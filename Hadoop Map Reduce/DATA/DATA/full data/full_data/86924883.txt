s a    preface   dave porter in the far north is a complete story in itself but forms the fourth volume in a line issued under the general title of dave porter series  in the first volume entitled dave porter at oak hall i introduced a typical american lad full of life and vigor and related the particulars of his doings at an american boarding school of todaya place which is a little world in itself at this school dave made both friends and enemies proved that he was a natural leader and was admired accordingly  the great cloud over daves life was the question of his parentage his enemies called him that poorhouse nobody which hurt him deeply he made a discovery and in the second volume of the series entitled dave porter in the south seas we followed him on a most unusual voyage at the end of which he found an uncle and learned something of his father and sister who were at that time traveling in europe  dave was anxious to meet his own family but could not find out just where they were while waiting for word from them he went back to oak hall and in the third volume of the series called dave porters return to school we learned how he became innocently involved in a mysterious series of robberies helped to win two great games of football and brought the bully of the academy to a realization of his better self  as time went by dave longed more than ever to meet his father and his sister and how he went in search of them i leave the pages which follow to relate as before dave is bright manly and honest to the core and in those qualities i trust my young readers will take him as their model throughout life  once more i thank the thousands who have taken an interest in what i have written for them may the present story help them to despise those things which are mean and hold fast to those things which are good                                                      edward stratemeyer  january 10 1908                            contents   chapter

for us answered dave porter he threw up the car window hastily hi there phil this way he called out lustily  a youth who stood on the railroad platform dresssuit case in hand turned hastily smiled broadly and then ran for the steps of the railroad car the two boys already on board arose in their seats to greet him  how are you dave how are you ben he exclaimed cordially and shook hands i see youve saved a seat for me thank you my but its a cold morning isnt it  i was afraid you wouldnt come on account of the weather answered dave porter how are you feeling  as fine as ever answered phil lawrence oh it will take more than one football game to kill me he went on with a light laugh  i trust you never get knocked out like that again phil said dave porter seriously  so do i added ben basswood the game isnt worth it  mother thought i ought to stay home until the weather moderated a bit but i told her you would all be on this train and i wanted to be with the crowd had a fine thanksgiving i suppose  i did returned ben basswood  yes we had a splendid time added dave porter only i should have been better satisfied if i had received some word from my father and sister  no word yet dave  not a line phil and dave porters usually bright face took on a serious look i dont know what to make of it and neither does my uncle dunston  it certainly is queer if they went to europe your letters and cablegrams ought to catch them somewhere i trust you get word soon  if i dont i know what i am going to do  what  go on a hunt just as i did when i found my uncle was dave porters reply  while the three boys were talking the train had rolled out of the station the car was but half filled so the lads had plenty of room in which to make themselves comfortable phil lawrence stowed away his suit case in a rack overhead and settled down facing the others he gave a yawn of satisfaction  i can tell you it will feel good to get back to oak hall again he observed you cant imagine how much ive missed the boys and the good times even if i was laid up in bed with a broken head  youll get a royal reception phil said dave dont forget that when you went down you won the football game for us  maybe i did dave but you had your hand in winning too and so did ben  well if the fellows say here comes nat poole dave lowered his voice i dont think hell want to see me  as dave spoke a tall fastidiously dressed youth came down the car aisle he was not badlooking but there was an air of dissipation about him that was not pleasant to contemplate he wore a furtrimmed overcoat and a cap to match and heavy furlined gloves  hello he exclaimed on catching sight of phil lawrence going back to the hall eh  i am and you are going back too nat i suppose  yes drawled nat poole he turned and caught sight of dave and ben humph he muttered and without saying more continued on his way down the aisle and through to the next car of the train  hes real sociable he is observed ben basswood with a grin  i knew he wouldnt want to see me said dave  whats upmore trouble dave questioned phil remember ive been away from oak hall so long ive rather lost track of things  this trouble didnt occur at the school answered dave his face grew a trifle red as he spoke  it happened back at crumville broke in ben and winked one eye you see nat wanted to come to a thanksgiving party the wadsworths gave but dave told jessie just what sort nat was and she left him out at the last moment it made nat furious and ive heard that he is going to do his best to square up with dave this winter  youre mistaken ben i didnt have to tell jessie anything corrected dave a fellow named bangs wanted nat invited but jessie didnt want him and neither did her folks bangs got mad over it and said he wouldnt come either and he and nat went to a show instead  well i heard that nat blamed it on you  he is apt to blame everything on meif he can said dave with a short hard laugh its his style i suppose hell even blame me for getting gus plum to reform  well you did get gus to do that declared ben heartily its the best thing i ever heard of too  if plum cuts poole whats the dude to do asked phil the two used to be great cronies  to these words dave did not reply he was wiping the steam from the car window now he peered out as the train came to a stop  hurrah here we are he cried and leaped from his seat  where are you going demanded ben  after roger i know hell be at the station for i sent him a special message and away went dave after roger morr one of his best and dearest schoolmates the two met on the car platform and as the train moved off again both came in to join ben and phil  to those who have read the former volumes in this dave porter series the boys already mentioned need no special introduction they were all pupils of oak hall a firstclass boarding school located in the heart of one of our new england states at the academy dave porter seemed to be a natural leader although that place had been at times disputed by nat poole gus plum and others it was wonderful what a hold dave had on his friends considering his natural modesty physically he was well built and his muscles were those of a youth used to hard work and a life in the open air yet though he loved to run row swim and play games dave did not neglect his studies and only a short time before this story opens had won the oak hall medal of honor of which he was justly proud  in times gone by daves enemies had called him a poorhouse nobodysomething which had caused him a great deal of pain when a child he had been picked up alongside of the railroad tracks by strangers and taken to the crumville poorhouse at this institution he remained until he was nine years old when a brokendown college professor named caspar potts who had turned farmer took him out and gave him a home at that time caspar potts was in the grasp of a hardhearted money lender aaron poole the father of nat poole already mentioned and the outlook soon became very dark for both man and boy  then came an unexpected turn of affairs and from that moment daves future seemed assured as related in my first volume dave porter at oak hall the boy called upon mr oliver wadsworth a rich manufacturer of that neighborhood the gentleman had a daughter jessie a brighteyed miss some years younger than dave she was waiting to take an automobile ride when the gasoline tank of the machine caught fire it was plucky dave who rushed in and at the peril of his own life saved the girl from being fatally burned  the wadsworths were more than grateful and when mr wadsworth discovered that caspar potts was one of his former college teachers he insisted that both the old man and dave come to live at his mansion he took a great interest in dave more especially as he had had a son about daves age who had died  the lad must go to some boarding school said oliver wadsworth and at his own expense he sent dave to oak hall with dave went ben basswood a friend of several years standing  dave made friends with great rapidity first came roger morr the son of a united states senator then phil lawrence whose father was a wealthy shipowner sam day who was usually called lazy because he was so big and fat buster beggs shadow hamilton and a number of others whom we shall meet as our story proceeds  for a while all went well with dave but then came trouble with nat poole who had come to the hall and with gus plum the school bully and chip macklin his toady the cry of poorhouse nobody was again raised and dave felt almost like leaving oak hall in disgust  i must find out who i really am he told himself and fortune presently favored him by a curious turn of circumstances he fell in with an old sailor named billy dill this tar declared he knew dave or somebody who looked exactly like him this unknown individual was on an island in the south seas  my fathers ships sail to the south seas phil lawrence told dave and the upshot of the matter was that dave took passage on one of the vessels in company with the shipowners son roger morr and billy dill  as already related in the second volume of this series dave porter in the south seas the voyage of the stormy petrel proved to be anything but an uneventful one fearful storms arose and dave and some others were cast away on an uninhabited island but in the end all went well and much to the lads joy he found an uncle named dunston porter  your father is my twin brother said dunston porter he is now traveling in europe and with him is your sister laura about one year younger than yourself we must return to the united states at once and let them know of this they mourn you as dead  there was a good deal of money in the porter family a fair share of which would come to dave when he became of age the whole party returned to california and then to the east and word was at once sent to europe to david breslow porter as daves father was named to the surprise of all no answer came back and then it was learned that mr porter and his daughter laura had started on some trip leaving no address behind them  this is too bad said dave i wanted so much to see them  well get word soon never fear replied his uncle and then advised dave to finish out his term at oak hall mr porter in the meantime remaining a guest of the wadsworth family  how dave went back to oak hall and what happened to him there has already been related in detail in dave porters return to school his enemies could no longer twit him with being a poorhouse nobody yet they did all they could to dim his popularity and get him into trouble  he shant cut a dash over me even if he has money said nat poole and to this gus plum the bully eagerly agreed there was likewise another pupil nick jasniff who also hated dave and one day this fellow who was exceedingly hottempered attempted to strike dave down with a heavy indian club it was a most foul attack and justly condemned by nearly all who saw it and thoroughly scared over what he had attempted to do nick jasniff ran away from school and could not be found  there had been a number of robberies around oakdale where the academy was located and one day when dave and his chums were out iceboating they had come on the track of two of the robbers then to his surprise dave learned that nick jasniff was also implicated in the thefts he knew that jasniff and gus plum were very intimate and wondered if the bully of the school could be one of the criminals also at length one snowy day he saw plum leave the hall and followed the fellow plum made for the railroad where there was a deep cut and into this cut he fell just as a train was approaching at the peril of his life dave scrambled to the bottom of the opening and drew the bully from the tracks just as the train rolled by  if ever a boy was conquered it was gus plum at that time at first he could not realize that dave had saved him to think you would do this for meyou he sobbed and i thought you hated me and then he broke down completely he confessed how he had tried to injure dave and his chums but said he had had nothing to do with the robberies nick jasniff had wanted him to go in with the robbers but he had declined  i am going to cut jasniff after this said gus plum and i am going to cut nat poole too i want to make a man of myselfif i can  but it was hard work a short time after the railroad incident the two robbers were caught and sent to prison to await trial and plum had to appear as a witness for the state and tell how he had been implicated in the meantime nick jasniff ran away to europe taking several hundred dollars of the stolen funds with him dave thought he had seen the last of the young rascal but in this he was mistaken as the events which followed proved     chapter ii  a row in a restaurant   the majority of the boys had been home only for the thanksgiving holidays the exception was poor phil lawrence who had been laid up for a number of weeks as the result of a blow on the head while playing a game of football phil said he felt as well as ever but he was somewhat pale and in no humor for anything in the way of roughness  as the train stopped at one station and another along the line it began to fill up with passengers including a goodly number of oak hall students at one place sam day and shadow hamilton came on board followed by half a dozen snowballs sent after them by boys who had come to see them off  hi stop that cried sam day as he tried to dodge and just then a snowball meant for his head took a somewhat stout man in the ear the man uttered a cry of surprise slipped on the platform of the car and fell flat crushing his valise under him at this a shout of laughter rang out from the depot platform and the lads standing there lost no time in disappearing  youyou villains roared the stout man when he could catch his breath illill have you locked up  it wasnt my fault answered sam day trying hard to suppress the grin on his face shall i help you up  no grunted the man and arose slowly do you know i have a dozen fresh eggs in that valise  sorry im sure  a dozen eggs cried shadow hamilton well i never say that puts me in mind of a story once a man bought some eggs that werent strictly fresh and  pah who wants to listen to your stories interrupted the stout man you had better pay for the eggs that are smashed and he entered the car in anything but a pleasant humor  dave had come to the car door to greet sam and shadow and conduct them to a seat near his own the stout man was so upset mentally that he bumped roughly into the youth  get out of my way will you grunted the irate passenger  excuse me i didnt know you owned the whole aisle said dave coldly he did not like the manner in which he had been addressed  see here are you another one of them goodfornothing schoolboys bellowed the stout individual if you are i want you to understand you cant run this trainnot as far as i am concerned anyhow  dave looked at the man for a moment in silence you are very polite i must say he observed i havent done anything to you have i  no but you young bloods are all in together i know you last spring i was on the train with a lot of college boys and they tried to run things to suit themselves but we fixed em we did and well fix you too if you try to run matters here and with a savage shake of his head the stout man passed down the aisle and dropped heavily into the first vacant seat he reached  isnt he a peach murmured sam day to dave meekest man i ever saw and ought to have a monument for politeness  i hope all his eggs are smashed said shadow hamilton he certainly deserves it  shouldnt wonder if they arehe came down hard enough answered dave  by good luck all the students had seats close to each other and as the train rolled along they told of their various holiday experiences and discussed school matters  just four weeks and then well close down for christmas said roger  we ought to have lots of fun said ben we can go skating and iceboating and we can build a fort  and snowball pop swingly and horsehair interrupted sam mentioning the janitor of oak hall and the driver for the institution dont forget them or theyll feel slighted  whats the matter with snowballing job haskers asked phil mentioning a teacher who was anything but popular with the students  oh well attend to him never fear answered roger morr  has anybody heard from plum questioned sam during a lull in the conversation  i got a letter from him answered dave seeing that nobody else replied he is afraid he is going to have a hard time of it to reform i hope you fellows will treat him as well as you can  i shall said the senators son and several nodded  i think i have always treated him better than he deserved said shadow hamilton he could not forget what serious trouble the former bully of oak hall had once caused him when doctor clays valuable collection of postage stamps had disappeared  it had been snowing slightly since morning and now the flakes began to come down thicker than ever as a consequence the engineer of the train could not see the signals ahead and had to run slowly so that when the junction was gained where the boys had to change for oakdale they were half an hour late  weve missed the connection and must remain here for just an hour and a quarter declared dave after questioning the station master we cant get to oak hall until after dark  i move we have something to eat said roger a sandwich a piece of mincepie and a cup of hot chocolate wouldnt go bad  second the commotion cried ben all in favor raise their left ear  which puts me in mind of a story said shadow two men went to a restaurant and ordered  fried snakes livers on mushrooms interrupted dave youve told that story before  no i didnt and it wasnt fried  i know what he means said phil it was robins wings salted in sauerkraut  it wasnt this was an order of  blue pumpkin rinds with mackerel sauce interrupted sam day very fine dish i ate it once when i was dining at the white house with the president  it wasnt pumpkin rinds or anything like it it was a plain order of  cherry roast with minced sunflowers suggested roger the girls at vassar dine on em regularly after playing football  this was a plain everyday order of pork and beans shouted shadow desperately and after the men got em what do you think they did oh this is a good one and shadows eyes began to sparkle  found fault i suppose because the beans werent from boston said dave  no  dont keep us waiting shadow tell the story to a finish said phil  well they got the pork and beans  yes  and they sat down facing each other  all rightfire away said sam as the storyteller paused  and they began to eat  glad to know they didnt begin to weep was rogers soft comment  and they ate the pork and beans all up continued shadow soberly and then he stopped short and looked around blankly  eh  well i never  is that all there is to the story demanded sam  certainly you didnt expect theyd buy the beans and throw them away did you asked shadow innocently  sold that time cried dave goodnaturedly never mind well let shadow pay for the lunch were going to have come on  not on your tintype murmured the storyteller not unless you pass around the hat and make me treasurer  they found a convenient restaurant and pushing together two of the tables sat down in a merry group the proprietor knew some of them and nodded pleasantly as he took their orders soon they were eating as only happy and healthy schoolboys can eat  my but this mincepie is good declared roger i could eat about a yard of it  a yard of pie is good said dave with a smile  talking about a yard of pie puts me in mind of a story came from shadow who was stowing away the last of a hot roastbeef sandwich  hold on weve had enough cried sam  if you pile on another like that last one well roll you out in the snow was phils comment  this is a real story really it is and its a good one too  vintage of 1864 or before columbus landed inquired ben  ive never told this before some yale students went into a butcher shop and one of em to be funny asked the butcher if hed sell him a yard of mutton certainly says the butcher fifty cents a yard all right says mr student ill take two yards a dollar please says the butcher here you are says the student and holds up the money then the butcher takes the bill puts it in his cash drawer and hands outsix sheep feet  very old and musty was daves comment washington told that to cæsar when the two were planning to throw socrates into niagara and then a laugh went up all around  the boys were just finishing their lunch when the door opened and a stout man walked in he was covered with snow and looked anything but happy  our friend of the smashed eggs whispered sam to dave wonder if he has cleaned out his valise yet  the man sat down at a side table and ordered several things then he happened to glance around noticed the students for the first time and scowled  humph what you fellows doing here he growled  havent we a right to come here demanded dave for the man was looking straight at him  shouldnt think the proprietor would want such gay larks as you here  i shouldnt think hed want such a grunt as you here retorted sam day  hi now dont you talk to me that way roared the stout man i want you to understand i am a gentleman i am  see here we cant have any quarreling in here said the restaurant proprietor coming forward  some of them fellows knocked me down on the train and smashed a valise full of eggs on me mr denman  we did nothing of the sort answered sam he fell on the icy platform of the car and right on top of his valise  and then he got up and bumped into me added dave he was very impolite to say the least  look here roared the stout man i want you to understand  wait a minute interrupted amos denman the restaurant keeper isnt your name isaac pludding  yes  then you are the man who caused the trouble at mr browns restaurant last week i know you some time ago you were in here and nothing suited you i dont want to serve you and you can go elsewhere for your meal  dont want to sell me anything snarled isaac pludding  not a mouthful and let me add i consider these young men gentlemen and i wont have them annoyed while they are in my place  oh all right have your own way snarled the stout man ill take my money elsewhere i will he glared at the students but ill get square some day for thisdont forget that and shaking his head very savagely he stormed out of the restaurant banging the door after him     chapter iii  off the track   well if he isnt the worst yet was the comment of the senators son  i hope he isnt waiting for that train said shadow i dont want to see any more of him  pooh whos afraid asked phil i guess we can make him keep his distance  i thought i knew him when he came in but i wasnt sure said the restaurant keeper the man who runs the hotel mr brown had a lot of trouble with him because he wouldnt pay his billsaid it was too high then he came here once and said the meat wasnt fresh and the bread was stale and sour i came close to pitching him out dont let him walk over youif he does take your train  no danger answered dave he had not yet forgotten the rude manner in which isaac pludding had shoved him  it was soon time for the oakdale train to arrive and the students walked back to the depot the snow was over a foot deep and still coming down steadily the depot was crowded with folks and among them they discovered isaac pludding with his valise and a big bundle done up in brown paper  he certainly must be waiting for the train said dave and he was right when the cars came to a stop the stout man was the first person aboard the students entered another car and secured seats in a bunch as before  by the way where is nat poole asked roger suddenly i didnt see him get off the other train  he got off and walked towards the hotel answered phil i suppose he feels rather lonesome  that cant be helped said sam he makes himself so disagreeable that nobody wants him around  just as the train was about to start a boy leaped on the platform of the car our friends occupied opened the door and came in it was nat poole and he was all out of breath he looked for a seat but could find none  they ought to run more cars on this train he muttered to roger its a beastly shame to make a fellow stand up  better write to the president of the railroad company about it nat answered the senators son dryly  maybe there is a seat in the next car suggested phil  nat poole shuffled off looking anything but pleased hardly had he gone when several came in from the car ahead also looking for seats among them was isaac pludding he had had a seat near a door but had given it up to look for something better and now he had nothing he glanced bitterly at the students as he passed then came back and leaned heavily against the seat dave and roger were occupying in doing this he almost knocked daves hat from his head  ill thank you to be a little more careful said dave as he put his hat into place he felt certain that isaac pludding had shoved against him on purpose  talking to me growled the stout man  i am i want you to stop shoving me  ive got to stand somewhere  well you quit shoving me or youll get the worst of it answered dave decidedly  at that moment the car lurched around a curve and isaac pludding bumped against dave harder than ever thoroughly angry the youth arose and faced the stout man  if you do that again ill have you put off the train he said  thats right dave dont let him walk over you added roger  if he doesnt know his place teach it to him was phils comment  have me put off the train cried isaac pludding id like to see you do it i want you to know i am a stockholder of this line  then its a shame you dont provide seats for all your passengers  thats true too remarked a gentleman who was standing close by  i dont believe he owns more than one share of stock observed sam and that he most likely inherited from his greatgranduncle  i own five shares howled isaac pludding and i want you to know  what he wanted the boys to know they never found out for at that moment the train gave another lurch it came so suddenly that the stout man was taken completely from his feet and sent sprawling in the aisle on his back a valise from a rack over a seat came tumbling down and not to get it on his head roger shoved it aside and it struck isaac pludding full on the stomach causing him to gasp  illustration roger shoved it aside and it struck isaac pludding full on the stomachpage 25  the boys uttered a shout of laughter and many other passengers joined in the floor of the car was wet from snow and when isaac pludding scrambled up he was covered with dirt dave caught up the valise and turned it over to sam to whom it belonged  who threw that valise on me demanded the stout man eyeing the boys in rage  to this there was no answer  i guess you threw it went on isaac pludding and caught dave by the arm  let go of me said dave eyeing the man steadily i did not throw it let go  isaac pludding wanted to argue the matter but there was something in daves manner that he did not like he dropped his hold and drew back a little  dont you dare to shove me againnot once continued the youth if you do youll regret it i have stood all from you that i am going to stand  oh youre no good muttered the stout man lamely and passed on to the end of the car  the train was coming to a halt at a place called raytown they were now but eight miles from oakdale and the students began to wonder if anybody would be at that station to meet them  if horsehair comes down with the carryall hell have all he can do to get through the snow said dave  perhaps hell come down with four horses suggested roger  one thing is certain doctor clay will see to it that we get to oak hall somehow said ben  what a rickety old railroad this side line is declared phil as the car gave several lurches its a wonder they dont fix the track  not enough traffic to make it pay i fancy answered dave they carry more milk and cattle than they do passengers  it was growing dark and still snowing briskly the car was cold and more than one passenger had to stamp his feet to keep them warm on they plunged through the snow until of a sudden there came a lurch and a jerk and then a series of bumps that caused everybody to jump up in alarm then the train came to a stop  whats the matter now  i think we must be off the track  its a wonder the train didnt go over  it couldnt go over for we are down in a cut  as one end of the car was up and the other down the boys knew something serious was the matter taking up their hand baggage they followed some of the passengers outside and jumped down in the snow  it did not take long to learn the truth of the situation a turnout on the track had become clogged with ice and the locomotive and two cars had jumped the track and bumped along the ties for a distance of two hundred feet nobody had been hurt and even the train was not seriously damaged although one pair of cartrucks would have to be repaired  i dont believe they can get the cars and the locomotive back on the track right away said dave theyll have to have the wrecking train and crew down here  when appealed to the conductor said he did not know how soon they would be able to move again probably not in three or four hours and maybe not until the next morning  ill have to walk back to raytown and telegraph to headquarters he explained  we are in a pickle and no mistake was rogers comment i must say i dont feel like staying on the train all nightits too cold and uncomfortable  in the group of passengers was isaac pludding storming angrily at everything and everybody  its an outrage he declared to a bystander i must get to oakdale by seven oclock ive got a business deal for some cattle i must close if i dont get there somebody else may buy the cattle  i hope he gets left said phil softly  so do i returned dave  if we could only hire a big sleigh and some horses we might drive to oakdale suggested ben  hurrah thats the talk cried dave there must be some farmhouse near here  say if you can get a sleigh ill pay my share if youll take me along put in nat poole eagerly he hated to think of being left behind  all right nat im willing said dave generously  weve got to find the sleigh first added the senators son  and see if we can get horses enough to pull it said ben some farmers wont let their horses out in such a storm as thisand you cant blame em much either  if we cant get a sleigh perhaps we can stay at some farmhouse all night suggested sam  all of the party climbed through the snow to the top of the railroad cut and then looked around for some buildings  i see a light cried phil and pointed it out between some bare trees  its a house come on replied dave and set off without delay the others following who knows but that somebody else may want to ride and if so we want to be first to get a sleigh  it was rather a toilsome journey to the farmhouse between them and the place were a barn and a cowshed and just as they passed the former there arose a fierce barking and three big black dogs came bounding toward the students  look out the dogs will chew us up yelled nat poole in terror and started to retreat  down called out dave who was still in advance down i say charge but instead of obeying the big dogs continued to approach until they were within a dozen feet of the students then they lined up growled fiercely and showed their teeth  let us get into the barn suggested roger and flung open a door that was handy into the building they went pellmell dave being the last to enter one dog made a dart at the youths leg but dave gave him a kick that sent him back then the door was slammed shut and latched and the students found themselves in utter darkness  wonder if they can get in any other way asked phil after a second of silence during which they heard the dogs barking outside  i doubt if any of the doors are open in this storm answered shadow  let us get up inin the loft suggested nat poole he was as white as the snow outside and his teeth were chattering from something else besides the cold  thats a good idea said dave but we must have a light to learn where the loft is anybody got a match  nobody had such an article and a groan went up nat poole was appealed to for the others knew he had been smoking on the train  my matchbox is empty said he i am going to hunt for the loft ladder in the dark  be careful or you may run into some troublesome horse cautioned dave  the boys moved slowly around in the dark they could hear the sounds of several horses feeding and the barking of the dogs then quite unexpectedly came the cracking of a board a yell of alarm from nat poole and a loud splash  help i am drowning save me     chapter iv  what happened at the barn   nat has fallen into the water  where is he i cant see a thing  he must have gone down in some cistern  these and other cries rang out and all of the boys of oak hall were filled with consternation dave had located the splash fairly well and as quickly as he could he felt his way in that direction  nat where are you he called out  here down in a cistern help me out or ill be frozen to death  dave now reached the edge of the cistern two of the boards which had covered it had broken letting nat down quite unexpectedly fortunately there was only three feet of water in the cistern so there was no fear of drowning but the water was icy and far from agreeable  as dave leaned down to give poole his hand the door of the barn was flung open and a farmer strode in a lantern in one hand and a stout stick in the other the man held the light over his head and looked around suspiciously  wot yeou fellers doin here he demanded  come here with the lightone of our party has fallen into the cistern cried dave  into the cistern eh mebbe it serves him right aint got no business in my barn answered the farmer as he came closer  we ran in because your dogs came after us explained roger  an where did yeou come from ye dont belong around here i know  we came from the trainits off the track said dave but help us get this boy out first and then well explain  train off the track well i snum cried the farmer then he set down the lantern and aided in bringing nat poole to the flooring of the barn putty cold ill bet a quart o shellbarks he added grinning at the lads wet and shivering figure  cant we get him into the house by the fire asked ben well pay you for your trouble  now if there was one thing shadrach mellick loved it was money and at the mention of pay he was all attention he asked a few questions and then led the way out of the barn and towards his house the dogs wanted to follow but he drove them back  their bark is worse nor their bite he explained they wouldnt hurt yeou very much then he asked about the train and the students gave him the particulars of the mishap in the meantime mrs mellick bustled around and got nat poole some dry clothing and allowed him to change his garments in a side room that chanced to be warm  the boys soon learned that shadrach mellick owned a sleigh large enough to accommodate the entire party and also four good strong horses for ten dollars he agreed to take them to oak hall stopping at oakdale on the way to see if the school sleigh was waiting for them  the sooner we start the better said dave and then he added in a whisper to roger and phil if we dont some other passengers from the train may come up here and offer him more money for his turnout  let us pay him part and bind the bargain suggested the senators son  ill do it answered dave and gave shadrach mellick two dollars  good enoughthet binds the bargain said the closefisted farmer  nat poole was a sight to behold in a wellworn suit several sizes too big for him and the boys could not help but laugh when he made his appearance  thats a real swagger suit nat cried sam day wont you give me the address of your tailor  nat cant do that added ben he wants the artist all to himself  which puts me in mind of a story broke in shadow hamilton a countryman went into a clothing store to buy a suit and  wow came from several of the students in a chorus  that story is a hundred and fifty years old  its full of mothholes shadow  it isntive only told it about  two hundred and eleven times finished dave shadow you really must get a new jokebook to read  never mind my clothing grumbled nat poole i couldnt help it that i fell in the cistern the farmer had no right to cover it with rotten boards  yeou had no right to be in the barn answered shadrach mellick with a grin howsomever well let it pass im satisfied ef yeou air  the sleigh was soon ready and the students bundled in making themselves as comfortable as possible nat pooles wet clothing was placed in a sack and tied on behind then the farmer mounted to the front seat  all ready he queried  all readylet her go sang out several of the lads  at that moment the dogs began to set up another bark and then came a call from the darkness  hi there wait a minute  who is that questioned dave hullo if it isnt the stout man  it was isaac pludding true enough he had been walking rapidly and was nearly out of wind  whewhere are you going he panted to the farmer  goin to take these chaps to oakdale  that is where i want to go isaac pludding glared at the students i dont like to ride with those boys but i suppose i can stand it got room for another passenger i suppose they told you how the train broke down  they did answered shadrach mellick reckon i can carry one more he added but yeoull have to pay me these boys are paying me ten dollars for the trip  how much do you want demanded isaac pludding  about a dollar i guess  its enough but ill go you answered the stout man and prepared to climb into the big sleigh  as soon as isaac pludding appeared dave held a whispered conversation with roger and some of the others now he turned to shadrach mellick  excuse me mr mellick but we dont propose to take another passenger he said decidedly at least not this man  no  no sir we hired this sleigh for ourselves alone  and paid part of the money to bind the bargain added phil  what do you mean to say i cant ride if i want to cried the stout man as unreasonable as he had been on the train  you cant ride with us said roger  what do you say asked isaac pludding of the farmer  shadrach mellick scratched his head  a bargain is a bargain mr mellick said dave hastily we hired this sleigh and that is all there is to it  that is true buter  wouldnt you rather earn ten dollars than one or two asked ben if that man is to ride we wont  so say we all of us came from a number of the others  then i cant take yeou said the farmer to isaac pludding these young fellers come fust  its an outrage cried the stout man illill have the law on you for it  guess yeou air a fool muttered shadrach mellick in disgust git alang there ye lazy critters and with a crack of his whip he sent the double team on their way leaving isaac pludding standing by the gateway shaking his fist at the vanishing students  he is mad now if he never was before observed phil  i wonder if well see any more of him said ben  i dont want to see him again answered dave  the wagonroad to oakdale did not run near the railroad so they saw nothing of the train passengers as they moved along luckily the snowstorm was letting up so the ride was not as disagreeable as they had anticipated in spite of the delay the boys were in excellent spirits the single exception being nat poole who sat huddled in a seat corner saying nothing the boys sang songs told funny stories and cut up generally and thus almost before they knew it they drew up alongside of the railroad station at oakdale  there was no turnout there to meet them and from the station master they learned that jackson lamond the hall driver had been down with the carryall but had gone back when he had learned that the train had broken down and would not arrive until morning  well it doesnt matter said dave weve hired our driver to take us to the hall anyway  all hands off for a hot soda cried phil as they rounded the drugstore corner and the sleigh was stopped and they rushed in to get the refreshment they treated shadrach mellick to two glasses which put the old farmer in fairly good humor  i dont blame ye for not wanting thet man said he after he had heard their story about isaac pludding guess hes about as mean as they make em  he said he had some cattle deal on in oakdale said dave perhaps you know something about that  oh mebbe i do theres a city consarn buying cattle up here nowstarted last fall theyre tryin to do old joe parker out o his busness mebbe this fat feller is the city companys agent if he is old joe parker wont want him up here  where does joe parker live asked dave with interest  well pass his house in a minit there it isover yonder by the willer trees  let me off a minute at that place went on dave  thats the talk cried roger catching daves idea well put a spoke in pluddings wheelif he is the rival cattle dealer  arriving at the parker cottage dave and roger leaped down in the snow and knocked on the door a heavyset and rather pleasantlooking man answered their summons  is this mr joseph parker asked dave  thats my handle lad what can i do for you will you come in  no mr parkeri havent time i wanted to ask you do you know a mr isaac pludding  at this question the brow of joe parker darkened  i certainly do  he is working for some opposition in the cattle line isnt he  yes and trying his best to do me out of my little income was the grumbledout answer  well i thought i might do you a favor went on dave and then told of his meeting with the cattle agent and of how pludding was trying to reach oakdale without delay  is that possible cried joseph parker if it is ill have to get a hustle on me im thinking i told farrington id let him know about those cattle today or tomorrow ill go right over and close the deal nowbefore pludding gets here its farringtons cattle he is after i am very much obliged to you  you are welcome said dave  i only hope you get the better of the fat man added the senators son and then he and dave went back to the sleigh and the journey to oak hall was resumed     chapter v  back to oak hall   as my old readers know oak hall was an uptodate structure built of brick and stone its shape was that of a broad cross with its front facing the south on that side and to the east and west were the classrooms while the dininghall and kitchen and laundry were on the north around the school was a broad campus running down to the leming river in the rear great clumps of oaks were scattered around giving to the institution its name  hurrah i see the school cried sam day who sat in front with the sleigh driver  so do i cried roger  boys lets give them a song when we drive up suggested dave it will prove that we are not quite frozen to death  right you are responded shadow hamilton now then all together and he started up the school song sung to the tune of auld lang syne      oak hall we never shall forget       no matter where we roam     it is the very best of schools       to us its just like home     then give three cheers and let them ring       throughout this world so wide     to let the people know that we       elect to here abide  this was sung with great gusto and immediately following came the wellknown hall rally              baseball             football             oak hall             has the call     biff boom bang whoop  thats the way to do it sang out dave and then as the sleigh drew up to the front door of the academy he started some doggerel also sung to the tune of auld lang syne and just then becoming popular      were here because were here because       were here because were here     were here because were here because       were here because were here     were here because were here because       were here because were here     were here because were here because       were nowhere else just now  the boys sang as loudly as they could and kept it up until the front door of the hall opened and job haskers appeared attired in a dressinggown and wearing slippers  here here stop that racket cried the teacher who could never see any fun in anything do you want to awaken the entire hall  oh no mr haskers we only thought wed let you know that we had arrived answered dave sweetly  well theres no need to act like a lot of hoodlums growled job haskers i thought you were all stormbound at raytown he went on lamond brought in word that the train had broken down  it did break down but we hired this sleigh to bring us over answered roger we said the man could put up here overnight and go back in the morning  ahem i dont know about that we are not in the habit began the teacher when somebody caught him by the arm and came to the front it was doctor clay also in a dressinggown and smiling broadly  how do you do boys he said cheerily glad to see you so you thought you couldnt stay away even if the train did break down i rather suspected some of you would try to get a sleigh over come right in you must be rather coldor did the singing keep you warm  how do you do doctor clay was the answering cry and all of the boys bounced out of the turnout ran up the steps and shook hands job haskers was left in the cold so to speak and stood in the background in disgust he thought it was bad discipline to treat the scholars too goodnaturedly hold them down with a rod of iron was his motto and the boys knew it only too well  matters were speedily explained to the master of the school and he directed job haskers to call lamond and have the horses and the sleigh taken care of and then told shadrach mellick to come in and he would be given a room for the night and his breakfast in the morning the farmer was paid off and was well pleased over the treatment received  you appear to be the only one who has suffered said doctor clay to nat poole but a good nights sleep will probably fix you up and the housekeeper can look after your clothing  i have plenty of other clothing in my trunk answered poole and then went off to the dormitory he occupied with gus plum and a number of others  dave and his chums occupied dormitories nos 11 and 12 and there they found several of the other students awaiting them including luke watson who was noted as a singer and banjoplayer bertram vane always called polly because his manner was so girlish and little chip macklin who had been the school sneak but who had now turned over a new leaf  it does my heart good to set eyes on you fellows again cried luke watson if it wasnt so late id get out my banjo and sing a song in your honor  yes and have old haskers up here giving us extra work for tomorrow answered ben no thank you luke not so early in the season please  delighted to see you all lisped polly vane i trust you all had a real nice time  i certainly did answered dave how about you polly did they invite you to any molassespulls or pink teas  oh i had a glorious time dave my two cousins visited ussplendid girlsand they had some other girls come in and we  all played blindmansbuff and hunttheslipper finished sam wasnt that too delicious for anything and he said this in such a feminine tone that everybody but polly laughed the girlish student looked a bit doubtful but was not offended  the cold ride had made the boys sleepy and all were glad to undress and go to bed dave was tired out having put in an extralong day and the moment his head touched the pillow he sailed off into the land of dreams and did not awaken until the morning bell was clanging in his ears  the storm had passed away and outside it was as clear as crystal the sun shone brightly and this helped to put all the boys in good humor for a gray day at oak hall was not to their liking all were soon dressed and dave roger and phil started to go below together  in the upper corridor they came face to face with gus plum the former bully plum looked rather pale and thin and his eyes were somewhat sunken that the exposure of his wrongdoings had caused him much worry there could be no doubt  how do you do gus said dave kindly and stepping closer he shook a hand that was almost as cold as ice phil and roger merely nodded  oh im pretty well answered gus plum how are you  firstratethat is i would be if i could only get some word from my father and sister  its too bad that you dont get some kind of message plum lowered his voice id like to see you alone this noon or tonight ierwant to talk something over with you he whispered  all right gusill try to see you this noon replied dave in a low tone and then all the students passed down to the dininghall  plum has certainly got something on his mind was rogers comment  well that exposure was a terrible thing for him returned phil of course what he did wasnt as bad as what was done by nick jasniff and those two robbers but it was bad enough id hate to have such a black mark against my name  the thanksgiving holidays had been rather short and those pupils who lived a long distance from oak hall had remained at that institution consequently the routine of studies was taken up that day without much trouble fortunately dave was now placed under andrew dale the first assistant a teacher loved by all the scholars  i know i shall learn faster than ever said dave to roger mr dale knows just how to bring out all there is in a fellow  i wish the doctor would get rid of old haskers returned the senators son i simply cant bear him  haskers is under contract so ive been told roger maybe hell be dropped when the contract runs out  just before the bell rang for the morning session shadrach mellick drove off in his big sleigh the schoolboys gave him a parting salute of snowballs which the farmer tried in vain to duck  hi yeou he roared want to knock the top of my head off stop it and then to escape his tormentors he whipped up his horses and dashed out of the hall grounds at top speed it was the last the boys saw of him for a long time  it was not until after the days sessions were over that dave got a chance to see gus plum alone the two met in the upper hallway and walked to the dormitory the former bully occupied and plum locked the door  sit down dave i want to talk to you said plum and motioned dave to the easiest chair the dormitory contained then he sank on the edge of a bed close by  all right gus fire away answered dave and he wondered what was coming next  ieri dont know how to say ithow to begin stammered the former bully and his face showed a trace of red in it but ive made up my mind to speak to you and ask your advice you saved me from a terrible disgrace dave and i know youll tell me the best thing to do  what about  wellabout everything first of all about staying here at first i thought i could do itthat i could face the crowd and live it down but nowthe way some of the boys treat meand look at meand the remarks made behind my back oh dave its terribleyou cant imagine how hard it is and there was a quiver in gus plums voice that meant a great deal  i am sorry to hear of this gus but you must live it down there is nothing else to do  i can go awaymy folks are ready to send me to another school  dont do itstay here and fight it out i know how you feeli felt that way when they called me a poorhouse nobody  oh dave i did that i am so sorry now  you are bound to win in the endif you do what is fair and honest so long as doctor clay is willing to keep you youd better stay by all means  yes yes i know butbutthere is something else plum dropped his hands in his face i dont know how i am going to tell you but i want to tell somebody its been on my mind ever since it happened and then to daves amazement gus plum threw himself across the bed and began to sob violently     chapter vi  gus plums confession   that the former bully of oak hall was thoroughly brokendown there could be no doubt and dave pitied him from the bottom of his heart he wondered what gus plum would have to say next and resolved to aid the lad as much as lay in his power  come gus you had better tell me your whole story he said kindly and sitting on the bed he took one of the lads hands in his own  well you know how i promised doctor clay id turn over a new leaf and all that began plum i havent done it  oh gus  i wanted tobut the force of circumstances and my own weakness wouldnt let me do you remember how i told you about my financial affairslosing money on that football game and all that well i learned that i was deeper in debt than i thought i was i paid what debts i could and then found out that i still owed two men in oakdale forty dollars i didnt dare to write home for money for after that exposure my father said he would only allow me five dollars a month spending money and not a cent more for the next year i met one of the men in oakdale the day before thanksgivingafter you were awayand heoh how can i tell ithe got me to go to that tavern with him and gamble again in the hope of winning the money i needed  and you gambled gus that was too bad  at first i played cards for small amounts but then the men treatedthey insisted upon my drinkingand then we made the stakes larger and when i came away instead of winning back the forty dollars i found myself owing them eightyfive dollars and now they say if i do not pay up at once theyll expose me to the doctor and my folks gus plum heaved a deep sigh oh i wish i was dead he sobbed  gus i thought you were going to give up gambling and drinking  i was but those men persuaded me before i was aware if i ever get out of this youll never catch me doing it againnever as long as i live  you say you owe them eightyfive dollars  yes  do you owe any more than that  they say i owe the tavern keeper two dollars but i dont think so i didnt order anything  have you any money at all  three dollars and a half  come to my room  what for  never mind come alongbefore any of the others come up  wondering what dave had in mind to do the former bully of oak hall followed dave to dormitory no 12 here dave went straight to his trunk brought out a long flat pocketbook and began to open it  why dave you dont mean to began gus plum his eyes opening widely  gus i am going to lend you the money but only under one condition said dave  do you mean to say you have that much on hand demanded plum  yes i have exactly a hundred dollars in this pocketbook it is a special sum that my uncle advised me to keep for emergencies he says he may go away some time and i may need money before he can send it to me it has nothing to do with my regular allowance i will loan you the eightyfive dollars on one conditionno on two conditions  what are they  the first is that you give me your word to cut out all drinking and all gambling from now on  ill do that readily dave  and the second is that you remain at oak hall and fight your way through in spite of what some of the fellows say show one and all that you want to make a man of yourself and sooner or later they will respect you  it will be a terribly hard thing to do  never mind gus i will help you all i can and i am sure some of the others will help you too  for a full minute gus plum was silent looking out of the long window at the gathering darkness of the short winter day then he turned again to dave  all right ill take you up and stay and ill do my level best to deserve your kindness dave he said in a husky voice  good now here is the money in fivedollar bills if you dont mind ill go along when you pay those fellows i want to see that you get a receipt in full from them as you say you owe them the money well let it go at that although its more than likely they cheated you  maybe they did but i cant prove it  with added thanks gus plum took the eightyfive dollars and placed it carefully away in an inner pocket  ill write the men a note to meet me saturday afternoon said he will that suit you  yes but dont meet them at the tavern the depot will be better  very well ill make it the depot answered the former bully he was very humble and once more dave had great hopes of his keeping his promises  some of the other students were now coming up and dave brought out some books he had brought along from home including a fine illustrated work on polar exploration which jessie wadsworth had presented to him she had written his name and her own on the flyleaf and of this inscription dave thought a great deal  ive read a part of it already he said to gus plum its very interesting some day ill let you read it if you wish  thanks perhaps i will dave said the former bully and then with a meaning look at dave he retired he knew dave had brought out the book merely in order that the other lads would not ask embarrassing questions  that is a great book said roger looking it over say it must be fine to travel in the land of perpetual snow  providing you can keep warm added phil  talking about keeping warm puts me in mind of a story began shadow hamilton now if youll listen ill tell it otherwise i wont  how much to listen asked luke watson meekly  nothingthis is free gratis for nothing  i mean what are you going to pay us for listening shadow  oh you go to jericho growled the storyteller of the school well this is about two men who hired a room in a hotel it was in the summertime and the room was very hot they opened the window on the court but it didnt let in enough air in the middle of the night one of the men got up in the dark what you doing asked the other man looking for another window to open says the man who was up pretty soon he touched a glass and found what he thought was a window opening sideways there thats fine he said its pretty breezyguess ill pull up the cover a little said the other man and then both slept well until morning when they got up they found that the one fellow had opened the door to an old bookcase in a corner  very breezy story was rogers comment  quite a refined air about it remarked ben  how did opening the bookcase make the room cooler demanded dave innocently  why it didnt the man thought  but you said he was cooler he even pulled up the cover on the bed  certainly he got the impression  who  the man he thought  how could he think if he was asleep shadow  i didnt say he thought in his sleep i said  well he went to bed anyhow didnt he  of course but when he opened the bookcase door  oh i see it was a refrigerator in disguise why didnt you tell us that beforehow the block of ice fell out on the mans left front toe and injured his spine so he couldnt sing any more finished dave and then a laugh arose in the midst of which shadow made a playful pass as if to box daves ear  the next time i have a good story like that to tell ill keep it to myself he grumbled  to change the subject some of the boys asked luke watson to give them a song luke was willing and getting out his banjo tuned up and soon started a ditty about a coon who lived in the moon or something of that sort then he began a breakdown and unable to resist sam day got up and began to dance a step he had learned from his fathers coachman at home  good for you sam cried dave thats fine  sam you ought to join the minstrels added roger and began to keep time with his hands patting juba as it is termed down south  not to be outdone by sam ben joined in the dance and several lads began to pat juba as loudly as possible growing very enthusiastic ben leaped over a bed and back then shadow hamilton caught up a chair and began to gallop around horseback fashion the chair caught in a stand and over it went carrying a lot of books and poor polly vane with it  gracious this wont do murmured dave as he set to work to pick up the books hi stop that racket shadow he called out do you want to get us all into trouble  cant stop im on the racetrack yelled shadow this is the last quarter bet i win and around the dormitory he spun again this time he knocked over little chip macklin sending him sprawling  say let up called out roger and catching up one of the books he took aim at shadow if you dont stop ill throw this at your head  cant stoplet her goif you dare called back shadow  hardly had he spoken when the senators son let the volume drive as he did so the dormitory door opened and job haskers appeared the book missed shadow who dodged and struck the door sending that barrier up against the teachers nose so sharply that job haskers uttered a shrill cry of mingled pain and alarm  illustration cant stop im on the racetrack yelled shadow page 58     chapter vii  how job haskers went sleighriding   on the instant the noise in dormitory no 12 came to an end shadow hamilton dropped the chair and sat upon it and luke watson swung his banjo out of sight under a bedspread dave remained on one knee picking up the books that had been scattered  youyou young rascals spluttered job haskers when he could speak how dare you throw books at me  he glared around at the students then strode into the dormitory and caught dave by the shoulder  i say how dare you throw books at me he went on  i havent thrown any books mr haskers answered dave calmly  what  i threw that book mr haskers said roger promptly but i didnt throw it at you  ahem so it was you master morr nice proceedings i must say instead of going to bed you all cut up like wild indians this must be stopped every student in this room will report to me tomorrow after school i will take down your names the teacher drew out a notebook and began to write rapidly who knocked over that stand  i did answered shadow it was aneran accident  who was making that awful noise dancing  i was dancing answered sam but i dont think i made much noise  it is outrageous this noise up here and it must be stopped once and for all now go to bed all of you and not another sound remember and with this warning job haskers withdrew from the room closing the door sharply after him  now we are in a mess muttered roger  isnt iterdreadful lisped polly vane who had taken no part in the proceedings but had been looking over daves book on polar explorations  hell give us extra lessons for this grumbled roger just wait and see  the next day the weather remained fine and a number of the students went out coasting on a hill running down to the river dave and his friends wished they could go along as both sam and ben had big bobs capable of carrying six boys each but after the school session they had to report to job haskers and he kept them in until suppertime doing examples in arithmetic  say dave we ought to square up for this said phil see what a lot of fun coasting weve missed  just what i say added the senators son we must get even with old haskers somehow  remember the time we put the ram in his room said sam with a grin  yes and the time we put the bats in added phil my but didnt that cause a racket  let us put something else in his room this time said ben  oh thats old answered dave we ought to hit on something new  if we could only play some joke on him outside of the academy said the senators son  he is going to oakdale tonight i heard him mention it to mr dale  did he say when he would be back  yesnot later than eleven oclock  maybe we can have some fun with him on his return said dave ill try to think up something  they watched and saw job haskers leave the hall dressed in his best he drove off in a cutter belonging to doctor clay but he had hardly reached the gateway of the grounds when he turned around and came back again  forgotten something i suppose said dave who had been watching  job haskers ran up the steps of the hall and disappeared  come roger quick cried dave well unhook the horse  the senators son understood and in a trice he followed dave outside it was rather dark so they were unobserved with great rapidity they unhooked the traces and unbuckled the straps around the shafts fortunately the horse did not move  wait well fix up the seat for him said dave and lifting the cushion he placed some snow and ice beneath that will make things warm for him  ill put a cake of ice in the bottom too for his feet said the senators son with a grin and did so covering it partly with the laprobe then the lads hurried into the school  soon job haskers came from the hall with a small packet in his hand the boys watched from some side windows and saw him leap into the cutter he took up the reins  get ap he chirped to the horse and gave a quick jerk on the lines  the steed did as bidden and began to move out of the shafts of the cutter at first job haskers could not believe the evidence of his eyesight  hi hold up he yelled what the mischief who did and then his remarks came to a sudden end he tried to hold the horse back but could not and in a twinkling he was dragged over the dashboard and landed head first in the snow of the road then the horse no doubt startled at the unusual proceedings started off on a trot dragging the teacher after him  whoa i say whoa there spluttered job haskers whoa and he tried to regain his feet only to plunge down once more this time on his face then he let go the reins and the horse trotted off coming to a halt near the campus gateway  if ever there was an angry man that individual was job haskers he had intended to make an evening call on some ladies and had spent considerable time over his toilet now his beautiful expanse of white shirt front was wet and mussed up and he had a goodly quantity of snow down his back  who did this who did this he cried dancing around in his rage oh if i only catch the boy who did this i will punish him well for it  he looked around sharply and at that moment a student chanced to come around the corner of the hall on the way to the gymnasium building job haskers leaped towards him and caught him roughly by the shoulder  ha i have you you young imp he cried how dare you do such a thing to me how dare you and he shook the boy as a dog shakes a rat  sttop spluttered the pupil in consternation and alarm stop i say ii oh mr haskers let up please dont shake me to pieces  well i never whispered dave to phil and roger  who is it  nat poole  oh my but hes catching it right enough chuckled the senators son  will unharness my horse went on job haskers will throw me on my head in the snow oh you imp and he continued to shake poor nat until the latters teeth rattled  ii wont stand this cried nat at last and struck out blindly landing a blow on the teachers ear  ha so you dare to strike me spluttered job haskers ii  let go i havent done anything roared nat let go or ill kick  now the assistant teacher did not fancy being kicked so he dropped his hold and nat poole speedily retreated to a safe distance  you unharnessed my horse began job haskers  i never touched your horsei dont know anything about your horse exploded nat  didnt i catch you  i just came from the library i left a pair of skates in the gym and i was going to get them ive been in the library for half an hour went on the dude of the school its an outrage the way youve treated me i am going to report it to doctor clay and he started for the front door of the school  wait stop called job haskers in sudden alarm do you mean to say you know absolutely nothing about this  no i dont  somebody came out here while i was in the hall and unharnessed the horse  well it wasnt me and you had no right to pounce on me as you did grumbled nat poole i am going to report it to doctor clay  stop ierif i made a mistake poole i am sorry for it said the teacher in a more subdued tone have you any idea who could have played this trick on me  no and i dont care snorted the dudish pupil i am going to report to the doctor and see if he will allow an innocent pupil to be handled like a tramp and off marched nat poole just as angry as job haskers  good for nat whispered phil i hope he does report old haskers  we must look out that we are not caught answered dave how funny it did look when haskers went over the dashboard and he laughed merrily  the boys took themselves to a safe place in the lower hallway they saw nat poole come in and march straight for doctor clays office the master of the hall was in and an animated discussion lasting several minutes took place then the doctor came out to interview job haskers who in the meantime had caught the horse and was hooking him up once more  mr haskers what does this mean asked the doctor in rather a cold tone master poole says you attacked him and shook him without provocation  somebody has been playing a trick on mei thought it was poole was the reply and the teacher told what had happened just look at that shirt and my back is full of snow  the doctor looked and was inclined to smile but he kept a straight face  certainly nobody had a right to play such a trick said he but you shouldnt punish poole for what he didnt do you are altogether too hasty at times mr haskers  am i well perhaps but some of the boys here need a club and need it badly too  i do not agree with you they like a little fun but that is only natural occasionally they go a little too far but i do not look to a clubbing as a remedy  i wish i could find out who played this trick on me  dont you think you owe poole an apology  an apology gasped job haskers such a thing had never occurred to him  yes you are certainly in the wrong  ill apologize to nobody snapped the teacher  well after this you be more careful as to how you attack my students said doctor clay severely otherwise i shall have to ask you to resign your position  some sharp words followed and in the end job haskers drove off feeling decidedly humble he could not afford to throw up his contract with the doctor and he was afraid that the latter might demand his resignation but he was very angry and the discovery of the ice and snow in the cutter later on did not tend to make his temper any sweeter  ill find out who did this he muttered to himself and when i do ill fix him as sure as my name is job haskers but he never did find out and there the incident came to an end the boys thought they had had fun enough for one night and so did not watch for the teachers return to oak hall     chapter viii  a mysterious letter   in the morning mail gus plum received a letter postmarked london which he read with much interest then he called on dave  ive just received a letter i want you to read he said it is from nick jasniff and he mentions you and he handed over the communication  it was a long rambling epistle upbraiding plum roundly for having gone back on him as jasniff put it the writer said he was now doing europe and having a good time generally one portion of the letter read as follows       the authorities neednt look for me for they will never find me      i struck a soft thing over here and am about seventy pounds to the      good tell dave porter i could tell him something he would like to      hearabout his folksbut i am not going to do it i dont think      hell meet that father of his just yet or that pretty sister of      his either shed be all right if she didnt have such a lunkhead      of a brother tell him that some day ill square up with him and      put him in a bigger hole than he got me into if it wasnt for him      i wouldnt have to stay away as im doingnot but what im having      a good timebetter than grinding away at oak hall  as may be imagined dave read this letter with even greater interest than had gus plum what was said about his father and sister mystified him  can it be possible that nick jasniff has met them he said  to me the letter reads that way dave answered plum he mentions your sister as being pretty and all right and how could he do that if he hadnt seen her yes i think they must have met  then perhaps my folks have been in london all this timeand i didnt know it gus id like to copy part of that letter and send it to my uncle  very welland i am going to show the letter to doctor clay answered the former bully of oak hall  dave copied that portion of the letter which interested him and forwarded it to dunston porter along with a communication in which he asked his uncle about taking a trip to london he said he was tired of waiting and would like to start on a hunt for his father and sister without further delay after sending the letter he talked the matter over with roger  you cant imagine how impatient i am to meet my father and sister he said why some days i get so i can hardly fasten my mind on my studies and i go in for fun just to help me forget what is on my mind  i can appreciate your feelings dave answered his chum kindly id feel the same way if my folks were missing if you go to london do you know id like firstrate to go with you  id like very much to have you roger but how could you get away  oh i think i could manage that my mother thinks i am pushing ahead almost too fast in my studiesthe doctor said i was growing too fast and studying too much at the same time i think shed be willing for me to take the tripand what she says father always agrees to  where are your folksin washington  yes they stay at a hotel there during the time congress is in session  well i will have to see what my uncle says before i make any move said dave and there the talk came to an end  gus plum had written to the men to whom he owed his gambling debt and they agreed to meet him at the oakdale depot on saturday afternoon at four oclock they wrote that if he did not pay up at that time in full they would expose him  i believe they are bluffing said dave after he heard of this they will not expose you so long as they think there is any chance of getting more money from you i wish you could prove that you had been swindledthen you wouldnt have to pay them a cent  well i cant prove thatalthough i think it answered the former bully with a long sigh  saturday noon it began to snow so that the majority of the students remained indoors or spent the time over at the gymnasium dave excused himself to his chums and met gus plum at a spot agreed upon and both set off for oakdale on foot  i suppose i might have asked the doctor for a cutter said plum but i was afraid he might ask embarrassing questions  we can walk it easily enough answered dave the road is wellbroken  dave you are putting yourself out a good deal for me answered plum gratefully somehow id hate to meet those men alone  they must be scamps or they wouldnt try to lead a student like you astray  on and on the two boys went past several places which were familiar to them the snow did not bother them much and before long they reached the outskirts of the village  there are the two men now cried gus plum and pointed across the way  they are not going to the depot answered dave they are turning down main street supposing we follow them gus  im willing but i dont see what good it will do  well it wont do any harm  the two men were burly individuals who had evidently seen better days each was shabbily dressed and each had a nose that was suspiciously red plum said that one was named blodgett and the other volney  i believe they came here from hartford the big youth added i wish i had their record from that city  the men turned into a resort that was half tavern and half restaurant at the doorway they met another burly fellow who had evidently been drinking pretty freely  hello blodgett cried this man glad to see you again hello volney  how are you crandall answered blodgett while volney nodded pleasantly what brought you to town  was looking for you two chaps  why questioned volney quickly  oh ive got news that will interest you  about sadler  yes  tell me about it demanded blodgett hoarsely what has he found out  a whole lot  does he suspect us  i dont know as to that he suspects somebody  you didnt tell him anything did you asked volney catching crandall by the arm  no but he is satisfied that he was swindled he was going to the hartford police about it  hang the luck muttered blodgett tell us the particulars  come inside and i willits too cold out here was the answer and then the three men entered the tavern  dave and gus plum had not heard all of the talk but they had heard enough and each looked at the other inquiringly  i believe they are thorough rascals said dave i wish we could hear the rest of what that crandall has to say  come with meive been in this building before answered the former bully of oak hall  he led the way to an alley halfway down the block this ran to the rear of the tavern where there was a door communicating with a hallway and a back stairs under the stairs was a closet filled with discarded cooking utensils the closet had two doors one opening into a drinkingroom behind the main barroom of the tavern  looking through a crack of the door they saw that the three men had seated themselves the proprietor of the resort spending his time with some men in front  now give us the straight of the story blodgett was saying  thereupon crandall launched into a tale that took him the best part of ten minutes to relate from his talk it was clear that a man named dodsworth sadler of hartford had met the three men at albany and gambled with them on three different occasions sadler had lost several hundred dollars one night and nearly a thousand the next and then blodgett and volney had come away now sadler had discovered that marked cards were in use at the place he had visited and he was satisfied that he had been swindled if not in all the games at least in some of them  well we did him up thats certain said blodgett with a coarse laugh but i dont want him to learn the truth if it can be helped  no we want to keep him in the darkhold him down like that boardingschool chap here chuckled volney  never mind about that said blodgett sharply  got somebody else on the string here eh observed crandall you always were the boys to keep things moving  oh this is only a small affairmere pocket money answered blodgett  at this point the conversation changed and it came out that crandall was out of money and wanted a loan of fifty dollars  we cant give it to you now said volney but wait till tonight and ill let you have ten dollars  and ill let you have the same said blodgett weve got to collect a trifle first  all right twenty is little enough but it will tide me over until i hit my streak again answered crandall and after a little more talk the men arose and prepared to separate  weve heard enough whispered dave to gus plum come on and he led the way out of the building and down the alley  what do you think demanded the former bully when they were on the street again  just as i suspected blodgett and volney are nothing but sharpers they undoubtedly swindled you i shouldnt pay them a cent  but they may expose me to the doctor dave  i dont think they willnot after you talk to them  i hardly know what to say  then suppose you let me do the talking gus  you  yes i fancy i know how to handle them answered dave confidently  well i dont want to get into any hole said the big boy doubtfully  you wont get into any hole when i get through with them im sure they will be only too glad to leave you alone  the two boys talked the matter over and at last gus plum agreed to let dave conduct the affair as he thought best then both walked to the oakdale depot there to await the arrival of the two swindlers     chapter ix  dave talks to the point   it was not long before blodgett and volney put in an appearance they had had several glasses of liquor at the tavern and walked along as if very well satisfied with themselves  so you are here said blodgett striding up to gus plum and holding out his hand shake my boy  i dont care to shake hands with you replied the former bully of oak hall  oh so thats your lay is it sneered the man very wellbut i thought you were a better loser  let us have this meeting over as soon as possible put in volney have you got the money  instead of replying plum looked at dave and then for the first time the two sharpers noticed that the lad they had come to meet was not alone  whos your friend thought youd come alone said blodgett somewhat roughly  i believe your name is blodgett remarked dave drawing himself up and looking as businesslike as possible  thats my name yes what of it  and your name i believe is volney went on dave turning to the second rascal  yes who are you  never mind that just now both of you come from hartford isnt that so  what if we do asked blodgett  some time ago you got this young man to gamble with you and he lost considerable money now you want him to pay up  hadnt he ought to pay up asked volney he was growing uneasy  he isnt going to pay you a cent  whats that came quickly from blodgett  i say he isnt going to pay you a cent mr blodgett is that plain enough for you to understand answered dave sharply  who are you id like to know to interfere with our dealings cried jack blodgett  perhaps ill tell you who i am later on i found out about this just in time it seems you came from hartford but you have been in albany lately while you were in albany you swindled a man named dodsworth sadler out of a large sum of moneyat least twelve or fifteen hundred dollars  say look here began blodgett and his tone became nervous  you used marked cards just as you did when you played with this young man i think when you find yourselves in the hands of the police hi stop dont be going in such a hurry  for turning swiftly blodgett had rushed from the depot volney followed him  they are running away cried gus plum he could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses  let us give them a good scare while we are at it answered dave and he ran outside and after the swindlers who cut across the tracks and made for the freighthouse here a freighttrain was just starting out and the men hopped aboard and were soon out of sight  there i guess you have seen the last of them gus said dave when he and the big youth had given up the chase  do you really think so  i feel sure of it  maybe they took you for some officer of the law  i dont know as to that but they were thoroughly scared i dont believe they will ever show their faces near oakdale again  but they may write to doctor clay  i shouldnt worry about that gus they will make themselves as scarce as possible for they will now know that dodsworth sadler is on the lookout for them  dont you think we ought to let dodsworth sadler know about this i might write him an anonymous letter  you wont have to gus ill write him a letter telling of what i heard that wont bring you into it at all and as i had nothing to do with blodgett and volney those fellows cant hurt me  oh dave what a head youve got for things cried the former bully admiringly i suppose youll say you simply overheard the talk while you were in oakdale  yes and ill add that when the swindlers found out i knew the truth they jumped on a freighttrain and ran away  when the two boys returned to oak hall gus plum felt in better spirits than he had for a long time he returned the money to dave and thanked him over and over for all he had done dave penned the letter to dodsworth sadler without delay and it was posted early monday morning  i hope i get a letter from my uncle today said dave to roger but no communication came for dunston porter had gone to boston on business and did not return to crumville for several days  the weather was now clear and bright and the wind had swept a good portion of the river clear of snow as a consequence many of the boys went out skating while a few brought out the iceboats they had constructed  among the latter affairs was the snowbird built by two students named messmer and henshaw it was not a handsome craft but it could make good speed and that was what the boys wanted  come on for a sail dave called henshaw after schoolhours on tuesday its just grand on the river  i was going skating with roger and phil was the reply otherwise id like to go firstrate  tell them to come too said messmer a lad who always liked to have company on his rides  the matter was quickly arranged and shadow hamilton was also included in the party the iceboat was rather crowded but that only added to the sport  hold tight everybody cried henshaw as he raised the sail there was a good stiff breeze and in a minute the snowbird was bowling along in grand style the students shrieking their delight as they passed their numerous friends on skates  come along and race cried roger to sam day  give me a tow and i will was the merry reply  be sure to return when you get back called out ben basswood and this remark caused a general laugh  do you remember the iceboat race we had with the rockville cadets said messmer  yes and the accident replied dave we dont want to run into anything again  i say fellows let us visit that cabin on the island cried roger maybe well find out something more about pud frodel and that other fellow  the senators son referred to a cabin located on a lonely island some distance from oak hall here it was that the lads had discovered the two robbers with whom nick jasniff had been associated and had given to the authorities the information which had led to the rascals capture  im willing to go said henshaw only we cant stay on the island too long for well have to get back before it gets too dark  as the iceboat swept along they passed quite a number of boys on skates presently they came to a crowd of six all attired in neat semimilitary uniforms  hello oak hall was the cry  hello rockville  where are you going with that tub  looking for another rockville boat to beat sang out henshaw how he had once won an iceboat race against the military academy lads is already known to my old readers  go along were going to build a boat that will leave you away behind retorted one of the rockville cadets  brag is a good hoss but getthere takes the oats cried dave and then the snowbird swept out of hearing of the military academy lads  they didnt like it at all that we beat them was rogers comment wonder if they will try to build a swifter boat  let them come on answered dave we can build another boat too if its necessary  say their blowing puts me in mind of a story came from shadow hamilton two little boys  oh shadow another groaned messmer reproachfully  let him tell it it will help to pass the time remarked henshaw i know its all about two poor lads who were caught in a snowstorm and had to shovel their way out with nothing but toothpicks  no its about two boys who sold suspension bridges for a living cried dave merrily they sold as high as eighteen a day and  say if you want to hear this story say so demanded shadow these little boys got to bragging what each could do says one i kin climb our apple tree clear to the top says the other huh i can climb to the roof of our house hum says the first boy i can climb to the roof of our house an its highern yours no taint it is soits got a cupola on top i dont care cried the other boy ours is higher its got a mortgage on iti heard dad say so and a smile went the rounds  not having any other name the boys had christened the place for which they were bound robber island it was a lonely spot rocky in some places and covered with woods and underbrush in others the shore was fringed with bushes through which the driven snow had sifted to a depth of two feet and more  here we are cried dave as they came in sight of one end of the island lower the sail or well be sliding into the trees and rocks  they made a safe landing and then prepared to walk to the cabin which was some distance away henshaw looked doubtfully at the iceboat  think shell be all right he asked of messmer  i think so  oh sure shell be all right with the sail down added roger  wonder if there are any wild animals on this island questioned shadow  might be an elephant or two answered dave or half a dozen royal bengal tigers  quit your fooling dave i reckon you wouldnt want to meet a bear or a wildcat any more than myself  no bears around here said the senators son might be a wildcat though or a fox im going to get a good stick  each student provided himself with a stout stick and then the whole crowd moved forward in the direction of the cabin in the center of the island never dreaming of the astonishing adventure in store for them     chapter x  an adventure on robber island   the way to the lonely cabin was not an easy one there was no path and they had to scramble over rough rocks and across fallen trees and through thick masses of brushwood they forgot about the gully and only remembered it when they found themselves floundering in snow up to their waists  for gracious sake cried the senators son as he crawled out the best way he could i fancied the bottom had dropped out of everything  i remember this hollow now answered dave we havent got much further to go  it was a clear december day and quite light under the leafless trees there were a few evergreens scattered about but not many and these hung low with their weight of snow all was intensely silent  this ought to be lonely enough to suit anybody observed henshaw he turned to roger how would you like to come out here some dark night all alone  none of that for me was the quick answer  might meet a ghost said dave with a smile  talking of ghosts puts me in mind of a story said shadow a boy once had to go through a dark woods all alone  shadow wants to get us scared interrupted dave oh shadow i didnt think it of you its bad enough as it is he went on in seeming reproach dont you know this island is haunted by the man who committed suicide here  a suicide dave cried the school storyteller forgetting all about the tale he had been on the point of relating  sure that man tried to kill his wife and seven children and then hung himself from a tree not far from here they say that twice a month his ghost appears  its about time for the ghost now added roger scenting fun listen didnt i hear a groan  must have been that went on dave there it is again  ii didnt hear anything faltered shadow he was not an excessively brave lad at the best  its getting pretty dark continued dave that is when the ghost shows itself so ive been informed if we look look he yelled pointing over shadows left shoulder  the storyteller gave a leap forward and glanced around hastily dave was pointing to a clump of bushes  whawhat did you see asked shadow in a shaking voice  i dont know it was tall and white  the ghost the ghost yelled roger its coming for us and he began to run back  shadow gave a scream of terror and started to run also as if by accident dave allowed his foot to trip the boy up and down went the storyteller of the hall on his face in the snow  hi hi dont leave me behind he bawled as the others all ran dont leave me and he scrambled up and tore along through the brushwood as if possessed the others speedily halted and set up a shout of laughter at which shadow looked very sheepish  ii only ran for the fun of the thing he explained lamely i knew all along there wasnt a ghost  shadow shall lead the way said dave go ahead old fellow  ieri dont know the path was the quick excuse you go on and shadow dropped behind once more and stuck there during the remainder of the trip  the cabin was built of rough logs it had been put up by some hunters years before but the sportsmen owing to the scarcity of game did not come to the place any more it was in a dilapidated condition and the snow had driven in through the brokenout window and open doorway  not a very cheerful place observed dave as he led the way inside let us light a torch so we can see things  they procured several pine sticks and soon had them lit and holding these aloft surveyed the scene all was very much as it had been during their former visit  nothing new so far as i can see was rogers comment  here are some footprints in the snow came from messmer we didnt make those  those are the footprints of some animal cried dave maybe theres a bear here after all he smiled as he made the remark  looks to me more like the tracks of a horse answered henshaw maybe somebody came over here from the shore on horseback  you want to be carefulit may be a wild beast after all observed shadow nervously  at that moment came a queer sound from outside of the cabin which caused all of the lads to start messmer who had the best of the torches dropped it leaving them almost in darkness  why i declare began dave when a form darkened the doorway and the next instant a big bony mule entered the old cabin and stood among them some of the boys were frightened and started to retreat  its only a mule cried dave i dont think hell hurt anybody but how in the world did he get here  his halter is broken declared roger he must have run away from somewhere  i know that mule declared shadow he belongs to mike marcy  the man he mentioned was a farmer living in the oakdale district marcy was a closefisted fellow who never wanted the schoolboys to have any of his fruit and dave through no fault of his own had once had considerable trouble with the fellow  i think shadow is right said dave i saw that mule around marcys place if he ran away we ought to take him back to where he belongs  perhaps youd have some fun trying to ride him suggested henshaw  oh pshaw anybody could ride that mule declared roger why riding a mule is as easy as riding a horse all mules dont love to kick  roger shall have the honor of riding him home said messmer think of what a reward mike marcy will give you he added with a grin  catch marcy giving a reward said dave laughing why he wouldnt fork over so much as a sour apple  hed want to charge roger for the ride  we can take the mule to the hall and let marcy come and get him suggested messmer  in a spirit of mischief shadow had taken his stick and rubbed it over the mules hind legs there was a sudden snort and up came the beasts feet bang crack bang they sounded on the wall of the dilapidated cabin and shadow leaped for his life  look out hes in action  clear the deck for his muleship  hell have the cabin down next called out dave take care  the mule continued to kick and standing at his head dave and roger tried in vain to quiet him then of a sudden came a crack of another kind and the wall of the rotted cabin fell outward and the roof began to sag  out of this all hands yelled dave and let go the mule roger did the same and both ran out through the open doorway shadow was already outside and messmer and henshaw started to follow then the mule turned knocking messmer down and made a dash for liberty  the cabin swayed and groaned and began to settle rapidly henshaw leaped out in the nick of time one heavy log scraping his shoulder messmer was half dazed by the sudden turn of affairs and before he could arise some of the roof beams began to settle across his back  help help he wailed the roof is coming down on me  his cry of assistance struck terror to the hearts of some of his friends and for the moment they did not know what to do dave was the only one of the party who remained cool and he rushed in and caught hold of one of the falling timbers  prop them up he called put your sticks under themanything if we dont messmer may be crushed to death  roger came forward first and the others quickly followed the mule being for the time forgotten they took their heavy sticks and set them up under the falling timbers and henshaw rolled in a stone that chanced to be handy these things kept the roof from coming down further but poor messmer was held as if in a vise and could not be extricated  weve got to pry the logs up a little said dave here is a log to work with and he pointed to one which had fallen out of the side wall  only one torch remained lighted and this had to be swung into a livelier blaze so that they could see then they had to start operations with care for fear they might do more harm than good  if ththe logs cocome down on me they will kikill me gasped the unfortunate lad under the ruins  well not let them come down answered dave keep perfectly still till i tell you to move  messmer did as directed and dave and the others inserted the loose log under one end of the ruins a flat stone was used for the fulcrum and they bore down slowly but steadily until the larger portion of the ruins was raised several inches  its coming cried dave dont go too fast can you loosen yourself now messmer  a little go a bit higher was the reply  they went up two inches more but now the log began to crack for the strain upon it was tremendous messmer heard the ominous sound and with a twist loosened himself and began to crawl forth dave caught him by the arms  out you come he said and gave a strong pull and out messmer did come and a moment later the lever snapped in two and the ruins settled back into their former position  ii think ive had a narrow escape faltered the lucky youth when he could speak much obliged to you dave for hauling me out  talk about a mule kicking declared henshaw he brought this cabin down quick enough  the old place was about ready to fall down answered the senators son i think i could have shoved it down myself had i tried but i wonder what made the mule start kicking so suddenly he acted as if a hornet had stung him  i guess i was to blame replied shadow sheepishly i rubbed him in the rear with my stick he didnt appreciate the handling  by the way where is his muleship cried dave looking around in the semidarkness  guess hes taken time by the forelock and run away answered the senators son  they looked around but could see nothing of the animal some marks were in the snow losing themselves on the rocks and that was all  its time to get back to the hall observed henshaw i am not going to lose time looking for a mule come on  we can send mike marcy word that his mule is on the island suggested dave that wouldnt be any more than fair if left here alone the animal may starve to death  mules dont starve so easily answered shadow i am not going to look for him any more he added  they were soon on their way back to the shore where they had left the snowbird the short winter day was drawing to a close and it was getting colder they walked briskly for they feared the wind would be against them on the return to oak hall and they did not wish to be late for supper for that at the very least would mean a lecture from job haskers  henshaw was in the lead and presently he came out on the shore looked around in dazed fashion and uttered a cry of dismay and not without good reason  the iceboat had disappeared     chapter xi  a hunt for an iceboat   its gone  where in the world could it have gone to  it was too far on the shore to be blown away  can anybody have stolen the craft  such were some of the words uttered as the students stood on the shore of the lonely island gazing first in one direction and then in another darkness had now settled down and they could see but little at a distance  i really believe somebody took the iceboat remarked dave as the sail was down i dont see how she could budge of herself  exactly my way of thinking answered roger and ive got an idea who took the craft too  those rockville cadets queried henshaw  yes  they wouldnt be above such a piece of mischief said messmer they feel mighty sore over the way we outsailed them that time we raced  theyll be likely to sail the boat to our dock and leave her there said shadow puts me in mind of a story i once heard about  i dont want to listen to any stories just now grumbled henshaw i want to find that iceboat if we cant find her well have to walk home  what a pity we didnt bring our skates cried dave the wind is very light and if we had them we might catch up with whoever took the craft i am by no means certain the rockville cadets are guilty when we met them they were going home and they didnt know we were coming here  nobody knew that said messmer  who was the last person we met on the river before landing questioned the senators son  all of the boys thought for a minute  i saw link merwell said shadow  yes and nat poole was with him answered henshaw merwell has become quite a crony of nat pooles since gus plum dropped out  link merwell was a new student who had come to oak hall from another boarding school some miles away he was a tall slim fellow with a tremendously good opinion of himself and showed a disposition to lord it over everybody as sam day had expressed it he was something of a dude and it was their mutual regard for dress that caused him and nat poole to become intimate  then i believe poole and merwell are the guilty parties declared dave they must have seen us land and poole i know is itching to pay us back for the way we have cut him  all of which doesnt bring back the iceboat observed messmer the question is what are we to do  hoof it back to oak hallthere is nothing else answered the senators son sadly  hardly had roger spoken when dave heard a peculiar sound on the rocks behind the crowd he looked back and saw mike marcys mule nibbling at some bushes  the muleim going to catch him he ejaculated and made a leap for the animal just as the mule turned he caught hold of the halter  whoa there whoa you rascal he cried and then watching his chance he flung himself across the mules back the animal pranced around in a lively fashion  look out dave hell throw you  hell kick you to death if he gets a chance  remember hes a vicious beast  the mule continued to dance about and kicked high in the air throwing dave well forward but the boy who had been brought up on a farm clung on grasping the mules ears to steady himself then of a sudden the mule turned and dashed away through the bushes  hes running away with dave  look out for the tree branches  dave paid no attention to the cries he had all he could do to keep from falling under the animal away went boy and mule over the rough rocks in a fashion which nearly jounced the breath from the riders body then just as they came close to some lowhanging trees where dave felt certain he would be hurt the mule turned again leaped for the shore and sped out on the ice of the river  so thats your game cried dave between his set teeth all right if you want to run you can carry me all the way to oak hall  away went the mule as if accustomed to run over the ice all his life he was a surefooted creature and took only one or two slides which amounted to nothing the boys on the shore saw dave and mule disappear in the darkness and set up a cry of wonder  hi come back here dave sang out roger  if you are going to ride to the hall take us with you yelled shadow  he wont stop till hes tired out said henshaw and goodness only knows where hell carry dave  trust dave to take care of himself answered the senators son i never saw him get into a hole but that he managed to get out again  i hope the mule doesnt land him in some crack in the ice said messmer  on and on through the gathering darkness sped the mule with dave clinging to his back with a deathlike grip the animal was young and full of go and seemed thoroughly to enjoy the run  talk about mules being slow panted the boy the chap who thinks that ought to be on this steed why hed win on a racetrack sure  a halfmile was quickly covered and then the mule neared the bank of the river where the latter made a long curve here there was a fairsized creek and up this the animal dashed in spite of daves efforts to stop him or get him to keep to the river proper  whoa you rascal sang out the youth for at least the fiftieth time and then he caught sight of a white sail just ahead of him the next moment the mule bumped into the edge of the sail shied to one side and sent dave sprawling on the ice then the animal steadied himself and made tracks for the road which led to mike marcys farm evidently he was tired of roaming around and of being ridden and was now going home  illustration the mule shied to one side and sent dave sprawling on the icepage 101  somewhat dazed dave picked himself up and gazed at the iceboat it was the snowbird and on it were nat poole and link merwell  hullo if it isnt dave porter muttered poole in amazement  where did he get that mule questioned merwell  im sure i dont know but this makes a mess of things i didnt want that crowd to know we had taken the iceboat went on the dudish youth  dave picked up the cap which had fallen on the ice and ran up to the iceboat those on board had run into the creek by mistake and were trying to turn the snowbird around  what are you doing with that craft asked dave  thats our business retorted nat poole  i think it is my business that boat belongs to messmer and henshaw  we found it and we are going to have a sail back to oak hall said link merwell  i dont think so answered dave decidedly  whats that cried merwell sharply he was a fellow used to having his own way  i want that boat i was with messmer and henshaw and we left the craft on the shore of an island its my opinion you two chaps ran off with her  see here do you take me for a thief cried link merwell and in his aggressive fashion he swaggered up to dave  not that merwell but i think you took the iceboat i am going to take her back so i can get our crowd aboard  and what do you expect me to do asked nat poole  you can skate back to the hall  i lost one of my skates  then let merwell tow you on one foot  oh you neednt boss us around porter growled link merwell im not used to it and i wont stand for it poole and i are going to the hall on the iceboat and that is all there is about it  he drew himself up to his full heighthe was four inches taller than daveand glared down defiantly this gave nat poole a little courage and he ranged beside merwell and both doubled up their fists  they fancied they could make dave back down but they were mistaken the lad who had been brought up on a farm faced them fearlessly  there is no use of fighting about it he said as calmly as he could you have no right to this iceboat and you know it if you dont give it up perhaps ill report you  oh youre a squealer are you sneered link merwell its about what i would expect from a boy brought up in a poorhouse  at this uncalledfor and cutting remark daves face flamed he took one step forward and caught the tall youth by the arm in a grip that seemed to be of steel and made merwell wince  are you going to bring that up he asked in a low voice i should have thought your friend poole would have cautioned you that it wasnt healthy to do so  let go of my arm porter and merwell tried to pull himself free but in vain daves eyes were blazing like two stars and seemed to look the tall youth through and through  i am not letting go just yet merwell i want you to answer my question  if you dont let go ill knock you down cried link merwell in a rage  if you do youll get well punished for it i allow nobody to talk to me as you have done  want to fight  no but i can defend myselfi guess nat poole knows that  dont soil your hands on him link said poole even though they were two to one he knew daves power and was afraid of him  he cant come it over me answered merwell let go and then he hauled off and tried to hit dave in the face  the boy from the country was on guard and ducked with a quickness that surprised his antagonist then he gave merwells arm a twist that sent the tall youth sprawling on the ice  the new pupil was amazed and it took him several seconds to recover himself he had not dreamed that dave was so powerful yet he threw prudence to the winds and rushed in trying again to reach daves face with his fist but dave skipped to one side put out his foot and again merwell went down on his hands and knees  ill fix you he roared scrambling up his face red with rage ill show you what i can do how do you like that you poorhouse rat  this time he hit dave in the breast the blow was a heavy one but it did not hurt nearly as much as did the words which accompanied it they made dave shiver as if with ague and all in a blaze he could not curb he sprang towards link merwell out shot first one fist and then the other the blows landing on the eye and chin of the tall youth they made him stagger back against the iceboat then came a third blow and merwell gave a gasp swayed from side to side and would have fallen had not nat poole caught him as he was going down  stop porter dont hit him again  merwell do you take back what you just said demanded dave paying no attention to nat pooles remark  there was an instant of silence link merwell wanted to answer but was too dazed to do so slowly and painfully he stood erect his head was in a whirl and one eye was rather rapidly closing  merwell are you going to take back what you said demanded dave again and he held his fist ready to strike another blow  yeyes stuttered link merwell dodont hit me again and then he collapsed in a heap at daves feet     chapter xii  the meeting of the gee eyes   when link merwell went down again dave looked at nat poole thinking that lad might possibly attack him but the dudish fellow was too scared to do anything but back away to a safe distance  dondont you dare to hit me porter he cried in a trembling voice dont you dare if you do ill tell doctor clay  if you behave yourself ill not lay my fingers on you nat poole was the reply merwell brought this on himselfyou know that as well as i do  hes pretty badly hurt i fear  oh hell come around all right answered dave you had better see to it that he gets to the hall safely  are you going to leave me  yes i want to find henshaw and the others  nat poole wanted to argue but he did not dare dave waited until link merwell sat up and opened his eyes then he leaped on the iceboat and flung off the three skates he found there  going away mumbled merwell when he could speak  yes and after this link merwell see that you keep a civil tongue in your head answered dave and then he trimmed the sail of the iceboat shoved the craft around and started for the river  dave was a good deal worked up but he had not deemed it wise to let his enemies see it to be called a poorhouse rat had stung him to the quick and once again when touched on that subject he had found his temper as ungovernable as ever  its no use i cant stand it he told himself if they want me to let them alone they have got to cut that out  it was now so dark that but little could be seen on the broad river dave turned the craft towards robber island and made a long tack he was just coming around on the other tack when there came a shout out of the darkness  dont run us down why its dave  right you are was the reply then he saw roger and the others who had started to walk to oak hall they were soon beside the snowbird and the craft was headed for the school  so poole and merwell had her observed messmer on the way did you have any trouble making them give her up  just a little answered dave modestly  tell us about it dave cried the senators son somebody told me merwell was of the scrappy kind  i really dont like to talk about it said dave his face clouding i had some words with merwell and i knocked him down then he and poole were willing enough to let me take the iceboat  you knocked merwell down exclaimed henshaw hes a big fellow  dave isnt afraid of anybody said roger in a tone of pride  in the end dave was compelled to tell his story to which the others listened with deep interest they understood the boy from the country perfectly and said the treatment received had served link merwell right  when they reached oak hall they were nearly an hour late they expected job haskers would lecture them and give them extra lessons to do but fortunately they found andrew dale the head teacher in charge he listened to their explanations with a smile  after this you mustnt go so far or else start earlier said the instructor and let them go in to supper  gracious what a difference between mr dale and old haskers was daves comment  i wish all the teachers were like mr daleand doctor clay returned roger  the party were just finishing their evening meal when nat poole and link merwell slunk in the tall youth had one eye nearly closed by the blow dave had delivered he glared savagely at dave but said nothing  hell chew you upif he gets the chance whispered roger to dave  then i wont give him the chance answered the other with a quiet smile  the story soon circulated among the students that merwell and dave had had a fight and the tall boy had gotten the worse of it to this dave said nothing but merwell explained to his friends that porter had hit him foul taking him completely off his guard  the next time we meet youll see him go down and out added the tall boy he wont be in it a minute after i once get at him  word was sent to mike marcy about his mule and the farmer sent an answer back that the mule was now at home again safe and sound the mean fellow did not add one word of thanks for the information given to him  thats like marcy said dave if he thanked me for anything i think id drop dead  some men hardly know how to be civil answered phil  during the next few days word also came from dodsworth sadler that he was on the trail of blodgett and volney and hoped to catch them before many days he added that he had evidence to convict the swindlers if he could only lay his hands on them  that lets you and me out said dave to gus plum i dont think youll ever hear another word from the two rascals  if it hadnt been for you i should have paid them that money said the former bully gratefully and they would have kept me in their power if they could  dave was anxiously awaiting a letter from his uncle and when it came he could scarcely take time to tear open the communication so eager was he to know its contents the letter was very brief and simply asked the boy to come home on the following saturday and added that if he really wanted to go to london he could do so dave was to show the letter to doctor clay in order to get the necessary permission to leave the hall  i shall be sorry to have you go master porter said the principal of the academy but i can understand how you feel about your father and sister and it will perhaps be better for you to go in search of them than to sit down here and be on pins and needles over it and doctor clay smiled kindly  then you are really going to london cried phil when he heard the news wish i was going too  so do i phil answered dave wed have as good a time as we did on your fathers ship in the south seas  i am going to write to my folks about this at once said roger his heart was set on going to england with his chum  as soon as daves friends heard that he was going away once more several began to plan a celebration for him  let us hold a special meeting of the gee eyes for daves benefit said sam day and so it was voted  the gee eyes as my old readers know was a secret organization that had existed at oak hall for a long time the words stood for the two letters g and i which in turn stood for the name of the club guess it the club was organized largely for fun and this fun consisted mainly in the initiation of new members  at one time gus plum had been at the head of a rival organization called the dare do anything club but this had been broken up by doctor clay because of the unduly severe initiation of a small boy named frank bond who had almost lost his reason thereby now gus had applied for membership in the gee eyes and had said that he would stand for any initiation they offered  i have half a mind to take plum up said phil lawrence who was the honorable muckamuck otherwise president of the club he deserves to be put through a strong course of sprouts for what he did to frank bond  all right i am willing for one said buster beggs who was the secretary under the highsounding title of lord of the penwiper but we will have to ask the others first  a canvass was made and it was decided to initiate gus plum on friday night after which the club was to celebrate the departure of dave in as fitting a style as the exchequer of the organization permitted plum was duly notified and said he would be on hand as required and you can do anything short of killing me he added with a grin  it will make plum feel better if he suffers said dave he hasnt got frank bond off his mind yet which statement was true plum and bond had made up and the former bully now did all in his power to aid the small timid fellow in his studies and otherwise  the club met in an old boathouse down the river it was a bright moonlight night and about twenty members were present all attired in their red robes and black hoods with yellow tassels as before some of the members had wooden swords and others stuffed clubs around the boathouse were hung a number of pumpkin lanterns cut out in imitation of skulls  for the initiation of gus plum one of the club members had composed a new chant which was sung slowly and impressively as the former bully of oak hall was led in by buster beggs and sam day      hoopra hoopra dilly dall       heres the victim see him fall     hoopra hoopra dilly dees       down upon his bended knees     hoopra hoopra dilly deet       bind his hands and bind his feet     hoopra hoopra dilly dive       let us cut him up alive      punch him crunch him smash him up     let him drink the poison cup     let him groan and let him rave     as we put him in his grave  as this strange doggerel was sung the masked students danced fantastically around gus plum slapping him with their swords and clubs then of a sudden he was tripped up bound hands and feet and marched out of the boathouse here a bag was tied over his head so that he could not see a thing although the bag had holes in the rear so that he would not be suffocated  to the river with him came the loud command an icy bath will do him a world of good  now if there was one thing gus plum hated it was icecold water for bathing purposes and the suggestion of such a bath in the open air with the thermometer below the freezing point caused him to shiver  now see here he began and then shut his lips tightly come what might he resolved to utter no complaint  what sayest thou demanded a voice by his side  wouldst thou beg off demanded another  no ill take my medicine no matter what it is answered the former bully doggedly     chapter xiii  an interrupted initiation   hes full of grit this time whispered phil to dave  oh plum isnt the boy he used to be i am certain of that was the low answer  before long the students reached a point on the river front where there was a heavy clump of bushes in a hollow between the bushes a fire had been built and on the bushes had been hung some horse blankets to keep off the wind  as the members of the gee eyes reached the hollow they saw two boys wrapped up in overcoats stealing away into the woods close by  hello who are those chaps cried roger  one of them looked like nat poole to me answered dave  wonder what they are doing here  came to see what was going on i suppose  i dont like fellows like nat poole to be hanging around remarked buster beggs  the fire had been burning low but now it was stirred up and more dry branches were piled on top creating a roaring blaze by the flickering glare the masked figures looked decidedly fantastic  up to that moment the club members had been undecided what to do with gus plum some were in favor of taking off his shoes and socks and letting him down into the river through a hole in the ice wetting him up to his knees others wanted him to crawl on his hands and knees to another spot on the river quarter of a mile away still others wanted to make a snow house and shut him inside for awhile letting him breathe through a piece of gaspipe which had been brought along others wanted him to make a ten minutes speech on what mackerels have done for astronomy or some subject equally deep  let us have the speech at least first suggested dave  all right give us the subject answered phil after a consultation with the other officers  all right i will answered dave after a moments thought better take the bag off his head first  this was quickly removed and gus plum was made to stand up on a rock close to the fire  wretch listen came from one of the masked figures it is decreed that thou must speak for ten minutes by the secondsplitting watch on a subject that shall be given to thee shouldst thou fail it will be a whacking with staves for thine dost thou agree  speak on what  here is the subject said dave in a disguised voice that was thin and piping if a pail lets out water when it leaks why doesnt a boat do the same thing and a snicker went round at this question  thou hast heard the subject art prepared to discourse asked one of the gee eyes  sure thing answered gus plum after a moment of thought he struck an attitude my subject is a most profound one first broached by cicero to henry clay during the first trip of the beloved pair to coney island  hurrah hooroo came from one of the club members  cicero had been speaking to just such a crowd of convicts as i am now addressingthieves murderers and those who had failed to shovel the snow from their sidewalks during the months of july and august continued gus plum  convicts is good murmured roger  the boat running to coney island had slowed up to a walk which caused cicero to grow impatient as he wanted a ride on the shootthechutes henry clay along with napoleon and a roman sausagemaker named hannibal were in the bow of the craft trying to solve the fifteen puzzle by the aid of a compass and a book on etiquette suddenly a great commotion arose to a height of a mile or more the boat sank to the bottom of the sea turned over three times and came to the surface again a shriek arose from one of the ladies cleopatras waitingmaid i have lost my knitting overboard man the pumps cried cicero and then tied his sandals around his neck for a lifepreserver henry clay drew a henry clay from his pocket and began to smoke vigorously hannibal said he would turn cannibal if the boat went down again cleopatra said she would die happy if only they would start up the phonograph and homer did so with that beautiful ode entitled why eat turkey when corned beef is so cheap  wheres the pail that leaked came from the crowd  stick to the subject  is the boat leaking yet  be not afraid answered gus plum solemnly by the chronometer i have still seven minutes before the boat and pail sink out of sight forever however the pail was there sitting like a hen on the larboard mast filled with gooseberries which pocahontas had picked at dawn in company with general grant and king henry the sixtysecond looking at this pail john paul jones slapped his sailor thigh and asked why is a gooseberry a question which has come resounding down the ages oh thunder do you want to blow me to pieces  crack bang crack boom came four loud reports and the fire was scattered in all directions bang came another report and dave received some burning fagots in the face gus plum was hurled from the rock upon which he had been standing boom came a report louder than any of the rest and what was left of the campfire flew up in the air as if a volcano were under it  illustration what was left of the campfire flew up in the air page 120  all of the club members were dumbfounded for nobody had expected anything of this sort half a dozen of the boys had gone down and in a twinkling the robes roger and ben wore were in flames the fire lay in all directions and now came two smaller reports and dave saw a fairsized firecracker fly apart  somebody put firecrackers under the fire he cried big ones and little ones and then seeing ben in flames he rushed to the assistance of his chum  it was no easy matter to put out the fire and before ben was out of danger dave got a blister on one hand in the meantime gus plum had leaped towards roger  roll over he cried and tripped the senators son up then he began to beat the flames out with his hands and with the bag that had been over his head roger had gotten some hot ashes in his face and he was confused and half blinded thereby  the excitement lasted nearly five minutes and when it was over the boys stood there with their hoods and robes off gazing at each other nervously  who did this demanded phil  that was too much of a good thing said shadow why some of us might have been burned to death  kind of rough initiation remarked gus plum dryly but i didnt catch it as much as roger and ben  that wasnt down on the programme returned dave at least it wasnt so far as i am concerned  i didnt know of it cried buster beggs  nor i nor i came from one after another of the other members of the gee eyes  who started the fire asked phil  i did answered sam day i just got some wood together and lit it thats all  was there anything on the ground  not a thing so far as i noticed  here is part of a big cannon cracker said dave holding up the still burning paper that was big enough to blow off a fellows hand or foot  say dont you remember those fellows we saw running away exclaimed roger  to be sure was the quick answer nat poole was one  who was the other  he looked like link merwell to me said buster beggs  then weve got an account to settle with poole and merwell said roger just look at how my hands and my neck are blistered  and my hand said ben oh how it smarts ill have to put some oil and flour on it  let us declare plums initiation finished said phil then we can hunt up those fellows who played this dirty trick on us  phils suggestion was at once adopted and the club members scattered through the woods to look for those who had hidden themselves in a very few minutes sam day set up a shout  here is one of them  and here is the other called out gus plum and ben simultaneously  you let go of me sam day came in the voice of nat poole i didnt do anything let me go  you come along with me nat poole answered sam sternly just look how that hand is burnt and in his anger sam gave the other boy a smart box on the ear  oh dont please dont  youll yell worse than that when we are through with you answered sam  you bet he will said buster beggs i got a hot cinder in my right eye  dont please dont shrieked nat poole he was a coward at heart and the attitude of those around filled him with sudden terror i didnt do it i tell you  then who did demanded dave  oh ii cant tell you ii  yes you can tell said shadow and gave pooles ear a twist the storyteller of the school had gotten some hot ashes in his mouth which had put him in anything but a gentle humor  it was link merwell he put the crackers under the fire and let the fuses stick up said poole  youre a fine sort to blab sneered merwell since youre willing to tell so much ill tell something too he bought the firecrackers  is that true poole questioned roger  yeyes but ii didnt know  he knew what i was going to do with them broke in link merwell it was only a joke  so is that a joke merwell answered roger and hauling off he boxed the tall youths right ear if you want to make anything out of it do so look at my hands and neck you went too far  merwells face blazed and he looked as if he wished to annihilate the senators son  humph i suppose you think you can do as you please with your own crowd around you he muttered you dont know how to take a joke  i can take a joke as well as anybody but not such a perilous trick as that  its on a par with the joke of the fellow who put gunpowder in a poor irishmans pipe broke in shadow it put the irishmans eyes out i dont see any fun in that  i think we ought to give them both a good licking cried a boy named jason and without more ado he took his wooden sword and gave poole a whack across the back then he turned and whacked merwell  it was a signal for a general use of the wooden swords and stuffed clubs and in a moment the two unlucky students were surrounded and blows fell thick and fast poole yelled like a wild indian but merwell set his teeth and said nothing only striking back with his fists when he got the chance dave took no part in the onslaught nor did ben and phil as soon as he saw a chance nat poole ran for his life link merwell stood his ground a little longer then he too retreated shaking his fist at the members of the gee eyes  just wait he fairly hissed ill get square for this if it takes me a lifetime     chapter xiv  goodbye to oak hall   ill wager merwell is the maddest boy oak hall ever saw said shadow when the excitement had subsided  poole is a sneak and no mistake said sam i wonder if hell go and tell old haskers or doctor clay  he wont darefor he is afraid we will tell about the firecrackers answered dave yes he is a sneak  i dont see now how i could ever make a friend of him declared gus plum now in one way i like merwellhes a fighter and he doesnt care who knows it  yes but hes got a wicked temper observed roger he reminds me of nick jasniff they would make a team  where did he come from anyway questioned messmer  from some ranch out west his father is a big cattleowner he is used to life in the open air and one of the fellows says he can ride like the wind  we must watch him declared phil  i cant do thatsince i am going away answered dave ill have to leave you chaps to fight it out  do you think theyll come back or send haskers asked buster beggs  it might be wise to leave this spot answered phil there are plenty of places we can go to  it was decided to move and several baskets which had been stored away in the bushes were brought forth  ive got an idea cried henshaw let us go to that old barn on the baggot place nobody will disturb us there  i want to fix up my burns first said roger  so do i said ben come on to the hallwe can join the crowd later  so it was arranged and while the senators son and ben went off in one direction the remaining members of the gee eyes took another which led them over a small hill and through an old apple orchard  the baggot place had not been used for several years the house was nailed up but the big barn stood wide open and had often been the resort of tramps but during the hunt for the robber pud frodel and his tool all the tramps had been rounded up and driven away  several of the students had brought their pumpkin lanterns with them and these were hung up on convenient nails  say a small stove wouldnt go bad suggested messmer its mighty cold in here  let us settle down in some hay suggested phil that will keep us warm especially if we shut the doors and windows tight  the baskets which had been brought along were filled with good things and these were speedily passed around the boys fell to eating with avidity for the adventures of the evening had made them hungry then dave was called upon for a speech  i hardly know what to say fellowstudents he began after a cheering and handclapping you have treated me royally tonight and i do not intend to forget your kindness i am sorry that i am going to leave you but you all know what is taking me away  we do and we hope youll find your folks put in phil  so say we all of us sang out henshaw  if i am successful in my search perhaps ill return to oak hall before a great while continued dave in the meantime i trust you all have good times and that you may have no more trouble with our enemies more than this as i expect to be away during the holidays i wish each one a merry christmas and a happy new year  as dave concluded there was a round of applause and the club members drank his health in lemon soda and sarsaparilla then some nuts and raisins were passed around and all prepared to return to oak hall  weve got to go in quietly or else there may be trouble said phil remember we dont know what merwell and poole will do  there was no trouble however for which dave was thankful since he wished to leave the hall with a clean record as soon as he reached his dormitory he went to bed and so did the other occupants of the apartment and thus his schooldays for the time being came to an end  he was up bright and early and by nine oclock was ready to enter the sleigh that was to take him to oakdale station the boys gathered around to see him off  i wish i was going with you said phil you must write me regularly  ill do that phil and you must tell me all about what happens here  remember dave ill join you if i possibly can said roger let me know where i can telegraph or telephone you  sure roger and if you can join me ill like it firstrate  an hour later dave was on the train and speeding towards crumville he had sent word ahead when he would arrive and at the station he found the wadsworth sleigh with caspar potts and jessie wadsworth awaiting him the old professor looked hale and hearty although his form was slightly bent and his hair was gray and white jessie roundcheeked and rosy was the picture of health and beauty  there he is theres dave cried the miss and leaped to the sidewalk to shake hands  why how tall you are getting jessie said the boy and then blushed for the handshake she gave him was a very cordial one how do you do professor and he shook hands with the man who had done so much for him in his younger years  i am very well indeed dave answered professor potts will you sit up here by me or with miss jessie  dave must come in with me said jessie promptly  did my uncle dunston come questioned the boy looking around for he had fully expected to see his relative  no he has a touch of rheumatism in his left knee answered caspar potts  thats too bad  dave assisted jessie to a seat and then got in beside her and tucked in the handsome fur robe off went the team at a spanking gait past the stores of the town and then in the direction of the wadsworth mansion many looked at dave as he rode by and thought him a lucky boyand he certainly was lucky and thankful for it  the mansion reached dave was warmly greeted by mrs wadsworth and later on by mr wadsworth who had been to his large jewelry works on business the lad found his uncle dunston in his room in an easychair with his rheumatic leg resting on a low stool  its not so very bad dave said dunston porter after their greeting was over i hope to be around again before long but it is too bad it should come on at this time when i had hoped to go to london with you  dave sat down and a conversation lasting the best part of an hour ensued the boy told all he knew about nick jasniff and showed the letter which gus plum had received dunston porter said he had sent several cablegrams to london but so far had heard nothing of satisfaction  i even sent a money order to this nick jasniff thinking he might try to get it cashed but the order has not been called for the money was cabled to london and then put in a letter for the general delivery department evidently this jasniff is keeping shady or otherwise he has left the city or is living under an assumed name  i know pretty much the sort of a chap he is said dave he likes to go to the theater and he was a great chap to bowl if i go over there i am going to hunt up the bowling places if there are any and take a look in at the different theaters if he is in london i ought to run across him some day and ill try finding him by letter and by a notice in the newspapers too  dave was a very busy boy for the next few days perfecting his plans to visit england yet he managed to spend several happy hours with the others and especially with jessie who now acted more like a young lady than a girl truth to tell dave thought a great deal of the rich manufacturers daughter and jessie seemed always to want him around that they might sing together or play games or go out for a sleighride  you mustnt forget us when you are in london said jessie i want you to send me some postal cardsthe picture kind  ill send you one every day replied dave the very nicest i can find  with pictures of the places you visit  yes  then you must tell me about the places in your letters  do you want me to write  of course and ill write too said jessie and gave him one of her sunniest smile dave thought of that smile long afterwardswhen he was in london and in the far northlandand it always brightened him in spirits  on the day before his departure dave received a telegram from roger it was short and characteristic       hurrah engage stateroom for two what steamer  good for roger cried dave as he showed the message to his uncle he has permission to go with me now i wont be lonely  i am glad to know he is going along said dunston porter not but that i know you can take care of yourself dave  dave at once sent word to new york to the steamship office and by night the matter of a stateroom for two was arranged then he sent word to roger where his chum could meet him  he spent a quiet evening at the wadsworth mansion jessie and the others did what they could to cheer him but they realized what was on his mind  oh dave i do so hope you will find your father and your sister said jessie on bidding him goodnight i want to know laura i know i shall love herfor your sake and then she ran off dave watched her mount the stairs and disappear in her room and then he retired to his own apartment more thoughtful than ever yet with a warm feeling in his heart that was peculiar to itself for it only came when he saw jessie or was thinking of her     chapter xv  dave and roger in london   off at last  yes roger and i am not sorry for it  and just to think dave inside of a week well be in england it doesnt seem possible  the two boys were standing on the deck of the great steamer watching the last sight of new york city as it faded from view mr wadsworth and caspar potts had come down to see them off and all had had a fine meal together at the old astor house  it was a clear cold day and the boys were glad enough to button their overcoats as they remained on deck watching the last bit of land disappear from view then they swept by the sandy hook lightship and out into the broad atlantic rolling majestically in the bright sunlight  by good luck dave had managed to obtain a firstclass stateroom and the chums felt very comfortable when they settled down in the apartment but they did not know a soul on board and it was not until the second day out that they made a few acquaintances  i think we are going to have a fine trip over said the senators son on the evening of the second day dont you think so dave  ill tell you better when we reach the other side answered the boy from the country with a laugh i dont know much about the atlantic when we were traveling on the pacific i know the weather changed very quickly sometimes  that very night came a heavy blow and by morning the seas were running high the air was piercing cold and everybody was glad enough to remain in the cabins dave returning from the ships library with a volume on travels in england found roger had gone to their stateroom  seasick ill wager a new hat he said to himself and hurried to the apartment sure enough the senators son was on his berth and as pale as death  can i do anything asked dave kindly  nothing groaned roger only make the boat stop for a minutejust one minute dave  i would if i could roger but maybe youll get over it soon he added sympathetically  perhapsafter my insides have had their merrygoround ride was the mournful reply  fortunately the heavy blow did not last long and by the morning of the fourth day the atlantic was comparatively calm dave had not been seasick in the least and he was glad to see his chum come around once more roger greeted him with a faint smile  i was going to fight against it said the senators son but when it caught me i had to give in first clip o dear i dont see what seasickness was invented for and he said this so seriously that dave was forced to laugh outright  as soon as it had been decided that he was to go to london dave had begun to study up about the place so that he might not be too green when he arrived there he had two guidebooks and on the steamship he met several people who were only too willing to give him all the information at their command  london isnt new york my boy said one old gentleman to whom he spoke its larger and its different but if youre used to big cities youll soon find yourself at home there  soon the two boys were watching for a sight of land and when it came they learned that they were in the english channel and nearing the isle of wight here there was plenty of shipping from all parts of the world and they passed several other big liners bound for boston new york philadelphia and southern ports  this is certainly the age of travel was daves comment as they watched the boats pass everybody seems to be going somewhere  by the time they reached southampton there was great bustle on board custom house regulations had to be met after which dave and roger took their first ride in an english railway coach and soon reached the greatest city of the world they had brought with them only their largest dresssuit cases and these they carried  they had already decided to go to a small but comfortable hotel called the todham a cabman was handy who had their dresssuit cases almost before they knew it  whats the fare to the hotel demanded dave  the jehu said several shillings but when dave shook his head the fellow cut the price in half and they sprang in and were off the brief ride was an interesting one and they could not help but contrast the sights to be seen with those of new york and chicago  its certainly different said roger but i guess we can make ourselves at home  the hotel was in the vicinity of charing cross and the two boys obtained an elegant apartment looking down on the busy street they were glad to rest over sunday only going out in the morning to attend services at one of the great churches  well dave now you are here how are you going to start to look for nick jasniff questioned roger it seems to me that it will be a good deal like looking for a needle in a haystack  i am going to advertise and then try all the leading hotels was the answer i have a list of them here if you want to help you can visit one group of them while i visit another  the senators son was willing and they started off without delay during the day dave rode around to exactly twentytwo places but at each hostelry was met with the reply that no such person as nicholas jasniff had registered there  one day wasted he sighed but altered his opinion when he rejoined his chum  jasniff was at the hotel silverin said roger but he left there a little over two weeks ago  did he leave any directions for forwarding mail  yes here is the address the senators son drew a notebook from his pocket 43 pulford road noxham  let us look up the place went on dave eagerly and got out his map of london and its suburbs it was in the northern end of the metropolis and they found a railway running in that direction  we cant go tonight very well but we can try it the first thing in the morning said dave and so it was decided  on arriving in the vicinity of 43 pulford road the two youths found the neighborhood anything but firstclass the houses were old and dirtylooking and had about them a general air of neglect  what do you want demanded the tall and angular woman who answered their summons at the door  goodmorning madam said dave politely i am looking for a young gentleman named nicholas jasniff i believe he boards here  oh so thats it said the woman she eyed dave and roger in a suspicious manner who told you he was boarding here  we heard so down at our hotel  he isnt herehe went away last weekowing me one pound six was the spiteful answer i wish i had my hands on him its kate clever would teach him a lesson the scamp  so he ran away owing you some board money said roger  he did that  and you havent any idea where he is  i have and i havent are you friends of his  not exactly but we wish very much to find him  i am not the one to do him a favorafter him treating me so shabbily said the woman spitefully  youll not be doing him a favor returned dave to tell you the truth i want to catch him for some other wrong hes been doing  oh thats it is it the woman became more interested you are from the states arent you  yes  he was from the states he pretended that he wasnt but i knew differently he got letters from americai saw one of them  and where did he go if you please asked dave  the tall woman drew up her angular shoulders and pursed up her thin lips  if youll pay that board money ill help you to find him  very well if we find him ill pay you the one pound and six shillings answered dave he did not wish to waste time that might be valuable  come in the parlor and ill tell you what i know said kate clever  they entered the little musty and dusty parlor with its old haircloth furniture and its cheap bricabrac the woman dusted two of the chairs with her apron and told them to be seated  i am a poor widow she explained i have to make my living by taking boarders this jasniff paid me only one weeks board he said he expected to get some money but while i was waiting he took his bag and box and slipped away one day when i was to market  i thought he had plenty of money said roger he ran away with enough  ran away with enough was he a thief  yes  o dear then i am glad he is out of my house really we might all have been murdered in our beds and the woman held up her thin hands in horror  after that she told what she could of nick jasniff she said he had spent a good part of his time both day and night down in the heart of london visiting the theaters and other places of amusement once he had complained of being robbed of his pocketbook on a tramcar and again he had lost himself in cheapside and fallen in with some thugs who had tried to carry him into an alleyway in the fight that followed he had had an eye blackened and the sleeve torn from his coat she had sewed on the sleeve again but he had paid her nothing for the work  he spoke once of visiting an old friend named chesterfield who lived in siddingate said the woman he said he might meet his father there maybe if you can find this chesterfield youll find him  we can try anyway answered dave is that all you can tell about him  i dont know of much else mr i havent learned your name yet  my name is david porter this is my friend roger morr  porter why ive heard that name somewhere the woman mused for a moment why yes nicholas jasniff had a friend by that namea gentleman much older than you  a friend gasped dave oh that cant be true mrs clever  well i heard him say something about a man named porter they had met somewherei think in london the man had a daughter named laura and i think this jasniff had been calling upon her     chapter xvi  some important information   dave felt like groaning when he heard mrs clevers words then what jasniff had written in the letter to gus plum was truehe had met mr porter and laura had he tried to set himself up as a friend it was more than likely  and father and laura dont know what a rascal he is dave murmured to his chum oh i feel as if i could wring his neck for all i know he has been making himself agreeable to my sister isnt it enough to make ones blood boil  it certainly is dave but i fancy your sister will soon be able to size up such a fellow as jasniff  perhaps although he can be very oily when he wants to be oh if only i knew where my folks were sighed the boy from the country  mrs clever could tell nothing more about nick jasniff or about the porters but she promised to send dave word if she heard anything and seeing that she was poor dave paid her the money out of which jasniff had swindled her about six dollars and a half then the two youths took their departure stating they might call again  let me know beforehand said mrs clever and ill treat you handsomelike she offered them some cakes and ale but they politely declined the refreshments  from the woman they learned the easiest way to reach siddingate and arrived at that london suburb shortly after the dinnerhour here they procured a hearty meal at the leading hotel and from a directory learned that six chesterfields lived in that vicinityone an ironmonger otherwise a hardware dealer another a draper that is a drygoods merchant and a third a stoker which meant that he was a locomotive fireman the other three were not put down as in business  i dont think well try to hunt up the stoker said dave most likely hes off on a run we can try the storekeepers and then the others  the ironmonger a burly redfaced man had never heard of jasniff but the draper while he did not know anybody of that name said that one of the other chesterfields whose first name was philip had some relatives in the united states including some folks who were now traveling either in england or scotland  thank you well hunt him up said dave where does he live  any cabman can tell you was the answer better ride outits a cold walk  it was cold with the snow covering the ground to the depth of two inches or more the air was very raw and a regular london fog was settling down over the land  a cabman was readily found and inside of a few minutes they were on their way to the philip chesterfield estate from the driver they learned that this chesterfield was an old man rather peculiar in his ways and that he entertained visitors but seldom  it would be queer for nick jasniff to visit such a man remarked dave but i dont want to let any chance of locating him slip by  nick may be glad enough to get a roof over his head if his money is gone answered roger  the cab presently turned up a side road and approached the stone wall of a fairsized estate the mansion of which stood back in a patch of old trees as they entered the gateway dave saw a door open and a boy came out on a veranda  there he is he gasped there is nick now  youre right exclaimed the senators son this is luck and no mistake  as the cab came closer nick jasniff gazed at it curiously to see whom it might contain not to be recognized too quickly dave kept his face averted and cautioned his chum to do the same  say i say began the youth who had run away when dave leaped out and confronted him whewhere did you come from  from oak hall answered dave coolly i fancy you didnt expect to see me so soon jasniff  humph the runaway boy did not know what to say ier been following me up i suppose  i have  you didnt expect me did you put in roger with a grin  i didnt growled nick jasniff any more and he gazed anxiously into the cab half expecting an officer of the law to put in an appearance  no more just now said dave with peculiar emphasis  what do you want jasniff was gradually regaining his selfpossession  i want a whole lot of things answered dave do you want to do your talking here or in the house and he glanced at the cab driver who was staring at the boys with his mouth open in curiosity  you can come in if you wish was the awkward answer and nick jasniff led the way into the old mansion which was semidark and not more than half warmed do you know who lives here he continued  your relative philip chesterfield answered roger  humph hes a greatuncle of mine and very old he is down with gout come into the library we neednt disturb him  they filed into the apartment mentioned a long low room the walls of which were lined with shelves filled with musty volumes dave kept his eyes on jasniff and this the runaway noticed  think im going to skip he queried sourly  ill not give you the chance was the ready answer  you think youve got me foul dont you  doesnt it look like it  you cant make me go back to the united states  perhaps i can  my folks have settled up that pud frodel affair for medid it only a few days ago  but they didnt settle up with mrs clever she was swindled out of some board money  ieri was going to send her that money today  then you had better pay me for i settled the account answered dave but let us drop this talk for the present jasniff i want you to tell me all you know about my father and my sister  humph i havent got to tell you anything if i dont want to  yes you have got to cried dave a dangerous gleam came into his eyes out with it at once where is my father  see here porter i dont propose to be bullied i  you answer my question nick jasniff if you dont ill call in an officer at once and have you placed under arrest  you cant do it  i can and will if i cant have you held on one charge ill have you held on another i want the truth from you and i want it right away  dave had followed nick jasniff to a window and faced the runaway with such sternness and determination that the latter cowed before him  ierthat is your father went north last week  where to  he said he was going to christiania norway  christiania norway repeated dave he knew there was such a place but that was all what for  oh he was interested in an expedition that was going to the upper interiorsome kind of a scientific expedition i think he was full of itsaid they hoped to make all kinds of discoveries  whose expedition was it  it was gotten up by two men named lapham and hausermann  i read about that expedition cried roger there was an account of it in this mornings times  when was it to start asked dave anxiously  i dont know  do you know jasniff  not exactlysome time this week i think  was my sister laura going with my father went on dave anxiously  no  where is she  i give it up  jasniff tell me the truth and again dave looked at the runaway sternly  i dont know where she is  you met her  certainlyhalf a dozen times  how did you get acquainted with my folks  oh i met them by accident and as soon as i learned who they were i introduced myself and said i knew your uncle dunston porter  what did you say about me and now dave was more anxious than ever  ieri  come out with it and tell the exact truth jasniff or it will be the worse for you  ieri didnt mention you stammered the runaway he could scarcely bring himself to speak the words  you didnt  what do you mean to say you met mr porter and his daughter and didnt let them know that dave was alive and that he was looking for them demanded roger  it wasnt my business to tell them answered jasniff doggedly  nick jasniff you are the meanest fellow i ever met in my whole life burst out the senators son for two pins id give you the worst thrashing you ever received didnt you know how happy it would make mr porter and his daughter to know that dave was alive  ierthat wasnt my business dave was no friend of minewhy should i put myself out to do him a good turn if he wants to find his father and his sister let him do it  did you become well acquainted with my sister asked dave after a pause  fairly well yes  did you take her out anywhere  noershe wouldnt go with me  i am glad to hear it you say you have no idea where she is now  not exactly there was an american family named endicott over here they came from somewhere out west they had a daughter about lauras age and the two were chums i think your sister sailed with the endicotts for the states  did they write to my uncle  i dont know but i think not for they thought your uncle was still knocking around the south sea islands  and you wouldnt tell them a word cried dave bitterly jasniff i never supposed any fellow could be so cruel and hardhearted  humph i havent forgotten what i had to suffer muttered the runaway  you brought all that on yourself you had no business to go in with those two thieves if you had remained honest there would have been no call for you to run away  oh dont preach dave porter  what dave says is true jasniff said roger if you have suffered it is all through your own dishonesty  who says a relative of mine is dishonest came a loud harsh voice from the doorway of the library and turning quickly dave and roger found themselves confronted by an old man white with sudden rage and brandishing a heavy cane in his hand     chapter xvii  on the north sea   both dave and his chum were startled by the sudden interruption and for the moment did not know what to say they looked at the old man and then at nick jasniff the latter turned pale and seemed thoroughly ill at ease  who says a relative of mine is dishonest repeated the old man and now he strode up to dave and raised the cane over the youths head  if you refer to this boy as your relative i say he is dishonest answered dave stoutly  and so do i added the senators son  nicholas dishonest it cannot be there must be some mistake  i am sorry for you sir but there is no mistake returned dave  who are you sir  my name is david porter i come from the united states nicholas and myself and my friend here all attended the same boarding school  the place called oak hall  yes sir i presume you are mr philip chesterfield  i am and i am a greatuncle to nicholas the old man lowered his cane what do you know of nicholas he questioned curiously  i know a great deal mr chesterfield if you care to hear the story i will tell it to you  dont you listen to him uncle phil stormed nick jasniff in increasing fear hell tell you nothing but a bundle of lies  i can prove every statement i make answered dave  dave will tell you nothing but the truth added roger  who are you young man  my name is roger morr  he is the son of united states senator morr added dave  ah indeed the fact that rogers father occupied a high political position seemed to have considerable effect on philip chesterfield  they are a couple of fakirs cried nick jasniff he knew not what else to say  nicholas be silent i will listen to their story and then you can have your say  if you are going to listen to them ill get out stormed the runaway and edged for the door  no you dont youll stay here exclaimed dave and blocked the way i came all the way from america to catch you and you are not going until i get through with you  a brief war of words followed which came to an end when the old gentleman locked the door then he had dave and roger tell their tale in full after which he asked a number of questions nick jasniff wanted to break into the conversation a number of times but was not permitted to do so  nicholas if this is true you are a young scoundrel and i do not want you in my house another day exclaimed philip chesterfield i shall send a telegram to your father at once asking him to come on  where is mr jasniff asked dave  in italyhe went there for his wifes health  did nicholas tell you anything about my folks went on dave  nothing excepting that he had met a mr porter and his daughter and that the father had sailed for norway and the daughter for the states  then that news must be true said roger dave the best thing you can do is to go to christiania at once  exactly my way of thinking roger  and about nick  you shant do anything to me roared the runaway i wont stand for it  i shall notify the authorities in america where you are answered dave then they can do as they please in the affair  a little later dave and roger left the mansion philip chesterfield bidding them a formal goodbye nick jasniff was sullen and looked as if he wanted to kill both boys  hell get back at us some day if he can observed the senators son as they drove back to siddingate  arriving at the town the two youths took the first train back to london proper here they found that to get to christiania they would have to take a train to hull and from there try to obtain passage on some vessel bound for the norwegian capital  its only a four hours ride to hull said dave consulting a timetable i can get there tonight if i wish  all right let us take the first train  do you want to go to hull to see me off roger  i am not going to see you off dave  what do you mean  i am going with youif youll have me  to norway  sureanywhere  but what will your folks say  they wont mindso long as i keep out of trouble i told father we might go further than england  ill be pleased to have you along  they settled up at the hotel and quarter of an hour later were at the station at the booking office as it is called in england they procured tickets for seats in a firstclass coach and soon the train came along  it seems funny to be locked up in such a coach as this remarked dave i must say i like our style of open car best  they were soon leaving the smoky and foggy city of london behind and rushing northward only two stops were made one at leicester and the other at sheffield  here is where the celebrated sheffield cutlery comes from observed roger as the last stop was made if we were going to stop over id buy a pocketknife for a souvenir  remember we must get some picture postals at hull answered dave who had not forgotten the promise made to jessie he had already sent her over a dozen cards  hull is one of the main seaports of england and shipbuilding and sailmaking are great industries there in the harbor were a great many steamers and sailing vessels bound for ports all over the world  dave was in a fever of anxiety he had been unable to ascertain when the expedition in which his father was interested was to start northward from christiania and as a consequence he wanted to reach the norwegian capital city with the least possible delay  it will be just my luck to arrive there after the expedition has left he half groaned to his chum  let us hope for the best dave  as late as it was the two youths skirmished around and finally learned that a steamer would leave hull for christiania two days later on this they booked passage and then dave hurried to the nearest telegraph office and sent a cablegram to christiania addressed to his parent the message ran as follows       wait until i reach you your longlost son                                                   david porter  that ought to hold him said he to roger  of course it willif he gets it dave  the message sent the two boys looked around for a hotel and then obtained a decidedly late supper when they retired roger slept like a top as he expressed it but dave lay awake for hours wondering what the future held in store for him now that he seemed so close to his father he could scarcely wait for the time to come when they should meet face to face  roughly estimated the distance from hull to christiania is about six hundred miles as it was winter the harbor of the norwegian capital was frozen up so the steamer could not go further than dröbak a seaport eighteen miles south of the capital owing to the wintry weather dave learned that it would take three full days to make the voyage  it was not particularly cold on leaving hull but as soon as the steamer struck the full sweep of the winds on the north sea the thermometer went down rapidly  phew but this is cold ejaculated roger as he buttoned his coat tightly its like being down on the coast of maine  just wait until we get to norwaythere is where youll find it cold was daves reply maybe well have to invest in fur overcoats  well i am willing answered the senators son with a laugh  fortunately both boys had been supplied with considerable cash and ample letters of credit so that monetary matters did not bother them before leaving hull dave supplied himself with an englishdanish selfeducator and on the ship both he and roger studied the volume with interest  i want to know a few words said the senators son it is awful to be in a country when youre not able to speak a word of the language  on the second day of the voyage the two boys got something of a scare they heard an explosion and then a great cloud of steam spread over the vessel  something has burst thats certain cried dave let us go on deck and see what is wrong  they hurried out on the main deck and there found a great number of passengers all in a state of excitement a few were on the point of leaping overboard thinking the ship was going to sink but the officers were cool and collected and did all in their power to restore confidence  nothing serious has occurred was the announcement one of the officers made in the presence of dave and his chum a steampipe burst and one of the engineers was scalded that is all the pipe will be repaired as quickly as possible  will this delay us much asked dave  that i cannot say was the answer  the rest of the day passed quietly enough the steamer moved along slowly for the engines were badly crippled dave thinking only of the time in which he might reach his destination walked the deck impatiently  ill wager this means another day said he to his chum  more than likely was the reply well since it cant be helped youll have to make the best of it  yes i know roger but id give almost anything to be in christiania now  i can appreciate how you feel id be the same way if i were in your place dave was the kindly answer of the senators son  that night a heavy snowstorm came on and by morning all around the ship was completely shut out of sight the steampipe had now been mended but the engines had to be kept down at a low speed for fear of running into some other craft the foghorn was blown constantly and occasionally came an answering sound from another vessel once they ran close to a threemasted schooner and then the bell on that ship was rung with a loud clamor  that was a narrow escape said dave after the schooner had drifted from sight  towards night the snowstorm increased in violence the wind piped merrily over the deck of the steamer and the boys were glad to remain inside they turned in early since there was nothing else to do  illustration once they ran close to a threemasted schoonerpage 160  dave could not sleep at first but presently dropped into a light doze when he awoke he sat up with a start he had heard a strange noise but now all was silent he called to roger but received no reply then he called again and got up and lighted the room  roger where are you he repeated and then looked toward his chums berth to his amazement the berth was made up as if it had never been occupied and roger was gone     chapter xviii  in norway at last   there is no denying the fact that dave was startled it was one thing to have roger missing it was quite another to have his chum gone and have the berth made up as if it had never been occupied  he went to bedi saw him go muttered the boy from the country to himself am i dreaming or what can the matter be  the more dave thought over the affair the more was he puzzled as quickly as he could he put on some of his clothing and slipped on his shoes then he opened the stateroom door and stepped out into the passageway leading to the main saloon  there was a dim light burning outside and nobody appeared to be in sight dave looked up and down the passageway eagerly and even stepped to one of the corners then he walked to the main saloon with its big sofas and easychairs and its grand piano not a soul was in sight anywhere  well if this isnt the queerest yet he murmured and pinched himself to make certain that he was not dreaming he walked to one end of the saloon and then to the other and then started for the stairs leading out on deck  at that moment there came an extraheavy gust of wind and the steamer rocked violently dave was thrown on his side and fell headlong over the end of a sofa as he went down he heard several cries one in a voice that sounded familiar to him  that must have been roger he told himself where can he be and then he called out loudly roger roger morr where are you  the boat continued to toss and pitch and now dave had all he could do to keep his feet when he reached the entrance to the main deck he was stopped by one of the under officers  too rough to go out there  i am looking for my friend answered dave and told of the disappearance of the senators son  perhaps hes walking in his sleep suggested the officer  that may be it cried dave queer i didnt think of it he told me he got up once in a great while  if he was walking in his sleep the lurching of the boat must have awakened himif he cried out maybe he went back to his stateroom continued the ships official  ill go back and see  not without some difficulty dave returned to his stateroom the steamer was pitching and tossing dreadfully and the wind made a wild whistling sound overhead he heard the overturning of a table or a chair and the crash of glassware  we are going to have a tough night of it he reasoned guess further sleep will be out of the question  hoping he would find his chum in the stateroom dave returned to the apartment here another surprise was in store for him the door was locked from the inside he rapped loudly several times  hello whos there came in a sleepy voice  roger is that you let me in  dave i declare why i thought you were in your berth  the senators son came to the door and opened it dave entered the stateroom which was dark  roger where have you been he demanded  so you knew i went out did you asked the senators son in a voice that showed he was vexed i thought i went out and came back without your knowing it i thought you were still in your berth  i got up made a light and found you goneand the berth made up as if you hadnt used it dave paused and looked at his chum who had just lit up  welleri might as well tell you i must have been walking in my sleep stammered roger and got red im as bad as shadow hamilton  well i hope you didnt steal anything as he did added dave hastily referring to an unfortunate incident already well known to my old readers  i dont think i didbut i dont know where i went  you made up your bed too  did i thats queer  and you dont know where you went at all roger  no i havent the slightest idea  were you dreaming  i think i wasim not sure it was something about nick jasniffhe was trying to take something from me and i got afraid of him that is all i can remember  i thought i heard you screamwhen the vessel gave that awful lurch a few minutes ago  that woke me up and i found myself in one of the passageways not far from here i was dazed by the tumble i received but got back here all right  after this you had better tie yourself to the bed was daves final remark and then he turned in again and the light was again extinguished  but anything more than fitful dozes could not be had the north sea is well known for its violent storms during the winter months and this one proved to be a corker as dave called it afterwards the waves were lashed into a tremendous fury and some broke over the steamers deck with terrific force one carrying away a twentyfoot section of the forward rail the high wind was accompanied by a snow that was as fine and hard as salt and this sifted through every crack the windows and doors afforded  no port today said dave and he was right to run close to the norwegian coast in such a high wind and with so much snow flying was dangerous and they had to remain for twentyfour hours longer at the entrance to christiania fjordfjord being the local name for bay  but at last the snow stopped coming down and the wind subsided a little and the steamer headed up the bay to dröbak located on the east shore of the harbor here there was a good deal of floating ice and plowing among it were vessels of all kinds and sizes all covered with ice and snow  its wintry enough up here goodness knows remarked roger i wonder how far north christiania is  i was looking it up on the map answered dave it is located about sixty degrees north which is just about the latitude of the lower coast of greenland  what as far north as that no wonder it is cold  dont forget roger that norway is the land of the midnight sun at the far north they have a night lasting about three months  well i dont want such a night as that just yet  noyou might do too much sleepwalking and dave grinned  oh cut that out and the face of the senators son grew red  i shant mention it again  dröbak is but a small place containing less than twentyfive hundred inhabitants but during the winter all the shipping of the fjord congregates there and as a consequence the scene was a lively one the boys were quickly landed and then from one of the dock officials learned where they could get a train running to the capital their baggage had been examined and passed upon by the usual custom officials  well this is certainly a secondrate railroad was daves comment as they seated themselves in the stuffy coach and had the door locked upon them then the train moved off at a slow rate of speed that was tantalizing to both with half a dozen stops it took them nearly an hour to reach christiania only eighteen miles away looking out of the window the landscape was a dreary one of marshland on one side and rocks on the other all covered with ice and snow the coach had no heat in it and roger declared that his feet were half frozen  puts me in mind of the time i visited a lumber camp in upper maine he told his chum it was in the wintertime and they only ran one train a day of two cars a freight and a combination of everything else we were delayed on the road almost snowed in and i didnt thaw out for a week afterwards  at the railroad station in christiania they had some trouble passing the guard again their baggage was looked over and they were taken to an office and asked a dozen or more questions by a man who looked as if he might be a policeinspector what it was all about they could not make out but at first the officer was not inclined to let them go  perhaps you had better go back to where you came from said the man to dave  why whats the trouble demanded the youth i am sure i have done no wrong  what brought you to norway  i am looking for my father his name is david porter like my own he has joined the laphamhausermann expedition bound for the interior of norway  exactly and the officer looked wise who is this young man  this is my friend roger morr he is traveling with me for company  you are very young to be traveling alone  i cant help that i want to find my father and do it as soon as i can  is he expecting you  i dont know i sent him a cablegram but i do not know if he received it  that expeditiondo you know anything about it asked the officer shrewdly  no sirnothing more than what i saw in the english papers  didnt your father tell you anything about it  no he couldnt and dave hesitated  why  becausewell he doesnt know methat is he doesnt know i am alive  this is extraordinary young man exclaimed the officer of the police for such the man was i think you had better explain  i am in a great hurry sir pleaded dave  he wants to catch his father before the expedition leaves christiania put in roger  before it leaves  yes  the police official drew up his shoulders and made a wry face  has it left already questioned dave eagerly  to be surefour days ago was the answer which filled daves heart with fresh dismay     chapter xix  off to the northward   dave and roger were told to follow the police officer and did so to a large stone building located on one of the principal streets of the norwegian capital as they walked along many gazed at the american boys with interest  conducted into a plainly furnished office the boys were told to sit down then they were asked if they had any objection to their baggage being examined  not the slightest answered dave and roger said the same  at the same time i wish you to understand one thing went on daves chum i am the son of a united states senator and if i have to suffer any indignity at your hands youll hear from it later through the proper authorities  a united states senators son murmured the police official ah he took a long breath i shall not detain you a second longer than is necessary sir he went on more civilly  after that dave and roger were asked a great number of additional questions and dave had virtually to tell his story from beginning to end several officials listened with interest but whether they believed him or not the boy could not tell  i am afraid you will have hard work finding your parent said the police officer at the conclusion of the interview  he must have left some directions behindfor forwarding mail and the like  possibly but i doubt it the expedition was bound up into the mountainsso it was said the means of communication are very poor at this time of year  the baggage was gone over with care and the examination was evidently a disappointment to those who made it a long talk in norwegian followed between several police officials and then dave and roger were told that they could go  would you mind telling me what it is all about questioned dave when he was ready to leave  you will have to excuse me but i am not permitted to answer that question said the man who had brought them in gravely if we have detained you without just cause we are very sorry for it and that was all he would say  its mighty queer to say the least observed roger after they had taken their departure dave what do you make of it  i think they took us to be some foreigners who had come to norway for no good purpose you must remember that throughout europe they have great trouble with anarchists and with political criminals who plot all sorts of things against the various governments maybe they took us to be fellows who had come here to blow somebody up  they ought to know better than that i dont think we look like anarchists  since that uprising in russia and the attempt on the king in italy every nation over here looks with suspicion on all foreigners but there is something else to it i imagine went on dave seriously those fellows acted as if they didnt think much of this expedition which my father has joined maybe that is under suspicion too  yes i noticed thatand if it is true your father may have some trouble before he leaves norway  i wish i could get to him at once i could warn him  from an englishman on the steamer the boys had learned of a good hotel where english was spoken and there they obtained a good room for the night before going to bed dave mailed several postals to jessie and also a letter to his uncle dunston and another to phil lawrence for the benefit of the boys at oak hall  it was not difficult in christiania to find out when the laphamhausermann expedition had left the capital or what had been its first stoppingplace it had taken a railroad train to pansfar and then gone northward to the mountain town of blanfosso called because of the waterfall in that vicinitya waterfall being a fos in the native tongue  i dont see anything to do but to journey to blanfos said dave i presume it will be a mighty cold trip and you neednt go if you dont wish to roger  didnt i say id go anywhere you wenteven if its to the north pole was the answer come onim ready to start any time you are  i dont think well get to the north pole but we may get to the north cape but we cant start until weve got those fur overcoats we talked about  at several of the shops in christiania they procured all the additional clothing they thought they needed some of their lighterweight stuff they left behind not wishing to be encumbered with too much baggage they booked for pansfar at the railroad station and by the middle of the afternoon of the second day in norway were bound northward  there is that police official watching us cried roger as the train was about to depart he was rightthe man was in sight but he quickly lost himself in a crowd and whether he got on the train or not they could not tell  the train was but scantily filled and only four people occupied the coach with the young americans one couple was evidently a newly married pair who had been on a wedding trip to christiania and they were very retired and shy the other pair were a burgomaster and his wife from some interior town the burgomasterwho held a position similar to that of a mayor in an american citywanted everybody to know who he was and was thoroughly disagreeable he crowded dave into a corner until the youth could hardly get any air  ill thank you not to crowd so muchthere is plenty of room said the boy  the norwegian did not understand and continued to crowd the youth then dave grew thoroughly angry and crowded back digging his elbow well into the burgomasters fat ribs this caused the man to glare at the young american nothing daunted dave glared back  what do you do that for demanded the burgomaster sourly  i dont speak norwegian answered dave brokenly for that was one of the native phrases he had picked up but i want you to quit crowding me he added in english and moved his elbows to show what he meant  the burly norwegian had supposed he would daunt dave by his looks and when he saw that the young american was unmoved he was nonplussed he growled out something to his wife who grumbled something in return he did not budge and dave continued to hold his elbow well in the fellows ribs the situation had its comical side and it was all roger could do to keep from laughing  if you dont stop that ill have you put off the train roared the burgomaster  as dave did not understand he said nothing  a few minutes passed and the train came to a halt and the door was unlocked nobody got out but a round and ruddyfaced man got in and nodded to all those present  guard guard come here roared the burgomaster but even as he spoke the door was closed and locked again and the train moved off then of a sudden the norwegian grabbed dave by the shoulder  let go there cried the youth and took hold of the mans fat wrist he gave such a tight squeeze that the burgomaster was glad enough to release his hold  i say whats the matter here demanded the man who had just come in and spoke in a distinctly english tone of voice  hes been shoving me into a corner and i told him to quit answered dave glad to be able to make himself understood to somebody besides roger  the englishman looked at the norwegian and gave a grunt of disgust cant you let the lad alone he demanded in norwegian hes not hurting you any is he whats the use of acting as if you owned the whole coach  the burgomaster attempted to answer but the englishman would scarcely listen he liked daves looks while he could readily see that the norwegian was nothing but a bully he said he didnt care if the man was a burgomaster if dave wasnt doing anything wrong he must be let alone and a good deal more to the same effect he and the norwegian got into a spirited argument but finally the burgomaster cooled down a bit got up and bounced down on another seat and his wife followed him  some of these blooming chaps are as overbearing as they can be remarked the englishman after matters had quieted down now this fellow is the burgomaster of some small town up here in norway and on that account he thinks he can treat folks as he pleases i am glad to know you stood up for your rights never let them walk over you old england every time say i and he smiled broadly  i am much obliged to you for what you did answered dave smiling back a fellow is at a disadvantage when he cant speak the language  thats true lad what part of our country do you come from  i come from the united states and so does my friend here and the young american introduced himself and roger  well now isnt that strange exclaimed the newcomer and i took you to be english lads sure well next to being english id prefer to be an american my name is granbury lapham  granbury lapham cried dave quickly not the lapham of the laphamhausermann expedition  no not exactly that lad but close to it that lapham is my brother oscar he is younger than i and daffy on the subject of investigations as soon as i heard he had started for the mountains of norway i came over to find out just what he was doing i dont want him to investigate some high mountain in a snowstorm fall over some precipice and kill himself  you are going to join the expedition  yes if i can find it but what do you know about it  i am going to join it also and so is my friend and then dave had to give his reasons granbury lapham listened with many a nod to the recital  i declare master porter it sounds like a sixshilling novel dont you know he said so you havent ever seen this father of yours small wonder youre in a hurry to run across him well ill assist you all i can i presume we had better travel together  with pleasure cried dave and he and the englishman shook hands then granbury lapham told something of himself and thus the time passed until pansfar was reached here they got out the burgomaster scowling after them as they departed  the englishman had visited norway a number of times and spoke danish and norwegian very well he led the way to a tavern where all enjoyed a smokinghot meal with some steaming coffee  in the parts of norway where there are no railroads the stage and sleigh lines so called are under the control of the government the drivers are allowed to charge just so much for driving a person from one place to another and the roadhouses along the way are also subject to official control and you can always get your meals for a stated price  i suppose a fellow can get extras suggested roger  certainlywhatever you pay for answered granbury lapham with a laugh  he said that the laphamhausermann expedition consisted of six members including mr porter what the object was he did not particularly know excepting that his brother wanted to gather information concerning the hardy plants of norway he knew the party were going to keep to what was known as the sklovarak highway as far as fesfjor and then to a new road leading directly northward  i think the best thing we can do is to hire a good sleigh and a double team of horses said the englishman well want a good driver too one who knows all the roads  it took them until the next day to obtain just what they wanted the sleigh was a commodious one and in it they placed such things as the driver advised them to take along then wrapped in fur overcoats and wearing fur caps they set off on a tour that was destined to be filled with not a few perils and strange adventures     chapter xx  an encounter with wolves   well this is certainly a strange christmas day  it was dave who spoke he stood in the doorway of a small log hut gazing anxiously out at the landscape before him  he was in the very heart of norway and on every side loomed the mountains with their covering of ice and snow just behind the hut was a patch of firs the only trees growing in that vicinity in front was what in summer was a mountain torrent now a mass of irregular ice the hollows filled with snow  the party had arrived at this place the night before after four days of almost constant traveling but here a blinding snowstorm had brought them to a halt the driver of the sleigh refusing to trust himself and his turnout on the mountain trail beyond  it is a bad road said he to granbury lapham in norwegian a slip and a slide and we should all be killed we must wait until the storm is over and so they put up at this hut by the roadside and the horses were stabled in a cowshed in the rear  the four days of traveling in the heart of norway had been full of interest to dave and roger they had passed through half a dozen towns and as many more villages and had met not a few people on the road some dressed like ordinary europeans and others in the brightcolored clothing of their forefathers they had had all kinds of meals mostly bad as dave declared and both boys longed for some united states cooking as roger said but one thing pleased themwherever they slept the beds were good and the rooms as clean as wax  up to the day previous they had heard a number of times about the scientific expedition which was said to be just ahead but then somebody had sent them astray and in trying to get on the right road they had been caught in the snowstorm and been forced to take to the shelter as described  too bad dave especially when you hoped to meet your father by christmas said roger but shut the doorit is too cold for comfort out there  i opened it to get a whiff of fresh airits vile inside when the cooking is going onthey use so much fat for frying  the hut was the property of a sturdy mountaineer who possessed half a dozen cows and a large flock of sheep he was a big fellow all of six feet four inches high with yellowish hair and bright blue eyes he was generally goodnatured but the boys once saw him give his oldest son a box on the ear that sent the youngster rolling over and over on the floor  hes got a hand on him like a ham remarked the senators son i shouldnt want him to strike me  most of these norwegian mountain folks are big and strong said granbury lapham i fancy the puny ones die off young  what do they do for a living they cant farm much around here said dave  they raise sheep goats and cows and a good many of them are woodchoppers norwegian lumber is a great thing in the market and of late years the paper mills are after woodpulp which they get from the small growth along the coast nearly all the inhabitants are fishermen  the family of the hutowner consisted of his wife and seven children for christmas dinner there were a hare potpie carrots and onions and a pudding with honey sauce the children had a christmas tree brought in by their father from the forest and this was decorated with fancycolored papers and rings stars and animals all made of a kind of ginger and spice dough and baked by the housewife there were a few presents and the boys and granbury lapham added to these by giving the children each a small silver piece which delighted them hugely  ill wager they are having a fine dinner at the wadsworth home said dave with a sigh in his minds eye he could see jessie his uncle dunston and all the others making merry around the board  dont mention it dave answered his chum we generally have a bangup time too  what i miss most of all is my plumpudding dont you know remarked granbury lapham ive had plumpudding for christmas ever since i was a baby  id like to know how my father is faring  and my brother added the englishman  well we are bound to catch up to them soon so dont let us worry about it any more said the senators son cheerfully  the mountaineer was something of a huntsman and showed the boys his shotgun a weapon they considered rather antiquated yet one capable of doing good service  he says he once brought down a bear with that gun said granbury lapham it must have been at close quarters for as i understand it a norway bear is a pretty tough creature to kill  do they have many wild animals up here questioned roger with interest  they have besides bears a good many wolves some lynxes and also red deer reindeer hares and a variety of small animals  we must go out hunting before we leave norway cried roger who liked the sport very much  all right im willing answered dave but i should like to find my father first he added hastily  oh of course  the evening of christmas day was spent in watching the children around the decorated tree which was lit up with a dozen or more tiny candles of home production then the boys turned in and granbury lapham followed  about the middle of the night came a great disturbance and in a minute the household was in an uproar they heard the mountaineer call to his wife and then lantern in hand he rushed outside and toward the sheepfold back of the cowshed  some wolves have gotten among the sheep explained granbury lapham after a few words with the woman of the hut the man is going after them with his gun  let us see if we can aid him exclaimed roger and slipped on such of his clothing as he had taken off he had a loaded pistol in his pocket  if you go out ill go too answered dave and followed his chum to the rear of the hut he too had a pistol purchased before going on the journey in the sleigh and now he looked to see that the weapon was in condition for use  outside they heard the mountaineer calling loudly although they could not make out what was being said there was a commotion in the sheepfold and also in the cowshed then came a crashing sound and from the cowshed came one of the horses  hullo one of the horses is running away cried dave this wont do at all whoa whoa there  but the steed did not whoaevidently not understanding such a command on it went around the corner of the hut and along the snowy trail the sleigh driver was up and after it and set off on a labored run cracking a whip as he went  i see a wolf cried roger the beast had just left the sheepfold and was carrying something in its mouth evidently it was nearly famished or it would never have stopped to carry off such a burden  its a sheep said dave  as he spoke the senators son fired and the bullet from his pistol hit the wolf in the side the beast staggered for a second and then kept on still carrying the sheep in its strong teeth  hes game thats sure said dave and now he too fired running forward as he did so then came the roar of the shotgun from the sheepfold and out came another wolf followed presently by a third the fourth and last of the pack was instantly killed by the mountaineer who literally at close range blew the animals head off  daves shot caused the wolf with the sheep to falter and presently it dropped its burden and limped away for the nearest patch of firs as it did this the second and the third wolf ranged up by the side of the two young americans roger fired three shots in succession and dave fired twice but the animals were so quick that but little damage was done one beast was hit in the tail and the other in the shoulder and this made them extremely ugly  granbury lapham had come out but was at the sheepfold with the mountaineer as a consequence the two boys faced the two wolves alone one was sniffing at the body of the dead sheep and now it essayed to raise the carcass up  hes going to run off with that sheep cried roger  not if i know it answered dave and rushing closer he took the best aim the night afforded and blazed away the wolf dropped the carcass gave a vicious snarl and turned abruptly  look out yelled the senators son and scarcely had he spoken when the wolf was at daves very feet glaring ferociously into the youths face dave wanted to fire at the animal but only a click of the hammer followed the pulling of the pistols trigger  it was a moment of peril but roger came to the rescue not to hit his chum he ran around to the wolfs side and blazed away twice in rapid succession this was too much for the wolf and with only a grunt it rolled over and stretched out dead  good for you roger said dave if you hadnt look out here comes the other wolf  dave was right undaunted by the death of its mate the last wolfthe largest of the pack of fourhad leaped up through the snow and darkness it was so hungry that the smell of blood maddened it beyond all endurance it leaped so close to dave it brushed his legs then grabbed the sheep and began to drag the carcass rapidly through the snow  hes game i must say cried roger and reloaded his pistol while dave did the same then came a shout from the sheepfold and the mountaineer put in an appearance followed by granbury lapham  the man of the place was angry for three of his best sheep had been killed he blazed away as soon as he saw the wolf but his aim was poor and the snow blown up by a sudden wind almost hid the beast from sight then the englishman fired hitting the wolf in the right hind leg the animal whirled savagely dropped the sheep gave a snarl of rage and suddenly confronted roger  get back you yelled the senators son and fired pointblank at the wolf he hit only one ear and in a twinkling the wolf was on his breast trying his best to get at rogers throat     chapter xxi  caught in a windstorm   it was an anxious moment for all and the others expected to see poor roger almost torn to pieces the wolf was big and strong and hunger and the wounds it had received made it a formidable antagonist its eyes gleamed like those of a tiger  help help cried roger and then his words were drowned in the crack of daves pistol taking the best aim he could the youth fired three times and the wolf was hit in the side and the rump it fell to the ground whirled over and over in the snow and started for dave then granbury lapham fired and the wolf fell over on its side a moment later the mountaineer rushed in and with a club he had picked up at the sheepfold dashed out the brains of the creature and thus the strange and unexpected encounter came to an end  roger had suffered little more than a few scratches yet he was so weak that the others had to support him back to the hut  ii felt it was my last minute on earth he gasped if that wolf had been left alone another ten seconds he would have bitten me in the throat  he was certainly a savage beast replied dave he too was trembling in spite of all he could do to control himself  several lights were now lit and leaving roger at the hut the others went around to view the damage done the mountaineer mourned the loss of his sheep but was rejoiced to know so many wolves were dead  i know that big wolf he told the englishman he had given me a great deal of trouble he was the leader of the pack now he is gone perhaps i shall have peace for the rest of the winter  the sleigh driver had returned with the runaway horse the animal was highly excited and the driver had all he could do to quiet the steed  i could tell a long story about this horse said the sleigh driver once we were caught near stamo in a great snow the wolves came after us and this horse was bitten in the flank that is what made him so afraid the other horses do not know what wolves really are and they did not mind them any more than they would so many dogs  this is a christmas night to remember said dave when they finally turned in again roger if this sort of thing keeps up we are in for a trip full of excitement  thank you i dont want to meet any more wolves replied the senators son  all were worn out by what had happened and glad to sleep late the following day when they arose they found the storm had cleared away and it was as bright as could be expected at this time of year once more the sleigh was brought forth and the double team harnessed up from the mountaineer they obtained a few extra provisions including a portion of the mutton that had been killed for this the man would take no pay but the boys made his wife a present of some silver that pleased the family very much  and now to catch the exploring party cried dave i dont think they traveled any further than we did in that awful snowstorm  it all depends upon what road they were on so hendrik tells me answered granbury lapham hendrik was the sleigh driver a goodnatured man although rather silent  does he mean that they could travel on some of the roads even if it did storm asked dave  yes  well all we can do is to follow them the best we know how said roger  the new fall of snow had made traveling very heavy and by noon they had covered only nine miles not a hut was in sight and they made a temporary camp at the edge of a pine forest where the trees sheltered them from the wind a fire was built and they broiled a piece of mutton and made a large pot of coffee  what a sparsely settled country this is remarked the senators son i declare it looks like some spots in the far west of the united states  norway is the most thinly settled country of europe answered granbury lapham and instead of growing better it seems to grow worse many of the peasants emigrate to canada and the united states where they can get productive farms without much trouble  it was necessary to let the horses rest for an hour and during that time the two boys strolled around the vicinity there was however not much to see and once off the road they found walking uncertain and dangerous  i can now understand why the driver didnt want to go on in that storm was daves comment when he pulled himself out of a gully several feet deep a little more and id have gone heels over head and what would happen to the turnout in such a place i dont know  if the sleigh breaks down or we lose a horse it will be very bad answered the englishman gravely the further north we go the more careful we must be or we may not get back in safety i think that exploring expedition was rather a foolhardy undertakingat this season of the year  i believe i know what prompted my father to undertake it said dave it was the spirit of adventure my uncle dunston says my father loves an adventure of any kind  do you take after him asked the englishman with a twinkle in his eyes  i think i mustotherwise i shouldnt be here and dave smiled broadly  the sleigh driver said that if they made good time during the afternoon they would reach the village of bojowak by five or six oclock here he was certain they would hear further of the exploring party  then let us hurry all we can said dave if it is too much of a pull for the horses i for one am willing to walk part of the way  so am i added the senators son and the englishman also agreed to this although he declared that trudging in the deep snow generally winded him greatly  they were now approaching a dangerous part of the road which ran around the western slope of two fairsized mountains they progressed with care and frequently the driver would go in advance to make sure that the footing was good  if only the fellows of oak hall could see us now declared dave wonder what they would say  i must take another snapshot or two answered roger  he had brought a folding pocket camera with him and had already taken several rolls of pictures none of the films had been developed so he could not as yet tell how the snapshots would turn out now he took a picture of dave kneedeep in snow with the turnout and the others in the background  i ought to have a picture of that fight with the wolves said roger when he put his camera away when we tell about it at the hall some of the fellows will be sure to say its a fishstory  nat poole wont believe it for one roger and i dont think merwell will believe it either  at the mention of merwells name daves face clouded for an instant  i wish merwell would leave oak hall roger he said somehow i like that chap less than i do nat poole or anybody elseeven jasniff  so do i poole is a fool and jasniff is a hotheaded scamp but this merwell the senators son could not finish  i believe merwell has the making of a thoroughly bad fellow in him finished dave i dont see how doctor clay allowed him to join the school  on and on went the sleigh the road was up hill and all hands walked once they passed a man on horseback wrapped up in furs he stared at them curiously  stop please called out granbury lapham in norwegian and the traveler came to a halt when questioned he said he had heard about the strange party of six men who had come into that part of norway and he had also heard that the authorities were watching them  but where did they go to asked the englishman  that the man could not tell but said they might possibly find out at bojowak from a man named quicklabokjav  what a name cried dave  its bad enoughbut i have heard worse answered granbury lapham some of the norwegian names are such that a person speaking the english tongue cannot pronounce them correctly  they were now more anxious than ever to reach bojowak which hendrik said was a village of about sixty or seventy inhabitants the people were mostly woodchoppers working for a lumber company that had located in that territory two years before  the wind was beginning to rise again this blew the snow down from the mountain side and occasionally the landscape was all but blotted out thereby they struggled along as best they could the driver cracking his whip with the loudness of a pistol they passed around one edge of the mountain only to view with consternation a still more dangerous stretch of road ahead  dave this is getting interesting remarked roger as the horses stopped for a needed rest  i dont like the looks of that road roger there is too much snow on the upper side and too deep a hollow on the lower  right you are the senators son turned to the englishman mr lapham will you ask hendrik if he thinks it is safe to go on  when appealed to the burly sleigh driver merely shrugged his shoulders then he looked up the mountain side speculatively  he says he thinks we can get through if the wind doesnt blow too strongly said granbury lapham presently  but the wind is blowing strong enough now answered roger  and it is gradually getting worse added dave  once again they went forward but now with added caution ahead of them was a point where the firs stood in a large patch with the road cut through the center as they entered the forest the wind whistled shrilly through the tree branches  id give a good bit to be safe in that village remarked roger after listening to the wind  after we leave this patch of timber we are going to have our own troubles on the road  they looked at the sleigh driver and saw that he too was disturbed he stopped the team and gazed upward between the firs to the dull and heavy sky then he shook his head slowly  he says another storm is coming said granbury lapham it is a great pity that it cant keep off until we reach bojowak  they were in the very center of the patch of firs when the wind increased as if by magic it caught up the loose snow and sent it whirling this way and that almost blinding the travelers the horses too could not see and they stopped short refusing to go another step the driver looked around again and now his face showed that he was frightened  he says we must gain shelter of some kind said the englishman after a few hurried words had passed he thinks it will be dangerous to remain here among the trees  the shelter of the trees is better than nothing answered roger if we were in the open and this wind gracious listen to that  a sudden rush of wind swept through the forest causing the trees to sway and creak the loose snow was blown in all directions and they had to be careful that they did not get their eyes and mouths full of the stuff its almost as bad as aa blizzard panted dave and i really think it is growing worse every minute  the question is where shall we go said granbury lapham  perhaps the driver knows of some shelter suggested dave  if he does  the englishman got no further for at that moment came another rush of air it bore down upon the forest with terrific force and a second later they heard several trees go down with crashes that terrified them to the heart it was a most alarming situation and what to do to protect themselves nobody seemed to know     chapter xxii  snowbound in the mountains   if we stay here well be in danger of the falling trees cried dave he had to raise his voice to make himself heard above the fury of the elements  thats true but where are we to go questioned roger the look in his eyes showed his keen anxiety  isnt there some kind of a cliff around here under which we can stand asked granbury lapham of the sleigh driver hendrik shrugged his shoulders for a moment then suddenly tossed his head  yes i know such a spot he said in his native tongue come we will try to reach it before it is too late  amid the howling of the wind and the swirling of the snow the horses and sleigh were turned partly around and they struck off on a side trail leading up the mountain on and on they toiled a distance of perhaps five hundred feet although to the boys it seemed a mile or more the wind was so strong it fairly took their breath away and the snow all but blinded them they had to walk for it was all the double team could do to drag the turnout over the rough rocks and through the snow once dave slipped bumped against the englishman and both rolled downward a distance of several yards  excuse me panted the young american my feet went up before i was aware  dont mention it my lad was the gaspedout answer i fancy were all doing the best we can  presently through the driving snow came the sight of a high rocky wall the sleigh driver halted and warned the others to do likewise  he says there is a pocket at the base of the cliff and we must be careful that we dont fall in it said granbury lapham let us wait until he makes certain it is perfectly safe  in a few minutes hendrik having gone forward came back and led the horses closer to the rocky wall which towered over their heads a distance of a hundred feet or more toward the base the wall receded about a rod so that the overhanging portion afforded a little shelter below outside of this shelter was a drift of snow as high as their heads and the travelers had not a little trouble in getting through it  well this is certainly better than nothing remarked dave as he shook the snow from his garments so long as the wind comes from down the mountain well be safe enough  hendrik proved a practical fellow in the emergency he found a spot where some small rocks outside of the cliff set up something of a barrier in front then he unhitched the horses took the outfit from the sleigh and turned the sleigh upon its side not content with this he found some fir saplings cut them down with an axe he carried and on them spread out the laprobes by the time he had finished they had quite a shelter from the wind and cold  make a little fire now he said to the englishman but be very careful that the forest does not catch and then he explained that to allow the forest to burn in norway was a prison offence  its an outrage to burn down a forest anyway said roger it takes so long for the trees to grow again  yes and they are never so nice afterwards either added dave  with security from the storm at least for the time being everybody found himself hungry a small fire of fir branches was started and over this they made a pot of coffee and broiled a piece of the mutton brought along they had some bread with them and also some cheesecake and managed to make a square meal they took their time eating since there was nothing else to do  wonder how long well have to stay here mused the senators son  until this awful wind lets up i guess answered dave my just listen to it roar and whistle i shouldnt care to be out on the mountain top  you couldnt stand up there  hendrik brought in a large bundle of sticks and kept the fire going so that they were soon well warmed in the meantime it was growing darker and darker  well have to stay here until morning announced granbury lapham to attempt to move in this darkness would be foolhardy  there was absolutely nothing to do after that but sit down and rest and soon the dancing of the fire made dave sleepy he rolled up in a blanket and closed his eyes and presently roger followed his example  when the two boys awoke it was morning but only a faint light reached them in their sleeping place under the cliff they found granbury lapham already up the sleigh driver worn out was stretched beside the fire snoring lustily  why what has happened asked dave trying to look beyond the shelter i declare it looks as if we were snowed in  thats about the size of it returned the senators son and it looks to me as if it was still snowing  well have a time getting out on the road  it was snowing thickly so that but little could be seen beyond the improvised shelter fortunately however the wind had gone down so that it was not nearly so cold as it had been  they made themselves breakfast and then granbury lapham aroused the sleigh driver hendrik went beyond the shelter before eating and shook his head dubiously  it will be a hard road to travel he announced in norwegian to the englishman a hard road indeed  dont you think we can reach bojowak today asked granbury lapham  we can try was the noncommittal reply  they did not start until nearly noon first hendrik broke the road with the horses alone and then came back for the sleigh it took a full hour to get down to the spot where they had turned off the bojowak highway the day previous even then they broke one of the traces and had to stand around while the leather was mended the falling snow was so thick they could not see any distance ahead it clung to their fur caps and overcoats until each looked like a regular santa claus as dave declared  beyond the forest the road ran along a ridge and here they found traveling much easier so that all entered the sleigh once more and rode but at the end of the ridge they found a hollow covered even with snow  whats the trouble now questioned the englishman as hendrik pulled in his four horses  i must see how deep it is first was the reply and the norwegian jumped out and walked ahead with a long and slender pole he had brought along of a sudden he sank up to his waist then he stuck his pole down ahead of him the snow was all of seven feet deep he shook his head vigorously  we cant drive through there said dave now whats to be done  roger and granbury lapham stared around helplessly the driver came back and began an inspection of the ground to the left here was another ridge he said they might try skirting that since there seemed nothing else to do  all right anything so long as we get to bojowak cried dave  the sleigh was turned partly around and the horses tugged and labored bravely to get through the snow on the new route they went up a small rise of ground and then along a ridge that did not appear to be more than two yards wide at one point there was a sharp decline on the left  well have to be careful here cried the englishman to the driver otherwise we may all take a tumble  he had hardly spoken when a sleigh ran up on a rock on one side and plunged into a hollow on the other in a twinkling the turnout was upset dave felt himself pitched out and rolled over and over before he could stop himself then he went down and down he knew not whither his hand touched that of roger and instinctively the two chums clung to each other the snow filled their eyes ears and noses and almost smothered them they saw a little light and then suddenly all became pitchdark around them  for several seconds after they fell neither spoke for each was busy collecting his scattered senses they were side by side on their backs and the snow was still all around them dave put out an arm felt something of an opening and crawled into it  roger are you all right  ii guess so came in a spluttering voice but i must have rolled over a hunhundred times  so did i we came down on the lightning express didnt we  where are we and where is the sleigh  dont ask me were at the bottom of some place come here there is more room to breathe  the senators son followed dave into the opening the latter had found all was so dark here they could not see a thing they stood close together fearing to take another step  hello hello yelled dave when he had his breath back and roger quickly joined in the cry to their consternation there was no answer  most likely the others went down too said dave  then they ought to be near here  unless they slipped clear down to the bottom of the mountain if they did that i guess its goodbye to them  oh do you think theyve been killed dave  i dont know what to think let us call again  they did so a dozen times or more but no answer came back all around them it was as silent as a tomb  while procuring their outfit dave had invested in a pocket lantern and this he now brought forth and lit by the tiny rays he made out that they had tumbled into a hollow between several large rocks over which the snow and ice hung thickly a big bank of snow was in front of them and behind was a blacklooking space of uncertain depth  roger i must confess i dont like the look of things  dont like the look of things well i guess not dave how are we ever to get out  i dont know  but weve got to get out somehow went on the senators son desperately we cant stay here forever  not unless this place becomes our tomb  you are cheerful to say the least answered roger with a shiver  i dont intend the place shall be my tomb went on dave sturdily i am going to get out somehow let us do a little exploring  what go into that black hole behind us why we may fall into a bottomless pit  not if we are careful  i dont want to take any more chancesive taken enough  dave held the light low so that he could see where he was going and walked into the opening behind him for a couple of rods roger followed very gingerly for he did not want to be left behind the opening proved to be a cave in the mountain side and the roof and flooring were of almost solid rock walking was very rough and they could not tell how far the cave extended or in what direction  i am going to call again said roger and going back to the mouth of the cave they set up as strong a cry as before at first they fancied somebody answered them but then all became silent  nothing doing murmured the senators son and his face took on a look of deep anxiety dave he stopped short  what  nothing onlydo you really think the others were killed  let us hope not was daves grave reply     chapter xxiii  left in the dark   the thought that their two companions might possibly have been killed by the toppling over of the sleigh filled dave and roger with fresh horror and for several minutes neither of the youths spoke they listened for some sound but none came then roger heaved a deep sigh  perhaps we had better try to climb out he suggested timidly  ive thought of that roger but what if we slip when we get out why the bottom of the valley is quarter of a mile further down i dont want such a tumble on top of the one we have already experienced  if we ever get out well have plenty of news to send home was the senators sons comment  true but let us get out before we think of sending news  they talked the matter over and at length concluded to do a little more exploring of the cave dave turned up the pocket lantern as high as possible and as he did this roger took from his pocket a short strong cord i thought this might come in useful for tying up our supplies explained the senators son so i brought it from the last house we stopped at tie one end around your waist dave and i will hold fast to the other end then ill walk behind you and if you go into a hole  i may drag you behind me finished dave  no ill look out for thatonly be as careful as you can  ill take no more risks than are necessary  they moved forward slowly and cautiously first to one side of the cavern and then to the other at last they struck what appeared to be a passageway running parallel to the mountain side  let us follow this suggested dave it may bring us out somewhere on the road  roger was willing to do anything his chum suggested it was a hard journey over rocks that were sharp and slippery in some spots they found a coating of ice and above their heads long icicles hanging from the roofing roger slipped and fell and came down with such a jar that a great icicle weighing at least twenty pounds came down close to his head smashing into many pieces and scattering over both him and dave  hi look out cried dave if we got one of those on our heads  his voice echoed loudly throughout the cave and then down came two more icicles one hitting his shoulder he was thoroughly alarmed and leaped to a spot beyond literally dragging roger with him  that was a close shave murmured the senators son dave this spot is full of perils  on they went once more until dave was almost certain he saw some sort of an opening ahead of them he pointed it out and just then the tiny light of the pocket lantern began to flicker  dave the light is going out  i know it  cant you turn it up a bit  no the oil is gone was the answer after dave had shaken the lantern to make certain of that fact  what will we do if we are left in the dark  hurry i think we can reach that openingif it is an opening  they ran and as they did so the lantern flickered up for the last time and went out then dave stopped short and roger clung to him  dont stop here dave  i wontbut we must go slow or well knock our heads on a rock or on the icicles  they advanced with all the caution they could command each was filled with a nameless dread for if there was no opening ahead what should they do to go back the way they had come was next to impossible in the dark a dozen steps and both went down in a hollow roger rolling on top of his chum the spot was like a huge washbowl and all of the sides were covered with ice they tried to scramble out only to slip back over and over again  this is the limit cried roger desperately  if we oh wait he felt in his pocket  hurrah  what is it  ive got five matches im going to light one  make it last as long as possible was daves advice  the match was ignited and the boys gazed around the hollow dave found some bits of projecting rocks and pulled himself up and roger came behind the match burning itself out in the meanwhile then they pushed on until they presently came to an opening through which the snow came down  out at last murmured dave i am thankful for that  we have reached the open air but we are not out of our difficulty returned the senators son i cant see anything of the road can you  not yet but it must be somewhere in the neighborhood for we went upward in the cave  they had come out at a point where there was a small tableland which the wind of the night before had swept almost clear of snow below was the valley and above them a patch of firs  thats the forest said dave pointing upward the road runs through there i think the place where we took the tumble is over yonder  let us call to the others again  once more they raised their voices and from a distance came an answering call from granbury lapham  where is he queried roger i cant see anything through this snow  neither can i  they called again and at last made out that the englishman was above them then they said they were going to try to get to him and commenced the struggle it was a hard task and took not only their strength but also their breath they could not see the man and it was only by continual calling they finally located him  we all took a great tumble dont you know cried granbury lapham were you hurt  not enough to mention answered dave where is the sleigh driver  he tried to stop the horses i think they ran away after the sleigh turned over i wanted to help and the first thing i knew i went down too  do you know where the road is asked roger not far above us but i slipped back several times trying to get to it  now was no time to compare notes and all three started to ascend the mountain side to where they thought the road must be located as they could not get up the icy slopes they pushed on to where there was a stunted growth of pines here by clinging to one tree after another they at last reached a point where trudging through the snow became comparatively easy  i got a pretty bad scare when i came down the mountain side said granbury lapham when they stopped to rest a bear came along not more than fifty feet in front of me  a bear cried the two boys simultaneously  yes and a mighty big fellow too i can tell you  what did you do  i felt for my pistol but it was gonei must have dropped it in the snow when i tumbled at first i thought the beast would attack me but he gave one look and then jumped away in the snowand thats the last i saw or heard of him  both of the boys felt instinctively for their weapons and were glad to learn that they were safe  i dont want to see any bears observed dave all i want is to go on and join my father  and all i want to do is to find my brother answered granbury lapham i sincerely trust they are safe  we all hope for that answered the senators son  by the time they gained the mountain road it had stopped snowing so that they could see a fair distance ahead and behind dave gave a long look in advance  there is something he said i think it must be our turnout  it certainly is the sleigh said roger a minute later but it is still turned over  yes and the two front horses are gone added the englishman  as tired as they were they pressed forward with all possible speed and soon came up to the overturned sleigh with its scattered outfit some of their goods had gone down the mountain side out of sight and the rest were covered with snow the horses were nervous and on the point of dashing off so that dave had to go to their heads to quiet them  do you know what i think said the boy the front team broke loose somehow and hendrik has gone after them  well i hope he catches em and brings em back answered roger  they unhooked the team attached to the sleigh and tied them to the nearest tree some distance off then all hands got at the heavy turnout and righted it and cleaned it out this done they put in the robes and all they could find of their belongings thus an hour went by  hendrik doesnt seem to be coming back said dave perhaps those horses went a long distance and it might be as well to follow themif the single team can do it  let us try the horses that are left anyway returned roger we can let mr lapham drive while we walk ahead and make sure of the road  they hooked up with care and the englishman took the reins it was all the two animals could do to start the sleigh for the road was slightly upward for quarter of a mile but then it ran downhill and going became almost too easy  theyll be running away if we dont look out said granbury lapham after dave and roger had jumped in on the rear seat there doesnt seem to be any whoa in them  shall i drive asked dave  do you know anything about horses my knowledge is rather limited  yes i used to live on a farm when i was younger ill take the reins  dave started to step from the rear to the front seat of the sleigh as he did this the turnout reached a point in the road where the downgrade was greater than ever away went the horses taking the bits in their teeth the shock threw dave backward into rogers lap  hi hi yelled granbury lapham in quick alarm they are running away stop them whoa whoa and he tugged helplessly at the lines  the steeds paid no attention to the command to stop and the pulling on the reins did not appear to bother them in the least on and on the downgrade of the mountain road they bounded causing the sleigh to bounce from one side to the other they were certainly running away and to the occupants of the sleigh it looked as if each moment might bring a smash that would terminate fatally     chapter xxiv  the burgomaster of masolga   granbury lapham had had practically no experience with horses and in the present trying emergency he was as helpless as an infant he sawed this way and that on the reins and yelled at the top of his lungs this merely served to frighten the steeds still more and away they sprang at a greater speed than ever  well be killed gasped roger he stood up pale with fright  dont jump out cried dave maybe i can stop them  as quickly as he could he gained the front seat of the turnout and took the reins from the englishmans hands he saw at once that the horses had the bits in their teeth and that pulling on the lines would do little if any good  by this time they had gained a level stretch of road but ahead was a decline greater than that just passed if they reached that spot an accident would be inevitable  on one side of the road was the upward slope of the hill on the other the treacherous downward slope that had already caused them so much trouble dave hesitated for a moment then pulled on one side of the reins with might and main allowing the other side to drop entirely  at first the horses did not heed but presently one began to lose temper and courage and turned in toward the upward slope then the other had to come around and in a twinkling the team was literally climbing the mountain side dragging sleigh and occupants behind them  look out well all go over cried the senators son  hold tight theyre bound to stop soon they cant keep this up yelled back dave and even as he spoke the horses blowing heavily slackened up came to a walk and then stopped short  really dont you know began granbury lapham and knew not what to say  now you can get out if you wish said dave and gathered up both reins once more i guess they have had their fill of running away  you turned them up the hill nicely  it was a hard pull said roger dave are you going to get out he added as he hopped to the ground  no i am going to turn them around and drive them down to the road  theyll run away with you ejaculated the englishman in alarm  i wont give them a chance was the quiet but firm reply  if you are going to ride ill do the same said roger and clambered back to his seat again granbury lapham said he would walk for a while  i want to see how they act he remarked frankly i am not going to risk my neck again until i know what i am doing  with a firm hand dave started the horses and turned them partly around they were inclined to be fretful but he gave them no chance to gain the mastery he spoke to them in a voice they could not help but notice and was ready to turn them up the mountain side again at the first indication of another break  dave you certainly know how to manage horses spoke up roger when the road was reached it must be born in you  i suppose it is roger my uncle dunston tells me that my father is a very good horseman and that he and my mother used often to go out horseback riding together  seeing how well dave managed granbury lapham entered the sleigh once more and away they went along the road and down the decline previously mentioned to retard the movement of the turnout and thus ease the team dave kept partly in the deep snow and consequently there was no excuse for the horses running away  nearly a mile was covered when they saw hendrik returning with the other team the norwegian sleigh driver hailed their approach with joy which was considerably increased when he learned that the sleigh and the other horses had suffered no damage and that the greater part of the outfit had been saved  i was afraid somebody had fallen down the mountain side and been killed said he to granbury lapham it is a most dangerous portion of this road last winter two men and a woman lost their lives close to this very spot  we had all the trouble we wanted said dave when the drivers remarks had been translated by the englishman  hendrik looked over the sleigh and the harness with care and quarter of an hour later they were moving toward bojowak as rapidly as the state of the road permitted they had to pass through two hollows and here the men and boys walked for it was all the double team could do to get through  i see smoke cried dave presently it seems to come from a chimney  bojowak said the sleigh driver nodding his head  hurrah well soon be there cried roger he looked at his chum you wont be sorry dave  no indeed was the ready answer  they had to pass around a spur of the mountain which took another halfhour and then came in full view of bojowak a village the houses or rather cabins of which seemed to fairly cling to the side of the mountain there was but one street and most of the residences were located on the upper side of this with barns and sheds below or attached to the dwellings  their arrival was noted with considerable curiosity and the sleigh driver was plied with innumerable questions as to what had brought him thus far in such weather he quickly explained and then asked concerning the exploring expedition and granbury lapham asked a number of similar questions  the expedition left bojowak two days ago said the englishman after he had learned the news it moved on to a sheepstation called plivohav six miles from here from plivohav the party was going to try to reach the top of the mountain called thundercap  is there any kind of a good road to plivohav asked dave eagerly  no it is a very poor road  then we cant use the sleigh  no well have to go there either on foot or on horseback the explorers used horses  oh let us go on horseback urged roger i dont want to walk  i certainly prefer riding added dave  im not much in a saddle but i fancy i can stand it said granbury lapham we can take hendrik with us and as we have four steeds that will give each of us a mount  dave was desirous of going ahead at once but it was too late and the horses were so worn out it was decided to remain at bojowak over night there was something of a roadhouse used principally during the summer and at this they asked for accommodations for the whole party and also for the horses  i think i can accommodate you said the landlord a burly and rather roughlooking norwegian wait till i call my wife and see what rooms are vacant we have quite a number of guests the burgomaster of masolga is here with his brother and his wife they too came in all this storm  the landlord went out leaving the two american boys and the englishman in the public room of the roadhouse scarcely had he departed when a side door opened and a man came in evidently not in the best of humor  you dog of a landlord he cried in norwegian where are you my room is as cold as a barn i want some extra wood put on the fire at once this is a scurvy way to treat the burgomaster of masolga  hello cried dave in a low voice and plucked his chum by the sleeve here is the brute of the railway coach  sure enough murmured the senators son i never thought wed meet him up here wonder if hell say anything if he sees us  humph so hes the burgomaster of masolga eh muttered granbury lapham i pity the townfolks under him  i say do you hear landlord stormed the burgomaster striding around are you deaf that i must wear my lungs out calling you if i had ha  he stopped short for his striding around had brought him face to face with our friends he was astonished then glared at the three as if they were deadly enemies  you he cried you what brought you to this place are you following me  we are not following you answered the englishman  i thought i was done with you that i would never behold any of you again went on the burgomaster you are english cattle  and you are a norwegian pig answered granbury lapham his english blood could not stand the insult  ha this to me me the burgomaster of masolga the speaker stamped violently on the floor with his heavy boot you shall pay for that insult a pig i will show you  you started the quarrel i did not said the englishman he was a trifle alarmed over the turn affairs had taken  are you stopping here demanded the burgomaster after an ugly pause  we expect to stop here  it shall not bei will not have you in the house with me such english cattle hi you minathis to a servant who had come in call your master at once i must see him  the servant departed her wooden shoes clattering loudly on the bare floor the burgomaster of masolga paced up and down slapping his hands together  i will show you your place he muttered with a malicious look on his face wait yes wait  in a moment more the landlord came in almost out of breath  a thousand pardons he said bowing low it was stupid of jan to let the fire burn low i have ordered more wood and  let that pass for the present answered the burgomaster it is about these fellows i want to question you have they engaged rooms here  they want rooms sir and we have two that  you must not take them in roared the burgomaster of masolga i forbid it  forbid gasped the astonished landlord  yes forbid they are nothing but english cattle i met them on the train they insulted me grossly they must go elsewhere for accommodations  have you two vacant rooms demanded granbury lapham coming to the front  yes butbut  well take them answered the englishman quickly he felt certain no other accommodations could be had in the village  thank you sir but  he cannot have the roomsi will take them myself howled the burgomaster  i have already taken them answered the englishman quietly i will pay in advance for them if necessary and he pulled out his purse  it shall not be stormed the burgomaster of masolga i forbid it i will pay for the rooms if needs be those english cattle shall not sleep under the same roof with me and my family     chapter xxv  to the northward once more   whats the trouble about asked dave coming forward  that brute doesnt want us to stay here explained granbury lapham he forbids the landlord renting us rooms  are there any rooms vacant questioned roger  two  well take them cried dave he cant stop us  ive already said id take them but the burgomaster wont listen to it  the landlord has got to let us have the rooms said dave if his place is a public roadhouse we are entitled to accommodations and at the legal rate  by jove youre right how stupid of me to forget cried the englishman he turned to the landlord i demand those rooms he said in norwegian that man shall not keep us out of your place it is a public house i demand my rights  illustration out with the lot of them i will take the rooms page 229  yes yes replied the landlord but sir  ha do not listen to him voshof said the burgomaster who is more important here he or i out with the lot of them i will take the rooms and if every apartment is occupied why you cannot accommodate them can you  here is my money said granbury lapham he placed several silver thalers on the table i believe you know the law if you do not my friends and i do  the landlord was in a quandary ordinarily he would have sided with the burgomaster of masolga but there were several considerations which made him pause in the first place he did not like the burgomaster for he was very dictatorial and few things at the inn suited him and his party in the second place the foreigners usually paid liberally for what they got generous tips were not withheld and lastly and this was equally important the landlord had once refused a man a room when he was by law entitled to accommodations and he had been fined for the offense he did not want to be dragged into court again for his license might possibly be taken from him  he pays for the rooms i am helpless said the landlord taking up the thalers i will see to it that you are not molested by any one he added gravely  at this the burgomaster stormed and raved calling granbury lapham a number of hard names the englishman would not stand such insults and rushing up he caught the norwegian official by the arm  stop he cried any more such words and i will knock you down my friends and i did not come here to be insulted we are gentlemen and we expect to be treated as such landlord i look to you for protection while under your roof  there must be no quarreling here said the landlord the law does not allow it he paused for an instant i will show you gentlemen to your rooms he turned to the burgomaster of masolga your fire shall be attended to immediately  i shall remember this cried the burgomaster quivering with rage i shall remember it i shall never come here again and he stormed from the room  he is a very passionate man said the landlord when he was alone with our friends i do not care if he stays away he is poor pay and he wants too much for his money  we shall pay you well if you treat us fairly answered granbury lapham and slipped an extra thaler into the innkeepers ready hand  depend upon me to do my best sir was the quick answer and then the travelers were shown to two connecting rooms plainly but comfortably furnished one had a broad fireplace and in this a roaring fire was soon blazing that there might be no further trouble they were served with supper in a private diningroom so they saw practically nothing more of the hotheaded and unreasonable burgomaster of masolga  we have to thank you for getting through in this instance said dave warmly to granbury lapham i realize now we should have been at a tremendous disadvantage had roger and i undertaken this trip aloneneither of us being able to speak more than a few words of the language  i am glad i fell in with you was the englishmans reply twould have been mighty lonely without you dont you know  despite the adventures through which they had passed the young americans slept soundly that night and did not awaken until eight in the morning it was cold and cheerless no sun showing in the sky and there was a promise of more snow in the air  a good breakfast was procured and they settled with the landlord and tipped him in a fashion that made him bow almost to the ground  come again and welcome sirs he said and do not mind what the burgomaster said more than likely he will soon lose his position for many people are dissatisfied with him and he is exceedingly slow in settling his debts  they were soon on horseback the sleigh having been put away under one of the sheds hendrik led the way past the village and then to what was little better than a mountain trail winding in and out through several patches of firs and then across some rough rocks at the latter spot there was a good deal of ice and once rogers horse went down carrying his rider with him  are you hurt roger asked dave leaping down to his chums assistance  i dont think so was the reply of the senators son but when he arose he drew in a sharp breath he caught my left ankle and i reckon he twisted it a little  the horse was gotten up and dave assisted roger to mount it was painful to stand on the injured ankle but roger said it was all right when he was in the saddle  be careful after this said dave and they were cautious at every spot where the ice showed itself  the scenery around them was magnificent but it was such a gray day this was practically lost upon them they were going steadily upward and to the north of norway and they could feel the air growing colder only the firs stood out against the sky all else was snow and ice  this is winter weather and no mistake remarked roger i dont know that i want to go much further north  how desolate it is said dave not a sign of a house or hut anywhere its as bad as being in the far west of our country in midwinter  hark i hear bells cried granbury lapham can another sleigh be coming  they looked in the direction from whence the sound came and presently made out something moving below them on a road in the valley  i really believe it is a sled with a reindeer attached cried dave and such proved to be the case but before they could get a good look at the novel turnout sled and reindeer flashed out of sight  i shouldnt mind having a ride behind a reindeer myself said dave as they resumed their journey  nor i added his chum  at the end of three hours of hard traveling they came in sight of the sheepstation for which they were bound it was composed of a log cabin and half a dozen large sheds surrounded by a high fence nobody was in sight and they had to call several times before the caretaker of the place put in an appearance  have you a party of strangers here questioned granbury lapham  yes was the answer but they are not here just now  a scientific exploring party  yes  where have they gone  they started this morning for the top of old thundercap said the sheep raiser they will be back by tomorrow night  found at last said the englishman joyfully and translated what had been said to dave and roger  back tomorrow night murmured dave his heart began to beat rapidly i wish theyd come tonight i can hardly wait  the sheep raiser was questioned further and told them the party was made up of mr porter mr lapham and five others including a norwegian guide named bjornhof he said they had a number of scientific instruments with them and talked of gold and silver and other precious metals  maybe they are trying to locate a mine suggested roger  if they are i fancy they will be disappointed answered granbury lapham norway has been pretty well explored for minerals and the best of the mines have been located  this region doesnt look as if it had been explored very much returned dave its about as wild and primitive as could be  the sheepstation afforded but meager accommodations and they were glad that they had brought along some supplies there was to be sure plenty of mutton but who wanted to eat that all the time  i dont mind lamb said the senators son but mutton especially when it is strong is another matter  which puts me in mind of a story as shadow hamilton would say said dave with a smile a young housewife was going to have a number of her husbands friends to dinner and her husband told her to get a big leg of lamb for roasting so she went to the butcher give me a leg of lamb she said i want a very large one i think you had better give it to me from a lamb four or five years old  and that puts me in mind of another answered the senators son a country boy went to town and there saw a circus parade including two camels when he got back home he told his folks that the parade was all right but he thought it was a shame to drive around such longnecked humpbacked cows  the sheep raiser told them that all the members of the exploring party were in excellent health he said one of the men resembled dave very much and smiled broadly when told the man was the lads father when granbury lapham added that the two had not met since dave was a little fellow the sheep raiser opened his eyes wide in astonishment  tis like a fairy tale said he and then told them several fairy tales he had heard when a boy he was an uneducated man and his life was exceedingly simple and the fairy tales were consequently very wonderful to him  imagine such a man set down in the heart of new york or chicago observed roger how his eyes would open and how he would stare  if you told him of all the wonders of the big cities he wouldnt believe you answered dave i once started to tell one of those natives of the south sea islands about the brooklyn bridge and when i pointed out how long it was and said it hung in midair he shook his head and walked away and i know he thought i was either telling a lie or was crazy  the day passed slowly especially to dave who could scarcely wait for the hour to arrive when his father should come back what a meeting that would be it made the tears stand in his eyes to think about it  dear dear father he murmured to himself i know we are going to love each other very very much     chapter xxvi  days of waiting   with the coming of night a strong wind sprang up and by ten oclock it was blowing a gale the wind caused the house to rock and groan and for the travelers sound sleep was out of the question the man in charge however had experienced such a condition of affairs before and did not appear to mind it  some great winds here at times he said to granbury lapham once the top of the house was blown off and sailed away down into the valley  excuse me but i dont want to be here at such a time dont you know answered the englishman  the wind increased steadily and at midnight it was blowing so furiously that dave thought the shelter might go over he went towards the door to find a quantity of snow sifting in above the sill  hello it must be snowing again he remarked thats too bad for it will make traveling worse than ever  it was snowing and the downfall continued all night and half of the next day the wind piled it up against the house until it reached the roof burying two of the windows completely from sight  this is a regular north pole experience remarked roger as he bustled around in the morning trying to get warm i dont know that i want to go much further north  dont want to become an arctic explorer then queried granbury lapham  not much say stir up the fire or ill be frozen stiff  wood was piled on the fire and soon a pot of steaming coffee made all feel better when the man in charge went out to look at the sheep in the various folds dave went with him the air was filled with snow and it was very dark  this is terrible said dave on returning he was thinking of his father and the others of the exploring party  land of the midnight sun returned the senators son laconically  the man says theyll not return today said granbury lapham it would not be safe on the mountain trail  i thought as much answered dave well all we can do i suppose is to wait and he heaved a deep sigh  the day passed slowly for the place afforded nothing in the way of amusement and even if it had dave was too much worried about his father to be interested all went out among the sheep and saw them fed the folds were long low and narrow and the occupants huddled together just like a flock of sheep as roger remarked with a grin  what timid creatures they are said he a little later i suppose you can do almost anything with them  not with the rams answered dave and then he went on do you remember farmer cadmores ram and how we put him in job haskers room  i dont believe these animals are quite so ugly said the senators son and went up to one of the rams in question the animal backed away a few feet then of a sudden it leaped forward lowered its head and sent roger sprawling on his back  wow grunted the youth ho chase him off and he lost no time in rolling over and getting out of harms way gracious but that was a crack in the stomach all right he groaned  hes what you can call a batteringram observed dave  yes and a rambunctious one at that  dont ramble in your talk roger  if he goes on another rampage i wont ramble ill run  say this joke has too many ramifications for me let us drop it said dave and with a merry laugh both lads changed the subject  the hours dragged by slowly at noon they took their time eating a meal that all hands prepared fortunately they had with them a few canned goods which gave them something of a change in their diet  when night came again the wind arose once more but now the house was so completely buried in the snow that it was scarcely touched dave was worn out and slept soundly and the others did not awaken him until nearly nine oclock  any news was his first question on arising  nothing answered granbury lapham porter i am growing worried he added seriously  i think we have good cause to worry mr lapham it is no joke to be out on a mountain top in such weather as this  the man here tells me there are several shelters up there one built between the rocks where the wind cannot touch it but for all that i am worried  do you suppose they have enough food with them  they should know enough to go well supplied  all of that day and the next went by and still nobody appeared at the sheepstation another snowstorm was brewing and when it came the air was so filled with it that nobody could venture outside the young americans and the englishman paced the floor of the shelter impatiently but could do nothing their food was limited and the tobacco for granbury laphams pipe ran low which caused the man additional trouble  i can get along with a poor meal but i must have my smoke he said  a day later they were seated around the fire discussing the situation when roger gave a cry  well i never  whats up now asked dave  why weve gotten into a new year and nobody ever noticed it  by jove thats so answered granbury lapham well heres a happy new year to all of you  a poor beginning makes a good ending they say said dave let us hope that proves true in this instance he was sorry he had not been in a position to send new year greetings to those at home and especially to jessie  sunday passed drearily and also monday on tuesday it began to clear and the wind dropped entirely then the house was opened and they went forth and the man in charge busied himself with his sheep two of the animals had died from the cold and one had been trampled to death in the huddling together to keep warm  thank fortune the horses are all right said roger after an inspection  with the coming of comparatively good weather they watched eagerly for the return of the exploring party the sheepstation keeper pointed out to them where the mountain trails ran and told them the party must come by way of one of them for to descend in any other manner would be impossible  i really cant see how they are going to get down in such a snow was daves comment why in some places it must be ten feet deep or more  the wind has swept some places clear was granbury laphams answer as far as possible theyll stick to those cleared spots  it must be fearfully slippery said roger and if any of them takes a tumble he did not finish  the day was coming to a close when dave who was still on the watch uttered a shout  i see somebody up on yonder trail he cried one two three of them  only three queried granbury lapham  that is all so far  all ran out and looked to where dave pointed three men were coming along the trail slowly sometimes they would be in snow up to their waists and then again they could be seen crawling cautiously over the icy rocks which had been swept clear of snow  if we only had a fieldglass murmured dave he wondered if one of the men could be his father  the men were only in sight a few minutes then some projecting rocks hid them from view the man in charge of the sheepstation was questioned and he told them it would take the men on the mountain a good two hours to get down to the house as the trail wound around considerably to avoid several dangerous cliffs  let us go out to meet them said dave i cant stand this hanging around doing nothing  all right ill go with you answered his chum  granbury lapham was also anxious and in a few minutes the three started out along a road the sheepstation keeper pointed out it was now dark but they kept to the road with ease as it ran between several patches of stunted pines  no words can describe the feeling that filled daves heart was he to meet his father at last at times he trembled like a leaf just to think of it  his eyes were on the alert and after trudging along for half an hour he made out several forms approaching down the mountain trail he set up a shout and so did his companions and presently came an answering call  in a few minutes the two parties were within speaking distance dave gave each of the three newcomers a searching look and his heart sank not one of them was his father  the three men were the norwegian guide and two individuals named hausermann and davis they were almost exhausted by their journey and begged to be conducted to the sheepstation and given something to eat before telling their story  but my brotherwhat of him demanded granbury lapham  who is your brother asked samuel hausermann  philip lapham the head of this expedition  oh so you are philips brother well he is safeat least he was when we left him he hurt his knee a little slipping over some rocks but it didnt amount to much  and what of my father david porter put in dave anxiously he was with you wasnt he  yes he was with us answered samuel hausermann but he the man stopped speaking and looked at his companions  but what oh dont say something has happened to him cried dave and a sudden chill took possession of his heart  were hoping he is safe said charles davis you see he went out yesterday to look for some food it was very slippery on the rocks and the wind knocked him down and rolled him over a cliff  and then dave could hardly speak  we tried to get to him but couldnt said samuel hausermann our rope wasnt long enough then he tried to climb up the cliff but the snow seemed to blind him and he lost his grip went down and disappeared over another cliff about a hundred feet below and thats the last we saw or heard of him     chapter xxvii  dave strikes out alone   it was dismaying news and utterly downcast dave followed the others to the sheepstation and listened to the details of what the newcomers had to tell it was a long story and while they related it a good hot meal was prepared for them  we reached the top of the mountain in safety and also the plateau of the smaller mountain beyond said samuel hausermann that was the place for which we were bound shortly after that the snowstorm came on and the high winds and it was all we could do to gain one of the old shelters up there between the rocks in journeying around we lost a good portion of our outfit including some of the provisions and all we had to live on for two days was some venisonmr porter shot a small red deerand some beans and crackers we had intended to do some more exploring but the weather put a stop to everything of that sort then one of the party mr jackson took sick and we had to do what we could to get him well again at last mr porter went out to see if he couldnt bring down something in the way of game he could get only some small birds and they lasted only one meal then he went out again after an elk he had seen at a distance that was when he took the tumble over the cliffs  are you sure he wasnt killed asked dave  i am sure of nothing my lad but i think the chances are he fell in the deep snow or on some of the fir trees and that that saved his life  what time was this yesterday  about noon after that we decided to come down here and at the same time look for your father philip lapham said he would remain to look after jackson who was as yet too weak to walk we left all our provisions up there and came down here as fast as we couldand here we are  this was all samuel hausermann could tell and charles davis corroborated his statement dave shook his head sadly  even if my father wasnt killed by the tumble he took maybe he was starved or frozen to death he said to roger  hope for the best dave was all the senators son could answer  the norwegian guide bjornhof had agreed to go back to the mountain top with a load of provisions he had expected to go alone but dave said he would go also to see if he could not find what had become of his parent then granbury lapham said he would go also  maybe id better go too said roger  no roger answered dave it wouldnt be fair to ask you to do that there is too much of peril and you must remember what you promised your mother and father you stay here with mr davis and mr hausermann and so it was finally settled  all of the party were provided with knapsacks which they filled with the best provisions available the guide also carried an extra bag of stuff strapped across the back of his neck he was a brawny fellow over six feet in height and did not seem to mind the load in the least he had a gun and dave and granbury lapham each carried a pistol and a box of cartridges  good luck to you dave said the senators son on parting and he shook hands warmly remember i shall be very anxious until i hear from you again he followed his chum a short distance up the mountain trail and the two were loath to separate  the route was rocky and uncertain and during the next two hours dave realized what climbing the alps must be at certain spots they had to help one another along using a rope for that purpose once they crossed a split in the rocks several feet wide and of great depth and it made dave shudder to peer down into the dark and forbidding depths below  yet he thought very little of the perils of that arduous journey his mind was constantly on his parent would he find his father alive or had the fall over the cliffs killed his parent  god grant he is alive he said to himself over and over again  they had started directly after breakfast and by noon reached a small level spot where they took a welldeserved rest from this place the guide pointed out the cliffs from which mr porter had fallen  but you cannot reach them from here he explained in his native dialect to granbury lapham to get to them we must walk at least a mile further and even then i know of no way to reach the spot to which the poor man fell  ill reach that somehow said dave when the guides words had been translated to him  well lad you must be careful cautioned granbury lapham no use in your losing your life you know  but dave merely shook his head he was bound to find his father dead or alive no matter what the cost for the time being he could think of absolutely nothing else that and that alone possessed him heart and soul  the air was clear with little or no wind which was one comfort as they went on they had to pass around great ridges of snow and over hummocks of ice where the water had frozen while tumbling down the mountain side there were but few trees in that vicinity although a small forest grew at the foot of the cliffs  at last they reached a spot where the guide said a small and decidedly uncertain trail led to the bottom of the upper cliffthe first one over which mr porter had fallen  then that is where i am going said dave perhaps i can find out something about my father there  you had better come with us answered granbury lapham as soon as i have met my brother we can all come back to this place  no you can come back anywayill stay here now and look around replied the youth firmly  bjornhof pointed out the exact spot from which mr porter had fallen and without waiting dave trudged off and the others continued their climb up the mountain soon a point of rocks separated them and dave found himself utterly alone  had he had less to think about the boy might have felt very lonely but now his heart was filled with thoughts of his parent and he never gave the situation in which he was placed any consideration on and on he hurried twice he fell on the slippery rocks but picked himself up just as quickly in his minds eye he could see his father helpless at the bottom of the cliffs with a broken leg or a fractured rib or suffering for the want of food and warmth such thoughts were terrifying and caused him to shudder from head to foot  this must be the place  he spoke the words as he came to a spot where footprints in the snow were plainly visible he looked around eagerly and made out where his father had slipped from that cliff to the hollow below here was a long icy slide and dave did not dare to venture too close to the brink for fear of going over  that hollow must be at least a hundred feet deep reasoned the youth how am i ever to get down there  he called out but no answer came back then he walked slowly to the far end of the cliff behind and over some jagged rocks which at first seemed to completely bar the way  he heaved a long sigh then looked at the very end of the cliff here the rocks were notched and uneven and he found a spot where he could drop a distance of fifteen feet in safety but after that  if i get down there perhaps i wont be able to get backif i want to he reasoned but im going down anywayand find out what became of father he added recklessly the drop taken he found himself on a ledge several yards wide and twice as long to his delight back of the ledge was a hollow leading downward  perhaps that goes to the bottom of the cliff he mused ill try it anyway  the passageway was dangerous being covered with ice and he had to move literally an inch at a time once he slipped but caught fast to a ridge of ice just in time to save himself it made his heart leap into his throat yet he kept on he was so eager to gain the object of his quest that no peril no matter how great could have daunted him surely blood is thicker than water every time  having gained the bottom of the hollow inside of the cliff he turned to where a streak of light showed here was a narrow slit leading to the greater hollow outside of the cliff it was so small that the youth squeezed through with difficulty and had even more trouble getting his knapsack on the other side  he now stood where there was a gentle slope leading to the firs growing at the foot of the cliff here there was a great drift of snow in some spots fifteen and twenty feet high  i wonder if father came down in that he mused if he did he wouldnt be apt to break any bones but he might get smothered before he could find his way out especially if the fall took his breath away  he gazed around in the drift and saw a spot where it looked as if the snow had been disturbed then he saw what looked to be footprints further on leading among the firs  hello hello he called with all the strength of his lungs mr porter where are you  his voice echoed along the rocks and beyond and he waited with bated breath for a reply but as before none came  what should he do nextgo on or search the immense snowdrift for his fathers body  he deliberated for several minutes then moved onward  i must see if he is alive he reasoned i can always come back for his body laterif i have to  the edge of the fir forest gained dave paused once more here was a track in the snow but whether made by a human being or a wild animal he could not tell then he uttered a sharp cry and rushed forward to pick something up  it was a box that had contained rifle cartridges it was empty and practically new had his father possessed that and discarded it  suddenly he thought of something new and pulling out his pistol fired it off as a signal the last echo had hardly died out when an answering shot came back his face lit up with joy then grew sober again  perhaps the shot had come from above from granbury lapham or the others up there but no it had seemed to be further downbeyond the line of firs which confronted him at the risk of wasting too much ammunition he fired again but this time no signal came back  if it was father hell want to save his shotsespecially if his cartridge box is empty thought dave then he resolved to push on through the timber calling his parent in the meanwhile     chapter xxviii  a joyous meeting   dave had proceeded a distance of fifty yards into the patch of firs when he came to a halt a peculiar sound to his left had caught his ears he had never heard such a sound before and he wondered what it was  must have been some birdor a wild animal he murmured after he had listened for some time there ought to be many kinds of small wild animals in a place like this  he proceeded on his way again but a dozen steps further came to another halt something lay in the snow at his feet it was a fur glove he picked it up looked it over and then in his agitation dropped it  the glove was stained with blood  can that be fathers glove he thought and if it is how does it happen that it is covered with blood  a shiver ran down his backbone that was not caused by the cold and for the minute he could hardly move he tried to call once more but his throat was so dry he could scarcely make a sound again from a distance came that peculiar noise low and muttering he now recognized it as a growl but whether of a dog or a wild beast he could not determine he brought out the pistol he had placed in his pocket and held it ready for use  footprints the word came from his lips involuntarily he had reached a spot where the snow was only a few inches deep and here the footprints of a man were plainly to be seen they led through the belt of firs and then towards the jagged rocks at the base of a high cliff  again that suspicious growl reached him and now dave saw a dark object just as it disappeared around a corner of rock close to some brushwood  was that a beast or a man crawling in the snow he asked himself that sound came from an animal but the thing didnt look like a beast  he went on more cautiously than ever then he heard a sudden cry that made every nerve in his body tingle  get back there get back you brute  it was a mans voice weak and exhausted trying to keep off some wild beast then came a low growl followed by the discharge of a pistol and a few seconds later there came running toward dave a fullgrown bear growling savagely and wagging its shaggy head from side to side the youth was surprised but not taken off his guard and as the animal came closer he leveled his weapon took aim and pulled the trigger the bear had raised up on its hind legs and the bullet took it straight in the breast inflicting a bad but not a mortal wound then dave started to fire a second time but in a twinkling the bear leaped over a low rock and disappeared in the brushwood listening dave heard it lumbering away growling with rage and pain as it went  hello came a faint voice is that you lapham  no it is somebody else answered dave he could scarcely speak he was so agitated where are you  here near the cliff i am wounded and ii the voice died out completely  im coming shouted dave just let me know where you are  for a minute there was no answer and dave continued to call then came what was half call and half moan with ears on the alert the boy followed up the sounds and quickly came in sight of a man wrapped up in a fur overcoat and crouched in a heap between two rocks at the base of the cliff he held a pistol in his hand but the weapon was empty  for the instant man and boy faced each otherthe former too weak to speak and the latter too agitated to do so daves heart was beating like a triphammer and for the time being his surroundings were completely forgotten  are youare you he began are you david porter he blurted out  yes was the gaspedout reply yoyou  and you dont know me oh father  eh whats that asked the man rising up slightly  you dont know me but of course you dontif you didnt get the letters and telegrams i am your son dave porter  my son whawhat do you mean ierhave no son i had one years and years ago but mr porter was too weak to go on he sat staring at dave in bewilderment  you lost him i know he was stolen from you well i am that son i have been looking for you for months i found uncle dunston first and then we sent letters and cablegrams to you but no answer came back then i started out to hunt you upand here i am dave was on his knees and holding his fathers bloodstained hand in his own i see you are hurt ill  my son my son queried mr porter like one in a dream can this be true he gazed unsteadily at dave then he closed his eyes and went off into a dead faint the youth was startled for he saw that his parent might be dying his hand was hurt and he had scratches on his ear and one knee of his trousers was bloodstained  i must help himhe must not die thought dave and set to work with feverish haste doing all that was possible under the circumstances from his shirt he tore off the sleeves and used them as bandages then he rubbed his fathers face with snow presently the man opened his eyes and stared again at dave  did yoyou say you were mymy son he asked in a weak incredulous voice  if you are david breslow porter a twin brother to dunston porter  i am  then i am your sonthe one who was stolen from you by the nurse polly margot and her worthless husband sandy  it isis marvellous i can hardly believe it murmured mr porter  but it is trueand i can easily prove it father answered the youth in a happy tone he bent over and kissed his parent oh i am so glad i have found you  yes yes i am glad too mr porters eyes began to beam but iireally cant understand it yet imy son my little dave why it sounds like a fairy tale i must be dreaming he caught dave by the shoulder is it really really so  it is father and ill explain it all after awhile but now you are hurt and you must take it easy did you tumble over the cliff or did that bear  both dave how queer it sounds to call you dave my dave mr porter caught the boy around the neck i cant believe it yeti really cant where have you been all these years and how did you learn  ill tell you afterwards fatherwhen we are safe then you fell over the cliff  yes and while i was trying to crawl away to some spot to rest the bear got after me and scratched me in the ear i let him have a bullet in his neck and that made him retreat but then he came at me again and i dont know what i should have done if it hadnt been for your arrival the pistol is empty as you can see  you heard my shot and you signaled back didnt you  yes i signaled back and shot at the bear at the same time but that shot didnt hit him although it made him keep his distance for awhile  i see your pistol is the same size as mine so ill load them bothin case the bear comes back dave set to work immediately and soon had the work completed now you must have something to eat and to drink and then youll feel better  he unslung his knapsack and brought forth his provisions and sitting in the shelter of the cliff prepared a meal over some lighted brushwood he made a canteen of coffee of which his father partook with satisfaction and then ate a sandwich and some crackers and cheese as he supplied his parent dave told a good portion of his story although he went into few details  it is queer that i never received any of those letters and cablegrams said mr porter yet you must remember i thought your uncle was still among the south sea islands he wrote to me that he was going on a trip that might last two years or more and might not be able to write to me for some time laura your sisterhow surprised she will beand myself traveled down to rome and through spain and then came up to berlin there i fell in with hausermann and later on with philip lapham they told me of this expedition into norway and got me interested financially your sister wanted to go to the united states with some close friends and i let her go and came up here we traveled to norway somewhat in secret for we did not wish to let the object of our expedition become known on that account we had some trouble with the police who took us for political intriguers after that we left no addresses behind uswhich accounts for the nondelivery of the cablegram you sent to me from england  but what brought you up into this portion of norway father and at this time of the year  we came to locate a valuable mine or rather a series of mines in this section hausermann had some information about them but had no money and he came to me and then to philip lapham and we staked the expedition as miners call it we came up this winter because we heard that three other parties were coming up next spring and next summer and we wanted to get in ahead  and have you done that asked dave with interest  not as yet we have found some traces of copper at one point and nickel at another but not the rich deposits the information we possessed led us to believe could be located  never mind now we are together perhaps youll have better luck father ill help you dave smiled broadly tell me about yourself and about my sister laura wont you  both sat in front of the tiny campfire mr porters bandaged head resting on daves shoulder and a hand clasping that of the boy they were supremely happy and for the time being the world around them was forgotten mr porter told much about himself and of his travels and dave related how he had been raised at the poorhouse and taken care of by caspar potts and oliver wadsworth and how he had fallen in with billy dill the sailor and gone to the south sea islands and found his uncle dunston  i know your sister laura will be overjoyed to learn the news said mr porter she has often said how nice it would be if she had a sister or a brother since your mothers death we have been very lonely ah if your mother could only have seen this day and the tears stood in mr porters eyes then he drew dave to his breast and a warm embrace by both followed  they had completely forgotten their surroundings when a deep growl close at hand aroused them and caused the boy to leap to his feet he gazed into the brushwood fronting the jagged rocks and the base of the cliff and uttered a cry of alarm  what is it dave questioned his father  two bearsthe one we wounded and another and bigger one     chapter xxix  bears and wolves   at the announcement from dave mr porter tried to rise to his feet he could not stand on both legs and so had to rest against one of the rocks from this point he too could see the two bears but a moment later both animals were hidden completely by the brushwood and the snow  i am afraid they mean business said dave anxiously  they are hungry and the deep snow has made it hard for them to get food answered mr porter  i thought bears went into winter quarters in a place like this  so they do sometimes but not always besides i disturbed the wounded bear when i fell over the cliff and i presume that other beast is his mate  i wish i had a rifle i could get a better shot than with this pistol  a good doublebarreled shotgun would be a fine thing dave but well have to use what weve got dont shoot until you are certain of your aim added mr porter  a portion of his strength had come back to him and the new alarm gave him temporary vigor yet he knew that to fight off two angry bears would not be easy and he looked around for some better shelter than that which they at present possessed  here is a small opening between the rockslet us back into it if the bears press us too closely said he  he had scarcely spoken when the wounded bear advanced followed closely by its mate dave waited until the foremost beast was within a dozen paces of him then he fired there was a growl of pain and the bear tumbled back landing against its mate  good cried mr porter look out he added a second later the other one is coming  he was right the bigger bear of the two came forward with a bound landing almost at daves feet crack crack went mr porters pistol and the huge animal was hit twice in the breast and in the neck the bear uttered a sound that was half growl and half yelp and then came on again crack went daves pistol and the bullet hit the beast directly in the teeth knocking one of them down the animals throat wounded and alarmed the bear stood still and again the boy fired and then the bear turned and lumbered away into the brushwood wounded just sufficiently to make it thoroughly disagreeable the other bear followed and the battle for the time being came to an end  come dave it is dangerous to stay out here said mr porter let us go back into the hollow and bring that fire with you if you can  mr porter crawled back and the youth followed dragging the burning brushwood behind him then dave took both pistols and reloaded the empty chambers with all possible speed  i see you have learned the first rule of hunting said his father with a smile  what is that  never to carry around an empty or partly empty weapon i kept my pistol loaded up as long as i had any cartridges left  i wish i had some more brushwood to put on the firethat would keep the beasts off wonder if i cant break some of the stuff off  dont go out yet daveits dangerous pleaded mr porter  ill keep my eyes on the bears never fear was the reply  with caution the youth crawled over to the nearest patch of brushwood a distance of fifty feet as he broke off some of the dry twigs a low growl reached his ears but he kept at the task until he had as much as he thought he could carry  but dave never got the brushwood where he wanted it for as he commenced to drag it along both bears leaped from their hidingplace and one landed almost on top of him crack crack went his pistol and the weapon mr porter possessed sounded out three times each bear was wounded again but dave received a blow from a rough paw that sent him headlong he rolled over and over in the snow and then leaped for the shelter and his father dragged him to temporary safety while this was going on the bears started to retreat this time they left the brushwood entirely and stationed themselves behind the nearest belt of firs about fifty yards away  illustration dave received a blow from a rough paw that sent him headlongpage 267  i told you to be careful said mr porter as dave got up and faced about are you seriously hurt  nno bubut that bear knocked me dodown as if he was a priprizefighter gasped dave phew but they are powerful  if he hadnt been wounded he might have killed you you must take no more chances promise me you wont dave i dont want to lose you right after finding you and mr porter turned an appealing look into the lads eyes  ill be on guard father and dont you take any chances either added dave gazing at his father in a manner which spoke volumes  they found the hollow under the cliff to be less than two yards deep and of about the same width the rocks overhead hung down so that they touched daves head in front was a small snowdrift looking over which father and son could just make out the two bears as they squatted on the ground between the firs the beasts did considerable growling and did what they could to take care of their wounds yet they showed no disposition to leave that vicinity  they must be very hungry was mr porters comment otherwise they wouldnt remain here after being punished so badly and he was right the animals were wellnigh starved hence their recklessness  half an hour went by and dave and his parent remained under the cliff without a fire it was extremely cold and they had to stamp around to keep warm at times mr porter felt rather faint from his wounds but he kept this from dave as much as possible yet presently the boy noticed it  i must get you out of this soon he said you need regular medical attention  i shant mind it dave if only i can keep warm  maybe i can get that brushwood now father  no do not attempt it  there was a spell of silence after that and then dave raised his pistol  do you know what i am going to do he said i am going to discharge four shots at the bears even at this distance i ought to be able to do some damage  well you can try it dave but i dont think youll accomplish a great deal their hide is too tough  dave brushed the snow from the rocks in front of him knelt down and rested his arm with care then he took careful aim at the bear that had first appeared crack went the pistol four times in rapid succession the bear gave a leap clawed at its face several times and then with a grunt of agony turned and fled among the firs and out of sight  hurrah that did some damage cried the youth as he started to reload now ill see if i can hit the other bear hello hes gone too  the boy was right the larger beast was also lumbering off evidently frightened by the way its mate had been treated soon it too had disappeared from view mr porter and dave watched for a long time but neither animal came back  they may possibly return but i doubt it said dave anyway i dont think theyll come back right away and that will give us a chance to escape  not if we must go back through that patch of timber my son  let us try to get away by walking along the base of the cliff we are bound to strike some sort of a mountain trail sooner or later but pshaw i forgot that you cant walk well maybe i can carry you  no it will be too much of a load dave we had better wait awhile and so they sat down and waited after dave had brought in the brushwood he had previously broken off a roaring fire cheered them greatly and once more each related his experiences mr porter told how he had traveled in many parts of the world and said that dave must some day do the same he asked the youth about his education and when dave related how he had won the medal of honor at oak hall his face beamed with pleasure  i certainly owe professor potts and mr wadsworth a good deal he said and i shall not forget them you could not have fallen among better friends  i believe that answered dave warmly professor potts and all of the wadsworths have been just as good as they could be to me  almost before they knew it darkness came on dave brought in more of the brushwood and even dragged over some limbs of a fallen fir luckily he had brought along enough provisions for several meals and they proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as possible in the hollow of the cliff they ate slowly talking the while and each smiling warmly into the face of the other  it seems almost too good to be true said mr porter not once but several times  and oh i am so thankful responded dave  mr porter was so weak he needed sleep so dave told his parent to lie down on some of the brushwood which he spread out as a couch next to the rocky wall  but what will you do my son asked mr porter  ill remain on guardso those bears dont get a chance to surprise us  but arent you sleepy  noim so happy i dont think ill be able to sleep for a week  mr porter lay down and closed his eyes but it was a good hour before he dropped into a doze dave sat by the fire where he could look at his fathers face it seemed as if he would never get done gazing at those features so like his uncle dunstons  found at last he murmured found at last and thank god for it  two hours passed and still dave sat in the same position thinking of the past and speculating on the future he thought of his sister laura and wondered how soon they would meet and if she and jessie would become friends  whats that  the boy leaped to his feet and the sudden movement aroused his father both listened to a yelping and a growling at a distance the yelping grew louder and louder while the growling grew fainter  i know what it is cried dave at length some wolves have gotten on the trail of those wounded bears now there will be a battle royal  you must be right dave hark the wolves must number a dozen or more  sounds like about half a hundred to me father  the battle took place at the far end of the forest of firs and gradually grew fainter and fainter mr porter shook his head doubtfully  i dont like this dave  what arent you glad that the bears have been attacked i am  it isnt that if those wolves want more meat theyll follow up that bloody trailand it leads directly over here  phew i never thought of that ill stir up the firethat will help to keep them at a distance dave set to work with avidity piling on nearly all of the brushwood that was left he had just completed the task when he chanced to look beyond into the waste of snow he saw a pair of gleaming eyesthen another pair and still another  the wolves are coming father he cried in consternation  i see them dave and we are going to have the fight of our lives to keep them off answered mr porter     chapter xxx  home againconclusion   in a few minutes the wolves had come up and were glaring at mr porter and dave as they crouched close to the campfire there were fourteen of the beasts all large lean and hungrylooking they sniffed the air and set up yelps and mournful howls two found the spot where one of the bears had been wounded and pawed at the blood which had saturated the snow  oh for a brace of good shotguns sighed dave we could scatter them in short order  when we shoot we must make every shot tell said his father and keep the cartridges where we can get at them quickly how many left dave  the youth counted the contents of the box he carried  seventeen  hardly enough for fourteen wolves yes we must be very careful if they they are coming closer  let us fire off one pistol at a time cried dave then well always have one ready for use  mr porter did not answer for he was aiming at the nearest beast with the discharge of the pistol the wolf leaped high in the air turned and came down on its side and began to kick the snow in its death agony  a good shot exclaimed dave  you can try your luck said mr porter i will take out that empty shell and reload  the other wolves had surrounded the one that was dying and taking aim at the center of the pack dave let drive one wolf was hit in the nose and the bullet glanced off and hit another in the jaw wild yelps of pain followed and the two wolves turned and ran for cover with all possible speed  we have gotten rid of three of them said dave with much satisfaction if we keep this up well soon get rid of the rest  it is snowing again announced mr porter  he was right and soon the downfall became so heavy that they could see next to nothing beyond the circle of light made by the campfire but that the wolves were still near they knew by the yelps and snarls which occasionally reached their ears  a quarter of an hour went by and the snow came down as thickly as ever a light wind had sprung up and this sent the flakes directly into the hollow under the cliff mr porter heaved a sigh  more bad luck he observed by morning if this keeps on well be snowed in  look said dave i believe the wolves are getting ready to rush us  both strained their eyes and soon saw seven or eight of the beasts sneaking softly up through the snow the light from the campfire shone in their eyes and on their white fangs they were growing desperate and hoped by sheer force of numbers to lay their human prey low  fire three shots dave and i will do the same said mr porter in a low tone aim as carefully as you can my boy  the various shots rang out in rapid succession how much damage was done they could not tell although they saw two wolves go down and lie still the others retreated some limping and the entire pack went back to the shelter of the brushwood  they had now only a few cartridges left and these they divided between them then dave stirred up the fire a little and placed the burning sticks so they would last as long as possible father and son looked at each other and suddenly stepped closer and embraced  god grant now we have found each other that we get from this spot in safety murmured mr porter fervently  oh we must get away added dave impulsively  all we can do is to fight to the last dave  yes  both knew only too well what to expect should the wolves get the better of the contest as cruel as a wolf is a true saying they would be torn limb from limb and only their bones would be left to tell to some later traveler the story of their fate they decided with set faces and shut teeth to fight to the very last  another quarter of an hour went by and soon they heard the wolves coming back neither said a word but both looked at each other  take those on the lefti will take those on the right whispered mr porter but be carefulevery shot means so much  ill shoot my very best answered dave  after that not a word was spoken silently the beasts came closer and closer daves heart began to beat rapidly then when he could wait no longer he aimed at the nearest animal on the left and pulled the trigger  two shots one from the son and the other from the father rang out almost simultaneously and down went two wolves mortally wounded crack went daves weapon a second time and now a wolf was hit in the neck then mr porter fired sending a bullet into a breast that was presented to view with four of their number out of the fight the other wolves turned and fled into the brushwood and then toward the forest of firs  the battle had been of short duration but the excitement had been intense and dave found himself bathed in a cold perspiration from head to foot his father too was weak and now sank on the rocks breathing heavily  only one small branch of a tree remained for the fire and this dave set up so that it might burn as a torch when that was gone they would be in utter darknessand then the youth shivered as he asked himself the question he knew that wild animals love the darkness and are braver in it than in the light  hello hello hello  loud and clear from above the cliff the cry rang out a dozen times or more at first dave thought he must be dreaming then he roused up and so did his parent  what was that demanded mr porter  somebody calling i think dave ran out of the hollow and looked upward through the falling snow who calls he yelled at the top of his lungs  it is i granbury lapham and i have my brother and the others with me is that you porter  yes  have you found your father  yes  how is he came in another voicethe voice of philip lapham  he is hurt a little but not much  ill be all right if i can only get out of here called mr porter coming out so that he could look up the cliff weve been having our own troubles with two bears and a pack of wolves  we thought there must be troubleby the shots fired said granbury lapham thats why we started out in the darkness he waved a torch in the air can you see us  we can see a light answered dave he took up the branch from the fire can you see our light  yes  a long talk followed and the party above numbering four said they had brought along a good rope this they lowered and after not a little difficulty mr porter and dave were raised up to the ledge above  there come the wolves again cried the youth as he reached the ledge have you a shotgun with you  yes said philip lapham please lend it to me  the weapon was passed over and dave blazed away twice in rapid succession a wild snarling and yelping followed and then the wolves disappeared and that was the last seen of them  we are well out of that murmured mr porter and i am glad of it  and i am glad too added dave  as it was snowing heavily the party did not waste time on the edge of the cliff but moved back to a small hut built on the mountain side and which was easily located by the norwegian guide here they found the others of the exploring party and here mr porter and dave were served with a hot meal and made as comfortable as possible  the snow lasted until noon of the next day and then it grew clear and much warmer on the following day dave and his father and the guide went down the mountain to the sheepstation before they left they bade the laphams and the others goodbye and mr porter said he would leave the question of locating the mines entirely in philip laphams charge  you can draw on me for my full share of the expenses said mr porter and if nothing comes of the venture i wont complain it may be added here that later on several mines of considerable importance were located and when mr porter sold out to a syndicate that was formed he realized a profit of about fifteen thousand dollars  at the sheepstation dave found roger anxiously awaiting his return the senators son was delighted to meet mr porter and the two immediately became great friends  as the weather remained fine it was decided to start on the return to christiania without delay mr porter took granbury laphams place in the sleigh and the party took with them a good stock of provisions the journey was not without excitement for they met and killed two wolves and once they rolled down a small hill and were dumped in the snow but in the end they arrived safely at the nearest railroad station and from that point the remainder of the trip was easy  at the norwegian capital a long cablegram was sent to dunston porter by dave and his father telling of their meeting and stating that they and roger would return to the united states at once they also wanted to send a cablegram to laura but could not for they did not know her exact address  i shall have to wait until i hear from her or until we get on the other side said mr porter more than likely she is somewhere out westperhaps on mr endicotts ranch with belle endicott her friend i had the address of the ranch but i lost it while i was up in the mountains from christiania or rather the seaport dröbak they obtained passage on a swiftsailing vessel to hull and then took a train across england to liverpool they had already telegraphed ahead for staterooms on a cunard steamer bound for boston and two hours after arriving at liverpool were on board and leaving the dock  this is fast traveling remarked roger as they stood on the deck watching the shipping scene around them in less than a week well be home dave in some respects our trip to norway seems like a dream  that is true rogerbut what a happy dream and daves face fairly beamed with thankfulness  when they took the train from boston to crumville dave could scarcely control himself word had been sent ahead to the wadsworths and caspar potts and at the depot the travelers found all of their friends awaiting them mr porter was quickly introduced and shook hands warmly all around  oh dave im so glad to see you back cried jessie and to think you have really found your father at last isnt it splendid  yes jessie and if im not the happiest boy in the worldwell i ought to be thats all  and what a fine man he isand looks very much like your uncle dunston and looks like you too added the girl she lowered her voice and it trembled a little i am so happyfor your sake dave and the tears stood in her deep honest eyes  it was truly a great homecoming and daves father was told to make himself perfectly at ease by mr wadsworth  you have been more than kind to dave said mr porter you and your family and professor potts dave has told me all about it i do not know if i can ever repay you but i shall try my best and he shook hands all over again  on the very day that dave reached crumville came a letter from phil lawrence who had received word that dave was coming home in this communication phil said that matters were running smoothly at oak hall sam day and ben basswood had had some trouble with nat poole and the dude had received a welldeserved thrashing gus plum was keeping very quiet and had made a few more friends       you will be surprised to hear the news about link merwell wrote      phil i cannot tell you the start of it but it ended in a great      row between merwell and mr dale merwell is very bitter about it      and claims that i in some way got him into trouble he went home      for a vacation and before he left he shook his fist in my face and      said ill get even with you some day and ill get even with      that friend of yours dave porter too he was fearfully ugly and      acted as if he wanted to eat somebody up  humph that is cheerful news remarked roger after dave had shown him the letter dave you want to watch out for merwell  i certainly will roger dont you remember what i once said in some respects he is a worse chap than nick jasniff and a good deal worse than gus plum ever was and that dave was correct will be proved in the next volume of this series to be entitled dave porter and his classmates or for the honor of oak hall in that volume we shall meet all our friends again and also laura porter and learn how dave met the underhanded work of link merwell and what was the result  on friday evening following daves return to the wadsworth home he was surprised to receive a visit from phil ben sam and shadow they burst into the house like a cyclone and nearly hugged him to death and then shook hands all around not forgetting daves father who was quickly introduced  we simply couldnt stay away said phil we stormed doctor clays office and he let us off until monday morning  we want to hear all about your adventures in the far north added ben how you discovered the north pole and shot bears and wolves  and gave nick jasniff his setback interrupted sam and how you found your father  which puts me in mind of a story said shadow a fellow once  hold hard shadow interrupted phil dave has the floor this time your stories must wait until hes through  all right answered the storyteller of the school cheerfully id rather listen to dave anyway for i know hes got something worth telling  and then all sat down and dave told his tale just as i have related it here it took until midnight and when he had finished all said goodnight to each other and went to bed and here let us say goodnight too   the end                                       edward stratemeyers books  old glory series  cloth illustrated net 175 per volume  under dewey at
