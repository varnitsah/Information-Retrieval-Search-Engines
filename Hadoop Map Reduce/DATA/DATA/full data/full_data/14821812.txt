football  all right young gents  all in  hold fast everybody or i wont be responsible nohow if you drop off  git along jack up with ye sally  and with a crack of the whip a tooting of tin horns and it mad yelling and cheering from the students the long putnam hall stage left the football enclosure attached to the pornell academy grounds and started along the lake road for putnam hall  the stage was packed inside and out with as merry and lighthearted a crowd of boys as could be found anywhere and why should they not be merry and lighthearted seeing as they had just won a great football match by a score of 16 to 8  tom rover who was on the top of the stage actually danced a jig for joy  thats the third time we have done them up fellows he cried my but wont there be gloom around pornell academy tonight  it will be thick enough to cut with a knife  they were never in it from the start piped up sam rover  and they were all heavier than our team too he added proudly  it was science not weight that won the match said frank harrington  yes it was science broke in larry colby  and for that science we have to thank dick rover  oh but didnt that rush to the left fool them nicely  dick rovers handsome face flushed with pleasure  we won because every player did his full duty he said  if we  he broke off short  great scott what a racket on top  whos that capering around  its me thank you yelled tom with more force than good grammar  im doing an indian war dance in honor of the victory want to join in anybody  stop it youll be coming through the roof  we had only one man hurt on the field i dont want a dozen hurt on the ride home  oh its safe enough dick  if i feel the roof giving way ill jump and save myself and tom began a wilder caper than ever  but suddenly george granbury who sat nearby caught him by the foot and he came down with a thump that threatened to split the stage top from end to end  it wont do nohow pleaded peleg snuggers the general utility man attached to putnam hall military academy  them hosses is skittish and  oh stow it peleg interrupted george  you know those horses couldnt run away if they tried  you only want us to act as if we were a funeral procession coming  a wild blast of horns from below drowned out the remainder of his speech and this finished the football team and the other cadets began to sing in voices more forceful than melodious       putnam hall  putnam hall      what is wrong with putnam hall      nothing boys  nothing boys      shes all right      right right right  right  right  through the woods and far across the clear waters of cayuga lake floated the words followed by another blast from the horns and then continued cheering  and their cheering was answered by others who passed them some in carriages and others oil bicycles  it was a clear sunshiny day and nearly all of the inhabitants of cedarville as well as of other villages along the lake were out in honor of the occasion  it had been a general holiday both at putnam hall and at pornell academy and the whole neighborhood had taken advantage of it  i believe captain putnam is as proud as any of us remarked dick rover when the excitement had calmed down a bit  when tom kicked that final goal i saw him rise up and nearly pound the life out of the railing with his goldheaded cane  ill wager the cane is split into a dozen pieces  oh thats nothing put in harry blossom slyly  when tom did his little act i saw nellie laning actually throw him a kiss from the grand stand  if she  hi below there  whos taking my name in vain came from tom and suddenly his head appeared at the top of one of the openings on the side of the stage  i was just telling what nellie laning did tom  when you made that splendid kick  stow it you movingpicture camera cried tom his face growing suddenly red  you see altogether too much  do i drawled harry dryly  maybe  and then when dick made his run pretty dora stanhope just put out her arms as if she wanted to hug  whow  harry blossoms banter came to a sudden ending for as red in the face as his brother dick rover reached forward and thrust a banana he was eating into the tormenters half open mouth  harry gulped once or twice then the fruit disappeared as if by magic  all right dick i accept the bribe and will henceforth be silent he said solemnly as soon as he could speak  thats right tie up your tongue unless you want to be lifted from the stage said tom  its all right put in dave kearney another cadet  dora stanhope and the laning girls are nice folk and i dont blame anybody for being sweet on them  yes but you keep out of their cornfield or youll have all three of the rovers after you came from harry warningly  what are we going to do tonight asked dick abruptly and in such a tone that the others felt the bantering must come to an end is it feast or fireworks or both  make it both came in chorus from a dozen cadets  captain putnam is just in the humor to let us do anything tonight  and mr strongs in the same good humor  let us make the best of it  all right feast and fireworks it is said dick  but both will cost money  wholl pass around the hat  a groan went up as is generally the case when an academy boy is asked to part with some of his spending money  but the groan counted for nothing and the passing of the hat brought in over ten dollars  tensixty for this load announced the cadet who had made the collection  and there are two other loads following besides those who were on their wheels  we ought to be able to collect at least thirty dollars and that will buy out half of cedarville  if only old carrick has some of his fourth of july fireworks left said sam  chust so grinned hans muelle the german cadet who had joined the academy the season before  vot is von celebration midowit firevorks hey  he vos chust noddings  do you want another pistol explosion asked one of the others referring to an incident between tom rover and hans which had nearly ended in a tragedy  mine cracious no howled the german lad  i go me not py a hundred feet mid an old pistol again alrietty  i vould radder sit town on von can of dynamite to sleep yes i vould  and he shook his curly head earnestly  we wont have any pistols in this broke in tom who felt like shuddering every time the incident was mentioned  well just have skyrockets and roman candles and pinwheels and all of the rest of the good oldfashioned thingsthat is for the celebration on the outside  and for the celebration on the inside let us have cake icecream fruits and nuts put in larry  at this minute i feel hungry enough to eat the captain out of house and home  ditto myself came from another student  perhaps the captain will be glad enough to have us celebrateat our own expense suggested a cadet in one corner yet he did not mean what he said knowing that bluff captain putnam the owner and headmaster of putnam hall was wholesouled and generous to the core  the stage had already covered over a mile of the road and now the turnout left the lake shore and began to climb a long hill leading to the heights upon which the academy was located  but there was still a little valley to cross at the bottom of which dashed a rocky mountain torrent on its way to the placid waters beyond  at the top of the first long rise peleg snuggers stopped the team for a few minutes rest  here the view was magnificent and many a cadet stopped his idle talk to gaze at the mountains to the westward and the sparkling lake winding along in the opposite direction  it was early fall and nearly every tree was tinted with red and gold while here and there the first frosts had covered the ground with leaves and nuts  dont wait too long peleg urged tom impatiently  it will take some time to get ready for our celebration tonight you know  im hurrying as fast as i can master tom was the reply  git up jack git up sally  and once more they moved off and again some of the boys tooted their horns  at this sally picked up her ears and gave a little start to one side of the narrow road dragging her mate along  whoa  steady there cried peleg snuggers and tried to pull the team in  failing in this he grabbed the brake handle and pushed it back vigorously  he was so nervous that he gave the handle a mighty wrench and in a twinkle the brake bar snapped off close to the wheel  onward bounded the stage hitting the team in the flanks and away leaped both horses on a dead run  the brake is broke  stop the team peleg or theyll upset us sure  whoa there jack  whoa sally  dont you know enough to stop  such were some of the cries which rang out  peleg snuggers grasped the lines and pulled with might and main  but then came an awful bump and away flew the driver into a bush along the roadside and the reins fell to the horses heels scaring them worse than ever  we are in for it gasped tom  i dont see how we are going to stop them now  the bridge  the bridge across the gully screamed another cadet in terrorstricken tones  they were mending it this morning supposing they havent the new planking down  there is the bridge burst out another pointing ahead  oh heavens boys we are lost  all strained their eyes ahead to see what he meant and then every face grew pale  the bridge was torn up completely not a single plank of the flooring remained      chapter ii  something about the rover boys   the rover boys were three in number dick being the oldest tom coming next and sam the youngest  in their younger days they had resided with their parents in new york but after the death of their mother and the disappearance of their father they had gone to live with their uncle randolph rover and their aunt martha on a farm called valley brook near the village of dexter corners on the swift river  those who have read the previous volumes of this series entitled respectively the rover boys at school the rover boys on the ocean and the rover boys in the jungle know that our three heroes had already passed through many trying experiences and thrilling adventures  from home they had been sent to putnam hall a military academy of high standing and here they had made many friends including those already mentioned and several enemies among the latter being one dan baxter who was known as the school bully and john fenwick better known as mumps the bullys toady they had also made a bitter enemy of josiah crabtree the headmaster of the hall  but since those first days at the school many things had happened and many changes had occurred  it was discovered that dan baxter was the son of one arnold baxter a rascal who had years before tried to swindle the rover boys father out of some valuable mining property in the west and that the son was little better than his parent  dan had left the school in a hurry and soon after this his father had been arrested in albany for a daring office robbery and was now in jail in consequence  the disappearance of dan and josiah crabtrees yearning for wealth had led to further complications  near putnam hall resides the widow stanhope and her pretty daughter dora and crabtree who exerted a sort of hypnotic power over the widow tried to get the lady to marry him so that he might obtain the fortune she held in trust for her daughter  but how the rover boys fooled the grasping teacher and how dora was saved from the plot crabtree and dan baxter hatched up against her has already been told in the rover boys on the ocean  anderson rover had gone to africa to locate certain mines in that country and when many years passed and no word came from him the three boys grew worried and wanted to go in search of him  at last came a strange letter written by a sea captain containing some important information and acting on this the rover boys accompanied by their uncle randolph set out for the heart of the dark continent to find the longlost  on the way they fell in with one alexander pop who had formerly been a waiter at putnam hall who proved a valuable friend when it came to dealing with men of his own ebony hue  in this hunt they likewise ran across josiah crabtree who was out with an exploring party from yale and with dan baxter and both of these rascals tried to do them much harm but the schemes of the rascals fell through and crabtree only escaped after a severe whipping at the hands of dick rover while dan baxter fared little better  soon after this mr rover was found as a prisoner of a savage african tribe and rescued and then the entire party returned to the united states  alexander pop remained in the employ of the two elder rovers and the three boys returned to finish the term at putnam hall  these are a few of the things that had happened  but there were countless others which space will not permit being mentioned here there had been many contests in baseball football and other sports and jokes that seemed to have no end and there had also been a disastrous fire which none of the putnam hall cadets were likely ever to forgeta fire as thrilling as the scene now being enacted on the road  but i am afraid i have already left the boys in the runaway stage too long so we will return to them without further delay  the bridge is down the cry rang through the stage bringing every cadet to his feet on the instant  dont jump cried dick as he saw several preparing to leap you will break your necks for now the bushes were left behind and on either side of the road were jagged rocks covered here and there with withered vines  as dick spoke he pushed his way to the front of the stage and crawled out on the drivers seat  the backdrop off at the back came from frank harrington and he showed how it could be done  but the road was now rougher than ever and he landed on his knees and his face giving himself an ugly cut on the chin  dick was trying to reach the reins when tom came down beside him  can you make it asked tom  i can try was the desperate answer  if only we could block those wheels  block the wheels came from half a dozen and one boy who happened to have a stout cane with him thrust it out between several of the spokes of the wheel on the left in the rear  for an instant the stick held then it snapped and the wheel went around as before  the bridge was now less than two hundred feet away and whatever was to be accomplished must be done quickly  at last dick had the reins and he began to pull upon them with all of his strength at the same time calling upon tom to hold him to the seat  to the rightturn em to the right sang out sam as he saw a narrow opening between the rocks  yes the right added fred garrison  it is our only hope  dick did as requested and at the last instant the heavy stage swung around  there was a grinding and a splitting of wood as the front wheels met the rocks and went to pieces and then dick came down on the horses with tom on top of himand the elder rover knew no more  dicks hurt gasped sam as he scrambled out of the side window of the turnout  dont let the horses kick him  for the runaway team were struggling wildly amid the rocks and the wreck of the harness  but tom was already up and he and larry colby dragged dick to a place of safety  in the meantime some of the other cadets who were used to managing horseflesh took care of the team and led them away and tied them fast to a tree  dick dick are you badly hurt the question came from tom as he gazed anxiously into his brothers face  there was a nasty cut on the left check from which the blood was flowing  dick did not answer and tom asked somebody to run down to the stream for some water  when this was brought he and sam bathed dicks face and presently the latter opened his eyes and stared around him in bewilderment  a touchdowni claim he began and then stopped  whawhat has happened he stammered  oh i remember now  and he feel back again  he thinks hes still in the football game whispered harry blossom  oh but hes a plucky one  all of the other lads had been severely shaken up but nobody had been hurt excepting frank as before mentioned  soon he came limping up followed by peleg snuggers  i missed it by jumping he observed ruefully  hullo is dick knocked out  so ye stopped em eh cried the general utility man  it was prime plucky to do it so it was  poor dick hope he aint bad  by this time dick was opening his eyes once more and this time he kept them open  iithat was a nasty tumble wasnt it he muttered  im glad i didnt go under the horses feet  how do you feel  i guess i had the wind knocked out of me thats all he tried to get up but his legs refused to support him  ill have to keep quiet awhile  yes dont you move said sam  we cant get across the stream anyway now the bridge is down  well have to go around to the other bridge  its queer the workmen didnt put up some sort of a sign as a warning said fred garrison  i believe they can be held liable for this disaster  to be sure they can be held liable burst out peleg snuggers  but a sign wouldnt have kept the brake from breaking said tom  true lad but ye must remember that it was their duty to put the sign up at the beginning of this road which is on the top of the hill  if the sign had been there we would never have started to come down this way  perhaps we missed the sign put in another cadet  of dot is so ve besser run pack und stop udder carriages from comin dis vay broke in hans mueller quickly  listen to dot  they all listened and heard merry cries of laughter and carriage wheels rapidly approaching  a carriagewith ladies gasped sam  come on and stop them and away he dusted up the hill as well as his short legs would carry him  hans larry and several others followed  they had barely gained the top of the hill when a large carryall belonging to john laning appeared  in the carryall were the farmer and his two charming daughters and mrs stanhope who was his sisterinlaw and her daughter dora  mrs laning was also present along with several neighbors  hi whoa stop yelled sam  stop  hurrah for putnam hall cried grace laning waving a tiny flag toward sam which made the younger rover blush  glad to be able to congratulate you sam said dora stanhope where are the other members of the football team  just aheaddown by the gully  you mustnt drive down here for the bridge is down  bridge down ejaculated john laning  darwell said he was going to mend it this week but i saw no sign up at the crossroads  neither did we and we came near to going overboard  as it is we had a pretty bad smash up  indeed came from mrs stanhope in alarm  and was anybody hurt  dick was thrown out and knocked unconscious and frank harrington had his chin cut while the rest of us were pretty well shaken up peleg the driver was thrown into some brushwood and that most likely saved his life  mrs stanhope grew pale for she remembered only too well that fateful ride she had once taken with josiah crabtree which had almost cost both of them their lives  i will go to the poor boy she said and leaped to the ground followed by dora and the two laning girls  soon the carryall was led to the side of the road and the others alighted to see what damage had been done      chapter iii  the missing danger signal   when sam came back he found dick sitting on a rock with his cut plastered up from the out kit taken along to the football match frank had likewise been attended to  i am so glad you are not hurt seriously said mrs stanhope as she sat down beside dick with dora close at hand  all of you have had a very narrow escape  it is a shame that no danger signal was display said dora when they are fixing a bridge  they usually put a bar across the road with the sign danger  road closed on it  exactly put in peleg  but i haint seen no sign an that i can swear to  in that case contractor darwell will be responsible for this smash up said john laning  are the horses hurt  they are pretty well scratched up around the legs  humph  and the two front wheels of the stage are a total wreck i reckon it will take the best part of fifty dollars to fix matters up  anyway i dont calculate as how im responsible grumbled the general utility man fearing he saw trouble ahead when captain putnam should hear of the affair  a creaking on the road was heard and presently a lumber wagon hove into sight piled high with the new planking for the bridge  on the front sat darwell the contractor and two of his workmen  hullo what does all this mean cried the contractor as he brought his wagon to a standstill and viewed the wrecked stage  it means that captain putnam will have a little account to settle with you mr darwell put in harry blossom promptly  with me  what for  for this wreck  and for this cut chin added frank  and my being knocked out said dick  im not responsible for any wreck replied joel darwell  i put up the bar with the danger signal on it up at the crossroads  we didnt see no sign interrupted peleg snuggers  not a bit of a sign  there was no sign when i came along said john laning  i put the sign up not over three hours ago insisted joel darwell  i can show you just where sandy long and i dug the post holes for it  then some rascal took the sign down said tom  what for  must have done it to wreck the stage answered larry colby  but could anybody be so coldblooded  yes there are several people who would do that answered dick promptly  but i dont think they are within a hundred miles of cedarville just now  you mean dan baxter for one said sam  and josiah crabtree for another put in tom  they are both down on everybody around here  how about mumps asked larry  oh he reformed after that chase on the ocean and ive heard he is now out west said sam  theres another rascal thoughmr arnold baxter  but he is in jail in albanyhe and that tool of his buddy girk  well certainly somebody is responsible said frank  supposing we go back and try to find some clew  and find the danger sign and put it up again said joel darwell  a dozen of the boys went back and with them tom and sam leaving dick with the stanhopes  as soon as the crowd had left dora stanhope motioned the elder rover to one side  oh dick it makes me shiver to hear josiah crabtree spoken of she said in a whisper  why dora you dont mean to say that he has turned up again he questioned quickly  nobutbutlast night i heard a strange noise on our side porch as if somebody was trying the side window  i went to the door and asked to know who was there  at once i heard somebody or some animal leave the porch and climb over the side fence of the garden  i am almost certain it was some person trying to get into the house  did you tell your mother  no she had one of her nervous headaches and i thought it would do no good  but i couldnt sleep all night and i laid with a big stick in one hand and papas old revolver in the other  the revolver wasnt loaded but i thought i might scare somebody with it  the revolver ought to be loaded dora  do you know what caliber it is  no you know i know little or nothing about firearms  then ill find out for you and get some cartridges  if josiah crabtree is around you ought to shoot him on the spot  oh i couldnt do thateven though i do know how dreadfully he treated you while you were in the heart of africa  you must be very careful of your movements especially after dark crabtree may be around with some new scheme against you or your mother  i wish he could have been left behind in africa  oh so do i but he and dan baxter both came back to america didnt they  so we heard in boma  but dont get worked up too much dora for it might have been only a cator a common tramp looking for something to eat  we have had lots of tramps around the hall lately  i have asked grace laning to pay us a visit and she is coming over tomorrow  then you will have somebody in the house besides your mother and yourself  i wish i could stay with you folks  how long are you going to remain at the hall dick  when you came back you said something about going out west with your father to look up that mining claim in colorado  we shant start for the west until next spring  father was going right away at first but after he found out that arnold baxter was safe in jail and couldnt bother him any more he concluded to remain with uncle randolph and aunt martha until next spring so as to give himself the chance to get back his oldtime strength  his sufferings in africa pulled him down a good bit  i suppose  well i am glad you will be around during the winter next summer mamma has promised to go with me on a trip to buffalo and then around the great lakes  i trust the lake air will do her much good and that we wont hear or see anything of mr crabtree while we are on the water  id like to go with you on that trip answered dick  i have no doubt you will have a grand time  little did he dream of all the perils that trip was to lead to and of how he and his brothers would be mixed up in them  in the meantime the others had journeyed up the hill to where the road branched off in three directions  at this point joel darwell pointed out two newlymade holes in the earth about fifteen feet apart  see them he cried  well that is where i placed the danger sign and i am willing to swear to it  and so am i added the workman who was along  well there is no danger signal here now returned tom glancing around  some bushes torn up beside the road attracted his attention and he hurried toward them  here you are  he pointed to a cleared spot behind the bushes and there on the ground lay the tornup posts and boards  evidently somebody had dragged them thither in great haste  its the work of some thorough rascal cried sam  somebody who meant mischief to our stage  maype dis vos der vork of dem pornell academy fellers suggested hans  no they are gentlemen not scoundrels replied tom  they may feel cut up but they wouldnt play such a dastardly trick as this  the spot was one commanding a good view of the back road so that anybody standing there could have seen the stage coming while it was still a quarter of a mile off  all hands began a search for some clew leading to the identity of the evildoersthat is all but joel darwell and his helper these two dragged the posts and boards into position again and this time set them down so firmly that a removal would be out of the question without tools  hullo heres something cried one of the cadets presently  did you just drop this tom  as he spoke he held up a round flat coin of coppery metal engraved with several circles and a rude head  no i didnt drop it replied tom his face growing serious did you sam  sam gave a look placed his hand in his pocket and brought out a similar piece  no there is mine he said  where in the world did that come from  then tom and sam looked at each other  the same idea crossed the mind of each  the coin was similar to those they had handled while on their way through africa  they had brought home several as pocketpieces  ill wager dan baxter dropped that cried tom  he or  josiah crabtree finished sam  yes i am sure of it for dick brought none to putnam hall i heard him tell the captain so when they were talking about coins one day  then in that case either baxter or crabtree is responsible for this smashup came from one of the other cadets  right you are  the question is which one  perhaps both vos guilty suggested the german student  that may be true hans came from tom  i wonder if one or the other of the rascals is in hiding around here  well begin a search said sam  hans go and call the others and at once the german cadet started off on his errand      chapter iv  a trail is found and lost   by this time several carriages had come up also a number of folks on bicycles and on foot and to all of these the situation had to be explained  among the last to put in an appearance was captain putnam and he was at once all attention and desired to know how seriously dick and frank were injured  it was an outrageous piece of work he said  still to be fair we must admit that the broken brake is largely responsible for what happened after the start down hill was made  but i couldnt help the brake breaking pleaded the general utility man  i did my best and was thrown out  i am not finding fault with you snugger cut in the captain shortly  let it pass and leave the stage to be taken care of by the cedarville blacksmith  but i wish we might lay hands on the rascal who is responsible for the start of the mishap  they have found a coin such as we used when as we were in africa said dick  i think that furnishes a clew  in what way rover  those coins were also used by dan baxter and josiah crabtree  and you think one or the other or both are in this neighborhood again  it looks plausible doesnt it  yes butit would be very strange  i should think they would give this locality a wide berth  hardly  josiah crabtree isnt done with the stanhopes to my mind and baxter will get square with us if he can  while this talk was going on sam and tom were following some footprints leading from the clearing where the signal board had been found down a small path toward the lake  the footprints were clearly defined  the prints are not very large observed tom as he and his brother measured them  it looks to me as if dan baxters feet might have made them  certainly they werent made by old crabtree said sam  he had a very long foot and always wore squaretoed boots  they followed the prints down to the lake shore and then along the rim of the lake for nearly half a mile  here there was a little cove and under some bushes they discovered some marks in the wet dirt of the bank as if a rowboat had been moored there  in this dirt the footprints came to an end  thats the windup of this trail sighed tom  water leaves no trail  thats so  but supposing we skirt the lake some more  they went on and did not give up until the declining sun told them the day was done  when they reached the hall they found that all of the others had come in and that preparations were already going forward for the feast in the evening  for once captain putnam and george strong his main assistant were going to allow the cadets to have their own way  secretly the captain was tremendously pleased over the showing his pupils had made on the football field for this happened to be a year when college athletics were in the ascendancy in all of the states  but the regular evening drill must not be neglected and soon the sound of the drum was heard calling the members of companies a and b to the parade ground  a rush was made for uniforms swords and guns and soon the boys come pouring forth dick as a captain and his two brothers as under officers  attention shouted the major of the command  forward march  boom boom boom boom boom went the drums and then the fifers struck up a lively tune and around the academy marched the two companies at company front  then they went around again by column of fours and then marched into the messroom where they stacked arms and sat down at the long mess tables  the movements were patterned after those at west point and could not have been improved upon  well what of the hunt asked dick as soon as he got the chance to talk to tom  we followed it to the lake and then lost the trail answered his brother  but i am convinced that the rascal was dan baxter  i believe you are right tom answered dick and related what dora stanhope had told him  of course tom listened with keen interest  we made a mistake in letting old crabtree and baxter go when we had them in africa  we should have handed them over to the authorities  i am not worried about baxter so much went on dick  but i hate to think of crabtree being around to molest the stanhopes  and especially dora grinned tom  right you are tom and i am not ashamed to admit it to you  but please dontdont well make fun of it to me any more  i wont dick  tom gave his brothers hand a squeeze under the table  dora is all right and if some day i get her for a sisterinlaw i wont complain a bit this plain talk made dicks face flush but he felt tremendously pleased nevertheless and loved tom more than ever  directly after supper the boys were given until eleven oclock to do as they pleased  at once some old barrels were piled high at one end of the campus smeared with tar stuffed with wood and set on fire and the blaze mounting to the sky lit up the neighborhood to the lake on one side and the mountains on the other  four cadets had gone down to cedarville to buy the fireworks and the things to eat and by nine oclock these returned loaded down with their purchases  among the crowd was larry colby who sought out dick as soon as he arrived  ive got news he exclaimed  whom do you suppose i saw down in cedarville  josiah crabtree  you are certain larry  yes  where did you meet him  down at the restaurant where he went for some ice cream  he was just paying for a lunch he had had when i came in  did you speak to him  no i wanted to do so but as soon as he saw our crowd coming in he dusted out of a side door  was he alone  yes  humph dicks brow clouded  he was inclined to think that dora had been right concerning the noise she had heard on the side porch  you havent any idea where he went  no i wanted to follow him but it was dark on the street and he slipped me  this was all larry had to tell and he hurried to arrange the fireworks  the celebration was a grand success and lasted until almost midnight  the boys had brought along a lot of roman candles and skyrockets and these they set off from the top of one of the tallest trees on the grounds  so that the pornell fellows can see them said sam  i know they will enjoy the show and then he closed one eye suggestively  the pornell players had chaffed him on account of his size and now that the victory was won he did not mean to let them forget their defeat too quickly  at about ten oclock dick went to captain putnam and asked permission to leave the grounds for an hour or two  where do you wish to go asked the captain  to mrs stanhopes sir and he related what dora had told him and of what news larry colby had brought  i am afraid you may get into trouble rover said the captain seriously  i will be very careful sir  i am not afraid of mr crabtree should he turn up  i dont believe you are afraid of anyone said the master with a smile for he admired dicks courage  then you will let me go  wouldnt you rather have somebody with you  i wouldnt mind having tom along  i meant some grown personlike for instance mr strong  no sir  well then take tom  but mind and be careful and dont stay too late if everything is right down there  having received this permission dick hurried to tom  soon the two brothers were on the way tom eating some cake and peanuts as they hurried along  the latter hated to miss the feast but did not wish to see his brother under take the mission alone  it was a clear night and although there was no moon the stars twinkled overhead like so many diamonds  both knew the short cut to mrs stanhopes cottage well and made rapid progress  shall you ring the bell if everything appears to be right asked tom as they came in sight of the modest dwelling set in the widows wellkept garden  i guess not tom  its so late  both mrs stanhope and dora have probably gone to bed  they had almost reached the gate to the garden when dick caught his brother by the sleeve and drew him back into the shadow of a large maple tree  what is it dick  i think i saw somebody moving around the corner of the house just now  both boys strained their eyes but could see nothing that resembled a human form  i dont see a thing dick  come well move around to the outside of the garden returned the older brother  the flower garden was not large and was separated from the vegetable laths  as they made their way along this both caught the sound of a window sliding up  hark  did you hear that whispered dick excitedly  i did  it came from the back of the house  somebody must be trying to get into the kitchen window  dick broke into a run with tom at his heels  entering the garden by a rear gate they soon reached the vicinity of the kitchen  a window stood wide open and through this they beheld somebody inside the apartment with a blazing match in his hand trying to light a candle  hi there who are you cried tom before dick could stop him  at the sound of the call the man in the kitchen jumped as though stung by a bee  then he wheeled around with the lighted candle in his hand and both boys saw that it was josiah crabtree      chapter v  a struggle in the dark   crabtree you rascal ejaculated dick  whowho is that spluttered the former teacher of putnam hall in dismay  it is idick rover  what are you doing here  ii came to call upon the widow stanhope stammered josiah crabtree  he was so astonished he knew not what to say  you came to rob her more likely sneered tom  you just broke in at the window  no noitit is all a mistake rover  ii am stopping here for the night  indeed gasped dick almost struck dumb over the mans show of nerve as he afterward expressed it  yes i am stopping here  with mrs stanhopes permission of course  certainly  how could i stop here otherwise  what are you doing in the kitchen all alone  why ieri was up in my room but ierwanted a glass of water and so came down for it  then mrs stanhope and dora have gone to bed  yes they just retired  have you become friends again asked dick just to learn what josiah crabtree might say  yes rover mrs stanhope is once more my best friend  then she doesnt know what a rascal you were out in africa  my dear richard you are laboring under a great delusion  i was never in africa in my life  what roared dick aghast at the mans audacity  i speak the truth  i have made an investigation and have learned that somebody went to africa under my name just to take advantage of myahemof my exalted rank as a professor  great scott how you can draw the long bow murmured tom  i speak the plain truth  i can prove that for the past six months i have been in chicago and other portions of the west  well if you are a guest here just stay with tom while i call the stanhopes said dick and leaped in at the window  boy you shall do nothing of the kind cried josiah crabtree his manner changing instantly  why not  if you are friends it will do no harm  mrs stanhope iseris not feeling well and i will not have her disturbed by a headstrong youth like you  well see about that  if you  dick broke off short for just then a voice he knew well floated down into the kitchen from upstairs  who is talking down there  is that you dick  it was dora speaking in a voice full of excitement  yes dora it is iand tom  we have caught josiah crabtree here in your kitchen  oh  the girl gave a little scream  what a villain  can you hold him  we can try answered dick  he turned to crabtree  i reckon your game is up old man  let me go growled the former teacher fiercely and as dick advanced upon him he thrust the lighted candle full into the youths face  of course dick had to fall back not wishing to be burnt and a second later the candle went out leaving the room in total darkness  but now tom sprang forward bearing crabtree to the floor  over and over rolled the pair upsetting first a chair and then a small table  at the sound of the row dora stanhope began to scream fearing one of her friends might be killed and presently mrs stanhope joined in  but the cottage was situated too far away for any outsiders to hear so the boys had to fight the battle alone  at length josiah crabtree pulled himself clear of toms hold and made for the open window  but now dick had recovered and he hurled the man backward  the movement kept crabtree in the room but it was disastrous to tom for as the former teacher fell back his heel was planted on toms forehead and for the time being the younger rover lay stunned and unable to continue the contest  finding himself unable to escape by the window josiah crabtree felt his way to the door and ran out into the hall  because of his former visits to the house he knew the ground plan well and from the hall he darted into the parlor and then into the sitting room  dick tried to catch him and once caught his arm  but crabtree broke loose and placed a large center table between them   dont dare to stop me rover hissed the man desperately  if you do you will be sorry  i am armed  so am i armed josiah crabtree  and i call upon you to surrender  what you would shoot me cried the former teacher in terror  why not  didnt you try to take my life in africa  i repeat you are mistaken  i am not mistaken and can prove my assertion by half a dozen persons  i have not been near africa  i wont argue the point with you  do you surrender or not  yes i will surrender replied josiah crabtree meekly  yet he did not mean what he said and as dick came closer he gave the lad a violent shove backward which made the elder rover boy sit down in an easy chair rather suddenly  then he darted into a small conservatory attached to the sitting room  stop panted dick catching his breath  tom he is running away  crash jingle jingle jingle  josiah crabtree had tried the door to the conservatory and finding it locked and the key gone had smashed out some of the glass and leaped through the opening thus afforded  by this time dora was coming downstairs clad in a wrapper and carrying a lamp in her hand  the first person she met was tom who staggered into the hall with his hand to his bruised forehead  oh tom are you hurt she shrieked  not much he answered  but dickdick where are you  here in the conservatory  crabtree just jumped through the glass  dora ran into the little apartment which mrs stanhope had just begun to fill with flowers for the coming winter  tom came behind her carrying a poker he had picked up  is he out of sight asked tom  yes confound the luck replied his brother  which way did he go  i dont know  we ought to follow him  we will  dick turned to dora  after we are gone you had better lock up better than ever and remain on guard until morning  i will dick she answered  the key to the conservatory door was hanging on a nearby nail and taking it down they unlocked the door and the two boys passed into the darkness of the night outside  please take care of yourselves cried dora after them and then turned to quiet her mother who had come downstairs in a state of excitement bordering on hysteria for as old readers know mrs stanhopes constitution was a delicate one  running into the garden dick made out a dim form in the distance on the path leading to the lake  there he is he cried  come tom we must catch him if we can  i am with you answered tom  but take care what you do  he may be in a desperate frame of mind  he is desperate  but i am not afraid of him returned the elder rover with determination  josiah crabtree was running with all the speed of his long legs and the two lads soon found that they had all they could do to keep him in sight  stop yelled tom at the top of his voice but to this command the former teacher paid no attention  if anything he ran the faster  he is bound for the lake said dick  he must have a boat  but dick was mistaken for just before the water came into view josiah crabtree branched off onto the road leading into cedarville then of a sudden the shadows of a patch of woods hid him from view  hes gone came from tom as he slackened his speed  he didnt turn down to the lake  thats so  he must have gone toward cedarville  the rover boys came to a halt and looked about them searchingly on one side of the road lay a tilled field on the other were rocks and trees and bushes  they listened intently but only the occasional cry of a night bird broke the stillness  we are stumped groaned dick dismally  what you arent going to give up the hunt already are you demanded tom  no but where did he go  perhaps he went back to the house  i dont believe he would dare to do that  besides what would he go for  what made him go in the first place  i am sure i dont know  perhaps he was going to abduct doraor mrs stanhope  if he was going to do that alone he would have had his hands full  the two boys advanced but with great caution  they peered into the woods and behind some of the larger rocks but discovered nothing  that is the second time we have lost our game today remarked tom soberly  first it was dan baxter or somebody else and now it is josiah crabtree  it must have been baxter who tried to wreck the stage  he and old crabtree always did hang together  if they are stopping anywhere in cedarville we ought to put the police on their track  ill do that sure  we can easily hold both on half a dozen chargesif we can catch them      chapter vi  an interesting letter   but to catch josiah crabtree was not easy  the former teacher of putnam hall was thoroughly alarmed and once having taken to the woods he plunged in deeper and deeper until to find him would have been almost an impossibility  indeed he completely lost himself and when the boys had left the vicinity he found himself unable to locate the road again and so had to remain in the cold and damp woods all night much to his discomfort  he could not keep warm and sat chattering on a rock until daylight  finding it of no use to continue the search dick and tom retraced their steps to the stanhope homestead  they found dora on guard with every window and door either locked or nailed up  the girl had persuaded her feeble mother to lie down again but mrs stanhope was still too excited to rest comfortably  did you catch him dora asked anxiously after she had admitted them  no he got away in the darkness answered dick  it is too bad  what do you suppose he was up to  that is what we would like to find out dora  certainly he was up to no good  perhaps he wished to rob us  he must know that you do not keep much money in the house  day before yesterday mother had me draw four hundred dollars out of the bank to pay for the new barn we have had built  the carpenter however went to ithaca on business so as yet we have not been able to pay him the money  it was a mistake to keep so much cash in the house  you should have paid by checkits the same thing put in tom  i know it but mr gradley is peculiar  he once had some trouble over a check and he stipulated that he should be paid in cash  do you suppose josiah crabtree saw you draw the money from the bank remarked dick thoughtfully  i dont know what to think  he would be just rascal enough to try to get it if he knew of it i guess we had better remain here until morning and after that you had better have a man around the house  yes mother says she will hire a man  but men are difficult to getthat is one who is reliable  we had to discharge borgy on account of drunkenness  perhaps father will let alexander pop come up here for a while cried dick struck with the idea  i dont believe he needs the man at home and aleck is thoroughly reliable even if he is colored  yes i know pop well  i would like to have him firstrate  but it is asking a good deal at your hands dick  as if i wouldnt do a good deal more than that dora he cried quickly and caught her hand  i know you wouldyou have already  you are the best friend i have dickyou and your brothers  and i always will be dora always he whispered and pressed her hand so tightly that she blushed like a peony  tom had passed into the kitchen and was looking around to see what damage his struggle with crabtree had done  nothing was injured under the kitchen table lay a letter and a small vial  he picked up both  chloroform he cried as he smelt of the contents of the vial just as the others came in  where did you get that asked dora  found it under the table along with this letter  crabtree must have dropped both  let me see the letter cried dick  tom passed it over and all three read the communication with interest  it had been sent to josiah crabtree while the latter had been stopping in new york and was postmarked albany  its from dan baxter said dick  the letter ran as follows    dear mr crabtree    i drop you a few lines as promised  i have seen my father and his   plans are about completed  the rovers think they have the upper   hand but when he gets out of jail he will be able to show them a   thing or two and surprise them  if you go to cedarville i will   meet you there on the 5th of next monthat the old meeting place   we wont have mumps the turncoat to bother us and maybe we can   lay plans for a fat deal all around  anyway we ought to square   accounts with those rover boys  they treated both of us   outrageously and they ought to suffer for it    yours as faithfully as ever    db  wont crabtree be mad when he finds out that he lost this grinned tom  he may not know that he dropped it here  well it clears up one point  baxter and he are both around and intent on mischief  true enough  what shall you do next put in dora anxiously  i hardly know  forwarned is forearmed they say but baxter and crabtree are such underhanded rascals one never knows what to expect of them next  of course you will tell the cedarville policeor i shall  ill do that  but you know what they did before  never helped us a bit but let both slip through their fingers  perhaps they will be on their mettle now  the situation was talked over for half an hour and then it was decided that tom should return to putnam hall to explain to captain putnam and to sam while dick should remain with the stanhopes  this agreed upon tom took his departure immediately as it was now midnight and he did not wish to be locked out for the night  and now you had better return to bed dora said dick after his brother had departed  i will remain downstairs on the sofa and i dont believe anybody will disturb me  all right if you wish it that way replied the girl  but you can have one of the bedrooms if you wish  no ill stay here and keep my clothes on  dora went upstairs but soon came back carrying a pillow and a quilt  there that will provide a little comfort she said but then as dick caught her hand as if to kiss it she gave a merry little laugh and ran upstairs again  it was a long while before dick could go to sleep  he had read the letter found in the kitchen with care and he wondered what it all meant  what plans can arnold baxter be completing he asked himself and how can he surprise father  can that refer to the missing mine in colorado  he talks as if he was going to get out of jail pretty soon but that cant be for the judge will certainly give him three or four years at the least  perhaps i had better write to father about this  no other person came that night to disturb the inmates of the cottage and when at last dick did fall into slumber he did not awaken until the sun was shining in the window and a neighboring irish woman who did mrs stanhopes washing and ironing was knocking on the kitchen door for entrance  goodmorning mrs otoole he said as he leaped up and let her in  goodmarnin young sir stammered the washerwoman  sure an i didnt ixpict to see you here  i suppose not  but come in and i will call miss dora  no need to call me if you please came in a silvery voice from the hall and dora appeared as bright and fresh as ever  i would have been down before only i had to wait on mamma  and how is she  she is no worse but neither is she better  i shall send for our doctor today  breakfast was soon on the tablefresh coffee fresh eggs and dainty buckwheat cakes baked by doras own hands  it is needless to say that dick enjoyed the repast  youll make a famous housekeeper for somebody some day dora he said looking at her pointedly  you go and eat your cakes before they get cold she answered  ive already eaten my fill i cant go another one  ive enjoyed them ever so much  now i guess i had better be off for cedarville  if you wish you can hitch up dolly to the carriage and drive over  it will be nicer than walking  supposing i go over on horseback  is she used to a saddle  oh yes and you will find a gentlemans saddle in the harness closet back of the stalls  then ill go that way  goodby  ill be back before noon unless something unusual turns up  and when i am down in cedarville ill send word to father about aleck  leaving the house dick went to the barn which was usually locked dora had given him the key but to his surprise he found the padlock pried off and the door partly open  can this be more of crabtrees work he asked himself  perhaps he has stolen the mare  what fools we were not to look in here last night  but dicks fears were groundless  the mare was still there  but she was all saddled ready for him to ride  crabtrees work beyond a doubt he thought  before he went to the house he came here and it was his intention to steal the mare and get away on her      chapter vii  a hunt through the woods   before starting for cedarville dick acquainted dora with the discovery he had made  we were fortunate said the girl  i would not lose dolly for a good deal  if there was one thing dick loved it was a good horse and once on dollys back he urged the little mare along at top speed  she was in prime fettle and flew along the hard road as if she thoroughly enjoyed the outing  arriving at cedarville dick sought out the little police station for the town had at last taken on a force consisting of a chief and eight men  the chief a little fat man by the name of burger sat in his office reading the cedarville trumpet the weekly journal of the place  want to see me on business eh he said laying down the sheet all right young man sit down  what name  richard rover  i am one of the cadets at putnam hall  just so  trouble at the hall i presume  anything connected with that celebration last night  no sir i  another robbery then  captain putnam seems to have his hands full  weve had no robbery at the hall sir  i came  no robbery eh  then perhaps its a fight  students will fight when they get celebrating  i know we had a fight once at the academy i attended and it lasted three days  i hope they called out the fire department answered dick with a grin  the fire departmentha ha a good joke  no they called in the doctor ha ha  so its a fight eh  does the captain want us to arrest anybody  its not a fight  what but you said  the fat chief paused  i said i wanted to see you about business  just soand that you were from putnam hall and captain putnam had sent you  no no  please give me a chance to talk  why of course  i never interrupt anybody  go on but dont take too much time for my time is limited  i came from mrs stanhopes cottage man broke in there last night  ha a burglary  why didnt they let us know at once  or perhaps you have collared the villain already  no we havent got him although my brother and i tried to catch him  pooh  two boys and tried to catch a burglar  of course he got away  dick felt disgusted and arose to make his departure  if you wont listen to what i have to report ill take myself off he said half angrily  at this chief burger stared at him in astonishment  really you are a remarkable boy he gasped  aint i listening to everything you are saying  hardly  i wish to tell you everything from the beginning  just so  go on i shant say a word  what a remarkable boy  but it must be the military training that does it  as well as possible dick told all that had happened during the night  chief burger interrupted him a score of times but at last the tale was finished  at the conclusion the chief closed one eye suggestively  and dont you know where this josiah crabtree is now he asked  if i did id go after him hotfooted returned dick  he must be in hiding in the woods near the cottage  perhaps but he had eight hours in which to get away  just so  i will send out an alarm to all of my force and then detective trigger and i will make a personal hunt for the rascal  when you hunt for him you had better hunt for dan baxter too said dick and he told of the happening on the stage ride  i will keep an eye open for baxter too said the chief  from the police station dick rode to the post office and here wrote and mailed a long letter to his father relating what had happened and repeating the wording of the letter that had been found  he requested that alexander pop be sent up without delay  there was nothing to keep dick in cedarville any longer and he prepared to return to the stanhope cottage with the mare  but before going he entered the leading drug store and here purchased a box of choice chocolates for dora for he fortunately had his spending money with him or at least the balance left over from the football celebration  when dick reached the cottage he found both the washwoman and the carpenter at work one in the washhouse and the other finishing up the new barn  the money taken from the bank had been turned over to mr gradley so mrs stanhope no longer had this to worry her  feeling that he could do little at school for the balance of that day dick resolved to hunt through the woods for some trace of josiah crabtree and went off shortly after giving dora the chocolates over which the girl was greatly pleased  he followed the road in the direction of the lake at first and was about to plunge into the brushwood when a distant voice hailed him  hullo dick stop  i want to see you  it was sam calling and soon his youngest brother came up on a run  sam what brings you he asked for it was easy to see that something out of the ordinary had occurred  i want to know where tom is panted sam  tom dicks face grew pale all in an instant  didnt he return to putnam hall last night  no and nobody around there has seen him since he went off with you  i thought he was with you until dora just told me that he started to return about midnight  he did  and he didnt return  what can it mean  whats the trouble here  sam was given the particulars and uttered a long low whistle  that looks black doesnt it  it does sam  i dont like it for a cent  do you suppose he fell in with crabtree  perhapsor with somebody just as bad  perhaps he spotted crabtree and started to follow him  i shouldnt think he would follow him all this time without letting somebody know  for several minutes the two brothers discussed this new turn of affairs  both were greatly troubled and dick did not know whether to continue his hunt or not  i wouldnt care if only i knew he was all right he said  thats just it  tom is able to stand up for himself in an even fight but if crabtree played him some trick  let us hunt for him interrupted the elder rover  there is no use of our sitting down and sucking our thumbs  they went along the road until the spot was gained where josiah crabtree had been last seen  then they began a systematic search until sam discovered what he said were fresh footprints leading directly into the woods  at one point one of the prints was very plain and they saw that it was made by a long shoe squaretoed  i reckon you have struck it sam said dick after an inspection now if only we can stick to the trail to the end  fortunately the ground was so damp that the trail could be followed with ease  an hours walking brought them to the rock where the former teacher had spent the larger part of the night  he made a stop here thats certain observed dick as they surveyed the crisscross tracks  like as not he got mixed up in the dark dick  it must have been awfully black here under the trees  presently they discovered another trail leading up a hill  beyond was a tall tree which josiah crabtree had climbed in order to obtain a better view of the surroundings  from the tree the trail led directly toward the lake  were on his track all right enough observed sam  but if he took to the water well lose it just as we lost baxters trail yesterday  the trail crossed the main road and came out at the lake where there was a slight bluff covered with a heavy growth of underbrush to their right was an old building which in years gone by had been a dwelling  there is a fire over yonder observed dick as he pointed past the building  somebody seems to be burning a lot of wet brush see the heavy smoke  perhaps the folks at the fire can tell us something of crabtree answered sam  let us go over and interview them  his brother was willing and as well as they were able they pushed their way through the brush toward the fire  the latter burned fiercely and presently the two boys detected the odor of tar  then they reached a point where they could overlook what was going on around the fire for the blaze was located in something of a gully of the cliff  merciful heaven burst from dicks lips and he stood spellbound sam also gave a look and the sight that both boys saw nearly froze the blood in their veins       chapter viii  what became of tom   to go back to tom at the time when he left dick and the stanhopes and started to return to putnam hall  he went away whistling gayly for he thought that all danger was over  what a shame i had to miss the celebration he murmured  and after my success on the football field too  soon the stanhope grounds were left behind and he struck the main road leading to the academy  he had advanced a distance of several hundred feet along this road when on looking ahead he observed some person coming slowly toward him  wondering who the individual could be and thinking of crabtree he stopped short  at the same time the other person also halted and then of a sudden slipped out of sight behind the nearest trees  hullo thats queer murmured the youth  evidently he doesnt want to be seen can it be crabtree  he was unarmed and had some hesitancy about advancing not knowing what to expect  but he did not wish the former teacher to escape and so casting around he espied a sharp stone and picked it up  hi there come out of that he called as he ran forward and held the stone ready for use  no reply was vouchsafed and he called again  by this time he was directly opposite the spot where the mysterious individual had disappeared  look here josiah crabtree you might as well come out and give yourself up he called sharply  still there was no answer and now tom did not know what to do under the trees it was so dark that he could scarcely see a yard in front of him  yet he advanced several paces still holding the stone up as a weapon of offense or defense as the case might prove  but nobody appeared in sight and at last he returned to the road  he was in a quandary whether to return to the cottage or continue on his way to the hall  i suppose i may as well go on he concluded  neither dick nor i can do much in the woods in the dark  so he went on but this time more slowly wondering if josiah crabtree would follow him and never dreaming that the person who had slipped him was not the former teacher but dan baxter  for baxter it was who had been waiting around to be joined by crabtree for the pair of evildoers had come to the vicinity of the stanhope cottage together  its tom rover muttered baxter on hearing the boys voice  i was lucky to get out of the way  he remained as motionless as a statue while tom passed within a dozen feet of him  then when tom went out on the road again baxter ran forth too but in the opposite direction  down on a side road baxter had that day run across a tramps encampment  in the camp were three hoboes as they are sometimes called rascals who were willing to do almost anything but work for a living  they had demanded money of the bully and he gave them a dollar fearing violence if he refused them  baxter now thought of the tramps and as he did so an evil look crossed his face  if only i can pay off tom rover he muttered  ill do it if i can  soon the tramps encampment was reached and he found two of the men dozing before a tiny fire with an empty liquor bottle between then the third tramp had gone to cedarville for more liquor  wake up here cried baxter catching first one and then the other by the shoulder  what do yer want young feller demanded the leader of the party who rejoiced in the name of stumpy nuggs  i want you two men to help me lay a boy out answered dan baxter feeling that there was no use in mincing matters for he knew that the tramps were a bad crowd  lay a boy out repeated the second tramp who was called longback  yes he is an enemy of mine and just passed on the road yonder if you will help me thrash him and make him a prisoner ill give you each five dollars  say yer talkin big said stumpy nuggs  i mean what i say  i know you are not above doing such work by the way you tackled me  is de boy alone  yes  an yer want to whip him and den make him a prisoner  yes  wot yer goin ter do wid him after dat  i dont know yet  who is de boy  a cadet up at the military academy above here  stumpy nuggs scratched his head of tangled hair  maybe yer gittin us into a trap fer askin yer fer dat dollar he observed suspiciously  no i am not  this boy is an old enemy of mine and i want to get square with him  we can easily catch him before he gets to the academy if you hurry up  an you will give us five dollars each  yesand perhaps more  the boy carries a watch and must have some money in his pocket  he also wears a gold ring  at the mention of jewelry and money the tramps eyes glistened  if you are tellin de truth dis is all right cried stumpy nuggs as he arose and stretched himself  i am telling the truth and you can easily prove it for yourselves  only hurry up or it will be too late  the two tramps consulted together and asked a few more questions then they agreed to follow baxter and do whatever he desired of them providing they were allowed their fair share of plunder if there was any  in the meantime tom went on in deep thought  he still held the stone in his hand  he wished he had a club but the stick he had formerly picked up had been left at the cottage  the hall grounds had just come into sight in the dim distance when the boy heard the patter of footsteps behind him  he turned around but could see nobody and at that instant the sounds ceased  somebody is following me he thought  can it be the same party i spotted before  an instant later he found himself confronted by two men and a boy each with a bit of cloth tied over his face into which two holes had been cut for eyes  is dat him asked one of the men  yes answered the boy in a strangely unnatural voice  give it to him  all three of the party carried sticks and they at once fell upon tom hitting him over the shoulders and the head  he did his best to defend himself and hit baxter in the arm with the stone inflicting a wound that made the bully shriek with pain  so it is you baxter cried tom recognizing the voice  what do you mean by this  knock him down yelled the bully  dont let him get away from you  thus urged the two tramps closed in and while one caught tom by the arm the second tried to pull his feet from under him  it was a fierce but unequal struggle and though the boy struck out right and left inflicting not a little injury in the end he found himself on his back with stumpy nuggs sitting on his chest  you rascals let up he gasped  do you mean to kill me  lay still or youll catch it worse growled nuggs  wheres dat rope longback  a rope had been brought along and it was quickly produced and then tom was rolled over and his hands were bound behind him  his legs were also bound together in such a fashion that he might walk but not run  now get up ordered dan baxter with a wicked scowl  not caring to remain on the ground tom did so  he noted that the two men with baxter were tramps and he came to the conclusion that he had a hard crowd with whom to deal  march went on baxter taking tom by the shoulder  march  where to  youll find out fast enough  suppose i refuse  you had better not tom rover  you know im not to be trifled with  i am not afraid of you answered tom boldly  you were always a bully dan baxter and a bully is a coward  is your name baxter asked asked stumpy nuggs curiously  never mind what it is growled baxter  i used ter have a friend wot knowed a feller named baxter went on the tramp  me friends name was buddy girk  i know your friend cried tom  he once stole my brother dicks watch  he is this boys fathers tool and both of them are now in jail in albany for robbery  wot cried nuggs in astonishment  he turned to the other tramp longback i reckon we have struck an odd crowd hey  dats wot answered longback  but say we didnt go through de young gents pockets yet  wait until we are off the road interrupted dan baxter somebody may come along and make trouble for us  right ye are answered stumpy nuggs  dont lets stay here anudder minit  with baxter on one side of him nuggs on the other and longback bringing up the rear tom was forced to march along  once he resisted and received a punch in the side that took nearly all of the wind out of him  he started to cry for help but his captors threatened if he did this that they would place a gag of dirty cloth in his mouth  in days gone by baxter had often visited a deserted dwelling on the lake shore and to this spot the party now directed their steps in the dark their course was uncertain and they made slow progress so it was after three oclock in the morning when the dilapidated building was reached      chapter ix  a dose of tar and feathers   make some kind of a lighti cant see a thing said dan baxter as the little party came to a halt in front of a half tumbled down building  stumpy nuggs carried matches and quickly lit a bit of candle which he produced from one of the pockets of his ragged attire  they entered the dwelling forcing tom to accompany them  this done they tied the young cadet fast to an iron ring set in the huge old fashion fireplace  now well turn out his pockets said longback and this was quickly done  to the tramps chagrin tom carried no watch but had with him two dollars in money  now well take dat ring said nuggs pointing to the article on toms little finger  so i have fallen in with a lot of thieves eh said the boy well if you want the ring you can fight for it  shut up roared dan baxter and struck him across the mouth causing toms under lip to bleed  the boy tried to retaliate but his bonds held him fast  while one tramp held his hand the other possessed himself of the ring  the ring contained an opal of which tom was very proud and to part with the article made the young cadet feel pretty bad  you will rue this nights work he muttered  ill see you in prison for it  dont waste your breath in threatening cried baxter  all right baxter wait and see  ill put you where your father is  the bullys face reddened  will you shut up or do you want another crack on the mouth  its only a coward who would strike a person when he is helpless  coward or not i want you to keep a civil tongue in your head  perhaps you imagine we dont know who tried to wreck the stage went on tom pointedly  wreck a stage  i know nothing of such a thing  you know all about it  and well prove it toowhen you are under arrest  i wont talk to you howled baxter  come with me he added to the tramps and then the three quitted the building leaving torn to his reflections which were dismal enough  im in a pickle and no mistake he murmured  what will they do with me next  hour after hour went by and still tom was left alone  in the meantime baxter had held a long conversation with the tramps and had formed a compact with them paying them the ten dollars as agreed  the sun was shining brightly when at last dan baxter reentered the old building  getting hungry i suppose he remarked with a wicked grin  not particularly so answered tom coldly  he was hungry but he was not going to admit it  i suppose you would like to have your liberty went on the bully  dont ask superfluous questions baxter  let us get down to business  why did you make me a prisoner and what are you going to do with me  i made you a prisoner because i felt like doing so growled the big youth  and what do you propose to do next  teach you a lesson that you wont forget all your life tom rover  thank you for nothing  i havent forgotten how you and your brothers handled me out in africaand here too for that matter  you deserved what you got dan baxter  some persons would have had you sent to prison for your actions  bah  you dont know what you are talking about  what were you doing out so late last night  none of your business  were you over to the stanhopes place  perhaps i was and perhaps i wasnt  dont get mulish  remember that you are absolutely in my power  and what if i was at the stanhopes place  havent i a perfect right to go there  did you meet anybody there  yes i did  i met your particular friend josiah crabtree  baxters face fell  and whatthat is what did you have to say to each other  crabtree tried to rob the widowand i believe you were outside waiting for him tom continued suddenly  nonsense  at this moment stumpy nuggs came in  theres a man comin dis way he said excitedly wot shall we do  a man ejaculated baxter in alarm  ill go out and see if i know him  he left the building with the tramp  the newcomer was approaching along the gully path  as he drew closer baxter recognized josiah crabtree  baxter exclaimed the former teacher as he carne up  this is fortunate i was afraid you had been captured  and i was afraid you were in the same box rejoined baxter  i had a hard time of it to get away  i got lost in the woods and had to remain out in the cold all night  then you didnt succeed in getting what you wanted or in seeing mrs stanhope  no  those confounded rover boys turned up and i had toahem leave in a hurry  but who are these two men and josiah crabtree looked apprehensively at the tramps  they are all right crabtree  they helped me do a slick thing last night  ah and what was that  i met tom rover on the road and they helped me to capture him  indeed and where is theahyoung rascal now  a prisoner in the old house yonder  at this information josiah crabtree was much astonished and begged for the particulars of the affair which were speedily forthcoming  and now you have him a prisoner what do you propose to do asked the former teacher  ill soon show you growled baxter  im going to do him up brownor rather black  see here  he led the way back to the gully and pointed to a pot of tar and a brush which rested by it  it is tar cried crabtree  exactly  and you areahemgoing to give him a coat of that  yes  doesnt he deserve it  to be sure he does  i will assist you answered the former teacher readily with a malicious gleam in his fishy eyes  i wish you had all three boys here to tar them with the same brush  one at a time crabtree  well fix the others some time later  a fire was started and the pot of tar was hung from a chain caught up between two uprights  some of the softening stuff was smeared on the wood which was burning and this made the blaze more fierce than ever  soon the tar was near to the boiling point   the two tramps had thrown themselves down to watch the proceedings  yer ought ter have some fedders suggested longback  i have  there was an old musty feather bed in the house  im going to use that  going into the building dan baxter brought forth the feathers in question and placed them close to the pot of tar  while he was doing this josiah crabtree went in to talk to tom  of course the boy was surprised to see the former teacher who eyed him darkly  so baxter has caught you began crabtree  to this tom made no answer  i presume you do not like your present position went on the man  still no reply  you feel so bad about it that you do not even wish to talk is that it  no i was just thinking of what an ugly blackhearted villain you were crabtree aid tom looking him full in the face  i dont believe you have a single spark of honor left in you  at this crabtrees face grew as dark as a thunder cloud  ha i how dare you address me in this fashion he cried  i know i am taking a great risk but i cannot help it  do you forget that you and your brothers are solely responsible for my present position  that but for you i would have married the widow stanhope and started one of the finest boys school in new york state  yes and you would have made mrs stanhope perfectly miserable and squandered every dollar that she holds in trust for dora  that is your opinion and it is worth nothing  my opinion is the opinion of everybody that knows you as well as i do  you have constantly interfered in the doings of myself and of others and now you must stand punishment for the same  what do you intend to do demanded tom quickly  ill show you broke in the voice of dan baxter and he came in followed by the two tramps  soon tom was released from the fireplace and marched between them out into the open air  how do you like that asked baxter as he led the way to the fire  tar and feathers are fine arent they  you would tar and feather me asked tom and now it must be confessed that he shivered in spite of his efforts to remain calm  yes well tar and feather you responded baxter  and lay it onahemthick daniel put in josiah crabtree  trust me for that  baxter gave a signal to the two tramps and they began to literally rip toms clothing from his back  soon the unfortunate youth was stripped to the waist  then baxter caught up a brush full of tar and advanced upon him      chapter x  in the nick of time   baxter dont you dare to tar me cried tom as the bully faced him  ha ha  i guess you are pretty well scared now laughed baxter your former show of bravery was all put on  if you go ahead you shall suffer the full penalty for the outrage mark my words  bah tom rover you cant frighten me  when i get through with you ill warrant that your own mother wont know you  tom tried to retreat but each of the tramps held him by the arm so that he could not stir  as his legs were still bound kicking was likewise out of the question  let me put a nice big cross on his breast first said baxter here goes  he reached out with the brush but before he could touch tom an interruption came as forceful as it was unexpected  a thick stick came flying through the air hitting his arm and sending the tar brush spinning to a distance  you rascal let tom alone came in dick rovers voice and he rushed in and threw the bully headlong  dick  sam came from tom joyfully  oh how glad i am that you have come  wots dis gasped stumpy nuggs  longback dares trouble ahead  yes an i dont intend ter be in it answered the second tramp i reckon weve got about all we want out of dis crowd anyway and both tramps took to their heels  josiah crabtree stood by speechless  the interruption had come so suddenly that he knew not what to do  as quickly as he could dan baxter scrambled to his feet  as he did so sam leaped for the tar brush and secured it  let me alone roared the bully and began to back away  but as he did so his hand went into his hip pocket and he drew a pistol  no you dont cried sam and knocked the weapon from his hand with the brush  this action caused the hot tar to leave a heavy streak over baxters face and neck and he let out a yell that would have done credit to an indian on the warpath  wait ill get even for this sam rover he hissed and then as dick advanced he turned and took to his heels running as if the evil one were after him  sam followed him still swinging the brush but dan baxter was soon lost to sight in the bushes  dick now turned to where josiah crabtree had been standing  the former teacher had recovered and was making tracks down the gully toward the lake  the tramps had disappeared  he leaped to toms side  we must bag some of them tom he said as he whipped out his knife and set his brother free  there goes crabtreelet us collar him  both boys ran as never before and came upon the former teacher just as that individual reached the lake shore below the bluff tom made a grab and caught him by the coat tails  let me go snarled crabtree and aimed a blow at the cadets head  but tom ducked and the next instant put out his foot and crabtree pitched headlong into the lake  help me  ill be drowned spluttered the former teacher as he came up with his head covered with mud for the lake at this point was less than five feet deep  climb out and youll be all right sang out dick and feeling the bottom with his feet crabtree looked very sheepish and clambered slowly up the bank  as he stood before them all dripping with water and mud he looked the picture of misery  boys this is aasad way in which to treat your former teacher he wailed  dont talk like that or ill be tempted to throw you in again exclaimed tom  dick what will we do with him  hold him until we hear from sam  they looked up the gully and soon espied the youngest rover hurrying toward them  where is baxter asked dick  he got away but not until i had let him have that tar brush right in the neck answered sam  hullo so you have captured old crabby eh  thats good  surely you do not intend toahemkeep me a prisoner remarked josiah crabtree in a voice which he tried in vain to steady  thats just what we do intend to do answered dick  youll march right to the cedarville lockup with us  while dick and sam guarded the prisoner tom ran back for his torn coat and other garments and also for the rope  when he returned crabtrees hands were bound and the cadets told him to move along he was searched and a pistol was taken from him  crabtree went along most unwillingly  once he refused to budge but dick showed the pistol and that settled his stubbornness and he went along as willingly as a lamb  on the outskirts of cedarville the party met chief burger and detective trigger  so you have one of them eh cried the chief  very good very good indeed  turn him over to me and i will take him straight to headquarters  you must be careful that he doesnt get away said dick  just so lad i will be  no one ever escaped from me not much come on sir  and he caught josiah crabtree by the arm  this is awful groaned the former teacher  and right here in cedarville too where everybody knows me  you should have thought of those things before mr crabtree said dick his heart softening a little now that he saw the man was beginning to break down  what will my friends and the profession at large say and crabtree shook his head bitterly  you have only yourself to blame put in tom  he had not forgotten how crabtree had threatened him but a short while before  suddenly the former teachers last drop of courage seemed to desert him and deadly pale he sank on his knees  spare me boys spare me  for the sake of my family and my friends spare me he moaned  i didnt know you had a family put in sam  my relativesmy poor dear distant relatives replied crabtree hardly aware of what he was saying  spare me for their sakes and i will reward you well  the law must take its course mr crabtree said dick  he turned to chief burger  take him and tom can go with you to make the charge for us and for mrs stanhope  i think detective trigger had better come with sam and me to hunt for dan baxter  so it was arranged and soon crabtree was walking into cedarville with the chief of police on one side of him and tom on the other the sight of a man being placed under arrest was an unusual one and soon a crowd began to follow the three  its mr crabtree that used to teach at putnam hall said one my but aint he a sight  must have tried to get away by jumping into the lake suggested another  whats he arrested for asked a third  nobody in the crowd knew and consequently all followed to the police headquarters  here chief burger who also acted as justice of police took down toms charge against the former teacher  breaking in and trying to steal said tom  its not so cried crabtree  boy this isaheminfamous  i never stole a thing in my life  we will prove it when your trial comes off answered tom coolly  let usahemtry to patch this thing up went on josiah crabtree  chief will you kindly send for mrs stanhope  i am certain she will not allow this charge to stand against me  see here you shant try any of your games on that lady exclaimed tom  i know the peculiar influence you exert over her and i feel bound to protect her  she is not my enemy as you are  i know she will clear me  not much  if she wont testify against you her daughter dora will and so will i and my brothers and some other folks too  i demand to see my accusers stormed crabtree trying to put on a bold front  all right dick and sam will be here after awhile  and then if you wish well air all of your doings since the time captain putnam discharged you  at the last words the former teacher winced and turned pale for he knew his record would not bear investigating  you are a bad boy tom roverleave me he muttered and turned his back on the cadet  a few minutes later as he could not furnish bail he was led to a cell and locked up  as soon as crabtree was disposed of tom left the jail to find his brothers  this was no easy matter and it was not until well along in the afternoon that he discovered dick sam and detective trigger down by the lake shore nearly a mile from cedarville  any luck he asked  not a bit replied dick  he has given us the slip nicely  the hunt continued until nightfall and was kept up all of the next day  but it proved of no avail  dan baxter had left the vicinity of the lake entirely and the rover boys were destined not to see him again for many days to come  the arrest of josiah crabtree had occurred on friday  on monday came a letter from mr anderson rover stating that alexander pop would arrive in cedarville on tuesday and might remain at mrs stanhopes cottage as long as the lady and the boys wished  i wish aleck to be near you wrote mr rover  it alarms me greatly to hear of the trouble that you are having  it seems to me that our family are bound to be in hot water all the time  i cannot understand arnold baxter  as he is in prison at albany i do not see how he can trouble me at least for the next few years  i have looked up that mining property in colorado very carefully and shall go out there as soon as the coming winter is at an end perhaps i will take one or all of you with me but that will depend upon how good you do at your studies this winter  i shant take anybody along that cant show a good report      chapter xi  brought to trial   by jinks well have to be on our good behavior observed tom after he had read his fathers letter  thats so responded sam  father means to have us study or else we must stay here during the spring term  as anticipated alexander pop reached cedarville tuesday afternoon he came first to putnam hall and was warmly received both by the rover boys and by the others who knew him as an old hand around the hall  glad you have come aleck cried tom  i declare it looks as if you belonged here  yes sah an i dun feel like i belong heah too massah tom answered the colored man  remember the sport we used to have put in sam  deed i does massah saman de tricks youse lads used to play on dis yeah coon and aleck smiled broadly  captain putnam also came forward to greet pop  there had been a time when the captain had suspected pop of stealing and the colored man had run away in preference to being sent to jail but now it was known by all that the faithful negro was innocent and the master of the hall was sorry that he had ever accused the man  pop i miss you a good deal he said kindly  if ever you are out of work again come to me and i will let you stay here as long as you please  tank you capn putnam ill remember dat  but i dun lub de robers aint no use ter talk an so long as da wants me to stay by em why dats whar you will find aleck pop yes sah  and he bobbed his head to emphasize his words  i do not blame you for sticking by them answered the captain for they always stood up for you  of course some of the boys could not help but have some fun with pop  some ran off with his hat and when they returned it to him it was half full of flour although he did not know it  mustnt do dat larry colby he said as he took the hat  dis niggah dun cotch cole in his haid widout a hat  and then they clapped the headgear on his head very carefully  only a bit of larrys sport said frank  come in the captain wants to give you some supper before you start out for the stanhopes place  never suspecting that anything was wrong aleck pop entered the kitchen attached to the academy where mrs green the matron had a nice supper spread for him  how do you do aleck she said pleasantly as he came in  how do yo do missus green he answered and took his hat off with such a flourish that part of the flour swept into her face and the balance landed over the supper table  oh oh screamed mrs green  what in         the world have you done i am covered with flour from head to foot  and then she began to sneeze with great violence  deed missus i dontkerchew replied pop sneezing  i didntkerchew  but you didkerchew she answered  you covered me with kerchew  kerchew  oh youkerchew and then she went off into another prolonged sneeze  pop had gotten some of the flour in his eyes indeed his face was white from top to bottom and it was several minutes before he could see what he was doing  his sneezing made him bump his head against the kitchen shelf and at a point where sat a bowl of rice pudding  part of the pudding was plastered to his forehead while the balance turned over on to the cat sleeping on the floor  meow wailed the cat and started across the kitchen on a run nearly upsetting mrs green in its hurry to get away from more trouble  stop  did you kick my pet cat screamed mrs green  oh youkerchew  you brute  i neverkerchew kerchew and then she had to stop talking and let the sneezing have full play  i didnt kickkerchewnuffin spluttered aleck  ise dunkerchewdem boys dunkerchew  dern boys did it  did what  put flour in ma hat de ole boy take em  finished aleck and then he blundered out of the kitchen and tried to find larry and the others  but all of the cadets who had been watching proceedings through the kitchen window had vanished and could not be found  a couple of hours later tom and dick took the colored man down to the stanhope cottage  mrs stanhope already knew the man well as did dora and both were glad that he had come to stay with them pop had brought along a pistol and also a war club he had picked up in africa and declared himself ready to meet any and all comers  ise dun learned how to shoot putty straight he remarked  so de fellers wot prowls around bettah look out fo demselbes  crabtree is in jail so you will only have dan baxter to guard against said dick  and i hardly think he will show up in a hurry  that night dick and tom had a long conversation with mrs stanhope the lady was very nervous and when asked if she would appear against josiah crabtree she shivered from head to foot  ii cannot do it she said brokenly  do not ask it of me  he he  i cannot face him without he makes me feel as if i were in his power  he is something of a hypnotist said tom  cannot you remember that and nerve yourself against coming under his spell  but the lady only shivered again  no no  i have tried itfor doras sakebut i cannot do it  i am horrified at his influence but i cannot withstand it  then you will keep away from the court room when he is tried  yes i must  i will get my doctor to issue a certificate that i am ill  will you let dora testify  if she wishes to do so  there the matter rested and the two boys sought out dora  it is too bad said dick on the way  mrs stanhope is on the verge of a nervous collapse and i believe it is all on account of crabtrees doings  yes and i am afraid she will never get away from his influence if he hadnt been something of a hypnotist i dont believe she would ever have taken to him at the start as she did  when dora was told of what her mother had said she felt like crying and the tears stood in her eyes  i know it all only too well she said  i am glad mamma mill not face him  why he would influence her into declaring that he was innocent  but you will testify wont you asked dick earnestly  if you wish it dick  but i hate the publicity  crabtree ought to be put where he can do your mother no further harm  yes i feel that too  and you must remember how he helped to abduct you  i havent forgot that  vick and tom remained until it was quite late and then almost ran back to the hall for the captain had told them not to be out after eleven oclock  for several days matters ran smoothly at the hall  then came josiah crabtrees trial and all of the rover boys went to the county seat to remain several days  with them went dora and her uncle john laning  the former teachers trial lasted longer than expected and the jury were out the best part of a night before arriving at a verdict  in the end much to the rover boys surprise crabtree was sentenced to six months in the county jail instead of to several years in the states prison  i cant understand it muttered dick when they were on the way back to the hall he must have hypnotized the judge who tried the case  the verdict was a disappointing one yet it was something to know that crabtree would be out of the way even that long  before he gets out you can be on your trip to buffalo and the great lakes said dick to dora  and perhaps you can hide your whereabouts from him so that he cant get at your mother to try on his game again  i will certainly try to throw him off the track answered the girl  i never want to see him again  captain putnam was anxious to learn how the trial had ended and came from the academy on horseback to meet the boys  well it is something he said halfsmiling  but you are right he deserved more  i knew he was no good said tom  knew it from the first time i met him when he was head assistant here and placed me under arrest for shooting off a firecracker at the gate  at this captain putnam laughed outright  you have a good memory thomas i must say  well you are square now as you boys call it      chapter xii  winter days at putnam hall   after the trial of josiah crabtree the days flew by swiftly at the hall  bound to make a good showing each of the rover boys applied himself diligently to his studies and all made rapid progress  thanksgiving came and went and a week later there came a fairly heavy fall of snow  hurrah winter is knocking at the door at last cried sam joyfully  now for some snowballing skating and all the rest of the winter fun  snowballing was already going on and the white balls were flying in all directions  dick had his hat taken off by frank and in return filled franks ear with snow  tom and fred got into a regular war at close quarters and in the end tom threw  his opponent flat and stuffed snow down his neck  but then larry came up with a huge cake of snow and nearly smothered tom and then a dozen leaped in and a goodnatured melee resulted lasting for the rest of the playtime  it was very cold that night and two days later the ice on the lake was two inches thick  still the captain made the boys wait until the following saturday when the ice was strong enough to bear a horse  in the meantime skates had been brought out and polished up and soon the edge of the lake was alive with skaters all moving swiftly from one spot to another and shrieking and laughing at the top of their voices  george strong the assistant master also came down and showed some of the older boys how to cut fancy figures  dick was a good skater and took to the fancy figures with ease  as for tom and sam they preferred straight skating and entered half a dozen trials of speed down the lake to the old boathouse and back  if it gets much colder so that the ice thickens i am going to build an iceboat said frank to dick that night  captain putnam said i could have all the old lumber i want  you know the carpenters left a lot when they fixed over that burnt part of the hall  hurrah an iceboat cried dick  just the thing  let me help you frank  perhaps the captain will let us have an old campingout tent for a sail  yes ive asked him about that already and he told mrs green to get me one from the storehouse  and what about nails and runners  peleg snuggers is going to give me the nails and lend me the tools  the runners i will have to buy down to the blacksmith shop  there is an old cask down at the boathouse  we can take the hoops from that and have the blacksmith straighten them out and they will do first rate for runners  so the talk ran on and on the following monday as the cold continued the boys set to work during the offtime to build the iceboat  tom sam and hans joined in and as soon as the frame was put together the boat was christened the fiver because as frank declared it was built to hold just five and no more  there was a class devoted to manual training at the hall so all of the boys were acquainted with the use of tools  the building of the iceboat progressed rapidly and soon all that were wanting were the sail and the runners  frank and dick procured the hoops and had the blacksmith straighten them out and punch holes into them and mrs green kindly transformed an old tent into a mainsail of no mean proportions  as a matter of fact it would have been better for the boys had the sail been smaller  it was a rather cloudy saturday halfholiday when the boys placed the iceboat on rollers and rolled it down to the lake front  all of the other cadets watched the proceedings with interest and were sorry they could not go on the proposed trip  but frank promised that all should have their turns later on  a fair breeze was blowing and no sooner was the mainsail raised than the fiver moved off in such a lively fashion that tom who had lingered behind had all he could do to run and get on board  were off  hurrah yelled sam and the others took up the cry and both those on board and those left behind waved hats and caps in the air and set up a cheer  and now where shall we go asked frank as they whizzed along  that will depend upon the wind came from tom  remember we must get back before seven oclock  yah der vint is eferydings put in hans  supposin ve git far avay und der vint sthops plowing vot den  then well set you on the rear seat to blow the sail yourself replied frank  this wind is good for all day and i know it he added emphatically  let us follow the shore for the present said tom  perhaps the pornell students are skating below here and we can show them what we are up to  so on they went along the shore until the wind began to change and carry them out into the lake  here the ice was however far from safe and they began to tack back  its snowing cried sam presently  he was right and ere long the flakes were coming down thickly  with the coming of the snow the wind died out utterly  heres a pickle muttered tom in disgust  frank i thought you said this wind was good for all day  frank must haf had his schleepin cap on ven he said dot put in hans and the others set up a laugh  well i did think the wind would hold out replied frank with a wry face  this is going to spoil everything  did anybody bring his skates  nobody had although all had calculated to do so  in the excitement every pair had been forgotten  now we cant even skate home said dick  and i rather think it will be a long walkat least three miles  thats not the worst of it came from his youngest  brother look how heavily it is snowing  poch whos afraid of a little snow blustered tom  nobody but if we cant see our way  by jove  i never thought of that groaned frank just look around boys  its awful isnt it  much startled all looked around  on every hand the snow was coming down so thickly that they could not see a distance of two rods in any direction  we seem to be cut off observed dick soberly  i reckon the best thing we can do is to make for shore  and leave the fiver behind  no  let us lower the sail and push her in front of us  this was considered good advice and much put out over the sudden termination of their sport the five cadets lowered the sail and tied it up and then leaped to the ice  now then all together cried frank but to his surprise tom and hans pushed in a different direction to the others  why tom thats not the way cried frank  isnt it burst out tom  why not  because it isnt  of course dot is der vay cried hans  der shore vos ofer dare  yes the other shore  but not the one we left and the one we want to get back to  a long discussion followed and it was soon realized that either tom and hans or else the others were sadly mixed up  the majority rules said frank  so let us go this way  all right i will grumbled tom  but i still think you are wrong  and i vos sure of him added hans  however they took hold willingly enough and soon the whole party were moving slowly through the snowstorm shoving the fiver in front of them  the snow had now become blinding and absolutely nothing was to be seen around them  a half hour had passed and they were wondering why the shore did not appear when suddenly dick uttered a warning cry  look out  we are going into the open water  back all of you  they leaped back fairly tumbling over each other in their efforts to escape the water which crept up to their feet without warning as they pushed themselves back they naturally sent the fiver flying forward and an instant later they heard a crashing of ice and saw the iceboat topple over into the water and disappear from view       chapter xiii  lost in the snow   the iceboats gone  get back boys or well all be in the water  caaacck  a long warning sound rang through the snowladen air and the party of five felt the surface of the ice parting beneath them  they turned and sped away from the water with all the speed at their command and soon the dangerous spot was left behind but not before poor hans had lost his cap and sam had gotten his left foot wet to the ankle  by jinks but that was a narrow shave  gasped dick when they were safe  a little more and all of us would have been under the ice  and that would have cost us our lives said frank solemnly boys i dont believe ill ever want to go iceboating again  mine cap vos gone growled the german cadet dismally  how vos i going to keep mine head from freezing tole me dot vill you  thats rough on you said tom  here take my tippet and tie that around your head and ears  and he took the article in question and handed it over  dank you tom you vos a goot feller  but vot you vos do to keep your neck varm hey  heres a silk handkerchief he can wear that said dick  but i say fellows he went on  i think we are mixed up now and no mistake  i am sure i am answered frank  i havent the least idea where the shore is  nor i came from tom  well have to go at it in a hitormiss fashion  no miss for me put in sam  i am not prepared for a watery grave just now  we must be cautious said dick  ive got an idea  has anybody a rope with him  ive got a heavy cord answered frank  then let us tie that to each fellows right wrist  then we can string out in a line like the swiss mountain climbers and if the boy in front gets into trouble the others can haul him out  hurrah  dick has solved the problem of how the lost cadets are going to get to safety cried sam  let us have the cord by all means  it was quickly produced and proved to be about forty feet in length  dick tied himself fast to one end and sam the other and the others came between  now then forward march shouted dick  and on they moved in indian file  route step shouted frank  and they broke up as orderedthat is each walking to suit himself so that their feet should not come down on the ice at the same time something which might have cause another cracking  the snow still came down as hard as everindeed to dick it appeared to come down harder  the wind was beginning to rise again and blew the blinding particles directly into their faces  whats the use of walking right in the teeth of the wind grumbled tom  why not try the other way  i think the wind comes from off shore thats why answered his elder brother  i dont  i think its coming down the lake  i believe dick is right ventured frank  the wind came that way beforethat is why we were blown out so far  the matter was put to a vote and all but tom agreed that they must be heading for the western shore of the lake  so the weary tramp was resumed  it was not without its incidents  once hans feet went from under him and he went flat on his back taking tom with him  this caused the line to tighten and all went on top of the pair and a grand melee resulted  then tom playfully filled sams neck with snow and hans let a little snowball drop into toms ear and in a second all were at it in a snow fight which lasted several minutes  at last dick arose and shook himself  hi this wont do he cried brushing himself off  unless we hurry well be late in getting back  late in getting back repeated frank  i shall count myself lucky if we dont have  remain here all night  great caesar frank do you mean that came from sam  i do  here we have been tramping i dont know how long and we seem to be as far from shore as ever  exactly so grumbled hans  i dink ve must pe moving around in a ring hey  can that be possible asked tom  i dont think so answered dick for i have been watching the ice very closely and i havent seen the first sign of our doubling our steps  let us keep out in a straight line said tom  that will keep us away from the circle business  once more they pushed on but the snow was now several inches deep and the ice very slippery and all of the party could scarcely drag one foot after the other  it was sam who called another halt  im getting winded he panted  boys i guess we are lost in the snow  thats true sam said frank  the shore seems to be as far off as ever  i told you that you were wrong put in tom  if we had been walking toward shore we would be on land long ago  i dont know but what toms view is correct said frank slowly  unless weve been moving in a crooked line as hans suggested said the elder rover  one and another of the little party gazed at his companions and then at the desolate scene around them  yes they were lost in the snowstorm and what the end of the adventure would be they could not imagine  well we can try toms course said dick after another careful look around which is not saving much as the snow was coming down as thickly as ever  i notice that it is getting dark observed frank as they trudged on  i wonder what time it is  a watch was consulted and they learned to their chagrin that it was halfpast four  i vos gitting hungry came from hans  dont say a word cried tom  i could eat a doughnut a month old  dont speak about it put in dick dryly  it will only make you feel more hungry  darkness was coming on rapidly and all of the boys were beginning to despair when suddenly dick gave a shout of joy  the shore boys  the shore at last  where came from all of the others  over to our left  come on  the others followed dick willingly and in less than half a minute found themselves on solid earth once more but at some point where the ground was little more than a stretch of flat meadow land  hurrah shouted sam  how good to be on land once more  perhaps we might have been on land long ago if we had turned to the left observed frank  we may have been skirting the shore for half the afternoon  never mind we are here at last so dont lets grumble said tom whats that ahead a barn  some kind of a building answered dick  let us go forward and investigate  they did so and found a half tumbled down building which had once been used for the storage of meadow hay and also as a boathouse the door was gone and the window broken out and the snow lay on the floor to the depth of an inch or more  but still it was more pleasant inside than out for the wind was rising and the large flakes of snow had given place to fine hard particles which came swishing down like so much sharp salt so dick said  it cut into their faces and made them thankful that some shelter had been found no matter how humble  it was too dark now to see anything and sitting on some old hay in the most sheltered corner of the building the five boys held a consultation  i move we stay here until morning said tom  if we go out again we may be lost and frozen to death  that is true commented frank  but what will captain putnam say  he cant blame us for what has happened said dick  we tried our best to get back  yah und he vos know ve tont stay here nildowit suppers for noddings was the manner in which the german cadet expressed himself  oh hans how can you broke from tom who could eat at any time and who now felt more hungry than any of them  do you mean to say well have to remain here all night without our suppers  vell vot else you vos going ter do hey  well have to go without something to eat unless we can find something close at hand said frank  one after another went out to the doorway and to the open window and gazed forth  but the howling wind and blinding snow soon made all glad enough to get back to the sheltered corner  it was now pitch dark  we are in for it so make yourselves as comfortable as possible observed frank  my how the wind does blow  its like a hurricane in an african forest said sam  i believe its almost strong enough to take a fellow off his feet  the wind kept increasing in violence until the old barn seemed to rock back and forth  it arose in a low moan and mounted steadily to a shriek gradually dying away in the distance followed by the slishslishing of the fine snow across the rotted shingles of the roof  its a tempest not to be forgotten said frank  i cant remember when ive heard the wind make such a noise before  if it gets any worse it  frank got no further for the shrieking of the wind drowned out every other sound  then came a strange grinding and creaking overhead and the barn rocked more than ever  get out boys yelled tom  the old shebang is going to pieces  tom had scarcely spoken when the shock came and beams boards and shingles flew in all directions  it was a terrifying occurrence and not knowing what else to do the five boys dug into the loose hay and threw themselves flat  each felt as if the end of the world had come      chapter xiv  a few spring happenings   luckily for the boys the barn was blown clean over on its side its roof falling some distance away so that none of the wreckage came down on top of the crowd  but the sounds of the beams and boards breaking were so terrifying that for several minutes after the damage was done none of the crowd dared to move  each felt as though the next second might be his last  at length dick pulled himself together and peered forth  anyanybody hurt he panted  im not came from tom  but say wasnt  a splutter coming from hans interrupted him  in his eagerness to escape the fall of the barn the german cadet had plunged into the hay openmouthed and now some of the stuff had entered his throat and was almost choking him  clap him on the back cried dick and tom did as requested  then came several gulps and hans began to cough  but the danger from strangulation was over  all were soon out of the wreckage and thankful that they had escaped thus easily  but we wont have the barn to shelter us said frank ruefully what will we do next  push on until another shelter appears said dick  we cant remain here to be frozen to death  yes but be careful that we dont get on to the lake again cautioned sam  no fear of that sam  after the terrific blow which laid low the old barn the wind appeared to let up a bit and consequently moving was not so difficult  they struck out across the meadow and presently gained a clump of trees  dis vos besser as noddings said hans  supposing ve stay here for der night  im going to see whats on the other side of the woods first replied dick and stalked off tom at his heels  presently the others heard both rover boys set up a shout  a house fellows  come on  they made a rush forward and soon they reached a stone fence  on the other side was what had been a planted field and beyond this a house and several outbuildings  with hearts greatly lightened they climbed over the fence and made for the house  they were still some distance from the dwelling when they heard the bark of a dog  hullo  i hope he isnt loose cried frank  but he is ejaculated tom and he is coming this way too  du meine zeit shrieked hans  he vill chew us all up  vot shall ve do  and he looked ready to collapse  perhaps we can snowball him began sam when dick set up another cry  its lanings dog boys  what fools we are  this is mr lanings place  lanings place burst out tom  why to be sure it is  and that is leo  leo  leo old boy dont you know us he cried  on bounded the dog and then began to bark again but this time joyously  he came up to tom and leaped all around him wagging his brush as he did so  then he came to sam and to dick for he knew them all very well  its a good thing the old barn blew down said tom for he could not help but think of the greeting the laning girls would give him  they were soon at the back door of the farmers cottage  it was opened by mrs laning who stared at them in astonishment  can we come in asked dick  we are nearly frozen  well i never  out in all this storm  its a wonder the captain would allow it  why come in of course and get thawed out by the fire  and then they went in to meet mr laning and also the two girls  their story was soon told and meanwhile the lady of the house prepared a hot supper for them  as they sat eating they discussed the question of whether it would be better to return to putnam hall that night or wait until morning  i would say stay here said mr laning but captain putnam will be worried about you and start out in search of you  thats just it answered dick  i think one of us at least ought to return  let us draw straws for it said frank and so it was agreed  from the laning place each knew the road well so there was no danger of going astray  besides the storm was now letting up in violence  it fell to franks choice to go and as he was about to leave hans decided to keep him company  the pair was soon off and this left the rover boys and the lanings to themselves  satisfied that all was now right the three brothers made the most of the evening thus afforded them and so did the two girls and all played sang and went in for various games until eleven oclock  then the lads retired to a room assigned to them  i say said tom as he prepared to turn in  that adventure started queerlike but we came out of it all right  yes it couldnt be better added sam  at this dick winked  especially as we landed at the lanings home he observed  what a pity it wasnt doras home too drawled tom and then as dick shied a shoe at him he turned over and dropped off into the land of dreams  early the next morning they started for putnam hall john laning driving them thither in his sleigh  it was a ride they enjoyed the farmer dropped them at the door and captain putnam stood ready to receive them  i am glad you are safe back he said with some display of emotion  harrington and mueller have given me the particulars of your nights adventure  hereafter i want all of the cadets to remain off the lake during a snowstorm  you may be sure we will remain off captain answered dick  one such adventure is enough for any fellow  after this happening nothing of special interest occurred until christmas  then the cadets gave their usual entertainment including a little domestic drama called looking for a quiet boarding house  in this drama tom and larry acted the parts of two old maids who were taking boarders while dick sam and eight others were the socalled boarders or those looking for board the play was filled with humorous situations and the audience in which were the stanhopes and the lanings enjoyed it hugely  if you fail in everything else you had better go on the stage tom said nellie to that youth  you make a splendid actoror i should say actress and she laughed  how would you like to have me for a sister minced tom in the voice he had used in acting  thank you but i dont want an old maid for a sister  then perhaps you dont want to be an old maid yourself he retorted  all right ill see to it that you are spared that annoyance  and then she boxed him playfully on the ears  she could not help but think a good deal of this openhearted funloving fellow  after the entertainment the boys went home to remain over new years day  jack ness the hired man met them at the railroad station in oak run and drove them through dexters corners to valley brook farm  its good fer sore eyes to see ye back said the hired man  the folks is waitin fer ye like a set o children  when they came in sight of the farmhouse there were mr rover uncle randolph and aunt martha all on the porch to receive them anderson rover could not help rushing forward to embrace his sons and the greetings of uncle and aunt were scarcely less affectionate  my own boys was all that anderson rover said but the manner of speaking meant a good deal  the house is yours boys said their aunt martha  i used to think you were a bother but now id rather have the bother than miss you and she smiled so sweetly that dick gave her an extra hug  yes yes do what you please lads put in randolph rover  i shall not be annoyed  we understand each other a great deal better than we did before we went to africa eh  right you are uncle cried tom  we found you out to be a regular brick  christmas presents were numerous including some jewelry for all of the boys and a ring to replace the one tom had lost and some games and half a dozen story books not to mention other things more useful as for instance some socks mrs randolph rover had herself made  for the aunt there was a new breastpin from the three boys and for the uncle a set of scientific works just to his liking  for their father the lads had purchased a goldheaded cane the stick of which was made of some wood they had brought with them from the banks of the congo  the time at home passed all too quickly and soon it was necessary for the boys to return to putnam hall  dora stanhope and the laning girls had not been forgotten and now these young folks sent gifts of dainty embroidered handkerchiefs of which the boys were very proud  tom and sam had sent nellie and grace two elegant christmas cards  what dick had sent dora he would not tell  being behind the scenes we may state that it was a tiny gold locket heartshaped and that dora treasured the gift highly  the second week after new year found them at the hall once more pegging away at their studies harder than ever for they were bound to make the record their father desired of them  but the time spent at school was not without its sport and fun for there was plenty of sleighing and skating and the gymnasium was always open during the off hours  no enemies at the hall this season remarked fred garrison no baxters or cavens or fellows of that sort  no and i am glad of it answered dick  its a big relief  have you any idea what became of baxter  not the slightest  and of mumps the fellow who used to be his toady  oh mumps reformed after that chase on the ocean and ive since heard that he went west struck some sort of a job as a bookkeeper or something like that  well old crabtree is safe  he wont bother you any more concluded fred and there the subject dropped  the weeks glided by quickly until spring was at hand and the green grass began to cover the bills and fields surrounding cayuga lake  still the rover boys pegged away and it must be admitted that even captain putnam was astonished at their progress  they are wholesouled fellows he said to george strong  they put their whole mind into everything they go into  and those are the boys who afterward make their mark in the world answered the head assistant  the rover boys are all right      chapter xv  how arnold baxter escaped   well i never  it was dick rover who uttered the remark as he leaped from the chair in which he had been sitting newspaper in hand  never what dick drawled tom lazily looking up from a kite he was mending  never saw anything to equal those baxters  what do you think arnold baxter has escaped from prison  what ejaculated tom and on the instant the kite was forgotten and tom smashed it directly through the middle with his foot as he came to his brothers side  yes he has escaped and in the slickest manner i ever heard of i tell you tom he is a prize criminal if ever there was one  but how did he get out  how  why just shook hands with his jailers thanked them for their kindness and then left  oh pshaw dick is this a joke  because if it is i want to remind you that we had the first of april last week  its no joke although baxter ought to have played his trick on the first true enough  well what is the trick  you said he shook hands with his jailers and walked off  of course he couldnt do that unless his time was up  but it wasnt upnot by several years  then how did he do it  by a trick tomthe neatest cleverest slickest ever performed in this state  oh stow your longwinded speeches dick cried the younger brother half angrily  boil it down and serve the extract in short order  very well i will  firstly arnold baxter is in jail  secondly he states his friends are going to ask the governor for a pardon thirdly a friend in disguise comes to the jail with the supposed pardon  fourthly great joy of baxter  fifthly he thanks his jailers and bids them goodby as i said before  sixthly after he and his friend are gone the jailers inspect the socalled pardon seventhly the jailers telephone to the governor  eighthly the pardon is pronounced a forgery signatures seal and all ninthly all the powers that be are as mad as hornets but they can do nothing for baxter the elder has gone and has left no trace behind him  phew tom emitted a long low whistle  say but that runs like the halfdime novels i used to stuff myself with in my green days doesnt it  thats right tom excepting that this is strictly true while the halfdime novels used to be as far from the truth as a howling dog is from the moon  but seriously i dont like this went on the elder rover earnestly  neither do i like it  baxter at liberty may mean trouble for father and for us  i begin to see now what dan baxter meant ejaculated tom suddenly  ill wager he knew all along what his father and the friend were up to  i wonder who the stranger was  he must have been a very skillful forger to forge the governors signature and the other signatures too  he must be some old pal to baxter  dont you remember father said baxter was thick with several fellows in the west before he came out here  let us write to father about this at once  this was agreed to and dick began to pen the letter without delay while he was at work sam came in and was acquainted with the news  its just like the baxters said the youngest rover  after this ill be prepared to expect anything of them  id like to know where he has gone  perhaps out west  out west cried dick and tom simultaneously  certainly  didnt he swear to get the best of us regarding that mine matter  by gum murmured tom  dick we cant send that letter any too quick  perhaps we had better telegraph  oh father may have the news already  dick glanced at the newspaper again   hullo i missed this he cried  missed what came from both of the others  the paper says baxters escape occurred several days ago  the prison officials kept it to themselves at first hoping the detectives would recapture the criminal  and that paper was printed yesterday morning  at any rate baxter has had his liberty for at least five days  i must say i dont like this at all  well telegraph to father without delay  looking out of the window dick saw captain putnam walking on the parade ground  he ran down to interview the master of the hall  why yes you can go to cedarville at once if you deem it important said the captain  peleg snuggers can drive you down  thank you captain said dick and ran to the stables  he found the utility man at work cleaning out a stall and soon had snuggers hitching up  inside of ten minutes dick was on the way to town as he bowled along little did he dream of how long it would be before he should see dear old putnam hall again  while passing the stanhope cottage dick saw dora at work over a flower bed in the front garden  just going to cedarville on a little errand he shouted and waved his hand to her and she waved in return  in the back garden was aleck and the negro flourished a hoe as a salute  the telegraph office at cedarville was not a large place and but few private messages were received there  as dick drove up the operator looked at him and at snuggers  hullo i was just going to send a message up to your place he said to the utility man  all right ill take it replied snuggers  you can pay me for the messenger service he added with a grin  whom is the message for if i may ask questioned dick quickly  for richard rover  thats myself  let me have it at once  you are richard rover queried the operator and looked at snuggers who nodded  you came here just in time then  the telegraph operator brought the message forth and dick tore it open with a hand that trembled in spite of his efforts to control it  he felt instinctively that something was wrong  the telegram was from mrs randolph rover and ran as follows  come home at once  your father and uncle attacked by unknown rascal who tried to ransack house  uncle seriously hurt  martha rover  dicks heart seemed to stop beating as he read the lines attacked by rascal who tried to ransack the house he murmured it must have been arnold baxter  no bad news i trust master dick observed snuggers  yes peleg very bad  take this back to the hall and give it to my brothers and tell them i am going to ithaca by the first boat and there take the midnight train for home  tell them to explain to captain putnam and then to follow me  do you understand  wellieri guess i do stammered the workingman  be you going home then  at once  dick turned to the operator  the boat for ithaca is almost due isnt it  yes sir in five minutes  take me to the wharf peleg and hurry up about it  got to go then  i have and dick leaped into the carriage  peleg snuggers saw that the young cadet was in earnest and made the boat landing in less than three minutes  the sylvan dell a companion boat to the morning star was on time and dick soon found himself on board and bound for ithaca  he was too excited to keep quiet and began to pace the boat from stem to stern  whats up my lad asked the captain as he looked at the youth curiously  i am in a hurry to get home sir  well im afraid tramping around wont hurry matters any and captain miller smiled broadly  do you object to my walking around asked dick somewhat sharply  oh no go ahead  i hope you havent heard any bad news went on the captain kindly  but i have heard bad news  my father and my uncle were attacked by some man who tried to ransack the house  my uncle was seriously hurt  thats bad  i trust they collared the villain  no i guess he got away for the telegram i received said he was unknown  its too bad  do your folks live in the city  no at a country place called valley brook  then i doubt if they catch the rascal who did the deed  the country offers too good a chance to escape  i mean to catch him if i can said dick earnestly and then the captain left him once more to himself  he thought that the boy had rather a large opinion of himself but did not know that dick already had a firstclass clew to work on      chapter xvi  something about the eclipse mine   dick  oh how glad i am that you have come  mrs randolph rover rushed out to the porch to greet the boy as he came bounding up the steps two at a time  i came as soon as i received the telegram he answered as he embraced his aunt and how are father and uncle randolph  your father is not seriously hurtonly a twist of his left ankle where the burglar kicked him  but your uncle randolph  mrs rover stopped and shook her head bitterly  not dangerously hurt i hope cried dick his heart leaping into his mouth for as we already know his eccentric old uncle was very dear to him  yes he is seriously hurt dick  he was struck in the head and a fever has set in  can i see him  not yet  the doctor says he must be kept very quiet  but he will recover aunt  ii hope so dick  oh it was dreadful  and the tears rolled down the womans pale face  im so sorry for you he exclaimed brushing the tears away with his handkerchief  so sorry  where is father  up in the bedroom in the wing of the house  i can see him cant i  oh yes  dick waited to hear no more but ran up the stairs quickly yet making no noise for fear of disturbing his uncle who was in a front room on the same floor  father can i come in he asked in a low voice  yes dick was the reply and he went into the room to find his father in a rocking chair with his left foot resting on a stool mr anderson rovers face showed plainly that he had suffered considerable pain  father i am so glad it is no worse he said as he took his parents hand  aunt martha tells me uncle randolph is seriously hurt  yes he got the worst of it returned anderson rover  the blow was meant for me but your uncle leaped in and caught its full force  and do you know who the robber was  no he had his face well covered  i think i can tell you  you dick  ah you are thinking of that dan baxter  it was a man not a boy i am sure of that much  yes it was a man father  it was arnold baxter  arnold baxter  you must be dreaming  he is in jail  no he has escaped he escaped about a  week ago  escaped  anderson rover raised himself up and would have leaped to his feet hid not his sprained ankle prevented him  you are certain of this  yes and dick related the particulars  you must be right  the man did look like baxter but i thought it impossible that it could be the same  the elder rover gave a groan  then the fat is in the fire for a certainty  and after all my work and trouble  what are you talking about now father  that mining claim in coloradothe eclipse mine as roderick kennedy christened it  but i dont understand  its a long story dick  you have beard parts of it but not the whole and to go into the details would do you small good  but i would like to know something father  you shall know something dick mr rover drew up his injured foot  oh if only i could go after arnold baxter without delay  its too bad you are hurt  does it pain you very much  when i try to stand on it the pain is terrible  the doctor says i must not use the foot for a month or six weeks  that will make tedious waiting for you  yes and in the meantime baxter will try to cheat me out of that mining property if he can  but he wont dare to show himself  he will do the work through some other partyprobably the man who helped him to escape from prison  did he get anything of valuepapers for instance  yes he got most of the papers although i still retain one small map a duplicate of one which was stolen  you see dick years ago roderick kennedy and myself were partners out in colorado owning half a dozen claims  yes ive heard that before  well one day kennedy went off prospecting and located a very rich find which he christened the eclipse mine  the claim was never worked but he made a map of the locality which he kept a secret as his partner i was entitled to half of all of his discoveries just as he was entitled to half of my discoveries  at that time arnold baxter worked for both of us  he was thick with kennedy and i soon saw that he was trying to break up the partnership so that he could form a new deal with kennedy  but kennedy was true to me and in the end we caught baxter stealing from us and gave him twentyfour hours notice to quit camp  baxter was enraged at this and went off vowing to get square about a month after that happened kennedy tumbled off a cliff and died of his injuries  in his will he left me all of his mining properties including the eclipse claim which i have never yet seen  after kennedy was buried arnold baxter came forward and claimed part of the property and produced papers to substantiate his claims  but the papers were proved by a dozen miners to be of no value and in the end he was again drummed out of camp  i was making money fast just then and for the time being paid no attention to baxter  but he continued to annoy me and i am pretty certain that on one or two occasions be tried to take my life  but at last he disappeared and i heard no more of him until you boys brought me back from africa and told me that you had had trouble with both him and his goodfornothing son  he seems bound to shadow me wherever i go  but the eclipse mine broke in dick  i am getting to that  kennedy had left his interest in it to me but baxter claimed the whole discovery as his own saying he was out on his own hook when the mine was located which was a falsehood  but though baxter claimed the mine he could not locate it nor could i do so  it was along a creek which a certain jack wumble had called bumble bee but we could not locate this creek and jack wumble had departed for fresh fields  but i have located the old miner and he has told me that bumble bee creek was in reality one of the south branches of the gunnison river and is now called the larkspur  you must remember that in those early days matters were very unsettled in colorado and names changed almost weekly  so this eclipse mine is on larkspur creek  yes at a point three hundred yards above a white cliff which the old miners used to call rooneys ghost because a miner named rooney once committed suicide there  and what about baxter father  if he has those papers do you think he or his confederate will go up the larkspur to locate the eclipse mine  undoubtedlyunder another namethat is if it proves as valuable as my old partner anticipated  but if we can get there before him and locate for ourselves  ah if i could do that dick then i would not fear baxter or anybody else  but if he gets in ahead of mewell you know possession is nine points of the law and he can at least make me a lot of trouble  dick sprang from the seat into which he had dropped  he shant do it father he exclaimed  but how are you going to help it my son  i cannot go west with this sprained ankle  ill go west myself and locate that claim in spite of what arnold baxter has done  you go west  yes  without me  that would be awell  remember father i went to africa to find you  i shall never forget it dick  but you had others with youyour uncle randolph and tom and sam and aleck  well i can take tom and sam with me again if it comes to that  it is a wild country out there among the mining camps of the mountains  its no wilder than in the heart of africa  mr anderson rover shook his head doubtfully  and then if baxter found out what you were trying to do he would  he could not finish but dick understood  i shall be on my guard father  i know what a scoundrel he is and will give him no chance to get at me  at that point the conversation was interrupted by the hired girl who came to call dick to a late supper  the lad was hungry so he did not refuse  by the time he had finished mr rover had gone to bed so his son also retired without probing the eclipse mine affair any further  but it was a long time before dick got to sleep so full was his head of the suddenly proposed trip to the west      chapter xvii  bound for the west   on the following morning tom and sam arrived as anxious as dick had been to learn the particulars of what had occurred  they listened to their fathers story with interest as he told of how he had heard a noise and gone below to grapple with the midnight intruder who was ransacking the library desk and of how randolph rover had come to his assistance and been seriously wounded and how all were now certain that the unwelcome visitor had been arnold baxterthat is all but randolph baxter who lay semiunconscious in a high fever and who knew nothing  the doctor came in at noon and pronounced randolph rover but little better  he must be kept very quiet said the medical man  do not allow anybody to disturb him  if he should become in the least excited i would not answer for his life  so the boys kept away from his bedchamber and walked about on tiptoes and spoke in whispers  it was dick who called together a council of war out in the barn late in the afternoon after he had had another long talk with his father  heres the whole thing in a nutshell he said  arnold baxter has those papersor the best part of themand he means to stake that claim if he can  but he wont dare to show himself said sam  if he does we can turn him over to the police  of course he wont show himself but hell get somebody else to stake the claim and whack up replied dick  we wont let him do it interposed tom bluntly  ill go to colorado myself and stop him  good for you tom  youve struck the nails head first clip said his elder brother  father was going out there this spring anywayand he was going to take us  true  father would go today if he could but he cant on account of that hurt ankle went on dick  then let us go for him came from sam  we can do nothing here but worry uncle randolph and i dont feel like going back to putnam hall while this excitement is on  i told father that i wanted to go lout he is afraid the trip would be too dangerous  pooh we went to africa was toms comment  he was awfully proud of that trip to the dark continent  it isnt the trip so much as it is the fact that we may fall in with arnold baxter and his confederates  by the way i wonder if dan has joined his father mused sam  like as not  certainly dan knew what his parent was up to otherwise he wouldnt have written that letter josiah crabtree dropped  then you can be sure the two baxters have gone to colorado said tom  and the three rovers will go too said sam  will you asked dick  i wanted to say so but  yes well go and that settles it cried tom  and the sooner we get off the better  but we must get father to explain everything a little more closely before we leave  it was easy to get anderson rover to explain but not so easy to get him to consent to their going out to colorado  at last he said that if they could get jack wumble to go with them they might go  jack wumble is all right and if he says he will stick to you i know he will keep his word  he is a crack shot and besides he knows larkspur creek from end to end and it will save you a lot of hunting around to have him by to give information  and where can we find jack wumble  the last i heard of him he was in chicago  he is rather a reckless man and when he has money is apt to spend it in gambling but his heart is true blue and honest to the core  do you know where he was stopping  at a hotel called the western palace  it is a great resort for mining men and you will be sure to find out all about him if you ask for him there concluded mr rover  a great deal more had to be talked about and considered but we will pass that over  it was decided that the boys should leave for chicago early on the following monday morning  the spare time was used up in getting ready for the trip  the boys had their trunks shipped home from putnam hall and wrote to the master and their friends telling of what was going on but entering into no particulars  by saturday night they were all ready and on sunday went to church at their aunts request  i hate to see you go said mrs rover with a sad smile  it is a big risk  be sure and come back safe and sound  we will answered tom  and you be sure and have uncle randolph up and well when we do come back he added  poor tom little did he think of the grave perils that waited for him in the far west  the day was a perfect one when they left the air full of bright sunshine and the music of the birds which had made valley brook their summer home for many years  mrs rover saw them to the carriage while anderson rover waved them a serious adieu from his bedroom window  poor randolph rover was as feverish as ever and knew nothing of their coming or their going  all of the boys were half afraid they would never again see their uncle alive  but youth is strong and hopeful and by the time they had entered the cars and made themselves comfortable the scenes around them engrossed their attention and the past was forgotten for the time being  the train was an express and flew along at the rate of sixty miles an hour  well be in chicago by this time tomorrow said dick  its quick traveling isnt it  i hope we are fortunate enough to catch jack wumble said tom i dont want to lose time in chicago hunting him up  the car was but half filled so that the boys had several seats all to themselves  they had brought with them a map of colorado and they spent much of the day in studying this  when it came time for dinner they entered the dining car  they could not get seats together and so tom was compelled to sit opposite to a burly fellow whose appearance did not strike him as altogether favorable  bound for chicago asked the man after passing the time of day  yes sir answered tom  are you bound there  i am going through that city  you belong there i suppose  no sir ive never been there before  is that so  going on a pleasure trip or to try your luck  or perhaps you are on business  yes i am on business  you are rather young to be out on business it strikes me went on the burly stranger after a pause  oh ive been around a little before said tom coolly  yes you look like a lad who has seen some thing of the world well ive seen something of the world myself  are you a western man asked tom who thought it would not hurt to do a little questioning on his own account  yes i was born and brought up in colorado  the reply interested tom  but you have traveled you say  yes ive been to san francisco and to new york and also up in the mining districts of the northwest territory and in the mines of mexico  ive been what they call a rolling stone  and the burly man laughed lightly but the laugh was not a pleasant one  then you ought to know a good deal about mining tom ventured i am interested in the mines of colorado  in what part of the state were you located  well i lived in ouray some time and also in silverton but i went here there and everywhere prospecting and buying up old claims cheap  i hope you struck it rich  oh im fairly well fixed was the careless answer  so you are interested in our mines eh  got a claim  no sir but i am going out there to look up a claimif i can  take my advice and leave mining alone unless you have had experience  the chance for a tenderfoot as we call em getting along has gone by  i shant waste much time in looking around  and dont waste your money either  nine mines out of ten that are offered for sale are not worth buying at any price  ive been all through the miff and i know  i suppose you know a great many of the old time miners said tom after another pause  oh yes loads of them quray frank bill peters denver phil and all the rest  did you ever meet a man by the name of jack wumble  the burly man started and spilled a little of the coffee he was holding to drink  whyerconfound the rocking of the train he answered  why yes i met wumble once or twice but never had any business with him  are you going to buy a mine from him  no i am going to try to get him to help locate one that is missing answered tom before he had thought twice  indeed  well ive heard jack is a good man at locating paying claims  do you know him personally  i do not  a gleam of satisfaction lit up the burly mans face  but tom did not notice it  wumble used to hang out in denver  going to meet him there i suppose  no im going to meet him in chicago if i can  i see  so the talk ran on until the meal was finished  then the burly man bowed pleasantly and the two separated  when tom rejoined his brothers sam asked him about the man  im sure ive seen him before he said  but where is more than i can say  i think ive seen him too said dick  and i must say i dont much like his looks  when tom told of the conversation that had been held dick shook his head seriously  i wouldnt talk so much tom he remarked  it wont do any good and it may do harm you know  ill be more careful hereafter dick  i am sorry myself that i had so much to say returned tom      chapter xviii  the rover boys in chicago   chicago  change cars for st louis and the west  the long express had rolled into the great depot and the porters were busy brushing up the passengers in the parlor cars and gathering together their baggageand incidentally the tips which were forthcoming  the rover boys were soon out on the platform and making for the street  cab sir coupe  mornin papers  all de news  have a paper boss  the crowd of newsboys and hackmen made dick smile  its a good deal like new york isnt it he observed  yes indeed replied sam  where shall we goto the western palace  we might as well  the sooner we find this jack wumble the better  at that moment the burly man who had talked to tom in the dining car brushed up to them  goodmorning my young friend he said to tom  can i be of any assistance to you  it i dont know as you can replied tom coldly  i guess we can find our way around  glad to help you if i can went on the man  we want to get to the western palace put in sam before his brothers could stop him  that is quite a distance from here  the man hesitated a moment i was going there myself  if you dont mind riding on a street car ill show you the way  a street car is good enough for us returned sam  he was anxious to see more of the stranger for he wished if possible to recollect where he had seen the fellow before  a passing car was hailed and they all got on board each carrying a valise for the rover boys had decided that trunks would be too cumbersome for the trip  they sat close together and during the ride the stranger endeavored to make himself as agreeable as possible  my name is henry bradner he said introducing himself  out in the mines they used to call me lucky harry and a good many of my friends call me that still  may i ask your names  my name is sam rover said the boy  this is my brother dick and this my brother tom  there were handshakings all around  glad to know you said bradner  i hope you find jack wumble and that he locates your mine for you  ive been thinking that ive seen you before said sam bluntly but for the life of me i cant place you  perhaps weve met somewhere in the eastnew york for instance have any of you been in chicago before  no  its a great city and there are many sights worth seeing  if you wished i wouldnt mind showing you around a bit this afternoon or tomorrow  thanks but we wont have time said dick shortly  this offhanded invitation made him more suspicious than ever  the talking continued until at last henry bradner stopped the car  here we are he said  the palace of the west is one block down yonder side street  the palace of the west repeated tom  i thought it was called the western palace  well its all the same laughed the man  but it was not the same by any means  while the western palace was a firstclass hotel in every respect the palace of the west was a weak imitation run by a man who had once been a notorious san francisco blackleg  the hotel was soon reached and bradner led the way into the office which was filled with rather roughlooking sports all smoking and talking loudly  i know the clerk said bradner  ill ask him about your friend  and before dick could stop him he had pushed his way to the desk and was talking in a low tone to the clerk  dick tried to catch what was said but was unable to do so  you are in luck said bradner on coming back  the clerk says jack wumble has gone off for the day but said he would be back by tonight sure  im glad of that said tom and he and his brothers felt much relieved  the clerk cautioned me to keep quiet about wumble went on bradner confidentially  it seems wumble and another man had a row over a game of cards and wumble wants the other man to clear out before he shows up again  the other man is booked for denver on the afternoon train  as this statement about cards fitted in with what mr rover had said concerning jack wumble the boys swallowed it without hesitation and they were inclined to believe that henry bradner was all right after all  will you register here went on the man  no i dont like the looks of the place answered dick promptly we are not of the drinking kind he added  the burly man looked dark and disappointed  its a good hotel when once you get used to it he said  but dick shook his head and said he would go elsewhere and motioning to tom and sam he led the way to the sidewalk once more henry bradner followed them  if i see wumble shall i get him to wait for you he said  if you wish  we will be around tonight and also tomorrow morning to see him  all right  the boys walked off and around the corner into the street where the cars were running  i dont like him at all exclaimed dick  i believe he is tip to some game  oh you may be too suspicious declared sam  what game can he be up to  he was kind enough to help us hunt up this jack wumble  i dont carehis manner doesnt suit me at all  hes a sneak if ever there was one  the boys walked on for a distance of several blocks and then coming to a nicelooking restaurant went in for dinner  while they were eating dick happened to glance out of the show window of the place and gave a low cry  what is it dick asked tom  i thought as much  that man is watching us  sam and tom gave a look but by this time henry bradner had disappeared from view  you are sure that you saw him dick asked sam  i am positive  boys do you know what i think  i  think he is a sharper and imagines he has three green country boys with money to deal with  well if he thinks that he is much mistaken was toms comment in the first place we are not so very green and in the second our cash account is rather limited  we spoke about a mine and he may imagine that we carry several thousands of dollars with us  if hes a sharper why did he try to find wumble for us asked sam  this was a poser and dick did not pretend to answer it  the dinner finished they walked forth once more and down into the heart of the city  they soon found what looked to be a fairly good hotel and engaged a large room with two beds for the night  now we can take a look around said tom  the best part of the afternoon was spent in sightseeing and the boys visited lincoln park jackson park the museum menagerie masonic temple and numerous other points of interest  they were returning to the hotel at which they had registered for the night when suddenly tom caught his brothers by the arm  well i never he gasped  what do you think of that  they saw he was gazing across the way and looking in the direction saw an elegant hotel over the broad doorway of which was stretched the sign  western palace george lavelle proprietor established 1871  by jinks  that bradner deceived us gasped dick  this must be the hotel father mentioned  but what about jack wumble began sam  he was registered at the other place  did you see the register demanded dick  no but  well soon learn the truth went on the elder rover  come on and he made his way through the mass of moving wagons and trucks to the opposite side of the thoroughfare  all entered the broad hallway together  the floor was of marble and big mirrors lined every wall  certainly the place was in sharp contrast to that known as the palace of the west  walking up to the office counter dick inspected the register  on the third page from the last written upon he found the entry  jack wumble denver room 144  there what do you think of that he demanded as he showed his brothers the entry  both were dumfounded and for the moment knew not what to say dick turned to one of the clerks  is mr jack wumble in he asked  the clerk looked at the row of keys behind him  no sir hes out  have you any idea when he will be back  i have not  perhaps he is back already and over in the smoking room  i dont know him personally but i am very anxious to see him  ill have a boy look for him returned the clerk and called up a bellboy who took dicks card and went off with it to the smoking room and the dining hall calling softly as he passed one man and another number 144  number 144  presently the bellboy came back followed by a tall thin and pleasantfaced man of sixty wearing a lightchecked suit and a broadbrimmed slouch hat  this is the gentleman sir he said to dick  are you mr jack wumble asked dick curiously  thats my handle lad was the answer in a broad musical voice and i see your card reads richard rover  any relation to andy rover as used to be a mining expert  i am his son  well well  his son eh  glad to know you downright glad  and jack wumble nearly wrung dicks hand off  then tom and dick were introduced and more handshaking followed and the boys felt that they had found a true friend beyond a doubt      chapter xix  the burly strangers little game   im more than glad to have met you as we did said dick a little later after jack wumble had asked the boys about their father  i think it has saved us from getting into a lot of trouble  and he related the particulars of the meeting with henry bradner and what the stranger had said and done concerning wumble  the snake ejaculated the old miner passionately  hes a sharp true as you are born  why i never put up at the palace of the west in my life  i wish i knew what his game was went on dick  you will know dickif i can get my hands on him  do you reckon as how he is over to that other hotel now  more than likely  unless he shadowed us to here burst out tom  if he did that he must know his game is up and you can be sure he will keep out of sight  the matter was talked over and it was decided that jack wumble and the boys should go to the other hotel without delay  on the way dick told the old miner what had brought them to the west  jack wumble took a deep interest in all mining schemes and listened closely to all the youth had to say  yes i remember about the eclipse mine he said  and i remember this arnold baxter too  he was a bad one and if i and some others had our say he would have dangled from a tree for his stealings for you see we didnt have no jails in those days and stealing was a capital crime  it will you help us to locate the mine before arnold baxter or his confederates can get on the ground  we will pay you for your trouble  certainly ill do what i can  but idont want any of anderson rovers pilenot me  why your father nursed me through the worst case o fever a miner ever hadan i aint forgittin it lads ill stick to ye to the end  and the old miner put out his hand and gave another squeeze that made dick wince  the palace of the west reached wumble pushed his way into the smokeladen office and to the desk  say is there a man named jack wumble stopping here he demanded  jack wumble repeated the clerk slowly  thats what i said  there is a jack wimple stopping herebut he is outgone to st louis  jack wimple  hes not the man and the old miner fell back and repeated what had been said to the three boys  perhaps bradner made a mistake suggested tom  but i dont believe it  he tried to make us believe this hotel and the western palace were one and the same put in sam  hes sharp i tell you declared jack wumble  just wait till i get on his trail ill make him tell us the truth  more than likely he wanted to clean you boys out  they waited around for the best part of an hour but henry bradner failed to return and at last they gave up looking for him and the boys went back to where they had hired a room for the night promising to rejoin jack wumble early in the morning when the whole party would take a train for denver where wumble wished to transact a little business before starting out for larkspur creek  the boys had not slept very well on the train so they were thoroughly tired out  they were on the point of retiring when a bellboy came up stating that their friend wished to see dick for a few minutes  wumble must have forgotten something said dick  ill see what it is and he took the elevator to the ground floor  to his surprise it was not wumble who wished to see him but henry bradner  what you cried the youth  i thought you had skipped out  skipped out queried the burly man in pretended surprise  why should i skip out  dont you know that we have found you out  found me out  you are talking in riddles young man  and the stranger drew himself up proudly  we have found mr jack wumble and he tells us that he never stopped at the palace of the west in his life  mr jack wimple you mean  why he is certainly at the hotelor was  we were looking for mr wumbleand you know it  i care nothing for your mr wimple  and besides you told us that the western palace and the palace of the west were one and the same  that was a deliberate falsehood  bradner turned pale and looked as if he wished to catch dick by the throat  have a care young man he hissed  i am not a man to be trifled with  i tried to do you a good turn but i see i have put my foot into it  henceforth you can take care of yourself  so speaking henry bradner turned on his heel and strode off a look of baffled rage in his eyes  instantly dick turned to a bellboy  run up to room 233 and tell tom rover to come down at once and follow his brother he said hurriedly  i cant go upi want to watch that man for hes a crook  the boy seemed to understand and flew for the stairs the elevator being out of sight  dick ran to the door to behold bradner standing on the sidewalk as if undecided which way to pursue his course  but presently he walked slowly up the street  dick followed him and had gone less than half a block when tom joined him all out of breath with running  what is it dick  it was bradner who came to smooth matters over  i am following him to see if i cant get on to his game  oh what nerve  i should think he would have been afraid to come near us  hes a bold one tom and we must look out that we dont get bit by him  henry bradner covered half a dozen blocks of the street upon which the hotel was located and then turned into a narrow thoroughfare running toward the chicago river  here were a number of low drinking places and in front of one of these he stopped  instead of entering the resort by the main door he went in through a side hallway which led to a rear room  perhaps he is stopping here suggested tom as the two lads came to a halt  well if that is so we had better remember the place answered dick  there was an alleyway alongside of the house and looking into this the boys saw a light shining out of several windows near the rear of the resort  let us take a peep into the windows suggested dick and led the way  to let out some of the tobacco smoke the windows were pulled down partly from the top  the bottom sashes were covered with halfcurtains of imitation lace but so flimsy that the boys saw through them without difficulty  bradner had just entered this rear room and was gazing around inquiringly  now he stalked over to a table near one of the windows and dropped heavily into a chair  im afraid the jig is up he said addressing somebody on the opposite side of the table  what has happened asked the other person and now the two rover boys were amazed to learn that the party was dan baxter  the bully had changed his dress and also the style of wearing his hair and was sporting a pair of nose glasses  they have met the real jack wumble and found out that i was fooling them about the hotel  thats too bad cried dan baxter  you must have made a bad break of it bradner  i did my best but i couldnt keep them from looking around although i offered to conduct them  you can bet if i had had them under my care they wouldnt have got near the western palace nor jack wumble either  did you have a man ready to play the part of wumble questioned dan baxter after the burly one had ordered drinks for the two  yes i had bill noxton all cocked and primed  but now our cake is doughand after all the trouble ive taken for your father too and henry bradner uttered a snort of disgust  did you warn this noxton  oh yes and i put a flea into the ear of the hotel clerk too but the thing is what do you suppose your father will want done next  dont ask me answered dan baxter recklessly   he dont half trust me any more  he says im only good to sponge on him and the former bully of putnam hall gave a bitter laugh  well i havent followed these rovers all the way from valley brook farm to here for nothing went on henry bradner  your father wanted em watched and ive watched em ever since they came home from that boarding academy  it was a big job too  didnt they suspect you  one of em said he thought he had seen me before  and bradner laughed  it was at the valley brook church  i followed them to the church just to keep my word to your father  and you are certain mr rover isnt coming west  no hes laid up with a game leg and wont move for a month  i got that straight from the hired man  there was a pause  what do you reckon i had best do next  telegraph to my father at denveryou know his assumed name and let him advise you  i suppose the boys and that wumble will go straight through to the mining district now  more than likely  then father and roebuck will have to stop them out there although how its to be done i dont know  at this juncture a waiter came forward and closed down the window and the balance of the conversation was lost to the two rover boys       chapter xx  just a little too late   what do you think of that whispered dick as he led the way back to the sidewalk  its all as plain as day replied his brother  this bradner was set to watch the house immediately after the robbery occurred more than likely he was around at the time of the robbery  do you suppose he is the man who helped arnold baxter to escape from prison on that forged pardon  creation  it may be so ejaculated tom  ill tell you one thing we ought to have them both arrested at once  i dont know about that mused the elder rover  if we do that then how are we to find out where arnold baxter is or this fellow they called roebuck  but they may slip through our fingers if we dont have them locked up  the two brothers talked the matter ever and then decided late as it was to call upon jack wumble for advice  you can go for him said dick  ill continue to watch this place  if they leave ill throw bits of paper on the sidewalk and you can follow the trail just as if we were playing a game of hare and hounds  tom made off at top speed carefully noting the street and number so that he would not miss his way when returning  left to himself dick went into the alleyway again and looked through the window as before  dan baxter and bradner were still conversing but the youth could not hear what was said  presently the pair at the table arose settled for their drinks and came out of the place  they walked up the street and around a corner and dick followed scattering bits of an old letter as he went along  when the letter was used up he tore to bits some handbills which he found in the street  eight squares were covered before dan baxter and bradner reached a dingy looking hotel which went by the name of lakemans rest  it was set in the middle of the block with brick houses on either side of it  they entered a narrow hallway and by the light above the door dick saw them ascend the stairs to the second floor  there now seemed nothing to do but to await toms return and the youth retired to the opposite side of the street  it was lateafter midnight in factand the street was practically deserted  a half hour went by and dick felt as if his brother would never return when he heard swift footsteps behind him  so this is your game eh cried the voice of bradner and of a sudden a club descended upon dicks head and he went down as if shot  the man had looked out of the hotel window and spotted dick and had gone out by a back way add around the square to make certain of his victim  that was a good crack came from dan baxter  it serves him right for following you  bradner was about to bend over his victim to ascertain how badly dick was hurt when the footsteps of two men approaching made him draw back  come we dont want to be caught whispered dan baxter nervously and then as the footsteps came closer he darted away with henry bradner at his heels  they did not stop until a long distance away from the scene of the dastardly attack  the men who were approaching were a couple of bakers who were employed in a neighboring bakery  vas ist dis cried one of them as he stumbled over dicks body a young mans  he is drunk carl said the other  let him be or you may get into trouble  maype he vos hurt or sick said the german baker bending down i vos know der cop on dis beat and he knows i vos no footpad  just then dick gave a shiver and a groan and both bakers realized that he was suffering in some way  while the german remained by the boys side the other ran to the bakery for a lantern and assistance  soon a small crowd had collected and dick was carried into the bakery and made as comfortable as the means permitted  one of the bakers went on a hunt for a policeman and presently the officer of the law hove into sight  dick was just coming to his senses but was too dazed for several minutes to give an account of what had happened  at last he said a man had struck him down with a club  were you robbed asked the policeman  dick felt in his various pockets  no sir  you were lucky  i dink ve scare der rascal avay said the german baker  more than likely  its a pity you didnt collar him  the policeman turned to dick  shall i call up an ambulance  i dont think its necessary sir  my brother will be along this way soon  i was waiting for him to come when i was struck  you were out rather late remarked the officer of the law suspiciously  i was watching a rascal who tried to make trouble for me  then there must be more to this case than what you just told me  there is  in that case you had better go to police headquarters with me  i am willing  but wont you wait until my brother gets here  there was no need to wait for at that moment tom appeared on the scene accompanied by jack wumble  they both stared at dick in horror  oh dick you are hurt cried tom  not very much  bradner hit me on the head  i am glad i am alive  and where is the rascal now questioned the old miner  ran away  and dan baxter queried tom  gone too i suppose  they must have been together  and then dick related what had occurredso far as he knewsince tom had left him  the officer of the law accompanied all three to the police station and here the boys told their story and a watch was set for bradner and dan baxter  but nothing came of this for the pair left chicago early the next day  we had better keep close together after this said jack wumble as he was seeing the boys back to their hotel  i reckon youve got a mighty bad crowd to deal with  and he remained with them for the balance of the night  the express for denver left at eleven oclock in the morning and all of the party of four were on hand to catch it  soon they were whirling over the fields and through the forests toward the mighty mississippi river  never been west aforeeh remarked jack wumble  well you will see some grand sights i can tell ye that  no we have never been west answered sam  but we have been to africa he added proudly  gee shoo is that so  well thats long traveling certainly  but i reckon id rather see my own country first  we went to africa for a purpose said tom and told of the rescue of his father  the old miner listened with keen appreciation and at the conclusion clapped tom on the back  youre true blue tom he cried  you and your brothers will pull through i feel sure of it  and then he fell to telling about his own life and how he had become acquainted with anderson rover and his partner kennedy and of the various bad things arnold baxter had done in those days  this man seems to be a chip of the old block he concluded  the trip to denver was full of interest and dick was sorry he did not have a camera along that he might take snapshots of the scenery  yet he was impatient to get to his destination and stake out the missing eclipse mine before arnold baxter and his confederates should have the chance to do so  it was the afternoon of the next day when denver was reached and a light rain was falling  jack wumble wished to put up at a hotel called the miners rest a favorite resort with men from the mining districts  he had been negotiating for the sale of one of his mines and thought he could close the deal the next morning  and then well be off for larkspur creek without further delay was what he told dick       chapter xxi  off for the mining district   while jack wumble was off attending to his private business the three rover boys took a stroll through denver  the city was different from any they had visited and their walk was full of interest  coming to a store in the window of which were exhibited a number of indian curiosities the boys halted to examine the objects when tom uttered a sudden cry  look dick  there is bradner inside  yes and dan baxter is with him returned the elder brother quickly  heres luck surely  will you have them locked up asked sam  to be sureif we can  the boys looked around for a policeman but none happened to be in sight  run and see if you can find one said dick to sam  tom and i can watch the pair  at once sam made off  but policemen were not numerous and it took quite some time to locate one and explain what was wanted   in the meantime dan baxter had caught sight of tom and told bradner of his discovery  boy and man came out of the store in a great hurry  they were about to run off when dick caught bradner by the arm while his brother halted the former bully of putnam hall  let go of me hissed bradner and as dick paid no attention he aimed a blow for the youths head  but dick had been there before and dodged and the force of his effort nearly took the rascal off his feet  before he could recover dick had him down on his back and was sitting on his chest  tom was having a lively time with dan baxter  the bully hit the boy in the shoulder and tom retaliated with a sharp crack that landed straight on baxters nose and drew blood  a fight a fight yelled a passing newsboy and as if by magic a crowd began to collect  again baxter struck out but his blow fell short and now tom gave him one in the ear that spun him half around  by this time the bully felt that he had had enough of the encounter and breaking through the crowd he set off on a mad run down the street and around the nearest comer  feeling it would be useless to try to catch dan baxter just then tom turned his attention to dick and henry bradner  bradner was struggling hard to get up but dick was master of the situation so tom had little to do  whats the meaning of this demanded the policeman as soon as he came upon the scene  i want this man arrested answered dick as he got up but still kept close to bradner  what has he done  he is a sharper of the worst kind  you are sure of this  i am  you will have to go to the station house with us if i take the man in continued the policeman  i am willing answered dick quietly  muttering angrily to himself henry bradner arose  he wanted to run away but got no chance to do so  soon the station house was reached and here dick and his brothers told their story  the assault happened in another state said the officer at the desk  the most we can do is to hold him until the illinois authorities send for him  why thats harry the crook from gunnison put in an officer who had just come in  he is wanted here on half a dozen charges  at these words bradner turned deadly pale  this is aa mistake he faltered  i know nothing of the man you mention  too thin harry i know you well replied the officer  captain he is a bad one he continued to his superior  an investigation into the records was made and a picture in the rogues gallery proved that bradner and harry the crook were one and the same beyond a doubt  in that case well hold him right here said the police captain  the matter was talked over with dick and the youth decided to let his own charge against the crook drop as he did not wish to waste time in denver on the case  an hour later the three rovers departed leaving henry bradner to a fate he richly deserved  that is one of our enemies disposed of observed dick as they walked back to the hotel  i wish we could do up the baxters just as easily  the following day found them on the way to gunnison  nothing more had been seen or heard of dan baxter nor had anything turned up concerning arnold baxter and roebuck the man who was with him and who hid helped him to escape from prison  the country was now mountainous in the extreme with here and there a wild weird canyon thousands of feet deep some of the awful pitfalls made sam fairly hold his breath  gosh he murmured  this beats africa doesnt it  who ever saw such lofty peaks beforeand such rivers cut out of the solid rock  the boys found gunnison a small mining city containing perhaps six thousand souls  a few of the buildings were quite up to date but the majority were little better than shanties  but gunnison was a center for the trade of many miles around and business was brisk  at gunnison the entire party procured horses from a dealer jack wumble knew beasts that were strong and used to mountain traveling  we might go on for twenty miles or so by rail but this is the best place for fitting out said the old miner  we can strike a putty fair trail from here leading directly to larkspur creek  and how far is that mining district from here asked tom  as the birds fly about sixtyfive miles  but the trail makes it a good hundred miles and some putty stiff climbin at that  im glad ye are used to roughin it for this traveling dont go well with a tenderfoot  the day was clear and the air bracing and the boys started off with their friend in the best of spirits  soon the city was left behind and then began a journey along the foothills which seemed to have no end  if arnold baxter is watching us he is taking precious good care to keep out of sight said tom as they rode along in single file with jack wumble in the lead  no doubt dan has joined his father and told him of bradners fate returned dick  but we have got to keep our eyes wide open we all know what a wretch arnold baxter is and out in this wild country almost anything is liable to happen  on and on they went first over a stubble of thin grass and then through a forest of tall pine trees  rocks were everywhere and the trail wound in and out with an occasional watercourse to be forded  these watercourses are all right now observed jack wumble  but in the early spring when the snow on the mountains begins to melt they become raging torrents and getting across em is out of the question  how far are yonder peaks from here asked sam pointing ahead  about twenty miles  gracious as far as that  i didnt know one could see so clearly for such a long distance  they look to me to be only about three miles  the air is very pure and clear out here lad  no better air in this wide world than that of colorady  at noon they came to a halt in a little hollow protected alike from the breeze and the direct rays of the overhead sun  their saddle bags were filled with provisions and tom and sam began to prepare their first meal in the open with dick and the old miner assisting  after the meal jack wumble took a smoke and a ten minutes nap and during that time the three boys strolled off in various directions sam going ahead on the trail  presently the youngest rover had his eye arrested by a post set up in the middle of the trail  to the top of the post was tacked a sheet of white paper  this is queer thought sam and drew closer to inspect the sheet on it were written the words in pencil    to the rovers and their friend    if you want to keep out of trouble you will return to gunnison at   once  if you dare to push on to larkspur creek it may cost you   your lives  we are watching you and are fully armed and you had   better be warned in time    the rightful owners of the mine      chapter xxi  lost in the mountains   dick  tom  jack  come here and see what i have found  sams cry was a loud one and soon the others came up on a run jack wumble pistol in hand for his life in the open had taught him to be forever prepared for danger  wot is it lad asked the old miner anxiously  its a quit notice for us answered sam soberly  i can tell you the baxters mean to carry matters with a high hand  all of the others read the notice in silence  then dick thrust his hands into his pockets coolly  ill see them hanged before ill go back he said  i am with you added tom  but we must be cautious after this or the baxters will be firing at us from an ambush  if only we could catch sight of them put in sam  they ought to be shot on sight  the boys looked at jack wumble who had remained silent  do you advise us to go back asked dick hastily  i cant say as i do lads was the slow response  yet it might be better to do that nor to be shot down and have yer body thrown into a canyon added wumble speaking in his old time vernacular  perhaps your father would rather have ye back  i dont believe it burst out tom  father never wanted cowards for sons  dick caught the paper tore it down and ripped it in two throwing it to the wind  i say im going ahead  so am i came from both of his brothers  but you need not go jack went on dick  we dont wish you to run into danger and  hold up dick i said i would see ye through and i will cried the old miner  but i want ye to realize what ye are doing thats all  if you are shot down it will be yer own fault so to speak  but we dont intend to be shot down interrupted tom  we have run up against the baxters before so we know how to be careful  it aint like as if they were in a city in the east went on the old miner  here some men are mighty free with their shootinirons  and they could take a shot at ye from a long distance with a good rifle  thus talking the entire party walked back to their camp and sat down to discuss the situation in detail  perhaps we had better not advance until dark said dick  if we advance now we will simply be making targets of ourselves and he shivered in spite of himself  we wont advance at all put in jack wumble briefly  we would be wuss nor fools if we didwith them human wildcats awatchin of us and he began to puff vigorously at his short stump of a briarroot pipe  but you said began tom when the old miner waved him to silence  let me think it out lads and then ill tell ye my plan  well trick emthats best and he began to smoke again  satisfied that jack wumble knew the ground to be covered better than they did the boys decided to let him have his own way so long as the object of the expedition should be advanced  they sat down in the shade to rest and thus several hours passed and the old miner smoked up half a dozen pipefuls of his favorite plug mixture  ive got it he cried at last  if we kin work the deal well keep em guessing  and he laughed softly to himself  his plan was a simple one  several miles back on the trail there was a fork the second trail running to the northward  his plan was to ride back to the fork and then in the darkness of the night to take to the second trail  that dont lead to larkspur creek he said  but it leads to go lightly gulch and from there i know an old indian trail which leads to the larkspur by way of bender mountain  its dangerous trail to ride but its safe too so far as our enemies are concerned for they cant cover it from any other part of the mountains  they would either have to be right in front of us or right behind and in that case wed have as much of a show at them as they would have at us  thats a good plan exclaimed dick  let us adopt it by all means  slowly the afternoon wore away until the sun was lost to view behind the great rocky mountains in the west  as soon as the shadows became long and deep jack wumble arose  now i reckon we can begin to ride on the back trail he said with a shrewd smile on his rugged face  it was an easy matter to saddle the horse again  the rest had made the animals as fresh as ever and this was a good thing as the old miner calculated to ride a long distance between sunset and sunrise  i suppose our enemies are watching every move we make said tom but i must say i cant catch a single glance of them  i thought i saw a speck or two of something over the hill to the south said dick  jack wumble nodded  you are right dick i saw the specks too and they were men looking in this direction  but they might not have been our enemies  if only we had a good field glass sighed sam  i was going to bring one along but i forgot all about it  they rode on slowly the old miner not wishing to reach the fork in the trail until it was quite dark  fortunately it was clouding up so that not even the stars would be left to betray them  we are coming to the fork said wumble about eight oclock keep your eyes peeled lads and if you see anything out of the ordinary let me know at once  there was a tiny stream to cross and then the way led around a series of sharp rocks  keep to the grass as much as possible cautioned the old miner in a voice that was a mere whisper  and now follow me as fast as you can  away he bounded in the lead and the three rover boys followed around the rocks through a stretch of pines and over some fallen firs and then up and up a rugged trail where the footing was so insecure that the horses slipped continually  the branches of the drooping trees bothered them greatly and had it not been for wumbles continual warnings one or another of them would have been seriously hurt  the horses panted for breath but still the old miner kept the pace until the top of the first range of foothills was gained  here he called a halt under an overhanging rock beneath which it was as black as a dungeon  so far so good he muttered as he leaped to the ground and began to pat his heaving and perspiring animal  i dont believe they know much about where we went to even if they followed us back to the fork  i dont believe they are following us said dick as he placed his ear to the ground and listened  all was as silent as the grave  they remained under the rock the best part of an hour allowing their trusty animals to get back their wind and strength  during this time wumble walked back a short distance and tom climbed up to the top of the rock but neither made any discovery of importance  it was a little after midnight when they moved forward again their pace was now little better than a walk for the trail was a dangerous one and in many spots they had to leap down and lead their horses  once they came to a gully six to eight feet wide without a bridge and it took a good deal of urging to get toms horse to make the leap across  if a fellow should tumble in there where would he go to asked sam with a shudder  hed go out of sight forever replied wumble solemnly  some of those cuts are a thousand feet deep  what a mighty upheaval of nature there must have been here at one time said dick  by three oclock in the morning tom was completely fagged out and could scarcely keep his eyes open  gradually he dragged behind the others his eyes closing every few minutes in spite of his efforts to keep them open  i wish i had a cup of strong coffee to keep me awake he murmured  how much further are you going jack  a couple of miles or so answered the old miner  want a smoke you can have my pipe  thank you but i dont smoke and i guess it would only make me feel worse answered tom  he began to drop further and further behind  the other boys spoke to him but they were in reality nearly as much worn out as their brother and had all they could do to keep wumble in sight  at last toms head fell forward on his breast and on the instant he went fast asleep  his horse continued to move forward but coming to a fork in the trail took the downward path that being the easier to travel  on and on went the beast until striking a smooth road he set off on a gallop  the violent motion aroused tom and he stared about him in bewilderment  dick  sam he called out  where are you  no answer came back and he sat bolt upright in alarm  nobody was in sight nor could he hear a sound saving the hoof beats of his own horse  he drew rein instantly  dick he called loudly  jack wumble  where are you  not a sound came in replynot even the cry of a birdall was absolutely silent  tom gave something of a gasp  he realized his position only too well  he was lost in the mountains      chapter xxiii  tom meets the enemy   oh what a fool i was to fall asleep  thus spoke poor tom to himself as he continued to gaze around him and call out to one side was the high mountain to the other a deep valley filled with giant trees and on both sides an utter loneliness which seemed to penetrate his very soul  like a flash there came over him the various stories he had heard of men being lost in these mountains and wandering around for days and weeks until their very reason forsook them  was he too doomed to such a horrible fate  fervidly he prayed to heaven that such an ending might not overtake him  then with care he turned his horse about thinking to gain the point where he had become separated from the rest and feeling that they must sooner or later turn back to look for him  once he imagined that he heard somebody calling him  but the sound was so far away he was not sure and the echo was such that he could not determine from what direction the call emanated  yet he yelled in return nearly splitting his throat in his endeavor to make himself heard  for the time being the enemy was completely forgotten  toms turning back as he thought he was doing only made matters worse for the horse branched off on another trailbut so slender that it soon gave out altogether and left him on the trackless mountain side and several miles from the fork where his steed had made the first mistake  yet he pressed on calling again and again but receiving no answer  twice he imagined he heard pistol shots and this gave him the idea of firing his own weapon and he emptied the cylinder but with no good to himself  then he reloaded and came to a dead stop he had never been more lonely in his life  the balance of the night dragged so slowly that tom thought it would never come morning again  with the first streak of light in the east he arose from the rock upon which he had thrown himself and running to a higher point gazed eagerly around him  he felt as robinson crusoe must have done on his deserted island on all sides were rocks and hills mountains and valleys some bare and others covered with growths of pines and firs  here and there glistened a rushing stream or a lofty waterfall and on one of the hills he saw a herd of mule deer and on another a solitary rocky mountain goat  but nowhere was there the first sign of a human being  tom stood there for fully ten minutes his breast heaving and his heart sinking within him like a lump of lead  he was alone absolutely alone in that wild and almost trackless region  what was to be done  over and over he asked himself the question and the answer always remained a blank  he knew not which way to turn for going on might bring him into worse difficulty  and yet he could not think of remaining still where he was for the very thought was maddening  he must try to do something be the consequence what it might  then he realized that his mouth was dry and that he was hungry this made him remember that all of the provisions were loaded on the horses ridden by jack wumble and dick  his own steed bore only some mining tools  i wish i could swap the tools for something to eat he mused but there is no use in crying over spilt milk  im in a pickle and i must do my best to get myself out of it  at a short distance he saw a small hollow which had become partly filled by the rain of several days before  he walked to the hollow and drank his fill and then led his horse thither  were lost old man he said patting the beast on the neck  we must find the others  youll help wont you  and the horse pricked up his ears and looked around wisely as if he understood every word  at that moment tom felt that a horse is indeed mans best friend  he soon set off but slowly trying to locate the trail which had brought him astray and trying at the same time by the rising sun to determine the direction in which his brothers and jack wumble had passed  but as before his efforts were misleading and by the middle of the forenoon he found himself on a barren hilltop with no chance of leaving it excepting by the way he had come  it was truly disheartening and hot tired and discouraged he leaped again to the ground  he was now very hungry without a morsel to satisfy the cravings of his stomach  his steed too wanted for something to eat and gnawed eagerly at the spare vegetation as soon as permitted  tom was wondering what should be his next move when he was startled by the appearance of a mule deer on the hillside just below him as he gazed at the animal he soon saw another and then another until the hillside seemed to be covered with them  i suppose men never come here to disturb them he thought bitterly  i wonder if i could bring one down with my pistol ive got matches and cooked deers meat would be first class  he crept as close as he could to the deer  fortunately the breeze was blowing up the hill toward him so the animals could not scent him readily  when he had gotten as near as he thought possible he took careful aim and blazed away twice in quick succession  his first shot was a failure but his second landed in the deers front leg breaking that member at the knee and pitching the deer headlong  at once the rest of the herd took alarm and went off like the wind down the hillside into the valley and up another hill a good mile away  at the same time the wounded beast tried to rise but before it could do so tom ran closer and put three more balls into it and then it rolled over gave a jerk or two and remained quiet forever  the sight of such a feast made toms heart much lighter and he brought out his pocketknife and cut out some of the steaks  then he moved down the hillside to where some brush promised abundant firewood and better forage for his horse  the fire was soon lit and blazing away merrily and the boy began to broil his steaks  perhaps dick and the others will see the smoke he thought  i trust they do for i dont want to put in a whole night alone  tom ate his meal slowly for he did not know what to do after it was finished  he wished he knew how far the nearest settlement was and in what direction  after he had eaten his fill he tied the balance of the steaks in a corner of his blanket for the food must be kept for future use then he walked up to the top of the hill for another look around  suddenly he caught sight of a man riding swiftly toward hima heavyset man with busky whiskers and a face that was almost black from constant exposure to the elements  hullo youngster cried the man when he was within hailing distance  all alone here  i am cried tom and he felt something of joy to see a human being again  what brought you away out here  hunting  not exactly although i did bring down yonder animal with a jerk of the thumb toward the deer  ive lost my way  did you really  thats bad  its lucky i ran across you whats your handle   tom rover answered the youth boldly  what is yours  noxton  so you are all alone  yes  tom was trying to think where he had heard that name but could not remember  are you alone  well hardly  bill noxton hesitated for a moment  i was alone but day before yesterday i fell in with a couple of englishmen who are out here to see the sights and they hired me to show em around  our camp is just below here  will you come down an be introduced to the beefeaters  i suppose i might as well answered tom never suspecting any trick  i certainly dont want to remain alone any longer  then come on  i told the beefeaters i would be back inside of half an hour  the man waited for tom to mount and then led the way down the hillside and into the valley  there was a patch of forest to pass and they came out in a clearing on another hill overlooking a mountain stream which flowed a hundred feet below  here we are cried bill noxton as he suddenly wheeled behind tom  shall i introduce you mr rover  tom looked ahead and his heart dropped  there around a campfire sat arnold baxter and his son dan and a man who was a stranger to him  clearly he was trapped and in the hands of the enemy           chapter xxiv  the search for the missing boy   tom isnt here  it was dick who uttered the words as of a sudden he wheeled around on the dark trail and tried to penetrate the blackness of night behind them  isnt here demanded jack wumble while sam set up a cry of dismay  no  tom  tom  sam joined in the cry and so did the old miner but as we already know it was useless  this is the wust yet growled jack wumble  i told ye all to keep close to me  perhaps he fell asleep  i know he was dead tired answered dick hitting the plain truth  well have to go back for him said sam and turned without delay for going ahead without tom was all out of the question  yes well go back rejoined the old miner  but go slow or you may make matters wuss  i kin follow a clear trail even of three hosses but i cant follow a trail mixed up backward an forward  they rode back slowly until at least half a mile had been covered then they shouted but only a dismal echo came back  dick fancied once that he heard tom calling but was not sure  daylight found them still searching around dick and sam with more sober faces than they had worn in many a day  they knew only too well the danger of becoming lost in those wild mountains  perhaps he has fallen in with baxters party suggested dick as they came to a halt at the edge of a cliff overlooking a rushing river far below  it was past the breakfast hour yet none of them felt like eating  be careful how you expose yourself observed jack wumble as he screened himself and his horse behind some brush  it wont do no good to tom to let your enemies see you  if only we hadnt lost the trail sighed sam  the back trail had disappeared on some rocks half an hour before and all efforts to take it up again had proved unsuccessful  the rover boys felt very much disheartened  without tom what was the use of going ahead to locate the missing mine  hes worth a dozen mines said dick  we must find himwe simply must  but they were stumped to use sams way of expressing it and with nothing better to do jack wumble drew further back into the bushes tethered his horse and got out the provisions for a meal the boys ate mechanically and were soon done  then wumble got out his pipe and began to smoke more vigorously than ever  if we had a field glass we might spot him he observed  he cant be such a terrible distance away  im going to fire my pistol again said dick and did so but no response came back and he reloaded as crestfallen as ever  it was a clear day but the very sun seemed a mockery as it beamed down upon them  supposing we separate and renew the hunt suggested sam but wumble slowly shook his head  none o that lad  it will only be a case of another one lost no we must keep within sight of each other no matter what we do come i have an idea of looking into the valley on the other side of this hill and then we can try the hill yonder  anything was better than sitting still and once more they rode on for the time being the enemy was almost forgotten  they were going down along the edge of the cliff when without warning dicks horse began to slip having stepped on a rock which was insecure  hi whoa yelled the youth and tried to hold the horse back then as he saw the animal could not save himself he leaped for the ground  the horse managed to scramble to a place of safety but dick in trying to avoid a dangerous hoof stroke from the beast lost his balance and went crashing down into the bushes overhanging the cliff  down and down and still down went the elder rover from one bush to another his clothing catching here and there thus partly staying his progress  but he could not stop himself entirely and reaching the stream at last he went in with a loud splash and disappeared from view  dicks gone ejaculated sam  he tried to look over the edge of the cliff oh my he will be drowned  he had heard the splash as had also wumble and now both dismounted with all speed and crept to the very edge of the bushes but the cliff bulged outward just below them and they could see nothing but a strip of the water on the opposite side  dick  dick sang out the brother  are you safe  no reply came back and sams face turned white as he looked at jack wumble  do you think he has beenbeen killed  the question nearly choked him  i cant say sam was the answer  we must git down an see  with extreme care the old miner let himself down from one clump of brush to another  his experience at prospecting stood him in good stead for he had frequently climbed down just such heights to see if the mountain stream below would pan out sufficiently to set up a claim  in the meanwhile dick had gone to the very bottom of the stream struck on the sand and rocks and come up again  in falling down he had turned over and over and he was as much dazed by this as he was by the quantity of cold water which he swallowed  for the minute after coming up he did not realize his situation  then he felt himself borne along swiftly he knew not to where  the rushing of the water was deafening for the stream was approaching a narrow canyon and here the water was lashed into a milky foam as it tumbled and tore over the rocks on its way to a broader spot quarter of a mile below  presently dick felt his feet touch bottom but only for an instant the stream was calmer now and to one side of the cut he saw a narrow strip of band leading up to a shelving of rocks with here and there a tiny brush struggling for existence in a spot which the sunlight never touched  he began to strive with might and main to reach the strip of sand and finally succeeded  then he threw himself down too exhausted to make another move  im in for it now he thought when he somewhat recovered   how in the world am i ever to get back to that trail again  he looked above him  the mountain was high here and there was nothing resembling a path leading upward  to climb from one scant footing to another would prove perilous if not impossible  we are making a mess of this expedition he groaned  first tom must get lost or worse and now i am down here like a rat in a trap  perhaps we would have been better off if we had never started out  when dick felt able he walked from one end of the sand strip to the other  this gave him no satisfaction and he began to inspect the stream again  below him was a curve and what was beyond there was no telling  if i enter the water again it may carry me along for miles before i have another chance to get out he reasoned  and then i will be just that much further away from sam and wumble  if he had had his pistol he would have fired it to let them know that he was safe and in the hope that they would come for him but the weapon had been lost in the tumble down the cliff  with much hesitation he began to climb up the side of the canyon making sure that one footing was perfectly safe before he tried another  in this manner he at length reached the height of a hundred feet  he did not dare to look back for fear of tumbling and yet the path to safety was still a long way off  if i cant gain the top and cant go back what then he asked himself and the cold perspiration stood out on his forehead in beads there was a bush in front of him and he squeezed into this so that he might sit down to consider the situation  pushed back the bush suddenly gave way altogether and to his astonishment dick fell into the opening of a large cave      chapter xxv  a cave and a bear   hullo heres something new thought dick as he gathered himself up  bush and boy had rolled downward for a distance of a dozen feet  he found himself on a rocky floor that was almost level the cave was ten to twenty feet wide and so high that in the gloom he could not see the ceiling  luckily the boys had with them the waterproof match safes which had proved so handy in africa and now dick brought out the one he carried and lit a match  the bush that had given way was dry and soon he made of it quite a respectable torch  satisfied that the cave had no side branches in which he might become lost he resolved to push into it in the hope that another opening might present itself leading to the cliff where the accident had occurred  the cave was dry and dusty not a particle of water being anywhere visible  as he walked along he came across some dead leaves and then some small tree branches  these gave him much encouragement for how could they have gotten into the place if there was no entrance from the mountain side  dick had advanced a distance of several hundred yards when he came to a turn to the right and from this point the bottom of the cave sloped gradually upward  he also made out a glimmer of light but it was so far off that nothing was to be seen distinctly  much encouraged he pushed on faster than ever until a line of rocks barred his further progress  he was about to climb the rocks when a growl from a distance caused him to pause  what was it  with bated breath dick listened until the growl was repeated  the walls of the cave took it up and it was repeated over and over again until lost in the distance  a bearor something just as bad thought the youth  now whats to do  he crouched down on the rocks and sat as still as death for fully five minutes  but no further growl reached him and then he plucked up courage enough to scramble up the rocks which led to a flooring considerably higher than that over which he had been traveling  hurrah  it was the light of day ahead and dick could scarcely suppress a shout of joy  but the growl still hung in his mind and though he went forward it was as silently as a cat and with eyes strained first in one direction and then in another  he was glad he still had the torch for he remembered that the majority of wild beasts are afraid of a light  it had burned rather low but by swinging it around he soon started up the blaze  and now he could see the cave entrance distinctly less than two hundred feet off  it was low and wide and there were several bushes growing around it  he started on a run and as he did so the growl sounded out again this time almost directly beside him  he turned swiftly and beheld two glaring eyeballs bent upon him from the gloom of a hollow on one side of the cave  whether or not the bear was preparing to leap upon him he could not say but he jumped like lightning and then tore on as if the demon of the bottomless pit was after him  the bear was following dick knew this without looking behind  the animal was heavy and clumsy yet it covered the ground with an agility that was surprising  it was hungry not having tasted meat for several days and now thought it saw the prospect of a fine meal ahead  back yelled dick but the animal paid no attention  the boy was running as never before yet the bear kept drawing closer until dick almost felt its hot breath on his neck  he trailed the torch behind him and the beast fell back several paces  the opening was now gained and the youth ran out on the mountain side which was covered with stubble and rocks  glancing hastily around dick saw one rock that was both small and rather high and scrambled to the top of this  the bear gained the mouth of the cave and looked out suspiciously then as it discovered the boy on the rock it let out another growl more terrifying than any which had gone before  slowly it trotted toward dick and then began a circle of the rock as if to determine whether or not the ground was clear for an attack  the boy still held the torch but it was burnt nearly to the end and was in danger of going out every minute  besides in the sunshine it did not look half as formidable as it had in the gloomy cave  suddenly the bear reared itself up on its hind legs and advanced straight for the rock  at this movement dicks heart seemed to stop beating  yet he managed to let out one long scream for help then as the bear came still nearer he thrust the torch end directly into the brutes face  of course the animal fell back and down went the torch on the rocks below and dick was now utterly defenseless  the bear appeared to know this and let out a growl of satisfaction as though it had its next meal already within its grizzly grasp  bang  it was the report of a gun not over a hundred yards away and the bear dropped to all fours and shook its head wildly  bang came another report and now the bear screamed with pain and fell over on its side  dick looked behind him in amazement and beheld a stranger on horseback  the stranger had just emptied his doublebarreled rifle and now he came riding up with his pistol in his hand  the bear tried to rise up to meet him but was too seriously wounded already and a shot at close range finished the brutes misery  well young fellow reckon you was in a putty tight fix remarked the stranger after he had made certain that the animal was dead  i was in a tight fix answered dick with a shiver  you came in the nick of time and i owe you a good deal for it  thats all righti never go back on a bar if i git a chance at him  but how in thunder came you in such a fix in the fust place went on the horseman who was at least six feet four in heightand about as thin a man as dick had ever seen  its a long story sir was the cautious response   may i ask who it is that has saved me  wall my right handle are james carson was the answer  but them as knows me well callers calls me slim jim and its good enough fer the likes o a shadder like me too i calkerlate  an who might you be  i am dick rover i was with my two brothers and an old miner named jack wumble when i slipped off my horse into the river over there and nearly lost my life  but i managed to crawl out and in climbing up the mountain side found yonder cave and came through to this end  in the cave i found the bear and he followed me to here you know the rest  wall wall  you have had a narrow escape youngster an no disputin the pint  ef i hadnt acome as i did thet air bar would have chawed ye up in no time  i know it mr carson your kind  whoopee rover dont go fer to mister me or ill be sorry i killed the bar for ye  im plain slim jim to all as knows meslim jim the hunter an trapper  ive spent forty year on these mountains an like ez not ill spend forty more ef the good lord allows me to live thet long  an whar do ye calkerlate your brothers and jack wumble air now  im sure i dont know  one of my brothers tom got lost and i and sam and wumble were looking for him when i had the mishap  do you know jack wumble  fer sartin i doknowned him when he war mining up on the ole bumble bee creek ez he called it  indeed cried dick  then perhaps you knew my father anderson rover  he used to be in partnership with a man named kennedy  knew himo course i knew him lad  an so you air his son hey wall wall shake  and slim jim as he preferred to be called thrust forth a hand that was as hard as a piece of horn  but he had a soft heart and dick soon learned that he was as much to be trusted as was jack wumble  ill do my best to set ye right lad said the old hunter after he had listened to the details of dicks story  i think i know about the spot whar ye took the tumble  before leaving the vicinity slim jim set to work and cut the pelt off the bear and hung it up  he also cut away some of the choicest of the meat  its a pity to leave any o it behind he observed  some poor folks astarvin to deth in the city an thars a meal fer a hundred  it was well along in the afternoon when they started dick riding behind the old hunter  he felt that he could tell slim jim about their mission and he mentioned how the baxters were watching them and trying to outwit them  i remember thet baxter too said the old hunter  wumble kin tell ye how we come nigh to makin him do a dance on nuthin onct ill take your part agin him every time hear me  and his openness showed that he meant what he said      chapter xxvi  the baxters try to make terms   for the moment after tom found himself in the presence of the baxters he could not speak  then he turned fiercely upon bill noxton  you have fooled me he cried hotly  thats right laughed noxton sarcastically  and let me add ye was fooled putty easy  its tom rover ejaculated dan baxter as he leaped to his feet followed by his parent  where did you find him noxton over to that fire  yes  were the others of the party with him put in arnold baxter quickly  no he was alone  he got lost from the rest last night when they gave us the slip in the dark  then you have seen nothing of the others said arnold baxter and it was plain to see that he was keenly disappointed  no but i reckon they cant be far off replied noxton  seeing that tom contemplated running away he made the youth dismount  better make a prisoner of him he suggested  by all means cried dan baxter and brought forth a stout lariat with this tonis hands were bound behind him and his feet were also secured  thats number one roebuck laughed arnold baxter turning to the man who had thus far remained silent  tom rover asked the man laconically  yes  a brightlooking chap  oh hes bright enough growled baxter senior  but it wont help him any put in dan bound to say something  is he the oldest of the three  no dick is the oldest  tom comes next  then it is dick you ought to have collared said roebuck turning to noxton  i collared the one i happened to see  well tom rover how do you like your situation asked dan with a sickly smile as the men turned away to discuss the situation among themselves  dont like it replied tom as lightly as he could   i guess you are sorry now that you didnt heed our warning and go back to gunnison  im not particularly sorry  i have as much right out here as anybody  oh you neednt put on airs to me  i know you are trembling in your boots  thanks but if youll bring your chin out of the air baxter youll see that i am wearing shoes  dont you put on airs with me tom rover  you are in our power and you shall suffer for the way you have treated my father and me in the past  i have no doubt baxter now i am helpless that you will do your worst  you were always ready to take an unfair advantage of another  this answer made dan baxter boil with rage and he stepped closer and shook his fist in toms face  you be careful or illill crack you one he blustered  youre a cheerful brute dan i must say  why dont you try to fight fair for once  it would be such a delightful change  i do fight fair  you and your brothers have no right to poke your noses in my affairs and my fathers  this affair out here is our own not yours  the eclipse mine is my fathers property  and i say it belongs to me and dad answered dan with more force than elegance  but i wont argue with you  you are in our power and have got to take the consequence  what do you intend to do with me asked tom  youll find out soon enough  dont you know that my brothers are in this neighborhood and that they have the law on their side  yes i know your brothers are hereand well have them prisoners too before long returned dan baxter and then cut the conversation short by walking away  tom had managed to speak bravely enough yet his heart was by no means light  he realized that the baxters had not forgotten the past and that here in this wild country they were more inclined than ever to take the law in their own hands  he was left alone for the best part of an hour only noxton seeing to it that he did not run away  then he was ordered to mount again his legs being liberated for that purpose  feeling it would be foolhardy to refuse with three men and a boy against him tom mounted and the whole party moved along the mountain to a spot which was evidently wellknown to noxton  here at a certain point was what had once been an overland hotel but the building was now dilapidated and deserted  well stop here for the present said arnold baxter grimly  get down rover and tom obeyed  inside of the place two of the rooms were found in fair condition and in one of these tom was tied fast to a cupboard door  then the men went out for another parley  the youth could not hear all that was said but learned enough to convince him that al roebuck as he was called was the party who had forged the pardon which had obtained for arnold baxter his liberty  for this work roebuck had been promised a half share in the eclipse mine and of some money which baxter the elder was hoping to obtain  at last arnold baxter and dan came in once more and faced tom  rover we are now ready to come to terms began the man  are you ready to release me  yesunder certain conditions  youve got to sign off all rights to that mine broke in dan  dan keep quiet interposed his father  i can do this better alone  i know him better than you do dad returned his graceless son  perhaps but i am fully capable of making terms with him  all right fire away i dont care  only dont let him off too easy  i am anxious to settle this matter quietly went on arnold baxter to tom   i dont want any more trouble  well go ahead im listening came from tom  you are out here to locate a certain mine  i dont deny it  the mine belongs to my father  it belongs to meand i am bound to have it  you are a jailbird mr baxter  how can you hold such a property now  the criminal winced and clenched his fists  dont be quite so plainspoken rover it doesnt set well  i say the claim is mine  well  you are in my power  granted  isnt your life worth something to you  to be sure it is  then why not try to make terms to save it  you are fooling with me  you cannot be it earnest arnold baxter  youll soon see if dad aint in earnest burst out dan  i am not fooling rover i mean every word of what i say  if you want to save your life you must make terms with me  what sort of terms  you must write a letter to your brothers and the man who was with you and get them to return without delay to the east  and after that  after they have returned to the east we will set you free providing you swear to follow them and all of you swear to keep out of colorado in the future  and if i refuse  if you refuse your life shall pay the forfeit answered arnold baxter  come now which do you choose       chapter xxvii  dash for liberty   for the minute after arnold baxter spoke tom had nothing to say the man had offered terms and if he did not accept them his very life would be in danger  now had tom been the hero of some dime novel he would have shouted at once i refuse your offerdo your worse base villain that you are  but being an everyday american boy with a proper regard for his own life he revolved the situation in his mind with great care  well what do you say demanded arnold baxter impatiently  you had better accept dads offer broke in dan  i dont know what to say was the slow answer  this you must remember is brand new to me  my offer is a very fair one rover  you have gotten yourself in a bad fix and you can consider yourself lucky if you get out of it with a whole skin   if i write the letter how are you going to deliver it to my two brothers and jack wumble  we will find a way  and supposing they refuse to go back what then  i wont be to blame for that  they wont refusenot when they realize that such a refusal means death to you  they may  dick is quite headstrong at times  i dont want to do what i can for you and then suffer anyway  well if you do your best i will remember it when it comes to a final settlement responded arnold baxter with more grace than tom had anticipated  let me think it over for a few hours and i will give you an answer said the boy and though they coaxed and threatened neither of the baxters could get any more out of him  at last they left him in disgust first however seeing to it that his bonds were as tight as ever  as soon as tom was left alone he looked around for some means by which he might escape from his tormentors  the room was square with a small window at one side and a broad fireplace at the other at one end was the door and at the other the cupboard to which he had been fastened  in his schooldays tom had been a great hand at doing rope tricks and when his hands had been tied he had taken care to make his enemies adjust the lariat as loosely as possible now with a dexterous twist or two he cleared his hands although the effort drew blood on one of his wrists  but under the circumstances tom counted this as nothing  as soon as he was free the boy tiptoed his way to the window and looked out  he saw noxton and roebuck sitting on a fallen tree talking earnestly  close to the door of the house stood the baxters and arnold baxter was laying down the law to his son although what it was all about tom could not determine  i cant go by the window he mused  and if i try the door  he stopped short for just then dan baxter started to come into the building  but his father stopped him  let the boy alone cried the elder baxter  hell come around all right never fear  oh youre too soft with him returned the son  id give him a cowhiding  nevertheless he walked away and then all became as silent as before  tom realized that whatever was to be done must be done quickly and walking back he surveyed the broad chimney  it was wide open to the sky and at one corner of the opening he saw the waving green branch of a tree  if i could only get up into the tree he thought and no sooner thought than tried  the chimney was dirty and he was soon covered with soot from head to foot  but being rough the chimney afforded easy footings and he reached the top without great effort  the tree branch was scarcely two feet from the top  with great caution the boy peered from the chimney noxton and roebuck were still talking earnestly and both had their backs partly turned in his direction  the baxters were out of sight  as quickly as it could be accomplished tom stood upon the top of the chimney caught the tree limb and pulled himself up  the branch swayed violently with his weight but did not break and soon he was close to the trunk and out of sight  so far so good he murmured  but what shall i do next  this question was soon decided  there was another tree close at band but further from the house than the first and into this he leaped and made his way across it to where a drooping branch fell directly over a heavy clump of bushes  down this branch went tom and dropped into the bushes as silently as a cat  it must be confessed that the boys heart was now thumping like a steam engine  what if he was discovered  he was afraid that his enemies would kill him on the spot  he looked around and saw the horses tethered among the bushes a hundred feet further on  if only he could gain the animals he felt that escape would be almost secured  he crawled along the ground like a snake  once he had to go around a big rock and actually tear his way among the thorns which scratched him in a dozen places  but behind the rock the shelter was greater and unable to stand the suspense any longer he set off on a run for his horse  the animal saw him coming and set up a low whinny of recognition then all of the horses swayed around in a bunch for they were tethered close together  this gave tom another idea and he not only untied his own horse but likewise all of the others  he kept hold of the other lariats as he mounted his steed  get up he said sharply but in a low tone and touched on the flank the horse set off on a gallop followed by the other animals  hullo something is wrong with the hosses he beard bill noxton cry  then came a rush through the bushes  at the sound tom bent as low in the saddle as possible and urged his horse to do his best  they are stampeding came from arnold baxter  whoa there whoa how did they manage to get loose  the prisoner shouted roebuck  he is on the leading horse  he has escaped us  impossible gasped the elder baxter  why i have been watching the house  no matter its tom rover interrupt dan baxter  see there he goesand he taking all of our horses with him  at this arnold baxter drew his pistol and the others also brought forth their firearms but toms steed was not a large one and while he crouched low in the saddle the horses behind kept his enemies from getting more than an occasional glimpse of him  on and on went the boy the horses hoofs clattering loudly over the rocky trail  the men shouted loudly for him to halt and several pistol shots rang out but no damage was done  soon the enemy was left in the distance  as soon as he felt that he was safe for the time being tom brought his horse down to a walk in order that he might consider the situation  where were the others  that was the all important question  he had escaped from the men who wished him harm but he was now no better off than when he had fallen in with them  but they are a good deal worse off he thought grimly  i dont believe theyll want to travel around very far on foot  it was now sunset and the youth felt that night would soon be upon him  he did not know which way to turn although of one thing he was certainthat he wished to keep as far away as possible from those who had held him a prisoner  presently he gained the entrance to a small wood and as it was now too dark to go on he determined to rest for the night  he tied up all of the horses and tried to make himself comfortable at the foot of a large tree  for a long time he could not sleep but at last he dozed off  his sleep was full of horrible dreams and his awakening was a rude one      chapter xxviii  bill noxton comes to grief   weve found him boys  heres the hoss thief with five o the hosses with him  git up thar young feller an give an account oyerself  tom did not hear these words but he felt a sharp kick in the ribs and gave a gasp of pain and surprise  let up sam he murmured  cant you keep your feet out of my he broke off short and stared around him  whawhat does this mean he stammered  three men stood around himroughbearded men each heavily armed  it means thet we have collared ye answered one of the men sharply  git up  and he kicked tom again  see here keep your toe to yourself cried tom hotly  if you are arnold baxters tools you can treat me half decently anyway and he leaped up and faced the crowd  who is arnold baxter questioned the leader of the men quickly  i guess you know well enough  oh all right if you dont want to talk  but let me say young feller thet you have got yerself in a fine mess  dont yer know ez how they hang hoss thieves in these parts  a horse thief  what do you mean  i am no horse thief if thats what you are driving at  toms straightforward manner appeared to impress all three men but the leader shrugged his shoulders  ef ye aint no hoss thief how is it ye hev got all these critters with ye he questioned triumphantly  i can explain that easily enough  that horse is my own purchased in gunnison from ralph verbeck the dealer there  those horses belong to a set of rascals who captured me and made me their prisoner  i got away from them and to prevent them from following me i took their horses with me  hurmph  thets a slick story  its the plain truth  do i look like a horse thief  not persackly youngster  but two o them hosses i know well an they war stolen  my pards hyer kin prove it  well i know nothing about that  i have told you the plain truth you dont claim the horse i said was mine do you  no  but wots this tale ye tell of bein captured  anxious to set himself straight with these men who appeared to be of upright character tom told the larger part of his story to which the crowd listened patiently  then they asked him a number of questions  i reckon you are ok said the leader at last  i know jack wumble and i know he wouldnt be attached to a gang that wasnt on the level  i dont care what becomes of those horses went on tom  only i want my own  you shall have it lad  but you must put us on the trail o them thieves  it runs in my mind thet i know this bill noxton though perhaps not by thet handle  thar used ter be a hoss thief down hyer called slinky bill with a scar on his cheek an one tooth missin in front  thats your man  the tooth is still missing and the scar is there as plain as day  then hes the gent as we wants to be introduced to put in one of the other men  i calkerlated he had left these diggins fer good added the third newcomer  i can try to lead you back to their camp said tom although i am not altogether sure of the trail  they were stopping at a long low deserted house having a wide chimney and with several big trees growing close by  dillwells old overland hotel ill bet a hoss cried the leader of the men  it must be about ten miles from here went on tom  jest about youngster  come we want ye to go with us  i will do that willingly if youll promise to protect me from the rascals  i suppose they are mad enough to shoot me down on sight  well see ye throughef everything is straight answered hank yates for such was the name of the leading spirit of the party  the men had their own horses close at hand and soon all were in the saddle with the extra horses bringing up the rear as before the men had rations with them and offered tom some crackers and a bit of meat as they progressed  they were not a bad crowd although very rough and stern and it developed presently that hank yates had known the kennedy who had been anderson rovers partner in mining operations  he war a good man said yates  a banrup wholesouled critter its a pity he had to turn up his toes with wuss men hangin on an never dyin at all  half of the distance to the old hotel had been covered when on coming out on a little hill one of the men called attention to a man and a boy riding along the top of a ridge a short distance away  its my brother sam and jack wumble ejaculated tom  oh but am i not glad to see them again  he set up a shout and waved his cap and soon wumble saw him and waved his hand in return  then the old miner and sam came forward at top speed  tom came from sam and he rode up close and almost embraced his brother  where in the world have you been  been with the enemy answered tom  i can tell you i paid up for going to sleep on the trait he added half comically  the meeting made his heart ten times lighter than it had been  where is dick  thets the wust on it answered wumble  dick had a dirty tumble and we cant find him nowhar  of course the stories on both sides had to be told  jack wumble could not keep from laughing when told that tom had been mistaken for a horse thief  not but wot ye run away with them hosses slick enough he added slyly  dicks disappearance sobered tom greatly  can it be possible that he has been drowned he asked  i crawled down to the river but couldnt find hide nor hair of him answered wumble  soon all were on the way to the old hotel  as they drew closer yates warned them to be cautious  perhaps we can do a bit o surprisin he explained  here comes noxton exclaimed tom  slinky bill sure enough returned yates and one of his companions nodded  noxton was still fifty feet away when he saw them and gave a shout of consternation  then he turned and tried to run away  stop called hank yates  stop or ill fire on ye  but instead of stopping noxton ran the faster  seeing this the man of the plains raised his pistol took steady aim and fired noxton was hit in the leg and went down in a heap shrieking with pain      chapter xxix  locating the lost mine   while yates and another of the men ran toward noxton to make him a prisoner the others turned their attention to the baxters and al roebuck  the baxters were hiding behind a clump of bushes but now as soon as discovered they took to their heels making sure that the bushes and trees should keep them screened so that there would be no danger from a fire such as had brought down their unlucky companion  theyre on us dad groaned dan baxter oh why did we ever come out here  silence dan whispered arnold baxter  if we dont keep still they may shoot us down in cold blood and then dan became as mum as an oyster although his teeth chattered with terror  on went father and son down a hill and into a deep valley where the rocks were numerous and the growth thick  several shots flew over their heads causing dan to almost drop from heart failure  ii cant rurun much further he panted  come here is an opening between the rocks whispered arnold baxter  in you go before it is too late  if they follow us we can sell our lives as dearly as possible  dan gave a groan at this and slipped into the hollow  he did not wish to sell his life at any price  let us put out aa flag of truce he whined  give them everything father but dont let them shoot us  every ounce of courage had oozed away from him for he had seen noxton brought down and thought the rascal was dead  shut up you softy answered his parent in a rage  shut up and we will be safe  ill never give in to a rover he added vehemently  tom and sam had gone after the baxters with jack wumble behind them while the last man of the party turned to collar roebuck  but roebuck was game and fired at his assailant who fired in return and each man was slightly wounded in the shoulder  then roebuck disappeared in the woods back of the old hotel and that was the last seen of him for the time being  the hunt for the baxters was kept up until nearly nightfall  but they remained in hiding and although tom and sam passed within fifty feet of the hollow they were not discovered  they have given us the slip said tom its too bad  i thought we had them sure  as soon as the search was over it was discovered that two of the horses were missing  the several pistol shots had frightened them away and in the gathering darkness they could not be located  the entire party camped that night in the old hotel and tom showed where he had been a prisoner and how he had escaped up the chimney  noxton was not dangerously wounded and the men did what they could to allay the pain he was suffering  yet they had little sympathy for him for as stated before horse stealing in that locality was considered one of the worst of crimes  but well take ye back to the county seat said yates  and ye shall have a fair trial  take all i have but let me go pleaded noxton but to this the men with yates would not listen  early in the morning the party under yates set off taking noxton along although the criminal protested that he was too weak to ride  it may be as well to add here that later on noxton alias slinky bill was tried in court and given a sentence of five years for his misdeeds  jack wumble and sam had brought along dicks horse and they now took good care that the animal should not get away from them where to look for dick however was a poser  well ill tell you one thing tom declared im not going on to larkspur creek until he is found  or until we have found out what has become of him added sam he may be dead you know  i reckon we had best go back to where he took his tumble said wumble  if he escaped hell come back thar himself moren likely  this appeared to be good advice and an hour after the departure of yates and the others they mounted and set off  less than half a mile had been covered when of a sudden there came a shot and a bullet cut through the brush beside them  hullo this wont do cried the old miner  come out of sight an be putty quick about it too  they rode into a patch of wood and halted  but no more shots came nor could they locate that which had been fired  one thing is certain at least one of yer enemies is awatching of us was the old miners comment  well keep behind shelter after this  and they did  it was hard traveling and poor sam was utterly worn out by the time the trail along the watercourse was again reached  ive got to let up a bit he murmured  i cant sit up in the saddle any more  i shouldnt have pushed ye so hard answered wumble sympathetically  if ye he stopped short  whos that  he dodged behind a rock and the others did the same  somebody was stirring below them in the timber  all drew their pistols  if its an enemy well give them as good as they send said tom and he meant it  but it was not the enemy it was dick and he soon appeared and called to them  they were overjoyed and ran out to meet him and slim jim his companion  there was hearty handshaking all around then as they rested each told his tale  it was such a happy gathering as is not easily forgotten  you couldnt have fallen in with a better man nor slim jim said jack wumble to dick  hes got the warmest heart in all colorady he has  it was decided to wait until the morrow before setting out again for larkspur creek  slim jim agreed to accompany them for to the hunter and trapper one spot in the mountains was about as good as another  an ill help ye keep an eye open for them baxters said the old hunter  a good nights rest did wonders for all hands and they were stirring bright and early  slim jim knew every foot of the way and he told wumble of a short cut to the creek which was even better to travel than the short trail the old miner had selected  for two days the party went on over hills and mountains and across marvelous canyons and valleys thick with pines and firs  the boys had never seen such scenery and for the time being their enemies were forgotten  late in the afternoon of the second day they came out on the side of a low mountain which overlooked larkspur creek  here we are at the larkspur at last cried jack wumble  and how far still to kennedys claim do you think asked dick eagerly  not more than two or three miles  well have to hunt up the landmarks answered the old miner but hunting landmarks had to be deferred to the next day  then they set about it in earnest and by noon they were on the same ground which anderson rovers mining partner had traveled so many years before  they were trying to put down the first of their stakes when a pistol shot rang out and dick received a slight wound in the hand looking up the mountain side they saw arnold baxters savage face gazing down at them  behind the father was his son dan and close by stood roebuck  evidently their enemies meant to fight for the possession of the mine to the bitter end      chapter xxx  the landslideconclusion   dick are you badly hurt cried tom  noits only a scratch  but it was a close call  to cover came from jack wumble  quick all of you  there was no need to call out for all realized that they were in a dangerous position it was arnold baxter who fired on dick  now tom fired in return and so true was his aim that the elder baxter was hit in the left shoulder  as soon as our friends were under cover they held a council of war  we ought to round em up muttered jack wumble  dont you think so jim  i am with ye on it answered the old trapper  we air five to three although one o the crowd is wounded  its not muchonly a scratch said dick as he showed the wound yes let us surround them if we can  anyway it will be better if we get on the high ground above them  its useless to think of staking off the claim while they are in the vicinity  theyll pull up our stakes and shoot us in the bargain  their talk was interrupted by a crashing of the bushes and looking up they saw that their enemies were beginning to roll rocks down toward them  one rock weighing several tons tumbled within two yards of them  all right well try some o that when were on top said slim jim  it had threatened rain and now the drops began to come down at first scatteringly and then in a steady downpour  in this rain they moved off through the brush leading their horses and following the old hunter who knew more of the old indian trails than did even jack wumble  it was necessary to make a long detour for the rocks at one point were so steep that mounting them was all out of the question  this took them an eighth of a mile to the northward of the claim  it was now raining so hard that the water seemed to come down in sheets and they felt compelled to seek temporary shelter  it had also begun to lightning and the thunder roared and rumbled among the mountains in a manner that was deafening  this is about as bad as that tornado we encountered in africa observed sam as he crouched close to his brothers  dont you remember it and how the lightning struck that baobab tree  yes both remembered it well  it was awful said tom  i hope the lightning doesnt come near us here  if anything the rain now came down heavier than before until jack wumble declared it to be the greatest downpour he had ever witnessed in that section of the country  the water leaped over the rocks in tiny waterfalls and soon larkspur creek became a raging torrent  the sky was inky black and they could not see a dozen paces in any direction  suddenly a strange rumble reached their ears a rumble that made both wumble and slim jim turn pale and look at each other with faces full of fear  the rumble rose and fell shaking the earth beneath them and mingling with a grinding and crashing and ripping that seemed to strike each one to the very heart  what is it  the end of the world gasped sam  a landslide answered wumble  please god it doesnt come this way  they waited and the next halfminute seemed an eternity  the ground continued to tremble beneath them and the rumble kept coming closer and closer  we are doomed wailed tom but then the rumble and crashing passed them by and was slowly lost in the distance until with one last crash it came to a sudden end  its over said slim jim  thank heaven we escaped it  you are sure it was a landslide asked dick when he felt able to speak  yes my lad and a putty big one too  somewhar along this mountain side you will find a furrow cut down to the creek an find thet tons an tons o stone and dirt have slid down fer quarter o a mile or more  perhaps the slide has filled up the creek entirely  the rain continued to come down now drowning out every other sound  but wet as it was wumble urged that they go still higher up the mountain to escape any other landslide that might be imminent  so up they toiled until a large table rock was gained  at this point a second rock gave them shelter and here they remained throughout the whole of one of the most disagreeable nights the rover boys had ever encountered  the storm and the landslide had driven away all thoughts of surrounding the baxters and roebuck but with the coming of morning the skies cleared and they felt as if they must do as originally planned  unless the landslide paid em off said jack wumble  do you think they were caught in it asked dick  no tellin lad until we locate the slide  to locate the landslide was not difficult since it had passed to their right  they soon made out its trail which moved down to the creek in a zigzag fashion  sure enough the creek was partly filled with the debris and here the opposite bank was overflowed to the extent of several acres  we may find some rich deposits down thar said wumble  a landslide sometimes provides a harvest for prospectors  they moved on cautiously until they came to the spot where the baxters and roebuck had been seen last  here the landslide had been at its worst and rocks and trees had been torn up and cast down as by a giants hand  not a trace of the enemy was to be discovered until jack wumble at last made out a part of a mans coat lying a hundred feet away  they ran to the spot and soon uncovered the lifeless form of roebuck  the man had been literally mauled to death by the fury of the elements  poor fellow murmured tom as he gazed at the remains  it was a dreadful death to die  yes and he probably wasnt prepared for it said dick soberly i wonder if the baxters were caught too  moren likely put in wumble  look here is a mans hat  arnold baxters hat cried tom  i noted it particularly when i was their prisoner  where can the man be  there are tons an tons o loose dirt just be low here said slim jim  ye see the ground turned over and over as it rolled probably both o the baxters are under that dirt mebbe twenty or thirty foot down  at this all of the rover boys shuddered  very likely the old hunter spoke the truth  what a terrible fate for their old enemies  let us go away whispered sam  i cant stand this any longer and he rushed off with the tears standing in his eyes  the others were also affected and glad enough to leave the place once and forever  wumble and slim jim threw roebucks body into a hollow and placed some dirt over it and then built up a little mound of stones to mark the spot  it was not until the next day that the party returned to the creek and began to look up the eclipse mine once more  the landslide had cut across this and it was not long before both wumble and slim jim declared the ground to be full of good paying dirt to use their own term  the claim was staked out to the boys satisfaction and then wumble staked out a claim just above discovery as it is called in mining laws while slim jim staked out one for himself just below discovery  all three claims ran to both sides of the creek so that no one would suffer for water when mining operations should begin  and those claims will yield us thousands of dollars said jack wumble  boys we will all be rich  hurrah shouted tom  im glad i came west after all  and so am i said sam  dick what do you say  i say hurrah for the eclipse mine and all the gold it will bring us answered dick  wont father be pleased when he learns the news  here let us bring to a close the story of the rover boys trip out west  they had faced many grave perils but one after another these perils had been surmounted and now when success had finally crowned their efforts all the hardships were forgotten   in due course of time the title to the eclipse mine was established in law and later on anderson rover sent out a body of skilled miners to work the claim for all it was worth  it proved to be as valuable as anticipated and the rovers were of course correspondingly happy  the claims staked out by jack wumble and by slim jim proved also to be good payers from the start  when the boys got home they found that the story of the baxters fate had preceded them  many folks were inclined to think that the wrongdoers deserved the catastrophe which had overtaken them  as nothing was heard of either father or son for a long while it was presumed that both were dead beyond a doubt  but they were not dead although terribly bruised and unable to do much for themselves for a long while  the landslide threw both into the creek and when they came to their senses they were fully a mile from the scene of the disaster  here they fell in with a body of miners from canada and these men took them to a settlement still further west where arnold baxter hovered between life and death for many weeks  dan recovered more quickly  its the rovers fault growled dan baxter when he was able to sit up  ill fix them yet  he had still many plans for the future and what some of them were will be told in the next volume of the series to be entitled the rover boys on the great lakes or the secret of the island cave in this volume we will meet all of our old friends again and also learn what was done by the rover boys to outwit their old enemy  yet all went well for the present  randolph rover had quite recovered so the boys aunt martha was happy  anderson rover could now walk around again as well as ever  never saw such boys in my life declared martha rover  no matter what scrape they get into they always come out with colors flying  god bless em every one  and to this kind reader let us say amen and bid each other goodby   the end
