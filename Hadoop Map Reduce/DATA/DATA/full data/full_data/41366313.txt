                 university press       john wilson and son cambridge usa     mountainlaurel and maidenhair   heres your breakfast miss i hope its right your mother showed me how to fix it and said id find a cup up here  take that blue one i have not much appetite and cant eat if things are not nice and pretty i like the flowers ive been longing for some ever since i saw them last night  the first speaker was a redhaired freckledfaced girl in a brown calico dress and white apron with a tray in her hands and an air of timid hospitality in her manner the second a pale pretty creature in a white wrapper and blue net sitting in a large chair looking about her with the languid interest of an invalid in a new place her eyes brightened as they fell upon a glass of rosy laurel and delicate maidenhair fern that stood among the toast and eggs strawberries and cream on the tray  our laurel is jest in blow and im real glad you come in time to see it ill bring you a lot as soons ever i get time to go for it  as she spoke the plain girl replaced the ugly crockery cup and saucer with the pretty china ones pointed out to her arranged the dishes and waited to see if anything else was needed  what is your name please asked the pretty girl refreshing herself with a draught of new milk  rebecca mother thought id better wait on you the little girls are so noisy and apt to forget wouldnt you like a piller to your back you look so kind of feeble seems as if you wanted to be propped up a mite  there was so much compassion and goodwill in the face and voice that emily accepted the offer and let rebecca arrange a cushion behind her then while the one ate daintily and the other stirred about an inner room the talk went onfor two girls are seldom long silent when together  i think the air is going to suit me for i slept all night and never woke till mamma had been up ever so long and got things all nicely settled said emily graciously when the fresh strawberries had been enjoyed and the bread and butter began to vanish  im real glad you like it most folks do if they dont mind it being plain and quiet up here its gayer down at the hotel but the air aint half so good and delicate folks generally like our old place best answered becky as she tossed over a mattress and shook out the sheets with a brisk capable air pleasant to see  i wanted to go to the hotel but the doctor said it would be too noisy for me so mamma was glad to find rooms here i didnt think a farmhouse could be so pleasant that view is perfectly splendid and emily sat up to gaze delightedly out of the window below which spread the wide intervale through which the river ran with hayfields on either side while along the green slopes of the hills lay farmhouses with garden plots and big barns waiting for the harvest and beyond the rocky wooded pastures dotted with cattle and musical with cowbells brooks and birds  a balmy wind kissed a little color into the pale cheeks the listless eyes brightened as they looked and the fretful lines vanished from lips that smiled involuntarily at the sweet welcome nature gave the city child come to rest and play and grow gay and rosy in her green lap  becky watched her with interest and was glad to see how soon the newcomer felt the charm of the place for the girl loved her mountain home and thought the old farmhouse the loveliest spot in the world  when you get stronger i can show you lots of nice views round here theres a woodsy place behind the house thats just lovely down by the laurel bushes is my favorite spot and among the rocks is a cave where i keep things handy when i get a restingspell now and then and want to be quiet cant get much at home when theres boarders and five children round in vacation time  becky laughed as she spoke and there was a sweet motherly look in her plain face as she glanced at the three little red heads bobbing about the dooryard below where hens cackled a pet lamb fed and the old white dog lay blinking in the sun  i like children we have none at home and mamma makes such a baby of me im almost ashamed sometimes i want her to have a good rest now for she has taken care of me all winter and needs it you shall be my nurse if i need one but i hope to be so well soon that i can see to myself its so tiresome to be ill and emily sighed as she leaned back among her pillows with a glance at the little glass which showed her a thin face and shorn head  it must be i never was sick but i have taken care of sick folks and have a sight of sympathy for em mother says i make a pretty good nurse being strong and quiet answered becky plumping up pillows and folding towels with a gentle despatch which was very grateful to the invalid who had dreaded a noisy awkward servingmaid  never ill how nice that must be im always having colds and headaches and fusses of some kind what do you do to keep well rebecca asked emily watching her with interest as she came in to remove the tray  nothing but work i havent time to be sick and when im tuckered out i go and rest over yonder then im all right and buckle to again as smart as ever and every freckle in beckys rosy face seemed to shine with cheerful strength and courage  im tuckered out doing nothing said emily amused with the new expression and eager to try a remedy which showed such fine results in this case i shall visit your pet places and do a little work as soon as i am able and see if it wont set me up now i can only dawdle doze and read a little will you please put those books here on the table i shall want them byandby  emily pointed to a pile of blue and gold volumes lying on a trunk and becky dusted her hands as she took them up with an air of reverence for she read on the backs of the volumes names which made her eyes sparkle  do you care for poetry asked emily surprised at the girls look and manner  guess i do dont get much except the pieces i cut out of papers but i love em and stick em in an old ledger and keep it down in my cubby among the rocks i do love that mans pieces they seem to go right to the spot somehow and becky smiled at the name of whittier as if the sweetest of our poets was a dear old friend of hers  i like tennyson better do you know him asked emily with a superior air for the idea of this farmers daughter knowing anything about poetry amused her  oh yes ive got a number of his pieces in my book and im fond of em but this man makes things so kind of true and natural i feel at home with him and this one ive longed to read though i guess i cant understand much of it his bumble bee was just lovely with the grass and columbines and the yellow breeches of the bee im never tired of that and beckys face woke up into something like beauty as she glanced hungrily at the emerson while she dusted the delicate cover that hid the treasures she coveted  i dont care much for him but mamma does i like romantic poems and ballads and songs dont like descriptions of clouds and fields and bees and farmers said emily showing plainly that even emersons simplest poems were far above her comprehension as yet because she loved sentiment more than nature  i do because i know em better than love and the romantic stuff most poetry tells about but i dont pretend to judge im glad of anything i can get now if you dont want me ill pick up my dishes and go to work  with that becky went away leaving emily to rest and dream with her eyes on the landscape which was giving her better poetry than any her books held she told her mother about the odd girl and was sure she would be amusing if she did not forget her place and try to be friends  she is a good creature my dear her mothers main stay and works beyond her strength i am sure be kind to the poor girl and put a little pleasure into her life if you can answered mrs spenser as she moved about settling comforts and luxuries for her invalid  i shall have to talk to her as there is no other person of my age in the house how are the school marms shall you get on with them mamma it will be so lonely here for us both if we dont make friends with some one  most intelligent and amiable women all three and we shall have pleasant times together i am sure you may safely cultivate becky mrs taylor told me she was a remarkably bright girl though she may not look it  well ill see but i do hate freckles and big red hands and round shoulders she cant help it i suppose but ugly things fret me  remember that she has no time to be pretty and be glad she is so neat and willing shall we read dear im ready now  emily consented and listened for an hour or two while the pleasant voice beside her conjured away all her vapors with some of mrs ewings charming tales  the grass is dry now and i want to stroll on that green lawn before lunch you rest mamma dear and let me make discoveries all alone proposed emily when the sun shone warmly and the instinct of all young creatures for air and motion called her out  so with her hat and wrap and book and parasol she set forth to explore the new land in which she found herself  down the wide creaking stairs and out upon the doorstone she went pausing there for a moment to decide where first to go the sound of some one singing in the rear of the house led her in that direction and turning the corner she made her first pleasant discovery a hill rose steeply behind the farmhouse and leaning from the bank was an old appletree shading a spring that trickled out from the rocks and dropped into a mossy trough below up the tree had grown a wild grapevine making a green canopy over the great log which served as a seat and some one had planted maidenhair ferns about both seat and spring to flourish beautifully in the damp shady spot  oh how pretty ill go and sit there it looks clean and i can see what is going on in that big kitchen and hear the singing i suppose its beckys little sisters by the racket  emily established herself on the lichencovered log with her feet upon a stone and sat enjoying the musical tinkle of the water with her eyes on the delicate ferns stirring in the wind and the lively jingle of the multiplicationtable chanted by childish voices in her ear  presently two little girls with a great pan of beans came to do their work on the back doorstep a third was seen washing dishes at a window and beckys brownspotted gown flew about the kitchen as if a very energetic girl wore it a womans voice was heard giving directions as the speaker was evidently picking chickens somewhere out of sight  a little of the talk reached emily and both amused and annoyed her for it proved that the country people were not as stupid as they looked  oh well we mustnt mind if she is notional and kind of wearing shes been sick and it will take time to get rid of her fretty ways jest be pleasant and take no notice and that nice mother of hers will make it all right said the womans voice  how anybody with every mortal thing to be happy with can be outofsorts passes me she fussed about every piller chair trunk and mite of food last night and kept that poor tired lady trotting till i was provoked shes right pleasant this morning though and as pretty as a picture in her ruffled gown and that blue thing on her head answered becky from the pantry as she rattled out the pieboard little dreaming who sat hidden behind the grapevine festoons that veiled the corner by the spring  well shes got redder hair n we have so she neednt be so grand and try to hide it with blue nets added one little voice  yes and its ever so much shorter n ours and curls all over her head like daisys wool i should think such a big girl would feel real ashamed without no braids said the other child proudly surveying the tawny mane that hung over her shouldersfor like most redhaired people all the children were blessed with luxuriant crops of every shade from golden auburn to regular carrots  i think its lovely suppose it had to be cut off when she had the fever wish i could get rid of my mop its such a bother and becky was seen tying a clean towel over the great knot that made her head look very like a copper kettle  now fly round deary and get them pies ready ill have these fowls on in a minute and then go to my butter you run off and see if you cant find some wild strawberries for the poor girl soons ever you are through with them beans children we must kind of pamper her up for a spell till her appetite comes back said the mother  here the chat ended and soon the little girls were gone leaving becky alone rolling out piecrust before the pantry window as she worked her lips moved and emily still peeping through the leaves wondered what she was saying for a low murmur rose and fell emphasized now and then with a thump of the rollingpin  i mean to go and find out if i stand on that washbench i can look in and see her work ill show them all that im not fussy and can be right pleasant if i like  with this wise resolution emily went down the little path and after pausing to examine the churn set out to dry and the row of pans shining on a neighboring shelf made her way to the window mounted the bench while beckys back was turned and pushing away the morningglory vines and scarlet beans that ran up on either side peeped in with such a smiling face that the crossest cook could not have frowned on her as an intruder  may i see you work i cant eat pies but i like to watch people make them do you mind  not a bit id ask you to come in but its dreadful hot here and not much room answered becky crimping round the pastry before she poured in the custard im going to make a nice little pudding for you your mother said you liked em or would you rather have whipped cream with a mite of jelly in it asked becky anxious to suit her new boarder  whichever is easiest to make i dont care what i eat do tell me what you were saying it sounded like poetry said emily leaning both elbows on the wide ledge with a pale pink morningglory kissing her cheek and a savory odor reaching her nose  oh i was mumbling some verses i often do when i work it sort of helps me along but it must sound dreadful silly and becky blushed as if caught in some serious fault  i do it and its a great comfort when i lie awake i should think you would want something to help you along you work so hard do you like it becky  the familiar name the kind tone made the plain face brighten with pleasure as its owner said while she carefully filled a pretty bowl with a golden mixture rich with fresh eggs and country milk  no i dont but i ought to mother isnt as strong as she used to be and theres a sight to do and the children to be brought up and the mortgage to be paid off so if i dont fly round who will we are doing real well now for mr walker manages the farm and gives us our share so our living is all right then boarders in summer and my school in winter help a deal and every year the boys can do more so id be a real sinner to complain if i do have to step lively all day  becky smiled as she spoke and straightened her bent shoulders as if settling her burden for another trudge along the path of duty  do you keep school why how old are you becky asked emily much impressed by this new discovery  im eighteen i took the place of a teacher who got sick last fall and i kept school all winter folks seemed to like me and im going to have the same place this year im so glad for i neednt go away and the pay is pretty good as the school is large and the children do well you can see the schoolhouse down the valley that red brick one where the roads meet and becky pointed a floury finger with an air of pride that was pleasant to see  emily glanced at the little red house where the sun shone hotly in summer and all the winds of heaven must rage wildly in winter time for it stood as country schools usually do in the barest most uninviting spot for miles around  isnt it awful down there in winter she asked with a shiver at the idea of spending days shut up in that forlorn place with a crowd of rough country children  pretty cold but we have plenty of wood and we are used to snow and gales up here we often coast down the whole lot of us and that is great fun we take our dinners and have games noonspells and so we get on first rate some of my boys are big fellows older than i am and they clear the roads and make the fire and look after us and we are real happy together  emily found it so impossible to imagine happiness under such circumstances that she changed the subject by asking in a tone which had unconsciously grown more respectful since this last revelation of beckys abilities  if you do so well here why dont you try for a larger school in a better place  oh i couldnt leave mother yet i hope to some day when the girls are older and the boys able to get on alone but i cant go now for theres a sight of things to do and mother is always laid up with rheumatism in cold weather so much buttermaking down cellar is bad for her but she wont let me do that in summer so i take care of her in winter i can see to things night and morning and through the day shes quiet and sits piecing carpetrags and resting up for next spring we made and wove all the carpets in the house except the parlor one mrs taylor gave us that and the curtains and the easychair mother takes a sight of comfort in that  mrs taylor is the lady who first came to board here and told us and others about it said emily  yes and shes the kindest lady in the world ill tell you all about her some day its real interesting now i must see to my pies and get the vegetables on answered becky glancing at the gay clock in the kitchen with an anxious look  then i wont waste any more of your precious time may i sit in that pretty place or is it your private bower asked emily as she dismounted from the washbench  yes indeed you may thats mothers resting place when work is done father made the spring long ago and i put the ferns there she cant go rambling round and she likes pretty things so we fixed it up for her and she takes comfort there nights  becky bustled off to the oven with her pies and emily roamed away to the big barn to lie on the hay enjoying the view down the valley as she thought over what she had seen and heard and very naturally contrasted her own luxurious and tenderly guarded life with this other girls so hard and dull and narrow working all summer and teaching all winter in that dismal little schoolhouse with no change but home cares and carpetweaving it looked horrible to pleasureloving emily who led the happy carefree life of girls of her class with pleasures of all sorts and a future of still greater luxury variety and happiness opening brightly before her  it worried her to think of any one being contented with such a meagre share of the good things of life when she was unsatisfied in spite of the rich store showered upon her she could not understand it and fell asleep wishing every one could be comfortableit was so annoying to see them grubbing in kitchens teaching in bleak schoolhouses among snowdrifts and wearing ugly calico gowns  a week or two of quiet country fare and the bracing mountain air worked wonders for the invalid and every one rejoiced to see the pale cheeks begin to grow round and rosy the languid eyes to brighten and the feeble girl who used to lie on her sofa half the day now go walking about with her alpenstock eager to explore all the pretty nooks among the hills her mother blessed mrs taylor for suggesting this wholesome place the tired school marms as emily called the three young women who were their fellowboarders congratulated her as well as themselves on the daily improvement in strength and spirits all felt and becky exulted in the marvellous effects of her native air aided by mothers good cookery and the cheerful society of the children whom the good girl considered the most remarkable and lovable youngsters in the world  emily felt like the queen of this little kingdom and was regarded as such by every one for with returning health she lost her fretful ways and living with simple people soon forgot her girlish airs and vanities becoming very sweet and friendly with all about her the children considered her a sort of good fairy who could grant wishes with magical skill as various gifts plainly proved the boys were her devoted servants ready to run errands hitch up and take her to drive at any hour or listen in mute delight when she sang to her guitar in the summer twilight  but to becky she was a special godsend and comfort for before the first month had gone they were good friends and emily had made a discovery which filled her head with brilliant plans for beckys future in spite of her mothers warnings and the sensible girls own reluctance to be dazzled by enthusiastic prophecies and dreams  it came about in this way some three weeks after the two girls met emily went one evening to their favorite trystingplacebeckys bower among the laurels it was a pretty nook in the shadow of a great gray bowlder near the head of the green valley which ran down to spread into the wide intervale below a brook went babbling among the stones and grass and sweetferns while all the slope was rosy with laurelflowers in their time as the sturdy bushes grew thickly on the hillside down the valley and among the woods that made a rich background for these pink and white bouquets arranged with natures own careless grace  emily liked this spot and ever since she had been strong enough to reach it loved to climb up and sit there with book and work enjoying the lovely panorama before her floating mists often gave her a constant succession of pretty pictures now a sunny glimpse of the distant lake then the church spire peeping above the hill or a flock of sheep feeding in the meadow a gay procession of young pilgrims winding up the mountain or a black cloud heavy with a coming storm welcome because of the glorious rainbow and its shadow which would close the pageant  unconsciously the girl grew to feel not only the beauty but the value of these quiet hours to find a new peace refreshment and happiness bubbling up in her heart as naturally as the brook gushed out among the mossy rocks and went singing away through hayfields and gardens and by dusty roads till it met the river and rolled on to the sea something dimly stirred in her and the healing spirit that haunts such spots did its sweet ministering till the innocent soul began to see that life was not perfect without labor as well as love duty as well as happiness and that true contentment came from within not from without  on the evening we speak of she went to wait for becky who would join her as soon as the aftersupper chores were done in the little cave which held a few books a dipper and a birchbark basket for berries emily kept a sketching block and a box of pencils and often amused herself by trying to catch some of the lovely scenes before her these efforts usually ended in a humbler attempt and a good study of an oaktree a bit of rock or a clump of ferns was the result this evening the sunset was so beautiful she could not draw and remembering that somewhere in beckys scrapbook there was a fine description of such an hour by some poet she pulled out the shabby old volume and began to turn over the leaves  she had never cared to look at it but once having read all the best of its contents in more attractive volumes so becky kept it tucked away in the farther corner of her rustic closet and evidently thought it a safe place to conceal a certain little secret which emily now discovered as she turned the stiff pages filled with all sorts of verses good bad and indifferent a sheet of paper appeared on which was scribbled these lines in schoolgirl handwriting  mountainlaurel      my bonnie flower with truest joy       thy welcome face i see     the world grows brighter to my eyes       and summer comes with thee     my solitude now finds a friend       and after each hard day     i in my mountain garden walk       to rest or sing or pray      all down the rocky slope is spread       thy veil of rosy snow     and in the valley by the brook       thy deeper blossoms grow     the barren wilderness grows fair       such beauty dost thou give     and human eyes and natures heart       rejoice that thou dost live      each year i wait thy coming dear       each year i love thee more     for life grows hard and much i need       thy honey for my store     so like a hungry bee i sip       sweet lessons from thy cup     and sitting at a flowers feet       my soul learns to look up      no laurels shall i ever win       no splendid blossoms bear     but gratefully receive and use       gods blessed sun and air     and blooming where my lot is cast       grow happy and content     making some barren spot more fair       for a humble life well spent  illustration she wrote it herselfpage 23  she wrote it herself i cant believe it said emily as she put down the paper looking rather startled for she did believe it and felt as if she had suddenly looked into a fellowcreatures heart i thought her just an ordinary girl and here she is a poet writing verses that make me want to cry i dont suppose they are very good but they seem to come right out of her heart and touch me with the longing and the patience or the piety in them well i am surprised and emily read the lines again seeing the faults more plainly than before but still feeling that the girl put herself into them vainly trying to express what the wild flower was to her in the loneliness which comes to those who have a little spark of the divine fire burning in their souls  shall i tell her ive found it out i must and see if i cant get her verses printed of course she has more tucked away somewhere that is what she hums to herself when shes at work and wont tell me about when i ask sly thing to be so bashful and hide her gift ill tease her a bit and see what she says oh dear i wish i could do it perhaps shell be famous some day and then ill have the glory of discovering her  with that consolation emily turned over the pages of the ledger and found several more bits of verse some very good for an untaught girl others very faulty but all having a certain strength of feeling and simplicity of language unusual in the effusions of young maidens at the sentimental age  emily had a girlish admiration for talent of any kind and being fond of poetry was especially pleased to find that her humble friend possessed the power of writing it of course she exaggerated beckys talent and as she waited for her felt sure that she had discovered a feminine burns among the new hampshire hills for all the verses were about natural and homely objects touched into beauty by sweet words or tender sentiment she had time to build a splendid castle in the air and settle becky in it with a crown of glory on her head before the quiet figure in a faded sunbonnet came slowly up the slope with the glow of sunset on a tired but tranquil face  sit here and have a good rest while i talk to you said emily eager to act the somewhat dramatic scene she had planned becky sunk upon the red cushion prepared for her and sat looking down at the animated speaker as emily perched on a mossy stone before her began the performance  becky did you ever hear of the goodale children they lived in the country and wrote poetry and grew to be famous  oh yes ive read their poems and like em very much do you know em and becky looked interested at once  no but i once met a girl who was something like them only she didnt have such an easy time as they did with a father to help and a nice skyfarm and good luck generally ive tried to write verses myself but i always get into a muddle and give it up this makes me interested in other girls who can do it and i want to help my friend im sure she has talent and id so like to give her a lift in some way let me read you a piece of hers and see what you think of it  do and becky threw off the sunbonnet folded her hands round her knees and composed herself to listen with such perfect unconsciousness of what was coming that emily both laughed at the joke and blushed at the liberty she felt she was taking with the poor girls carefully hidden secret  becky was sure now that emily was going to read something of her own after this artful introduction and began to smile as the paper was produced and the first four lines read in a tone that was half timid half triumphant then with a cry she seized and crumpled up the paper exclaiming almost fiercely  its mine where did you get it how darst you touch it  emily fell upon her knees with a face and voice so full of penitence pleasure sympathy and satisfaction that beckys wrath was appeased before her friends explanation ended with these soothing and delightful words  thats all dear and i beg your pardon but im sure you will be famous if you keep on and i shall yet see a volume of poems by rebecca moore of rocky nook new hampshire  becky hid her face as if shame surprise wonder and joy filled her heart too full and made a few happy tears drop on the hands so worn with hard work when they ached to be holding a pen and trying to record the fancies that sung in her brain as ceaselessly as the soft sough of the pines or the ripple of the brook murmured in her ear when she sat here alone she could not express the vague longings that stirred in her soul she could only feel and dimly strive to understand and utter them with no thought of fame or fortunefor she was a humble creature and never knew that the hardships of her life were pressing out the virtues of her nature as the tread of careless feet crush the sweet perfume from wild herbs  presently she looked up deeply touched by emilys words and caresses and her blue eyes shone like stars as her face beamed with something finer than mere beauty for the secrets of her innocent heart were known to this friend now and it was very sweet to accept the first draught of confidence and praise  i dont mind much but i was scared for a minute no one knows but mother and she laughs at me though she dont care if it makes me happy im glad you like my scribbling but really i never think or hope of being anybody i couldnt you know but its real nice to have you say i might and to make believe for a little while  but why not becky the goodale girls did and half the poets in the world were poor ignorant people at first you know it only needs time and help and the gift will grow and people see it and then the glory and the money will come cried emily quite carried away by her own enthusiasm and goodwill  could i get any money by these things asked becky looking at the crumpled paper lying under a laurelbush  of course you could dear let me have some of them and ill show you that i know good poetry when i see it you will believe if some bankbills come with the paper the verses appear in i hope  blind to any harm she might do by exciting vain hopes in her eagerness to cheer and help emily made this rash proposal in all good faith meaning to pay for the verses herself if no editor was found to accept them  becky looked half bewildered by this brilliant prospect and took a long breath as if some hand had lifted a heavy burden a little way from her weary back for stronger than ambition for herself was love for her family and the thought of help for them was sweeter than any dream of fame  yes i would oh if i only could id be the happiest girl in the world but i cant believe it emily i heard mrs taylor say that only the very best poetry paid and mine is poor stuff i know well enough  of course it needs polishing and practice and all that but im sure it is oceans better than half the sentimental twaddle we see in the papers and i know that some of those pieces are paid for because i have a friend who is in a newspaper office and he told me so yours are quaint and simple and some very original im sure that ballad of the old house is lovely and i want to send it to whittier mamma knows him its the sort he likes and he is so kind to every one he will criticise it and be interested when she tells him about you do let me  i never could in the world it would be so bold mother would think i was crazy i love mr whittier but i wouldnt darst to show him my nonsense though reading his beautiful poetry helps me ever so much  becky looked and spoke as if her breath had been taken away by this audacious proposal and yet a sudden delicious hope sprung up in her heart that there might perhaps be a spark of real virtue in the little fire which burned within her warming and brightening her dull life  let us ask mamma she will tell us what is best to do first for she knows all sorts of literary people and wont say any more than you want her to im bent on having my way becky and the more modest you are the surer i am that you are a genius real geniuses always are shy so you just make up your mind to give me the best of your pieces and let me prove that im right  it was impossible to resist such persuasive words and becky soon yielded to the little siren who was luring her out of her safe small pool into the deeper water that looks so blue and smooth till the venturesome paper boats get into the swift eddies or run aground upon the rocks and sandbars  the greatest secrecy was to be preserved and no one but mrs spenser was to know what a momentous enterprise was afoot the girls sat absorbed in their brilliant plans till it was nearly dark then groped their way home hand in hand leaving another secret for the laurels to keep and dream over through their long sleep for blossom time was past and the rosy faces turning pale in the july sun  neither of the girls forgot the talk they had that night in emilys room for she led her captive straight to her mother and told her all their plans and aspirations without a moments delay  mrs spenser much regretted her daughters wellmeant enthusiasm but fearing harm might be done very wisely tried to calm the innocent excitement of both by the quiet matteroffact way in which she listened to the explanation emily gave her read the verses timidly offered by becky and then said kindly but firmly  this is not poetry my dear girls though the lines run smoothly enough and the sentiment is sweet it would bring neither fame nor money and rebecca puts more real truth beauty and poetry into her dutiful daily life than in any lines she has written  we had such a lovely plan for becky to come to town with me and see the world and write and be famous how can you spoil it all  my foolish little daughter i must prevent you from spoiling this good girls life by your rash projects becky will see that i am wise though you do not and she will understand this verse from my favorite poet and lay it to heart       so near is grandeur to our dust      so nigh is god to man      when duty whispers low thou must      the youth replies i can  i do i will please go on and beckys troubled eyes grew clear and steadfast as she took the words home to herself resolving to live up to them  oh mother cried emily thinking her very cruel to nip their budding hopes in this way  i know you wont believe it now nor be able to see all that i mean perhaps but time will teach you both to own that i am right and to value the substance more than the shadow continued mrs spenser many girls write verses and think they are poets but it is only a passing mood and fortunately for the world and for them also it soon dies out in some more genuine work or passion very few have the real gift and those to whom it is given wait and work and slowly reach the height of their powers many delude themselves and try to persuade the world that they can sing but it is waste of time and ends in disappointment as the mass of sentimental rubbish we all see plainly proves write your little verses my dear when the spirit movesit is a harmless pleasure a real comfort and a good lesson for you but do not neglect higher duties or deceive yourself with false hopes and vain dreams first live then write is a good motto for ambitious young people a still better for us all is do the duty that lies nearest and the faithful performance of that no matter how humble it is will be the best help for whatever talent may lie hidden in us ready to bloom when the time comes remember this and do not let my enthusiastic girls wellmeant but unwise prophecies and plans unsettle you and unfit you for the noble work you are doing  thank you maam i will remember i know you are right and i wont be upset by foolish notions i never imagined before that i could be a poet but it sounded so sort of splendid i thought maybe it might happen to me byandby as it does to other folks i wont lot on it but settle right down and do my work cheerful  as she listened beckys face had grown pale and serious even a little sad but as she answered her eyes shone her lips were firm and her plain face almost beautiful with the courage and confidence that sprung up within her she saw the wisdom of her friends advice felt the kindness of showing her the mistake frankly and was grateful for itconscious in her own strong loving heart that it was better to live and work for others than to dream and strive for herself alone  mrs spenser was both surprised and touched by the girls look words and manner and her respect much increased by the courage and good temper with which she saw her lovely castle in the air vanish like smoke leaving the hard reality looking harder than ever after this little flight into the fairy regions of romance  she talked long with the girls and gave them the counsel all eager young people need yet are very slow to accept till experience teaches them its worth as the friend of many successful literary people mrs spenser was constantly receiving the confidences of unfledged scribblers each of whom was sure that he or she had something valuable to add to the worlds literature her advice was always the same work and wait and only now and then was a young poet or author found enough in earnest to do both and thereby prove to themselves and others either that they did possess power or did not and so settle the question forever first live then write proved a quietus for many and do the duty that lies nearest satisfied the more sincere that they could be happy without fame so thanks to this wise and kindly woman a large number of worthy youths and maidens ceased dreaming and fell to work and the world was spared reams of feeble verse and thirdrate romances  after that night becky spent fewer spare hours in her nest and more in reading with emily who lent her books and helped her to understand themboth much assisted by mrs spenser who marked passages suggested authors and explained whatever puzzled them very happy bits of time were these and very precious to both as emily learned to see and appreciate the humbler harder side of life and becky got delightful glimpses into the beautiful world of art poetry and truth which gave her better food for heart and brain than sentimental musings or blind efforts to satisfy the hunger of her nature with versewriting  their favorite places were in the big barn on the front porch or by the spring this last was emilys schoolroom and she both taught and learned many useful lessons there  one day as becky came to rest a few minutes and shell peas emily put down her book to help and as the pods flew she said nodding toward the delicate ferns that grew thickly all about the trough the rock and the grassy bank  we have these in our greenhouse but i never saw them growing wild before and i dont find them anywhere up here how did you get such beauties and make them do so well  oh they grow in nooks on the mountain hidden under the taller ferns and in sly corners but they dont grow like these and die soon unless transplanted and taken good care of they always make me think of youso graceful and delicate and just fit to live with tearoses in a hothouse and go to balls in beautiful ladies bokays answered becky smiling at her new friend always so dainty and still so delicate in spite of the summers rustication  thank you i suppose i shall never be very strong or able to do much so i am rather like a fern and do live in a conservatory all winter as i cant go out a great deal an idle thing becky and emily sighed for she was born frail and even her tenderly guarded life could not give her the vigor of other girls but the sigh changed to a smile as she added  if i am like the fern you are like your own laurelstrong rosy and able to grow anywhere i want to carry a few roots home and see if they wont grow in my garden then you will have me and i you i only hope your plant will do as well as mine does here  it wont ever so many folks have taken roots away but they never thrive in gardens as they do on the hills where they belong so i tell em to leave the dear bushes alone and come up here and enjoy em in their own place you might keep a plant of it in your hothouse and it would blow i dare say but it would never be half so lovely as my acres of them and i guess it would only make you sad seeing it so far from home and pale and pining answered becky with her eyes on the green slopes where the mountainlaurel braved the wintry snow and came out fresh and early in the spring  then ill let it alone till i come next summer but dont you take any of the fern into the house in the cold weather i should think it would grow in your sunny windows said emily pleased by the fancy that it resembled herself  i tried it but it needs a damp place and our cold nights kill it no it wont grow in our old house but i cover it with leaves and the little green sprouts come up as hearty as can be out here the shade the spring the shelter of the rock keep it alive you see so its no use trying to move it  both sat silent for a few minutes as their hands moved briskly and they thought of their different lots an inquisitive ray of sunshine peeped in at them touching beckys hair till it shone like red gold the same ray dazzled emilys eyes she put up her hand to pull her hatbrim lower and touched the little curls on her forehead this recalled her pet grievance and made her say impatiently as she pushed the thick short locks under her net  my hair is such a plague i dont know what i am to do when i go into society byandby this crop is so unbecoming and i cant match my hair anywhere it is such a peculiar shade of goldenauburn  its a pretty color and i think the curls much nicer than a boughten switch said becky quite unconscious that her own luxuriant locks were of the true titian red and would be much admired by artistic eyes  i dont i shall send to paris to match it and then wear a braid round my head as you do sometimes i suppose it will cost a fortune but i wont have a strongminded crop a friend of mine got a lovely golden switch for fifty dollars  my patience do folks pay like that for false hair asked becky amazed  yes indeed white hair costs a hundred i believe if it is long why you could get ever so much for yours if you ever wanted to sell it ill take part of it for in a little while mine will be as dark and id like to wear your hair becky  dont believe mother would let me she is very proud of our red heads if i ever do cut it you shall have some i may be hard up and glad to sell it perhaps my sakes i smell the cake burning and off flew becky to forget the chat in her work  emily did not forget it and hoped becky would be tempted for she really coveted one of the fine braids but felt shy about asking the poor girl for even a part of her one beauty  so july and august passed pleasantly and profitably to both girls and in september they were to part no more was said about poetry and emily soon became so interested in the busy practical life about her that her own highflown dreams were quite forgotten and she learned to enjoy the sweet prose of daily labor  one breezy afternoon as she and her mother sat resting from a stroll on the wayside bank among the goldenrod and asters they saw becky coming up the long hill with a basket on her arm she walked slowly as if lost in thought yet never missed pushing aside with a decided gesture of her foot every stone that lay in her way there were many in that rocky path but becky left it smoother as she climbed and paused now and then to send some especially sharp or large one spinning into the grassy ditch beside the road  isnt she a curious girl mamma so tired after her long walk to town yet so anxious not to leave a stone in the way said emily as they watched her slow approach  a very interesting one to me dear because under that humble exterior lies a fine strong character it is like becky to clear her way even up a dusty hill where the first rain will wash out many more stones let us ask her why she does it ive observed the habit before and always meant to ask replied mrs spenser  here we are come and rest a minute becky and tell us if you mend roads as well as ever so many other things called emily beckoning with a smile as the girl looked up and saw them  oh its a trick of mine i caught it of father when i was a little thing and do it without knowing it half the time said becky sinking down upon a mossy rock as if rest were welcome  why did he do it asked emily who knew that her friend loved to talk of her father  well its a family failing i guess for his father did the same only he began with his farm and let the roads alone the land used to be pretty much all rocks up here you know and farmers had to clear the ground if they wanted crops it was a hard fight and took a sight of time and patience to grub out roots and blast rocks and pick up stones that seemed to grow faster than anything else but they kept on and now see  as she spoke becky pointed proudly to the wide smooth fields lying before them newly shorn of grass or grain waving with corn or rich in garden crops ripening for winter stores here and there were rocky strips unreclaimed as if to show what had been done and massive stone walls surrounded pasture field and garden  a good lesson in patience and perseverance my dear and does great honor to the men who made the wilderness blossom like the rose said mrs spenser  then you cant wonder that they loved it and we want to keep it i guess it would break mothers heart to sell this place and we are all working as hard as ever we can to pay off the mortgage then well be just the happiest family in new hampshire said becky fondly surveying the old farmhouse the rocky hill and the precious fields won from the forest  you never need fear to lose it we will see to that if you will let us began mrs spenser who was both a rich and a generous woman  oh thank you but we wont need help i guess and if we should mrs taylor made us promise to come to her cried becky she found us just in our hardest time and wanted to fix things then but we are proud in our way and mother said shed rather work it off if she could then what did that dear lady do but talk to the folks round here and show em how a branch railroad down to peeksville would increase the value of the land and how good this valley would be for strawberries and asparagus and garden truck if we could only get it to market some of the rich men took up the plan and we hope it will be done this fall it will be the making of us for our land is firstrate for small crops and the children can help at that and with a deepot close by it would be such easy work thats what i call helping folks to help themselves wont it be grand  becky looked so enthusiastic that emily could not remain uninterested though marketgardening did not sound very romantic  i hope it will come and next year we shall see you all hard at it what a good woman mrs taylor is  aint she and the sad part of it is she cant do and enjoy all she wants to because her health is so poor she was a country girl you know and went to work in the city as waiter in a boardinghouse a rich man fell in love with her and married her and she took care of him for years and he left her all his money she was quite broken down but she wanted to make his name loved and honored after his death as he hadnt done any good while he lived so she gives away heaps and is never tired of helping poor folks and doing all sorts of grand things to make the world better i call that splendid  so do i yet it is only what you are doing in a small way becky said mrs spenser as the girl paused out of breath mrs taylor clears the stones out of peoples paths making their road easier to climb than hers has been and leaving behind her fruitful fields for others to reap this is a better work than making verses for it is the real poetry of life and brings to those who give themselves to it no matter in what humble ways something sweeter than fame and more enduring than fortune  so it does i see that now and know why we love father as we do and want to keep what he worked so hard to give us he used to say every stone cleared away was just so much help to the boys and he used to tell me his plans as i trotted after him round the farm helping all i could being the oldest and like him he said  becky paused with full eyes for not even to these good friends could she ever tell the shifts and struggles in which she had bravely borne her part during the long hard years that had wrested the little homestead from the stonyhearted hills  the musical chime of a distant clock reminded her that supper time was near and she sprang up as if much refreshed by this pleasant rest by the wayside as she pulled out her handkerchief a little roll of pale blue ribbon fell from her pocket and emily caught it up exclaiming mischievously are you going to make yourself fine next sunday when moses pennel calls becky  illustration just as they were parting for bed in rushed one of the boys with the exciting newspage 45  the girl laughed and blushed as she said carefully folding up the ribbon  im going to do something with it that i like a sight better than that poor moses wont come any more i guess im not going to leave mother till the girls can take my place and only then to teach if i can get a good school somewhere near  we shall see and emily nodded wisely  we shall and becky nodded decidedly as she trudged on up the steep hill beside mrs spenser while emily walked slowly behind poking every stone she saw into the grass unmindful of the detriment to her delicate shoes being absorbed in a new and charming idea of trying to follow mrs taylors example in a small way  a week later the last night came and just as they were parting for bed in rushed one of the boys with the exciting news that the railroad surveyors were in town the folks talking about the grand enterprise and the fortune of the place made forever  great was the rejoicing in the old farmhouse the boys cheered the little girls danced the two mothers dropped a happy tear as they shook each others hands and emily embraced becky tenderly exclaimingthere you dear thing is a great stone shoved out of your way and a clear road to fortune at last for i shall tell all my friends to buy your butter and eggs and fruit and pigs and everything you send to market on that blessed railroad  a keg of our best winter butter is going by stage express tomorrow anyway and when our apples come we shant need a railroad to get em to you my darling dear answered becky holding the delicate girl in her arms with a look and gesture half sisterly half motherly wholly fond and grateful  when emily got to her room she found that butter and apples were not all the humble souvenirs offered in return for many comfortable gifts to the whole family  on the table in a pretty birchbark cover lay several of beckys best poems neatly copied as emily had expressed a wish to keep them and round the rustic volume like a ring of red gold lay a great braid of beckys hair tied with the pale blue ribbon she had walked four miles to buy that her present might look its best  of course there were more embraces and kisses and thanks and loving words before emily at last lulled herself to sleep planning a christmas box which should supply every wish and want of the entire family if she could find them out  next morning they parted but these were not mere summer friends and they did not lose sight of one another though their ways lay far apart emily had found a new luxury to bring more pleasure into life a new medicine to strengthen soul and body and in helping others she helped herself wonderfully  becky went steadily on her dutiful way till the homestead was free the lads able to work the farm alone the girls old enough to fill her place and the good mother willing to rest at last among her children then becky gave herself to teachinga noble task for which she was well fitted and in which she found both profit and pleasure as she led her flock along the paths from which she removed the stumblingblocks for their feet as well as for her own she put her poetry into her life and made of it a grand sweet song in which beauty and duty rhymed so well that the country girl became a more useful beloved and honored woman than if she had tried to sing for fame which never satisfies  so each symbolical plant stood in its own place and lived its appointed life the delicate fern grew in the conservatory among tearoses and camellias adding grace to every bouquet of which it formed a part whether it faded in a ballroom or was carefully cherished by some poor invalids bedsidea frail thing yet with tenacious roots and strong stem nourished by memories of the rocky nook where it had learned its lesson so well the mountainlaurel clung to the bleak hillside careless of wintry wind and snow as its sturdy branches spread year by year with its evergreen leaves for christmas cheer its rosy flowers for springtime its fresh beauty free to all as it clothed the wild valley with a charm that made a little poem of the lovely spot where the pines whispered woodbirds sang and the hidden brook told the sweet message it brought from the mountaintop where it was born  illustration logo
