there was once a king and he had a queen and he was the manliest of his sex and she was the loveliest of hers the king was in his private profession under government the queens father had been a medical man out of town  they had nineteen children and were always having more seventeen of these children took care of the baby and alicia the eldest took care of them all their ages varied from seven years to seven months  let us now resume our story  one day the king was going to the office when he stopped at the fishmongers to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail which the queen who was a careful housekeeper had requested him to send home mr pickles the fishmonger said certainly sir is there any other article goodmorning  the king went on towards the office in a melancholy mood for quarter day was such a long way off and several of the dear children were growing out of their clothes he had not proceeded far when mr pickless errandboy came running after him and said sir you didnt notice the old lady in our shop  what old lady enquired the king i saw none  now the king had not seen any old lady because this old lady had been invisible to him though visible to mr pickless boy probably because he messed and splashed the water about to that degree and flopped the pairs of soles down in that violent manner that if she had not been visible to him he would have spoilt her clothes  just then the old lady came trotting up she was dressed in shotsilk of the richest quality smelling of dried lavender  king watkins the first i believe said the old lady  watkins replied the king is my name  papa if i am not mistaken of the beautiful princess alicia said the old lady  and of eighteen other darlings replied the king  listen you are going to the office said the old lady  it instantly flashed upon the king that she must be a fairy or how could she know that  you are right said the old lady answering his thoughts i am the good fairy grandmarina attend when you return home to dinner politely invite the princess alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now  it may disagree with her said the king  the old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea that the king was quite alarmed and humbly begged her pardon  we hear a great deal too much about this thing disagreeing and that thing disagreeing said the old lady with the greatest contempt it was possible to express dont be greedy i think you want it all yourself  the king hung his head under this reproof and said he wouldnt talk about things disagreeing any more  be good then said the fairy grandmarina and dont when the beautiful princess alicia consents to partake of the salmonas i think she willyou will find she will leave a fishbone on her plate tell her to dry it and to rub it and to polish it till it shines like motherofpearl and to take care of it as a present from me  is that all asked the king  dont be impatient sir returned the fairy grandmarina scolding him severely dont catch people short before they have done speaking just the way with you grownup persons you are always doing it  the king again hung his head and said he wouldnt do so any more  be good then said the fairy grandmarina and dont tell the princess alicia with my love that the fishbone is a magic present which can only be used once but that it will bring her that once whatever she wishes for provided she wishes for it at the right time that is the message take care of it  illustration hoity toity me  the king was beginning might i ask the reason when the fairy became absolutely furious  will you be good sir she exclaimed stamping her foot on the ground the reason for this and the reason for that indeed you are always wanting the reason no reason there hoity toity me i am sick of your grownup reasons  the king was extremely frightened by the old ladys flying into such a passion and said he was very sorry to have offended her and he wouldnt ask for reasons any more  be good then said the old lady and dont  with those words grandmarina vanished and the king went on and on and on till he came to the office there he wrote and wrote and wrote till it was time to go home again then he politely invited the princess alicia as the fairy had directed him to partake of the salmon and when she had enjoyed it very much he saw the fishbone on her plate as the fairy had told him he would and he delivered the fairys message and the princess alicia took care to dry the bone and to rub it and to polish it till it shone like motherofpearl  illustration he saw the fishbone on her plate  and so when the queen was going to get up in the morning she said o dear me dear me my head my head and then she fainted away  the princess alicia who happened to be looking in at the chamberdoor asking about breakfast was very much alarmed when she saw her royal mamma in this state and she rang the bell for peggy which was the name of the lord chamberlain but remembering where the smellingbottle was she climbed on a chair and got it and after that she climbed on another chair by the bedside and held the smellingbottle to the queens nose and after that she jumped down and got some water and after that she jumped up again and wetted the queens forehead and in short when the lord chamberlain came in that dear old woman said to the little princess what a trot you are i couldnt have done it better myself  illustration  but that was not the worst of the good queens illness o no she was very ill indeed for a long time the princess alicia kept the seventeen young princes and princesses quiet and dressed and undressed and danced the baby and made the kettle boil and heated the soup and swept the hearth and poured out the medicine and nursed the queen and did all that ever she could and was as busy busy busy as busy could be for there were not many servants at that palace for three reasons because the king was short of money because a rise in his office never seemed to come and because quarter day was so far off that it looked almost as far off and as little as one of the stars  but on the morning when the queen fainted away where was the magic fishbone why there it was in the princess alicias pocket she had almost taken it out to bring the queen to life again when she put it back and looked for the smellingbottle  after the queen had come out of her swoon that morning and was dozing the princess alicia hurried upstairs to tell a most particular secret to a most particularly confidential friend of hers who was a duchess people did suppose her to be a doll but she was really a duchess though nobody knew it except the princess  illustration  this most particular secret was a secret about the magic fishbone the history of which was well known to the duchess because the princess told her everything the princess kneeled down by the bed on which the duchess was lying fulldressed and wide awake and whispered the secret to her the duchess smiled and nodded people might have supposed that she never smiled and nodded but she often did though nobody knew it except the princess  then the princess alicia hurried downstairs again to keep watch in the queens room she often kept watch by herself in the queens room but every evening while the illness lasted she sat there watching with the king and every evening the king sat looking at her with a cross look wondering why she never brought out the magic fishbone as often as she noticed this she ran upstairs whispered the secret to the duchess over again and said to the duchess besides they think we children never have a reason or a meaning and the duchess though the most fashionable duchess that ever was heard of winked her eye  alicia said the king one evening when she wished him good night  yes papa  what is become of the magic fishbone  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  and so another time the dreadful little snapping pugdog next door made a rush at one of the young princes as he stood on the steps coming home from school and terrified him out of his wits and he put his hand through a pane of glass and bled bled bled when the seventeen other young princes and princesses saw him bleed bleed bleed they were terrified out of their wits too and screamed themselves black in their seventeen faces all at once but the princess alicia put her hands over all their seventeen mouths one after another and persuaded them to be quiet because of the sick queen and then she put the wounded princes hand in a basin of fresh cold water while they stared with their twice seventeen are thirtyfour put down four and carry three eyes and then she looked in the hand for bits of glass and there were fortunately no bits of glass there and then she said to two chubbylegged princes who were sturdy though small bring me in the royal ragbag i must snip and stitch and cut and contrive so those two young princes tugged at the royal ragbag and lugged it in and the princess alicia sat down on the floor with a large pair of scissors and a needle and thread and snipped and stitched and cut and contrived and made a bandage and put it on and it fitted beautifully and so when it was all done she saw the king her papa looking on by the door  illustration  alicia  yes papa  what have you been doing  snipping stitching cutting and contriving papa  where is the magic fishbone  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  after that she ran upstairs to the duchess and told her what had passed and told her the secret over again and the duchess shook her flaxen curls and laughed with her rosy lips  illustration  well and so another time the baby fell under the grate the seventeen young princes and princesses were used to it for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs but the baby was not used to it yet and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye the way the poor little darling came to tumble was that he slid out of the princess alicias lap just as she was sitting in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her in front of the kitchenfire beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner and the way she came to be doing that was that the kings cook had run away that morning with her own true love who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier then the seventeen young princes and princesses who cried at everything that happened cried and roared but the princess alicia who couldnt help crying a little herself quietly called to them to be still on account of not throwing back the queen upstairs who was fast getting well and said hold your tongues you wicked little monkeys every one of you while i examine baby then she examined baby and found that he hadnt broken anything and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye and smoothed his poor dear face and he presently fell asleep in her arms then she said to the seventeen princes and princesses i am afraid to lay him down yet lest he should wake and feel pain be good and you shall all be cooks they jumped for joy when they heard that and began making themselves cooks caps out of old newspapers so to one she gave the saltbox and to one she gave the barley and to one she gave the herbs and to one she gave the turnips and to one she gave the carrots and to one she gave the onions and to one she gave the spicebox till they were all cooks and all running about at work she sitting in the middle smothered in the great coarse apron nursing baby by and by the broth was done and the baby woke up smiling like an angel and was trusted to the sedatest princess to hold while the other princes and princesses were squeezed into a faroff corner to look at the princess alicia turning out the saucepanfull of broth for fear as they were always getting into trouble they should get splashed and scalded when the broth came tumbling out steaming beautifully and smelling like a nosegay good to eat they clapped their hands that made the baby clap his hands and that and his looking as if he had a comic toothache made all the princes and princesses laugh so the princess alicia said laugh and be good and after dinner we will make him a nest on the floor in a corner and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks that delighted the young princes and princesses and they ate up all the broth and washed up all the plates and dishes and cleared away and pushed the table into a corner and then they in their cooks caps and the princess alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby who forgot his swelled face and his black eye and crowed with joy  illustration the dance of the eighteen cooks  and so then once more the princess alicia saw king watkins the first her father standing in the doorway looking on and he said what have you been doing alicia  cooking and contriving papa  what else have you been doing alicia  keeping the children lighthearted papa  where is the magic fishbone alicia  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  the king then sighed so heavily and seemed so lowspirited and sat down so miserably leaning his head upon his hand and his elbow upon the kitchen table pushed away in the corner that the seventeen princes and princesses crept softly out of the kitchen and left him alone with the princess alicia and the angelic baby  what is the matter papa  i am dreadfully poor my child  have you no money at all papa  illustration what is the matter papa  none my child  is there no way left of getting any papa  no way said the king i have tried very hard and i have tried all ways  when she heard those last words the princess alicia began to put her hand into the pocket where she kept the magic fishbone  papa said she when we have tried very hard and tried all ways we must have done our very very best  no doubt alicia  when we have done our very very best papa and that is not enough then i think the right time must have come for asking help of others this was the very secret connected with the magic fishbone which she had found out for herself from the good fairy grandmarinas words and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the duchess  so she took out of her pocket the magic fishbone that had been dried and rubbed and polished till it shone like motherofpearl and she gave it one little kiss and wished it was quarter day and immediately it was quarter day and the kings quarters salary came rattling down the chimney and bounced into the middle of the floor  but this was not half of what happened no not a quarter for immediately afterwards the good fairy grandmarina came riding in in a carriage and four peacocks with mr pickless boy up behind dressed in silver and gold with a cocked hat powdered hair pink silk stockings a jewelled cane and a nosegay down jumped mr pickless boy with his cocked hat in his hand and wonderfully polite being entirely changed by enchantment and handed grandmarina out and there she stood in her rich shot silk smelling of dried lavender fanning herself with a sparkling fan  alicia my dear said this charming old fairy how do you do i hope i see you pretty well give me a kiss  the princess alicia embraced her and then grandmarina turned to the king and said rather sharplyare you good  illustration alicia my dear  how do you do  the king said he hoped so  i suppose you know the reason now why my goddaughter here kissing the princess again did not apply to the fishbone sooner said the fairy  the king made her a shy bow  ah but you didnt then said the fairy  the king made her a shyer bow  any more reasons to ask for said the fairy  the king said no and he was very sorry  be good then said the fairy and live happy ever afterwards  then grandmarina waved her fan and the queen came in most splendidly dressed and the seventeen young princes and princesses no longer grown out of their clothes came in newly fitted out from top to toe with tucks in everything to admit of its being let out after that the fairy tapped the princess alicia with her fan and the smothering coarse apron flew away and she appeared exquisitely dressed like a little bride with a wreath of orangeflowers and a silver veil after that the kitchen dresser changed of itself into a wardrobe made of beautiful woods and gold and looking glass which was full of dresses of all sorts all for her and all exactly fitting her after that the angelic baby came in running alone with his face and eye not a bit the worse but much the better then grandmarina begged to be introduced to the duchess and when the duchess was brought down many compliments passed between them  a little whispering took place between the fairy and the duchess and then the fairy said out loud yes i thought she would have told you grandmarina then turned to the king and queen and said we are going in search of prince certainpersonio the pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely so she and the princess alicia got into the carriage and mr pickless boy handed in the duchess who sat by herself on the opposite seat and then mr pickless boy put up the steps and got up behind and the peacocks flew away with their tails spread  illustration she appeared exquisitely dressed like a little bride  prince certainpersonio was sitting by himself eating barleysugar and waiting to be ninety when he saw the peacocks followed by the carriage coming in at the window it immediately occurred to him that something uncommon was going to happen  prince said grandmarina i bring you your bride  the moment the fairy said those words prince certainpersonios face left off being stickey and his jacket and corduroys changed to peachbloom velvet and his hair curled and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and settled on his head he got into the carriage by the fairys invitation and there he renewed his acquaintance with the duchess whom he had seen before  in the church were the princes relations and friends and the princess alicias relations and friends and the seventeen princes and princesses and the baby and a crowd of the neighbours the marriage was beautiful beyond expression the duchess was bridesmaid and beheld the ceremony from the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk  grandmarina gave a magnificent wedding feast afterwards in which there was everything and more to eat and everything and more to drink the wedding cake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons frosted silver and white lilies and was fortytwo yards round  when grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple and prince certainpersonio had made a speech and everybody had cried hip hip hip hurrah grandmarina announced to the king and queen that in future there would be eight quarter days in every year except in leap year when there would be ten she then turned to certainpersonio and alicia and said my dears you will have thirtyfive children and they will all be good and beautiful seventeen of your children will be boys and eighteen will be girls the hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally they will never have the measles and will have recovered from the whoopingcough before being born  on hearing such good news everybody cried out hip hip hip hurrah again  it only remains said grandmarina in conclusion to make an end of the fishbone  so she took it from the hand of the princess alicia and it instantly flew down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pugdog next door and choked him and he expired in convulsions   the end  illustration                                                  printed at the
