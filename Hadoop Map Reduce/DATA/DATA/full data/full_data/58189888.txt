this and four other christmas pieces dickens received Â£1000  holiday romance was published in book form by messrs chapman  hall in 1874 with edwin drood and other stories  for this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in all the year round has been followed     captain boldheart and the latingrammar master   the subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted himself to the pirate profession at a comparatively early age we find him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns loaded to the muzzle ere yet he had had a party in honour of his tenth birthday  it seems that our hero considering himself spited by a latingrammarmaster demanded the satisfaction due from one man of honour to another not getting it he privately withdrew his haughty spirit from such low company bought a secondhand pocketpistol folded up some sandwiches in a paper bag made a bottle of spanish liquoricewater and entered on a career of valour  it were tedious to follow boldheart for such was his name through the commencing stages of his history suffice it that we find him bearing the rank of captain boldheart reclining in full uniform on a crimson hearthrug spread out upon the quarterdeck of his schooner the beauty in the china seas it was a lovely evening and as his crew lay grouped about him he favoured them with the following melody       o landsmen are folly      o pirates are jolly      o diddleum dolly                       di          chorus heave yo  the soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich tones of boldheart may be more easily conceived than described  it was under these circumstances that the lookout at the masthead gave the word whales  all was now activity  where away cried captain boldheart starting up  on the larboard bow sir replied the fellow at the masthead touching his hat for such was the height of discipline on board of the beauty that even at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot through the head  illustration his crew lay grouped around him  this adventure belongs to me said boldheart boy my harpoon let no man follow and leaping alone into his boat the captain rowed with admirable dexterity in the direction of the monster  all was now excitement  he nears him said an elderly seaman following the captain through his spyglass  he strikes him said another seaman a mere stripling but also with a spyglass  he tows him towards us said another seaman a man in the full vigour of life but also with a spyglass  in fact the captain was seen approaching with the huge bulk following we will not dwell on the deafening cries of boldheart boldheart with which he was received when carelessly leaping on the quarterdeck he presented his prize to his men they afterwards made two thousand four hundred and seventeen pound ten and sixpence by it  ordering the sails to be braced up the captain now stood wnw the beauty flew rather than floated over the dark blue waters nothing particular occurred for a fortnight except taking with considerable slaughter four spanish galleons and a snow from south america all richly laden inaction began to tell upon the spirits of the men captain boldheart called all hands aft and said  my lads i hear there are discontented ones among ye let any such stand forth  after some murmuring in which the expressions aye aye sir union jack avast starboard port bowsprit and similar indications of a mutinous undercurrent though subdued were audible bill boozey captain of the foretop came out from the rest his form was that of a giant but he quailed under the captains eye  what are your wrongs said the captain  why dye see captain boldheart replied the towering mariner ive sailed man and boy for many a year but i never yet knowd the milk served out for the ships companys teas to be so sour as tis aboard this craft  illustration the rescue of william boozey  at this moment the thrilling cry man overboard announced to the astonished crew that boozey in stepping back as the captain in mere thoughtfulness laid his hand upon the faithful pocketpistol which he wore in his belt had lost his balance and was struggling with the foaming tide  all was now stupefaction  but with captain boldheart to throw off his uniform coat regardless of the various rich orders with which it was decorated and to plunge into the sea after the drowning giant was the work of a moment maddening was the excitement when boats were lowered intense the joy when the captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth deafening the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of the beauty and from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones captain boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as william boozey  boldheart now pointed to the horizon and called the attention of his crew to the taper spars of a ship lying snug in harbour under the guns of a fort  she shall be ours at sunrise said he serve out a double allowance of grog and prepare for action  all was now preparation  when morning dawned after a sleepless night it was seen that the stranger was crowding on all sail to come out of the harbour and offer battle as the two ships came nearer to each other the stranger fired a gun and hoisted roman colours boldheart then perceived her to be the latingrammarmasters bark such indeed she was and had been tacking about the world in unavailing pursuit from the time of his first taking to a roving life  boldheart now addressed his men promising to blow them up if he should feel convinced that their reputation required it and giving orders that the latingrammarmaster should be taken alive he then dismissed them to their quarters and the fight began with a broadside from the beauty she then veered round and poured in another the scorpion so was the bark of the latingrammarmaster appropriately called was not slow to return her fire and a terrific cannonading ensued in which the guns of the beauty did tremendous execution  the latingrammarmaster was seen upon the poop in the midst of the smoke and fire encouraging his men to do him justice he was no craven though his white hat his short grey trousers and his long snuffcoloured surtout reaching to his heelsthe selfsame coat in which he had spited boldheartcontrasted most unfavourably with the brilliant uniform of the latter at this moment boldheart seizing a pike and putting himself at the head of his men gave the word to board  a desperate conflict ensued in the hammock nettingsor somewhere in about that directionuntil the latingrammarmaster having all his masts gone his hull and rigging shot through and through and seeing boldheart slashing a path towards him hauled down his flag himself gave up his sword to boldheart and asked for quarter scarce had he been put into the captains boat ere the scorpion went down with all on board  on captain boldhearts now assembling his men a circumstance occurred he found it necessary with one blow of his cutlass to kill the cook who having lost his brother in the late action was making at the latingrammarmaster in an infuriated state intent on his destruction with a carvingknife  captain boldheart then turned to the latingrammarmaster severely reproaching him with his perfidy and put it to his crew what they considered that a master who spited a boy deserved  they answered with one voice death  it may be so said the captain but it shall never be said that boldheart stained his hour of triumph with the blood of his enemy prepare the cutter  the cutter was immediately prepared  without taking your life said the captain i must yet for ever deprive you of the power of spiting other boys i shall turn you adrift in this boat you will find in her two oars a compass a bottle of rum a small cask of water a piece of pork a bag of biscuit and my latin grammar go and spite the natives if you can find any  deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm the unhappy wretch was put into the cutter and was soon left far behind he made no effort to row but was seen lying on his back with his legs up when last made out by the ships telescopes  a stiff breeze now beginning to blow captain boldheart gave orders to keep her ssw easing her a little during the night by falling off a point or two w by w or even by ws if she complained much he then retired for the night having in truth much need of repose in addition to the fatigues he had undergone this brave officer had received sixteen wounds in the engagement but had not mentioned it  in the morning a white squall came on and was succeeded by other squalls of various colours it thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks hurricanes then set in for two months waterspouts and tornadoes followed the oldest sailor on boardand he was a very old onehad never seen such weather the beauty lost all idea where she was and the carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold everybody fell senseless at the pumps every day  provisions now ran very low our hero put the crew on short allowance and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship but his spirit kept him fat in this extremity the gratitude of boozey the captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember was truly affecting the loving though lowly william repeatedly requested to be killed and preserved for the captains table  we now approach a change in affairs  one day during a gleam of sunshine and when the weather had moderated the man at the mastheadtoo weak now to touch his hat besides its having been blown awaycalled out  savages  all was now expectation  presently fifteen hundred canoes each paddled by twenty savages were seen advancing in excellent order they were a light green colour the savages were and sang with great energy the following strain    choo a choo a choo tooth     muntch muntch nycey   choo a choo a choo tooth     muntch muntch nyce  as the shades of night were by this time closing in these expressions were supposed to embody this simple peoples views of the evening hymn but it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of for what we are going to receive c  the chief imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours and having the majestic appearance of a fighting parrot no sooner understood he understood english perfectly that the ship was the beauty captain boldheart than he fell upon his face on the deck and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up  told him he wouldnt hurt him all the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror and had also to be lifted up one by one thus the fame of the great boldheart had gone before him even among these children of nature  turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal after dinner the chief told captain boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there apprehensive of treachery boldheart ordered his boats crew to attend him completely armed and well were it for other commanders if their precautionsbut let us not anticipate  illustration arminarm with the chief  illustration two savages floured him before putting him to the fire  when the canoes arrived at the beach the darkness of the night was illumined by the light of an immense fire ordering his boats crew with the intrepid though illiterate william at their head to keep close and be upon their guard boldheart bravely went on arminarm with the chief  but how to depict the captains surprise when he found a ring of savages singing in chorus that barbarous translation of for what we are going to receive c which has been given above and dancing handinhand round the latingrammarmaster in a hamper with his head shaved while two savages floured him before putting him to the fire to be cooked  boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to be adopted in the mean time the miserable captive never ceased begging pardon and imploring to be delivered on the generous boldhearts proposal it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked but should be allowed to remain raw on two conditions namely       1 that he should never under any circumstances presume to teach      any boy any thing any more       2 that if taken back to england he should pass his life in      travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done and      should do their exercises for those boys for nothing and never say      a word about it  drawing his sword from its sheath boldheart swore him to these conditions on its shining blade the prisoner wept bitterly and appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career  the captain then ordered his boats crew to make ready for a volley and after firing to reload quickly and expect a score or two on ye to go head over heels murmured william boozey for im a looking at ye with those words the derisive though deadly william took a good aim  fire  the ringing voice of boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and the screeching of the savages volley after volley awakened the numerous echoes hundreds of savages were killed hundreds wounded and thousands ran howling into the woods the latingrammarmaster had a spare nightcap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before he presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance and serve him right  illustration the latingrammarmaster had a spare nightcap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before  illustration ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced  by the uncouth though agile william  we now find captain boldheart with this rescued wretch on board standing off for other islands at one of these not a cannibal island but a pork and vegetable one he married only in fun on his part the kings daughter here he rested some time receiving from the natives great quantities of precious stones gold dust elephants teeth and sandal wood and getting very rich this too though he almost every day made presents of enormous value to his men  the ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of valuable things boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor and turn the beautys head towards england these orders were obeyed with three cheers and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile william  we next find captain boldheart about three leagues off madeira surveying through his spyglass a stranger of suspicious appearance making sail towards him on his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to she ran up a flag which he instantly recognized as the flag from the mast in the backgarden at home  illustration married the chiefs daughter  inferring from this that his father had put to sea to seek his longlost son the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger to inquire if this was so and if so whether his fathers intentions were strictly honourable the boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat and reported that the stranger was the family of twelve hundred tons and had not only the captains father on board but also his mother with the majority of his aunts and uncles and all his cousins it was further reported to boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board the beauty and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day  it was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the latingrammarmaster that thankless traitor was found out as the two ships lay near each other communicating with the family by signals and offering to give up boldheart he was hanged at the yardarm the first thing in the morning after having it impressively pointed out to him by boldheart that this was what spiters came to  the meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears his uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too but he wasnt going to stand that his cousins were very much astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men and were greatly overcome by the splendour of his uniform he kindly conducted them round the vessel and pointed out every thing worthy of notice he also fired his hundred guns and found it amusing to witness their alarm  the entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship and lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning only one disagreeable incident occurred captain boldheart found himself obliged to put his cousin tom in irons for being disrespectful on the boys promising amendment however he was humanely released after a few hours close confinement  boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin and asked after the young lady with whom it was well known to the world he was in love his mother replied that the object of his affections was then at school at margate for the benefit of seabathing it was the month of september but that she feared the young ladys friends were still opposed to the union boldheart at once resolved if necessary to bombard the town  taking the command of his ship with this intention and putting all but fighting men on board the family with orders to that vessel to keep in company boldheart soon anchored in margate roads here he went ashore wellarmed and attended by his boats crew at their head the faithful though ferocious william and demanded to see the mayor who came out of his office  dost know the name of yon ship mayor asked boldheart fiercely  illustration dost know the name of yon ship mayor  illustration standing sentry over him  no said the mayor rubbing his eyes which he could scarce believe when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor  she is named the beauty said the captain  hah exclaimed the mayor with a start and you then are captain boldheart  the same  a pause ensued the mayor trembled  now mayor said the captain choose help me to my bride or be bombarded  the mayor begged for two hours grace in which to make inquiries respecting the young lady boldheart accorded him but one and during that one placed william boozey sentry over him with a drawn sword and instructions to accompany him wherever he went and to run him through the body if he showed a sign of playing false  at the end of the hour the mayor reappeared more dead than alive closely waited on by boozey more alive than dead  illustration his lovely bride came forth  captain said the mayor i have ascertained that the young lady is going to bathe even now she waits her turn for a machine the tide is low though rising i in one of our townboats shall not be suspected when she comes forth in her bathingdress into the shallow water from behind the hood of the machine my boat shall intercept her and prevent her return do you the rest  mayor returned capt boldheart thou hast saved thy town  the captain then signalled his boat to take him off and steering her himself ordered her crew to row towards the bathingground and there to rest upon their oars all happened as had been arranged his lovely bride came forth the mayor glided in behind her she became confused and had floated out of her depth when with one skilful touch of the rudder and one quivering stroke from the boats crew her adoring boldheart held her in his strong arms there her shrieks of terror were changed to cries of joy  before the beauty could get under weigh the hoisting of all the flags in the town and harbour and the ringing of all the bells announced to the brave boldheart that he had nothing to fear he therefore determined to be married on the spot and signalled for a clergyman and clerk who came off promptly in a sailingboat named the skylark another great entertainment was then given on board the beauty in the midst of which the mayor was called out by a messenger he returned with the news that government had sent down to know whether captain boldheart in acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a pirate would consent to be made a lieutenantcolonel for himself he would have spurned the worthless boon but his bride wished it and he consented  only one thing further happened before the good ship family was dismissed with rich presents to all on board it is painful to record but such is human nature in some cousins that captain boldhearts unmannerly cousin tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a ropes end for cheekyness and making games when captain boldhearts lady begged for him and he was spared the beauty then refitted and the captain and his bride departed for the indian ocean to enjoy themselves for evermore  illustration captain boldhearts lady begged for him and he was spared   the end                                                    the orange tree series             of childrens books
