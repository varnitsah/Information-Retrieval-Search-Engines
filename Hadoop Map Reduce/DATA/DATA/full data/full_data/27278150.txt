on the title page that this book is by l frank baum and his correspondents for i have used many suggestions conveyed to me in letters from children  once on a time i really imagined myself an author of fairy tales but now i am merely an editor or private secretary for a host of youngsters whose ideas i am requestsed to weave into the thread of my stories  these ideas are often clever  they are also logical and interesting so i have used them whenever i could find an opportunity and it is but just that i acknowledge my indebtedness to my little friends  my what imaginations these children have developed  sometimes i am fairly astounded by their daring and genius  there will be no lack of fairytale authors in the future i am sure  my readers have told me what to do with dorothy and aunt em and uncle henry and i have obeyed their mandates  they have also given me a variety of subjects to write about in the future enough in fact to keep me busy for some time  i am very proud of this alliance  children love these stories because children have helped to create them  my readers know what they want and realize that i try to please them  the result is very satisfactory to the publishers to me and i am quite sure to the children  i hope my dears it will be a long time before we are obliged to dissolve partnership   l frank baum  coronado 1910    1  how the nome king became angry  the nome king was in an angry mood and at such times he was very disagreeable  every one kept away from him even his chief steward kaliko  therefore the king stormed and raved all by himself walking up and down in his jewelstudded cavern and getting angrier all the time then he remembered that it was no fun being angry unless he had some one to frighten and make miserable and he rushed to his big gong and made it clatter as loud as he could  in came the chief steward trying not to show the nome king how frightened he was  send the chief counselor here shouted the angry monarch  kaliko ran out as fast as his spindle legs could carry his fat round body and soon the chief counselor entered the cavern  the king scowled and said to him  im in great trouble over the loss of my magic belt  every little while i want to do something magical and find i cant because the belt is gone  that makes me angry and when im angry i cant have a good time  now what do you advise  some people said the chief counselor enjoy getting angry  but not all the time declared the king  to be angry once in a while is really good fun because it makes others so miserable  but to be angry morning noon and night as i am grows monotonous and prevents my gaining any other pleasure in life  now what do you advise  why if you are angry because you want to do magical things and cant and if you dont want to get angry at all my advice is not to want to do magical things  hearing this the king glared at his counselor with a furious expression and tugged at his own long white whiskers until he pulled them so hard that he yelled with pain  you are a fool he exclaimed  i share that honor with your majesty said the chief counselor  the king roared with rage and stamped his foot  ho there my guards he cried  ho is a royal way of saying come here   so when the guards had hoed the king said to them  take this chief counselor and throw him away  then the guards took the chief counselor and bound him with chains to prevent his struggling and threw him away  and the king paced up and down his cavern more angry than before  finally he rushed to his big gong and made it clatter like a fire alarm  kaliko appeared again trembling and white with fear  fetch my pipe yelled the king  your pipe is already here your majesty replied kaliko  then get my tobacco roared the king  the tobacco is in your pipe your majesty returned the steward  then bring a live coal from the furnace commanded the king  the tobacco is lighted and your majesty is already smoking your pipe answered the steward  why so i am said the king who had forgotten this fact but you are very rude to remind me of it  i am a lowborn miserable villain declared the chief steward humbly  the nome king could think of nothing to say next so he puffed away at his pipe and paced up and down the room  finally he remembered how angry he was and cried out  what do you mean kaliko by being so contented when your monarch is unhappy  what makes you unhappy asked the steward  ive lost my magic belt  a little girl named dorothy who was here with ozma of oz stole my belt and carried it away with her said the king grinding his teeth with rage  she captured it in a fair fight kaliko ventured to say  but i want it  i must have it  half my power is gone with that belt roared the king  you will have to go to the land of oz to recover it and your majesty cant get to the land of oz in any possible way said the steward yawning because he had been on duty ninetysix hours and was sleepy  why not asked the king  because there is a deadly desert all around that fairy country which no one is able to cross  you know that fact as well as i do your majesty  never mind the lost belt  you have plenty of power left for you rule this underground kingdom like a tyrant and thousands of nomes obey your commands  i advise you to drink a glass of melted silver to quiet your nerves and then go to bed  the king grabbed a big ruby and threw it at kalikos head  the steward ducked to escape the heavy jewel which crashed against the door just over his left ear  get out of my sight  vanish  go awayand send general blug here screamed the nome king  kaliko hastily withdrew and the nome king stamped up and down until the general of his armies appeared  this nome was known far and wide as a terrible fighter and a cruel desperate commander  he had fifty thousand nome soldiers all well drilled who feared nothing but their stern master  yet general blug was a trifle uneasy when he arrived and saw how angry the nome king was  ha  so youre here cried the king  so i am said the general  march your army at once to the land of oz capture and destroy the emerald city and bring back to me my magic belt roared the king  youre crazy calmly remarked the general  whats that  whats that  whats that  and the nome king danced around on his pointed toes he was so enraged  you dont know what youre talking about continued the general seating himself upon a large cut diamond  i advise you to stand in a corner and count sixty before you speak again  by that time you may be more sensible  the king looked around for something to throw at general blug but as nothing was handy he began to consider that perhaps the man was right and he had been talking foolishly  so he merely threw himself into his glittering throne and tipped his crown over his ear and curled his feet up under him and glared wickedly at blug  in the first place said the general we cannot march across the deadly desert to the land of oz  and if we could the ruler of that country princess ozma has certain fairy powers that would render my army helpless  had you not lost your magic belt we might have some chance of defeating ozma but the belt is gone  i want it screamed the king  i must have it  well then let us try in a sensible way to get it replied the general  the belt was captured by a little girl named dorothy who lives in kansas in the united states of america  but she left it in the emerald city with ozma declared the king  how do you know that asked the general  one of my spies who is a blackbird flew over the desert to the land of oz and saw the magic belt in ozmas palace replied the king with a groan  now that gives me an idea said general blug thoughtfully  there are two ways to get to the land of oz without traveling across the sandy desert  what are they demanded the king eagerly  one way is over the desert through the air and the other way is under the desert through the earth  hearing this the nome king uttered a yell of joy and leaped from his throne to resume his wild walk up and down the cavern  thats it blug he shouted  thats the idea general  im king of the under world and my subjects are all miners  ill make a secret tunnel under the desert to the land of ozyes right up to the emerald cityand you will march your armies there and capture the whole country  softly softly your majesty  dont go too fast warned the general my nomes are good fighters but they are not strong enough to conquer the emerald city  are you sure asked the king  absolutely certain your majesty  then what am i to do  give up the idea and mind your own business advised the general you have plenty to do trying to rule your underground kingdom  but i want the magic beltand im going to have it roared the nome king  id like to see you get it replied the general laughing maliciously  the king was by this time so exasperated that he picked up his scepter which had a heavy ball made from a sapphire at the end of it and threw it with all his force at general blug  the sapphire hit the general upon his forehead and knocked him flat upon the ground where he lay motionless  then the king rang his gong and told his guards to drag out the general and throw him away which they did  this nome king was named roquat the red and no one loved him  he was a bad man and a powerful monarch and he had resolved to destroy the land of oz and its magnificent emerald city to enslave princess ozma and little dorothy and all the oz people and recover his magic belt this same belt had once enabled roquat the red to carry out many wicked plans but that was before ozma and her people marched to the underground cavern and captured it  the nome king could not forgive dorothy or princess ozma and he had determined to be revenged upon them  but they for their part did not know they had so dangerous an enemy indeed ozma and dorothy had both almost forgotten that such a person as the nome king yet lived under the mountains of the land of evwhich lay just across the deadly desert to the south of the land of oz  an unsuspected enemy is doubly dangerous    2  how uncle henry got into trouble  dorothy gale lived on a farm in kansas with her aunt em and her uncle henry  it was not a big farm nor a very good one because sometimes the rain did not come when the crops needed it and then everything withered and dried up  once a cyclone had carried away uncle henrys house so that he was obliged to build another and as he was a poor man he had to mortgage his farm to get the money to pay for the new house  then his health became bad and he was too feeble to work  the doctor ordered him to take a sea voyage and he went to australia and took dorothy with him  that cost a lot of money too  uncle henry grew poorer every year and the crops raised on the farm only bought food for the family  therefore the mortgage could not be paid  at last the banker who had loaned him the money said that if he did not pay on a certain day his farm would be taken away from him  this worried uncle henry a good deal for without the farm he would have no way to earn a living  he was a good man and worked in the field as hard as he could and aunt em did all the housework with dorothys help  yet they did not seem to get along  this little girl dorothy was like dozens of little girls you know she was loving and usually sweettempered and had a round rosy face and earnest eyes  life was a serious thing to dorothy and a wonderful thing too for she had encountered more strange adventures in her short life than many other girls of her age  aunt em once said she thought the fairies must have marked dorothy at her birth because she had wandered into strange places and had always been protected by some unseen power  as for uncle henry he thought his little niece merely a dreamer as her dead mother had been for he could not quite believe all the curious stories dorothy told them of the land of oz which she had several times visited  he did not think that she tried to deceive her uncle and aunt but he imagined that she had dreamed all of those astonishing adventures and that the dreams had been so real to her that she had come to believe them true  whatever the explanation might be it was certain that dorothy had been absent from her kansas home for several long periods always disappearing unexpectedly yet always coming back safe and sound with amazing tales of where she had been and the unusual people she had met her uncle and aunt listened to her stories eagerly and in spite of their doubts began to feel that the little girl had gained a lot of experience and wisdom that were unaccountable in this age when fairies are supposed no longer to exist  most of dorothys stories were about the land of oz with its beautiful emerald city and a lovely girl ruler named ozma who was the most faithful friend of the little kansas girl  when dorothy told about the riches of this fairy country uncle henry would sigh for he knew that a single one of the great emeralds that were so common there would pay all his debts and leave his farm free  but dorothy never brought any jewels home with her so their poverty became greater every year  when the banker told uncle henry that he must pay the money in thirty days or leave the farm the poor man was in despair as he knew he could not possibly get the money  so he told his wife aunt em of his trouble and she first cried a little and then said that they must be brave and do the best they could and go away somewhere and try to earn an honest living  but they were getting old and feeble and she feared that they could not take care of dorothy as well as they had formerly done  probably the little girl would also be obliged to go to work  they did not tell their niece the sad news for several days not wishing to make her unhappy but one morning the little girl found aunt em softly crying while uncle henry tried to comfort her  then dorothy asked them to tell her what was the matter  we must give up the farm my dear replied her uncle sadly and wander away into the world to work for our living  the girl listened quite seriously for she had not known before how desperately poor they were  we dont mind for ourselves said her aunt stroking the little girls head tenderly but we love you as if you were our own child and we are heartbroken to think that you must also endure poverty and work for a living before you have grown big and strong  what could i do to earn money asked dorothy  you might do housework for some one dear you are so handy or perhaps you could be a nursemaid to little children  im sure i dont know exactly what you can do to earn money but if your uncle and i are able to support you we will do it willingly and send you to school we fear though that we shall have much trouble in earning a living for ourselves  no one wants to employ old people who are broken down in health as we are  dorothy smiled  wouldnt it be funny she said for me to do housework in kansas when im a princess in the land of oz  a princess they both exclaimed astonished  yes ozma made me a princess some time ago and she has often begged me to come and live always in the emerald city said the child  her uncle and aunt looked at her in amazement  then the man said  do you suppose you could manage to return to your fairyland my dear  oh yes replied dorothy i could do that easily  how asked aunt em  ozma sees me every day at four oclock in her magic picture  she can see me wherever i am no matter what i am doing  and at that time if i make a certain secret sign she will send for me by means of the magic belt which i once captured from the nome king  then in the wink of an eye i shall be with ozma in her palace  the elder people remained silent for some time after dorothy had spoken  finally aunt em said with another sigh of regret  if that is the case dorothy perhaps youd better go and live in the emerald city  it will break our hearts to lose you from our lives but you will be so much better off with your fairy friends that it seems wisest and best for you to go  im not so sure about that remarked uncle henry shaking his gray head doubtfully  these things all seem real to dorothy i know but im afraid our little girl wont find her fairyland just what she had dreamed it to be  it would make me very unhappy to think that she was wandering among strangers who might be unkind to her  dorothy laughed merrily at this speech and then she became very sober again for she could see how all this trouble was worrying her aunt and uncle and knew that unless she found a way to help them their future lives would be quite miserable and unhappy  she knew that she could help them  she had thought of a way already  yet she did not tell them at once what it was because she must ask ozmas consent before she would be able to carry out her plans  so she only said  if you will promise not to worry a bit about me ill go to the land of oz this very afternoon  and ill make a promise too that you shall both see me again before the day comes when you must leave this farm  the day isnt far away now her uncle sadly replied  i did not tell you of our trouble until i was obliged to dear dorothy so the evil time is near at hand  but if you are quite sure your fairy friends will give you a home it will be best for you to go to them as your aunt says  that was why dorothy went to her little room in the attic that afternoon taking with her a small dog named toto  the dog had curly black hair and big brown eyes and loved dorothy very dearly  the child had kissed her uncle and aunt affectionately before she went upstairs and now she looked around her little room rather wistfully gazing at the simple trinkets and worn calico and gingham dresses as if they were old friends  she was tempted at first to make a bundle of them yet she knew very well that they would be of no use to her in her future life  she sat down upon a brokenbacked chairthe only one the room containedand holding toto in her arms waited patiently until the clock struck four  then she made the secret signal that had been agreed upon between her and ozma  uncle henry and aunt em waited downstairs  they were uneasy and a good deal excited for this is a practical humdrum world and it seemed to them quite impossible that their little niece could vanish from her home and travel instantly to fairyland  so they watched the stairs which seemed to be the only way that dorothy could get out of the farmhouse and they watched them a long time  they heard the clock strike four but there was no sound from above  halfpast four came and now they were too impatient to wait any longer  softly they crept up the stairs to the door of the little girls room  dorothy  dorothy they called  there was no answer  they opened the door and looked in  the room was empty    3  how ozma granted dorothys request  i suppose you have read so much about the magnificent emerald city that there is little need for me to describe it here  it is the capital city of the land of oz which is justly considered the most attractive and delightful fairyland in all the world  the emerald city is built all of beautiful marbles in which are set a profusion of emeralds every one exquisitely cut and of very great size  there are other jewels used in the decorations inside the houses and palaces such as rubies diamonds sapphires amethysts and turquoises  but in the streets and upon the outside of the buildings only emeralds appear from which circumstance the place is named the emerald city of oz  it has nine thousand six hundred and fiftyfour buildings in which lived fiftyseven thousand three hundred and eighteen people up to the time my story opens  all the surrounding country extending to the borders of the desert which enclosed it upon every side was full of pretty and comfortable farmhouses in which resided those inhabitants of oz who preferred country to city life  altogether there were more than half a million people in the land of ozalthough some of them as you will soon learn were not made of flesh and blood as we areand every inhabitant of that favored country was happy and prosperous  no disease of any sort was ever known among the ozites and so no one ever died unless he met with an accident that prevented him from living  this happened very seldom indeed  there were no poor people in the land of oz because there was no such thing as money and all property of every sort belonged to the ruler  the people were her children and she cared for them  each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use which is as much as any one may reasonably desire  some tilled the lands and raised great crops of grain which was divided equally among the entire population so that all had enough  there were many tailors and dressmakers and shoemakers and the like who made things that any who desired them might wear likewise there were jewelers who made ornaments for the person which pleased and beautified the people and these ornaments also were free to those who asked for them  each man and woman no matter what he or she produced for the good of the community was supplied by the neighbors with food and clothing and a house and furniture and ornaments and games  if by chance the supply ever ran short more was taken from the great storehouses of the ruler which were afterward filled up again when there was more of any article than the people needed  every one worked half the time and played half the time and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do  there were no cruel overseers set to watch them and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them  so each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors and was glad when they would accept the things he produced  you will know by what i have here told you that the land of oz was a remarkable country  i do not suppose such an arrangement would be practical with us but dorothy assures me that it works finely with the oz people  oz being a fairy country the people were of course fairy people but that does not mean that all of them were very unlike the people of our own world  there were all sorts of queer characters among them but not a single one who was evil or who possessed a selfish or violent nature  they were peaceful kind hearted loving and merry and every inhabitant adored the beautiful girl who ruled them and delighted to obey her every command  in spite of all i have said in a general way there were some parts of the land of oz not quite so pleasant as the farming country and the emerald city which was its center  far away in the south country there lived in the mountains a band of strange people called hammerheads because they had no arms and used their flat heads to pound any one who came near them  their necks were like rubber so that they could shoot out their heads to quite a distance and afterward draw them back again to their shoulders  the hammerheads were called the wild people but never harmed any but those who disturbed them in the mountains where they lived  in some of the dense forests there lived great beasts of every sort yet these were for the most part harmless and even sociable and conversed agreeably with those who visited their haunts  the kalidahsbeasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigershad once been fierce and bloodthirsty but even they were now nearly all tamed although at times one or another of them would get cross and disagreeable  not so tame were the fighting trees which had a forest of their own if any one approached them these curious trees would bend down their branches twine them around the intruders and hurl them away  but these unpleasant things existed only in a few remote parts of the land of oz  i suppose every country has some drawbacks so even this almost perfect fairyland could not be quite perfect  once there had been wicked witches in the land too but now these had all been destroyed so as i said only peace and happiness reigned in oz  for some time ozma had ruled over this fair country and never was ruler more popular or beloved  she is said to be the most beautiful girl the world has ever known and her heart and mind are as lovely as her person  dorothy gale had several times visited the emerald city and experienced adventures in the land of oz so that she and ozma had now become firm friends  the girl ruler had even made dorothy a princess of oz and had often implored her to come to ozmas stately palace and live there always but dorothy had been loyal to her aunt em and uncle henry who had cared for her since she was a baby and she had refused to leave them because she knew they would be lonely without her  however dorothy now realized that things were going to be different with her uncle and aunt from this time forth so after giving the matter deep thought she decided to ask ozma to grant her a very great favor  a few seconds after she had made the secret signal in her little bedchamber the kansas girl was seated in a lovely room in ozmas palace in the emerald city of oz  when the first loving kisses and embraces had been exchanged the fair ruler inquired  what is the matter dear  i know something unpleasant has happened to you for your face was very sober when i saw it in my magic picture and whenever you signal me to transport you to this safe place where you are always welcome i know you are in danger or in trouble  dorothy sighed  this time ozma it isnt i she replied  but its worse i guess for uncle henry and aunt em are in a heap of trouble and there seems no way for them to get out of itanyhow not while they live in kansas  tell me about it dorothy said ozma with ready sympathy  why you see uncle henry is poor for the farm in kansas doesnt mount to much as farms go  so one day uncle henry borrowed some money and wrote a letter saying that if he didnt pay the money back they could take his farm for pay  course he spected to pay by making money from the farm but he just couldnt  an so theyre going to take the farm and uncle henry and aunt em wont have any place to live  theyre pretty old to do much hard work ozma so ill have to work for them unless  ozma had been thoughtful during the story but now she smiled and pressed her little friends hand  unless what dear she asked  dorothy hesitated because her request meant so much to them all  well said she id like to live here in the land of oz where youve often vited me to live  but i cant you know unless uncle henry and aunt em could live here too  of course not exclaimed the ruler of oz laughing gaily  so in order to get you little friend we must invite your uncle and aunt to live in oz also  oh will you ozma cried dorothy clasping her chubby little hands eagerly  will you bring them here with the magic belt and give them a nice little farm in the munchkin country or the winkie countryor some other place  to be sure answered ozma full of joy at the chance to please her little friend  i have long been thinking of this very thing dorothy dear and often i have had it in my mind to propose it to you  i am sure your uncle and aunt must be good and worthy people or you would not love them so much and for your friends princess there is always room in the land of oz  dorothy was delighted yet not altogether surprised for she had clung to the hope that ozma would be kind enough to grant her request  when indeed had her powerful and faithful friend refused her anything  but you must not call me princess she said for after this i shall live on the little farm with uncle henry and aunt em and princesses ought not to live on farms  princess dorothy will not replied ozma with her sweet smile  you are going to live in your own rooms in this palace and be my constant companion  but uncle henry began dorothy  oh he is old and has worked enough in his lifetime interrupted the girl ruler so we must find a place for your uncle and aunt where they will be comfortable and happy and need not work more than they care to when shall we transport them here dorothy  i promised to go and see them again before they were turned out of the farmhouse answered dorothy soperhaps next saturday  but why wait so long asked ozma  and why make the journey back to kansas again  let us surprise them and bring them here without any warning  im not sure that they believe in the land of oz said dorothy though ive told em bout it lots of times  theyll believe when they see it declared ozma and if they are told they are to make a magical journey to our fairyland it may make them nervous  i think the best way will be to use the magic belt without warning them and when they have arrived you can explain to them whatever they do not understand  perhaps thats best decided dorothy  there isnt much use in their staying at the farm until they are put out cause its much nicer here  then tomorrow morning they shall come here said princess ozma  i will order jellia jamb who is the palace housekeeper to have rooms all prepared for them and after breakfast we will get the magic belt and by its aid transport your uncle and aunt to the emerald city  thank you ozma cried dorothy kissing her friend gratefully  and now ozma proposed let us take a walk in the gardens before we dress for dinner  come dorothy dear    4  how the nome king planned revenge  the reason most people are bad is because they do not try to be good now the nome king had never tried to be good so he was very bad indeed  having decided to conquer the land of oz and to destroy the emerald city and enslave all its people king roquat the red kept planning ways to do this dreadful thing and the more he planned the more he believed he would be able to accomplish it  about the time dorothy went to ozma the nome king called his chief steward to him and said  kaliko i think i shall make you the general of my armies  i think you wont replied kaliko positively  why not inquired the king reaching for his scepter with the big sapphire  because im your chief steward and know nothing of warfare said kaliko preparing to dodge if anything were thrown at him  i manage all the affairs of your kingdom better than you could yourself and youll never find another steward as good as i am  but there are a hundred nomes better fitted to command your army and your generals get thrown away so often that i have no desire to be one of them  ah there is some truth in your remarks kaliko remarked the king deciding not to throw the scepter  summon my army to assemble in the great cavern  kaliko bowed and retired and in a few minutes returned to say that the army was assembled  so the king went out upon a balcony that overlooked the great cavern where fifty thousand nomes all armed with swords and pikes stood marshaled in military array  when they were not required as soldiers all these nomes were metal workers and miners and they had hammered so much at the forges and dug so hard with pick and shovel that they had acquired great muscular strength  they were strangely formed creatures rather round and not very tall  their toes were curly and their ears broad and flat  in time of war every nome left his forge or mine and became part of the great army of king roquat  the soldiers wore rockcolored uniforms and were excellently drilled  the king looked upon this tremendous army which stood silently arrayed before him and a cruel smile curled the corners of his mouth for he saw that his legions were very powerful  then he addressed them from the balcony saying  i have thrown away general blug because he did not please me  so i want another general to command this army  who is next in command  i am replied colonel crinkle a dapperlooking nome as he stepped forward to salute his monarch  the king looked at him carefully and said  i want you to march this army through an underground tunnel which i am going to bore to the emerald city of oz  when you get there i want you to conquer the oz people destroy them and their city and bring all their gold and silver and precious stones back to my cavern  also you are to recapture my magic belt and return it to me  will you do this general crinkle  no your majesty replied the nome for it cant be done  oh indeed exclaimed the king  then he turned to his servants and said please take general crinkle to the torture chamber  there you will kindly slice him into thin slices  afterward you may feed him to the sevenheaded dogs  anything to oblige your majesty replied the servants politely and led the condemned man away  when they had gone the king addressed the army again  listen said he  the general who is to command my armies must promise to carry out my orders  if he fails he will share the fate of poor crinkle  now then who will volunteer to lead my hosts to the emerald city  for a time no one moved and all were silent  then an old nome with white whiskers so long that they were tied around his waist to prevent their tripping him up stepped out of the ranks and saluted the king  id like to ask a few questions your majesty he said  go ahead replied the king  these oz people are quite good are they not  as good as apple pie said the king  and they are happy i suppose continued the old nome  happy as the day is long said the king  and contented and prosperous inquired the nome  very much so said the king  well your majesty remarked he of the white whiskers i think i should like to undertake the job so ill be your general  i hate good people i detest happy people im opposed to any one who is contented and prosperous  that is why i am so fond of your majesty  make me your general and ill promise to conquer and destroy the oz people  if i fail im ready to be sliced thin and fed to the sevenheaded dogs  very good  very good indeed  thats the way to talk cried roquat the red who was greatly pleased  what is your name general  im called guph your majesty  well guph come with me to my private cave and well talk it over then he turned to the army  nomes and soldiers said he you are to obey the commands of general guph until he becomes dogfeed  any man who fails to obey his new general will be promptly thrown away  you are now dismissed  guph went to the kings private cave and sat down upon an amethyst chair and put his feet on the arm of the kings ruby throne  then he lighted his pipe and threw the live coal he had taken from his pocket upon the kings left foot and puffed the smoke into the kings eyes and made himself comfortable  for he was a wise old nome and he knew that the best way to get along with roquat the red was to show that he was not afraid of him  im ready for the talk your majesty he said  the king coughed and looked at his new general fiercely  do you not tremble to take such liberties with your monarch he asked  oh no replied guph calmly and he blew a wreath of smoke that curled around the kings nose and made him sneeze  you want to conquer the emerald city and im the only nome in all your dominions who can conquer it  so you will be very careful not to hurt me until i have carried out your wishes  after that  well what then inquired the king  then you will be so grateful to me that you wont care to hurt me replied the general  that is a very good argument said roquat  but suppose you fail  then its the slicing machine  i agree to that announced guph but if you do as i tell you there will be no failure  the trouble with you roquat is that you dont think carefully enough  i do  you would go ahead and march through your tunnel into oz and get defeated and driven back  i wont  and the reason i wont is because when i march ill have all my plans made and a host of allies to assist my nomes  what do you mean by that asked the king  ill explain king roquat  youre going to attack a fairy country and a mighty fairy country too  they havent much of an army in oz but the princess who ruled them has a fairy wand and the little girl dorothy has your magic belt and at the north of the emerald city lives a clever sorceress called glinda the good who commands the spirits of the air  also i have heard that there is a wonderful wizard in ozmas palace who is so skillful that people used to pay him money in america to see him perform  so you see it will be no easy thing to overcome all this magic  we have fifty thousand soldiers cried the king proudly  yes but they are nomes remarked guph taking a silk handkerchief from the kings pocket and wiping his own pointed shoes with it nomes are immortals but they are not strong on magic  when you lost your famous belt the greater part of your own power was gone from you against ozma you and your nomes would have no show at all  roquats eyes flashed angrily  then away you go to the slicing machine he cried  not yet said the general filling his pipe from the kings private tobacco pouch  what do you propose to do asked the monarch  i propose to obtain the power we need answered guph  there are a good many evil creatures who have magic powers sufficient to destroy and conquer the land of oz  we will get them on our side band them all together and then take ozma and her people by surprise  its all very simple and easy when you know how  alone we should be helpless to injure the ruler of oz but with the aid of the evil powers we can summon we shall easily succeed  king roquat was delighted with this idea for he realized how clever it was  surely guph you are the greatest general i have ever had he exclaimed his eyes sparkling with joy  you must go at once and make arrangements with the evil powers to assist us and meantime ill begin to dig the tunnel  i thought youd agree with me roquat replied the new general ill start this very afternoon to visit the chief of the whimsies    5  how dorothy became a princess  when the people of the emerald city heard that dorothy had returned to them every one was eager to see her for the little girl was a general favorite in the land of oz  from time to time some of the folk from the great outside world had found their way into this fairyland but all except one had been companions of dorothy and had turned out to be very agreeable people  the exception i speak of was the wonderful wizard of oz a sleightofhand performer from omaha who went up in a balloon and was carried by a current of air to the emerald city  his queer and puzzling tricks made the people of oz believe him a great wizard for a time and he ruled over them until dorothy arrived on her first visit and showed the wizard to be a mere humbug  he was a gentle kindhearted little man and dorothy grew to like him afterward  when after an absence the wizard returned to the land of oz ozma received him graciously and gave him a home in a part of the palace  in addition to the wizard two other personages from the outside world had been allowed to make their home in the emerald city  the first was a quaint shaggy man whom ozma had made the governor of the royal storehouses and the second a yellow hen named billina who had a fine house in the gardens back of the palace where she looked after a large family  both these had been old comrades of dorothy so you see the little girl was quite an important personage in oz and the people thought she had brought them good luck and loved her next best to ozma  during her several visits this little girl had been the means of destroying two wicked witches who oppressed the people and she had discovered a live scarecrow who was now one of the most popular personages in all the fairy country  with the scarecrows help she had rescued nick chopper a tin woodman who had rusted in a lonely forest and the tin man was now the emperor of the country of the winkies and much beloved because of his kind heart  no wonder the people thought dorothy had brought them good luck  yet strange as it may seem she had accomplished all these wonders not because she was a fairy or had any magical powers whatever but because she was a simple sweet and true little girl who was honest to herself and to all whom she met  in this world in which we live simplicity and kindness are the only magic wands that work wonders and in the land of oz dorothy found these same qualities had won for her the love and admiration of the people indeed the little girl had made many warm friends in the fairy country and the only real grief the ozites had ever experienced was when dorothy left them and returned to her kansas home  now she received a joyful welcome although no one except ozma knew at first that she had finally come to stay for good and all  that evening dorothy had many callers and among them were such important people as tiktok a machine man who thought and spoke and moved by clockwork her old companion the genial shaggy man jack pumpkinhead whose body was brushwood and whose head was a ripe pumpkin with a face carved upon it the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger two great beasts from the forest who served princess ozma and professor h m wogglebug te  this wogglebug was a remarkable creature  he had once been a tiny little bug crawling around in a schoolroom but he was discovered and highly magnified so that he could be seen more plainly and while in this magnified condition he had escaped  he had always remained big and he dressed like a dandy and was so full of knowledge and information which are distinct acquirements that he had been made a professor and the head of the royal college  dorothy had a nice visit with these old friends and also talked a long time with the wizard who was little and old and withered and dried up but as merry and active as a child  afterward she went to see billinas fastgrowing family of chicks  toto dorothys little black dog also met with a cordial reception toto was an especial friend of the shaggy man and he knew every one else  being the only dog in the land of oz he was highly respected by the people who believed animals entitled to every consideration if they behaved themselves properly  dorothy had four lovely rooms in the palace which were always reserved for her use and were called dorothys rooms  these consisted of a beautiful sitting room a dressing room a dainty bedchamber and a big marble bathroom  and in these rooms were everything that heart could desire placed there with loving thoughtfulness by ozma for her little friends use  the royal dressmakers had the little girls measure so they kept the closets in her dressing room filled with lovely dresses of every description and suitable for every occasion  no wonder dorothy had refrained from bringing with her her old calico and gingham dresses  here everything that was dear to a little girls heart was supplied in profusion and nothing so rich and beautiful could ever have been found in the biggest department stores in america  of course dorothy enjoyed all these luxuries and the only reason she had heretofore preferred to live in kansas was because her uncle and aunt loved her and needed her with them  now however all was to be changed and dorothy was really more delighted to know that her dear relatives were to share in her good fortune and enjoy the delights of the land of oz than she was to possess such luxury for herself  next morning at ozmas request dorothy dressed herself in a pretty skyblue gown of rich silk trimmed with real pearls  the buckles of her shoes were set with pearls too and more of these priceless gems were on a lovely coronet which she wore upon her forehead  for said her friend ozma from this time forth my dear you must assume your rightful rank as a princess of oz and being my chosen companion you must dress in a way befitting the dignity of your position  dorothy agreed to this although she knew that neither gowns nor jewels could make her anything else than the simple unaffected little girl she had always been  as soon as they had breakfastedthe girls eating together in ozmas pretty boudoirthe ruler of oz said  now dear friend we will use the magic belt to transport your uncle and aunt from kansas to the emerald city  but i think it would be fitting in receiving such distinguished guests for us to sit in my throne room  oh theyre not very stinguished ozma said dorothy  theyre just plain people like me  being your friends and relatives princess dorothy they are certainly distinguished replied the ruler with a smile  theythey wont hardly know what to make of all your splendid furniture and things protested dorothy gravely  it may scare em to see your grand throne room an praps wed better go into the back yard ozma where the cabbages grow an the chickens are playing  then it would seem more natural to uncle henry and aunt em  no they shall first see me in my throne room replied ozma decidedly and when she spoke in that tone dorothy knew it was not wise to oppose her for ozma was accustomed to having her own way  so together they went to the throne room an immense domed chamber in the center of the palace  here stood the royal throne made of solid gold and encrusted with enough precious stones to stock a dozen jewelry stores in our country  ozma who was wearing the magic belt seated herself in the throne and dorothy sat at her feet  in the room were assembled many ladies and gentlemen of the court clothed in rich apparel and wearing fine jewelry  two immense animals squatted one on each side of the thronethe cowardly lion and the hungry tiger  in a balcony high up in the dome an orchestra played sweet music and beneath the dome two electric fountains sent sprays of colored perfumed water shooting up nearly as high as the arched ceiling  are you ready dorothy asked the ruler  i am replied dorothy but i dont know whether aunt em and uncle henry are ready  that wont matter declared ozma  the old life can have very little to interest them and the sooner they begin the new life here the happier they will be  here they come my dear  as she spoke there before the throne appeared uncle henry and aunt em who for a moment stood motionless glaring with white and startled faces at the scene that confronted them  if the ladies and gentlemen present had not been so polite i am sure they would have laughed at the two strangers  aunt em had her calico dress skirt tucked up and she wore a faded bluechecked apron  her hair was rather straggly and she had on a pair of uncle henrys old slippers  in one hand she held a dishtowel and in the other a cracked earthenware plate which she had been engaged in wiping when so suddenly transported to the land of oz  uncle henry when the summons came had been out in the barn doin chores  he wore a ragged and much soiled straw hat a checked shirt without any collar and blue overalls tucked into the tops of his old cowhide boots  by gum gasped uncle henry looking around as if bewildered  well i swan gurgled aunt em in a hoarse frightened voice  then her eyes fell upon dorothy and she said ddddont that look like our little girlour dorothy henry  hi therelook out em exclaimed the old man as aunt em advanced a step take care o the wild beastses or youre a goner  but now dorothy sprang forward and embraced and kissed her aunt and uncle affectionately afterward taking their hands in her own  dont be afraid she said to them  you are now in the land of oz where you are to live always and be comferble an happy  youll never have to worry over anything again cause there wont be anything to worry about  and you owe it all to the kindness of my friend princess ozma  here she led them before the throne and continued  your highness this is uncle henry  and this is aunt em  they want to thank you for bringing them here from kansas  aunt em tried to slick her hair and she hid the dishtowel and dish under her apron while she bowed to the lovely ozma  uncle henry took off his straw hat and held it awkwardly in his hands  but the ruler of oz rose and came from her throne to greet her newly arrived guests and she smiled as sweetly upon them as if they had been a king and queen  you are very welcome here where i have brought you for princess dorothys sake she said graciously and i hope you will be quite happy in your new home  then she turned to her courtiers who were silently and gravely regarding the scene and added i present to my people our princess dorothys beloved uncle henry and aunt em who will hereafter be subjects of our kingdom  it will please me to have you show them every kindness and honor in your power and to join me in making them happy and contented  hearing this all those assembled bowed low and respectfully to the old farmer and his wife who bobbed their own heads in return  and now said ozma to them dorothy will show you the rooms prepared for you  i hope you will like them and shall expect you to join me at luncheon  so dorothy led her relatives away and as soon as they were out of the throne room and alone in the corridor aunt em squeezed dorothys hand and said  child child  how in the world did we ever get here so quick  and is it all real  and are we to stay here as she says  and what does it all mean anyhow  dorothy laughed  why didnt you tell us what you were goin to do inquired uncle henry reproachfully  if id known about it id a put on my sunday clothes  ill splain everthing as soon as we get to your rooms promised dorothy  youre in great luck uncle henry and aunt em an so am i and oh im so happy to have got you here at last  as he walked by the little girls side uncle henry stroked his whiskers thoughtfully  pears to me dorothy we wont make bangup fairies he remarked  an my back hair looks like a fright wailed aunt em  never mind returned the little girl reassuringly  you wont have anything to do now but to look pretty aunt em an uncle henry wont have to work till his back aches thats certain  sure they asked wonderingly and in the same breath  course im sure said dorothy  youre in the fairyland of oz now an whats more you belong to it    6  how guph visited the whimsies  the new general of the nome kings army knew perfectly well that to fail in his plans meant death for him  yet he was not at all anxious or worried  he hated every one who was good and longed to make all who were happy unhappy  therefore he had accepted this dangerous position as general quite willingly feeling sure in his evil mind that he would be able to do a lot of mischief and finally conquer the land of oz  yet guph determined to be careful and to lay his plans well so as not to fail  he argued that only careless people fail in what they attempt to do  the mountains underneath which the nome kings extensive caverns were located lay grouped just north of the land of ev which lay directly across the deadly desert to the east of the land of oz  as the mountains were also on the edge of the desert the nome king found that he had only to tunnel underneath the desert to reach ozmas dominions he did not wish his armies to appear above ground in the country of the winkies which was the part of the land of oz nearest to king roquats own country as then the people would give the alarm and enable ozma to fortify the emerald city and assemble an army  he wanted to take all the oz people by surprise so he decided to run the tunnel clear through to the emerald city where he and his hosts could break through the ground without warning and conquer the people before they had time to defend themselves  roquat the red began work at once upon his tunnel setting a thousand miners at the task and building it high and broad enough for his armies to march through it with ease  the nomes were used to making tunnels as all the kingdom in which they lived was under ground so they made rapid progress  while this work was going on general guph started out alone to visit the chief of the whimsies  these whimsies were curious people who lived in a retired country of their own  they had large strong bodies but heads so small that they were no bigger than doorknobs  of course such tiny heads could not contain any great amount of brains and the whimsies were so ashamed of their personal appearance and lack of commonsense that they wore big heads made of pasteboard which they fastened over their own little heads  on these pasteboard heads they sewed sheeps wool for hair and the wool was colored many tintspink green and lavender being the favorite colors  the faces of these false heads were painted in many ridiculous ways according to the whims of the owners and these big burly creatures looked so whimsical and absurd in their queer masks that they were called whimsies  they foolishly imagined that no one would suspect the little heads that were inside the imitation ones not knowing that it is folly to try to appear otherwise than as nature has made us  the chief of the whimsies had as little wisdom as the others and had been chosen chief merely because none among them was any wiser or more capable of ruling  the whimsies were evil spirits and could not be killed  they were hated and feared by every one and were known as terrible fighters because they were so strong and muscular and had not sense enough to know when they were defeated  general guph thought the whimsies would be a great help to the nomes in the conquest of oz for under his leadership they could be induced to fight as long so they could stand up  so he traveled to their country and asked to see the chief who lived in a house that had a picture of his grotesque false head painted over the doorway  the chiefs false head had blue hair a turnedup nose and a mouth that stretched half across the face  big green eyes had been painted upon it but in the center of the chin were two small holes made in the pasteboard so that the chief could see through them with his own tiny eyes for when the big head was fastened upon his shoulders the eyes in his own natural head were on a level with the false chin  said general guph to the chief of the whimsies  we nomes are going to conquer the land of oz and capture our kings magic belt which the oz people stole from him  then we are going to plunder and destroy the whole country  and we want the whimsies to help us  will there be any fighting asked the chief  plenty replied guph  that must have pleased the chief for he got up and danced around the room three times  then he seated himself again adjusted his false head and said  we have no quarrel with ozma of oz  but you whimsies love to fight and here is a splendid chance to do so urged guph  wait till i sing a song said the chief  then he lay back in his chair and sang a foolish song that did not seem to the general to mean anything although he listened carefully  when he had finished the chief whimsie looked at him through the holes in his chin and asked  what reward will you give us if we help you  the general was prepared for this question for he had been thinking the matter over on his journey  people often do a good deed without hope of reward but for an evil deed they always demand payment  when we get our magic belt he made reply our king roquat the red will use its power to give every whimsie a natural head as big and fine as the false head he now wears  then you will no longer be ashamed because your big strong bodies have such teentyweenty heads  oh  will you do that asked the chief eagerly  we surely will promised the general  ill talk to my people said the chief  so he called a meeting of all the whimsies and told them of the offer made by the nomes  the creatures were delighted with the bargain and at once agreed to fight for the nome king and help him to conquer oz  one whimsie alone seemed to have a glimmer of sense for he asked  suppose we fail to capture the magic belt  what will happen then and what good will all our fighting do  but they threw him into the river for asking foolish questions and laughed when the water ruined his pasteboard head before he could swim out again  so the compact was made and general guph was delighted with his success in gaining such powerful allies  but there were other people too just as important as the whimsies whom the clever old nome had determined to win to his side    7  how aunt em conquered the lion  these are your rooms said dorothy opening a door  aunt em drew back at the sight of the splendid furniture and draperies  aint there any place to wipe my feet she asked  you will soon change your slippers for new shoes replied dorothy dont be afraid aunt em  here is where you are to live so walk right in and make yourself at home  aunt em advanced hesitatingly  it beats the topeka hotel she cried admiringly  but this place is too grand for us child  cant we have some back room in the attic thats more in our class  no said dorothy  youve got to live here cause ozma says so and all the rooms in this palace are just as fine as these and some are better  it wont do any good to fuss aunt em  youve got to be swell and hightoned in the land of oz whether you want to or not so you may as well make up your mind to it  its hard luck replied her aunt looking around with an awed expression but folks can get used to anything if they try  eh henry  why as to that said uncle henry slowly i blieve in takin whats pervided us an askin no questions  ive traveled some em in my time and you haint an that makes a difference atween us  then dorothy showed them through the rooms  the first was a handsome sittingroom with windows opening upon the rose gardens  then came separate bedrooms for aunt em and uncle henry with a fine bathroom between them  aunt em had a pretty dressing room besides and dorothy opened the closets and showed several exquisite costumes that had been provided for her aunt by the royal dressmakers who had worked all night to get them ready  everything that aunt em could possibly need was in the drawers and closets and her dressingtable was covered with engraved gold toilet articles  uncle henry had nine suits of clothes cut in the popular munchkin fashion with kneebreeches silk stockings and low shoes with jeweled buckles  the hats to match these costumes had pointed tops and wide brims with small gold bells around the edges  his shirts were of fine linen with frilled bosoms and his vests were richly embroidered with colored silks  uncle henry decided that he would first take a bath and then dress himself in a blue satin suit that had caught his fancy  he accepted his good fortune with calm composure and refused to have a servant to assist him  but aunt em was all of a flutter as she said and it took dorothy and jellia jamb the housekeeper and two maids a long time to dress her and do up her hair and get her rigged like a popinjay as she quaintly expressed it  she wanted to stop and admire everything that caught her eye and she sighed continually and declared that such finery was too good for an old country woman and that she never thought she would have to put on airs at her time of life  finally she was dressed and when she went into the sittingroom there was uncle henry in his blue satin walking gravely up and down the room  he had trimmed his beard and mustache and looked very dignified and respectable  tell me dorothy he said do all the men here wear duds like these  yes she replied all cept the scarecrow and the shaggy manand of course the tin woodman and tiktok who are made of metal  youll find all the men at ozmas court dressed just as you areonly perhaps a little finer  henry you look like a playactor announced aunt em looking at her husband critically  an you em look more highfalutin than a peacock he replied  i guess youre right she said regretfully but were helpless victims of hightoned royalty  dorothy was much amused  come with me she said and ill show you round the palace  she took them through the beautiful rooms and introduced them to all the people they chanced to meet  also she showed them her own pretty rooms which were not far from their own  so its all true said aunt em wideeyed with amazement and what dorothy told us of this fairy country was plain facts instead of dreams  but where are all the strange creatures you used to know here  yes wheres the scarecrow inquired uncle henry  why hes just now away on a visit to the tin woodman who is empror of the winkie country answered the little girl  youll see him when he comes back and youre sure to like him  and wheres the wonderful wizard asked aunt em  youll see him at ozmas luncheon for he lives here in this palace was the reply  and jack pumpkinhead  oh he lives a little way out of town in his own pumpkin field well go there some time and see him and well call on professor wogglebug too  the shaggy man will be at the luncheon i guess and tiktok  and now ill take you out to see billina who has a house of her own  so they went into the back yard and after walking along winding paths some distance through the beautiful gardens they came to an attractive little house where the yellow hen sat on the front porch sunning herself  good morning my dear mistress called billina fluttering down to meet them  i was expecting you to call for i heard you had come back and brought your uncle and aunt with you  were here for good and all this time billina cried dorothy joyfully  uncle henry and aunt em belong to oz now as much as i do  then they are very lucky people declared billina for there couldnt be a nicer place to live  but come my dear i must show you all my dorothys  nine are living and have grown up to be very respectable hens but one took cold at ozmas birthday party and died of the pip and the other two turned out to be horrid roosters so i had to change their names from dorothy to daniel  they all had the letter d engraved upon their gold lockets you remember with your picture inside and d stands for daniel as well as for dorothy  did you call both the roosters daniel asked uncle henry  yes indeed  ive nine dorothys and two daniels and the nine dorothys have eightysix sons and daughters and over three hundred grandchildren said billina proudly  what names do you give em all dear inquired the little girl  oh they are all dorothys and daniels some being juniors and some doublejuniors  dorothy and daniel are two good names and i see no object in hunting for others declared the yellow hen  but just think dorothy what a big chicken family weve grown to be and our numbers increase nearly every day  ozma doesnt know what to do with all the eggs we lay and we are never eaten or harmed in any way as chickens are in your country  they give us everything to make us contented and happy and i my dear am the acknowledged queen and governor of every chicken in oz because im the eldest and started the whole colony  you ought to be very proud maam said uncle henry who was astonished to hear a hen talk so sensibly  oh i am she replied  ive the loveliest pearl necklace you ever saw  come in the house and ill show it to you  and ive nine leg bracelets and a diamond pin for each wing  but i only wear them on state occasions  they followed the yellow hen into the house which aunt em declared was neat as a pin  they could not sit down because all billinas chairs were roostingpoles made of silver so they had to stand while the hen fussily showed them her treasures  then they had to go into the back rooms occupied by billinas nine dorothys and two daniels who were all plump yellow chickens and greeted the visitors very politely  it was easy to see that they were well bred and that billina had looked after their education  in the yards were all the children and grandchildren of these eleven elders and they were of all sizes from wellgrown hens to tiny chickens just out of the shell  about fifty fluffy yellow youngsters were at school being taught good manners and good grammar by a young hen who wore spectacles  they sang in chorus a patriotic song of the land of oz in honor of their visitors and aunt em was much impressed by these talking chickens  dorothy wanted to stay and play with the young chickens for awhile but uncle henry and aunt em had not seen the palace grounds and gardens yet and were eager to get better acquainted with the marvelous and delightful land in which they were to live  ill stay here and you can go for a walk said dorothy  youll be perfecly safe anywhere and may do whatever you want to  when you get tired go back to the palace and find your rooms and ill come to you before luncheon is ready  so uncle henry and aunt em started out alone to explore the grounds and dorothy knew that they couldnt get lost because all the palace grounds were enclosed by a high wall of green marble set with emeralds  it was a rare treat to these simple folk who had lived in the country all their lives and known little enjoyment of any sort to wear beautiful clothes and live in a palace and be treated with respect and consideration by all around them  they were very happy indeed as they strolled up the shady walks and looked upon the gorgeous flowers and shrubs feeling that their new home was more beautiful than any tongue could describe  suddenly as they turned a corner and walked through a gap in a high hedge they came face to face with an enormous lion which crouched upon the green lawn and seemed surprised by their appearance  they stopped short uncle henry trembling with horror and aunt em too terrified to scream  next moment the poor woman clasped her husband around the neck and cried  save me henry save me  cant even save myself em he returned in a husky voice for the animile looks as if it could eat both of us an lick its chops for more  if i only had a gun  havent you henry  havent you she asked anxiously  nary gun em  so lets die as brave an graceful as we can  i knew our luck couldnt last  i wont die  i wont be eaten by a lion wailed aunt em glaring upon the huge beast  then a thought struck her and she whispered henry ive heard as savage beastses can be conquered by the human eye  ill eye that lion out o countenance an save our lives  try it em he returned also in a whisper  look at him as you do at me when im late to dinner  aunt em turned upon the lion a determined countenance and a wild dilated eye  she glared at the immense beast steadily and the lion who had been quietly blinking at them began to appear uneasy and disturbed  is anything the matter maam he asked in a mild voice  at this speech from the terrible beast aunt em and uncle henry both were startled and then uncle henry remembered that this must be the lion they had seen in ozmas throne room  hold on em he exclaimed  quit the eagle eye conquest an take courage  i guess this is the same cowardly lion dorothy has told us about  oh is it she cried much relieved  when he spoke i got the idea and when he looked so shamed like i was sure of it uncle henry continued  aunt em regarded the animal with new interest  are you the cowardly lion she inquired  are you dorothys friend  yesm answered the lion meekly  dorothy and i are old chums and are very fond of each other  im the king of beasts you know and the hungry tiger and i serve princess ozma as her body guards  to be sure said aunt em nodding  but the king of beasts shouldnt be cowardly  ive heard that said before remarked the lion yawning till he showed two great rows of sharp white teeth but that does not keep me from being frightened whenever i go into battle  what do you do run asked uncle henry  no that would be foolish for the enemy would run after me declared the lion  so i tremble with fear and pitch in as hard as i can and so far i have always won my fight  ah i begin to understand said uncle henry  were you scared when i looked at you just now inquired aunt em  terribly scared madam answered the lion for at first i thought you were going to have a fit  then i noticed you were trying to overcome me by the power of your eye and your glance was so fierce and penetrating that i shook with fear  this greatly pleased the lady and she said quite cheerfully  well i wont hurt you so dont be scared any more  i just wanted to see what the human eye was good for  the human eye is a fearful weapon remarked the lion scratching his nose softly with his paw to hide a smile  had i not known you were dorothys friends i might have torn you both into shreds in order to escape your terrible gaze  aunt em shuddered at hearing this and uncle henry said hastily  im glad you knew us  good morning mr lion well hope to see you againby and bysome time in the future  good morning replied the lion squatting down upon the lawn again you are likely to see a good deal of me if you live in the land of oz    8  how the grand gallipoot joined the nomes  after leaving the whimsies guph continued on his journey and penetrated far into the northwest  he wanted to get to the country of the growleywogs and in order to do that he must cross the ripple land which was a hard thing to do  for the ripple land was a succession of hills and valleys all very steep and rocky and they changed places constantly by rippling  while guph was climbing a hill it sank down under him and became a valley and while he was descending into a valley it rose up and carried him to the top of a hill  this was very perplexing to the traveler and a stranger might have thought he could never cross the ripple land at all  but guph knew that if he kept steadily on he would get to the end at last so he paid no attention to the changing hills and valleys and plodded along as calmly as if walking upon the level ground  the result of this wise persistence was that the general finally reached firmer soil and after penetrating a dense forest came to the dominion of the growleywogs  no sooner had he crossed the border of this domain when two guards seized him and carried him before the grand gallipoot of the growleywogs who scowled upon him ferociously and asked him why he dared intrude upon his territory  im the lord high general of the invincible army of the nomes and my name is guph was the reply  all the world trembles when that name is mentioned  the growleywogs gave a shout of jeering laughter at this and one of them caught the nome in his strong arms and tossed him high into the air  guph was considerably shaken when he fell upon the hard ground but he appeared to take no notice of the impertinence and composed himself to speak again to the grand gallipoot  my master king roquat the red has sent me here to confer with you he wishes your assistance to conquer the land of oz  here the general paused and the grand gallipoot scowled upon him more terribly than ever and said  go on  the voice of the grand gallipoot was partly a roar and partly a growl he mumbled his words badly and guph had to listen carefully in order to understand him  these growleywogs were certainly remarkable creatures  they were of gigantic size yet were all bone and skin and muscle there being no meat or fat upon their bodies at all  their powerful muscles lay just underneath their skins like bunches of tough rope and the weakest growleywog was so strong that he could pick up an elephant and toss it seven miles away  it seems unfortunate that strong people are usually so disagreeable and overbearing that no one cares for them  in fact to be different from your fellow creatures is always a misfortune  the growleywogs knew that they were disliked and avoided by every one so they had become surly and unsociable even among themselves  guph knew that they hated all people including the nomes but he hoped to win them over nevertheless and knew that if he succeeded they would afford him very powerful assistance  the land of oz is ruled by a nambypamby girl who is disgustingly kind and good he continued  her people are all happy and contented and have no care or worries whatever  go on growled the grand gallipoot  once the nome king enslaved the royal family of evanother goodygoody lot that we detest said the general  but ozma interfered although it was none of her business and marched her army against us  with her was a kansas girl named dorothy and a yellow hen and they marched directly into the nome kings cavern  there they liberated our slaves from ev and stole king roquats magic belt which they carried away with them  so now our king is making a tunnel under the deadly desert so we can march through it to the emerald city when we get there we mean to conquer and destroy all the land and recapture the magic belt  again he paused and again the grand gallipoot growled  go on  guph tried to think what to say next and a happy thought soon occurred to him  we want you to help us in this conquest he announced for we need the mighty aid of the growleywogs in order to make sure that we shall not be defeated  you are the strongest people in all the world and you hate good and happy creatures as much as we nomes do  i am sure it will be a real pleasure to you to tear down the beautiful emerald city and in return for your valuable assistance we will allow you to bring back to your country ten thousand people of oz to be your slaves  twenty thousand growled the grand gallipoot  all right we promise you twenty thousand agreed the general  the gallipoot made a signal and at once his attendants picked up general guph and carried him away to a prison where the jailer amused himself by sticking pins in the round fat body of the old nome to see him jump and hear him yell  but while this was going on the grand gallipoot was talking with his counselors who were the most important officials of the growleywogs when he had stated to them the proposition of the nome king he said  my advice is to offer to help them  then when we have conquered the land of oz we will take not only our twenty thousand prisoners but all the gold and jewels we want  let us take the magic belt too suggested one counselor  and rob the nome king and make him our slave said another  that is a good idea declared the grand gallipoot  id like king roquat for my own slave  he could black my boots and bring me my porridge every morning while i am in bed  there is a famous scarecrow in oz  ill take him for my slave said a counselor  ill take tiktok the machine man said another  give me the tin woodman said a third  they went on for some time dividing up the people and the treasure of oz in advance of the conquest  for they had no doubt at all that they would be able to destroy ozmas domain  were they not the strongest people in all the world  the deadly desert has kept us out of oz before remarked the grand gallipoot but now that the nome king is building a tunnel we shall get into the emerald city very easily  so let us send the little fat general back to his king with our promise to assist him  we will not say that we intend to conquer the nomes after we have conquered oz but we will do so just the same  this plan being agreed upon they all went home to dinner leaving general guph still in prison  the nome had no idea that he had succeeded in his mission for finding himself in prison he feared the growleywogs intended to put him to death  by this time the jailer had tired of sticking pins in the general and was amusing himself by carefully pulling the nomes whiskers out by the roots one at a time  this enjoyment was interrupted by the grand gallipoot sending for the prisoner  wait a few hours begged the jailer  i havent pulled out a quarter of his whiskers yet  if you keep the grand gallipoot waiting hell break your back declared the messenger  perhaps youre right sighed the jailer  take the prisoner away if you will but i advise you to kick him at every step he takes  it will be good fun for he is as soft as a ripe peach  so guph was led away to the royal castle where the grand gallipoot told him that the growleywogs had decided to assist the nomes in conquering the land of oz  whenever you are ready he added send me word and i will march with eighteen thousand of my most powerful warriors to your aid  guph was so delighted that he forgot all the smarting caused by the pins and the pulling of whiskers  he did not even complain of the treatment he had received but thanked the grand gallipoot and hurried away upon his journey  he had now secured the assistance of the whimsies and the growleywogs but his success made him long for still more allies  his own life depended upon his conquering oz and he said to himself  ill take no chances  ill be certain of success  then when oz is destroyed perhaps i shall be a greater man than old roquat and i can throw him away and be king of the nomes myself  why not  the whimsies are stronger than the nomes and they also are my friends  there are some people still stronger than the growleywogs and if i can but induce them to aid me i shall have nothing more to fear    9  how the wogglebug taught athletics  it did not take dorothy long to establish herself in her new home for she knew the people and the manners and customs of the emerald city just as well as she knew the old kansas farm  but uncle henry and aunt em had some trouble in getting used to the finery and pomp and ceremony of ozmas palace and felt uneasy because they were obliged to be dressed up all the time  yet every one was very courteous and kind to them and endeavored to make them happy ozma especially made much of dorothys relatives for her little friends sake and she well knew that the awkwardness and strangeness of their new mode of life would all wear off in time  the old people were chiefly troubled by the fact that there was no work for them to do  evry day is like sunday now declared aunt em solemnly and i cant say i like it  if theyd only let me do up the dishes after meals or even sweep an dust my own rooms id be a deal happier henry dont know what to do with himself either and once when he stole out an fed the chickens billina scolded him for letting em eat between meals  i never knew before what a hardship it is to be rich and have everything you want  these complaints began to worry dorothy so she had a long talk with ozma upon the subject  i see i must find them something to do said the girlish ruler of oz seriously  i have been watching your uncle and aunt and i believe they will be more contented if occupied with some light tasks  while i am considering this matter dorothy you might make a trip with them through the land of oz visiting some of the odd corners and introducing your relatives to some of our curious people  oh that would be fine exclaimed dorothy eagerly  i will give you an escort befitting your rank as a princess continued ozma and you may go to some of the places you have not yet visited yourself as well as some others that you know  i will mark out a plan of the trip for you and have everything in readiness for you to start tomorrow morning  take your time dear and be gone as long as you wish  by the time you return i shall have found some occupation for uncle henry and aunt em that will keep them from being restless and dissatisfied  dorothy thanked her good friend and kissed the lovely ruler gratefully then she ran to tell the joyful news to her uncle and aunt  next morning after breakfast everything was found ready for their departure  the escort included omby amby the captain general of ozmas army which consisted merely of twentyseven officers besides the captain general  once omby amby had been a private soldierthe only private in the armybut as there was never any fighting to do ozma saw no need of a private so she made omby amby the highest officer of them all he was very tall and slim and wore a gay uniform and a fierce mustache yet the mustache was the only fierce thing about omby amby whose nature was as gentle as that of a child  the wonderful wizard had asked to join the party and with him came his friend the shaggy man who was shaggy but not ragged being dressed in fine silks with satin shags and bobtails  the shaggy man had shaggy whiskers and hair but a sweet disposition and a soft pleasant voice  there was an open wagon with three seats for the passengers and the wagon was drawn by the famous wooden sawhorse which had once been brought to life by ozma by means of a magic powder  the sawhorse wore wooden shoes to keep his wooden legs from wearing away and he was strong and swift  as this curious creature was ozmas own favorite steed and very popular with all the people of the emerald city dorothy knew that she had been highly favored by being permitted to use the sawhorse on her journey  in the front seat of the wagon sat dorothy and the wizard  uncle henry and aunt em sat in the next seat and the shaggy man and omby amby in the third seat  of course toto was with the party curled up at dorothys feet and just as they were about to start billina came fluttering along the path and begged to be taken with them  dorothy readily agreed so the yellow hen flew up and perched herself upon the dashboard  she wore her pearl necklace and three bracelets upon each leg in honor of the occasion  dorothy kissed ozma goodbye and all the people standing around waved their handkerchiefs and the band in an upper balcony struck up a military march  then the wizard clucked to the sawhorse and said giddap and the wooden animal pranced away and drew behind him the big red wagon and all the passengers without any effort at all  a servant threw open a gate of the palace enclosure that they might pass out and so with music and shouts following them the journey was begun  its almost like a circus said aunt em proudly  i cant help feelin high an mighty in this kind of a turnout  indeed as they passed down the street all the people cheered them lustily and the shaggy man and the wizard and the captain general all took off their hats and bowed politely in acknowledgment  when they came to the great wall of the emerald city the gates were opened by the guardian who always tended them  over the gateway hung a dullcolored metal magnet shaped like a horseshoe placed against a shield of polished gold  that said the shaggy man impressively is the wonderful love magnet  i brought it to the emerald city myself and all who pass beneath this gateway are both loving and beloved  its a fine thing declared aunt em admiringly  if wed had it in kansas i guess the man who held a mortgage on the farm wouldnt have turned us out  then im glad we didnt have it returned uncle henry  i like oz better than kansas even an this little wood sawhorse beats all the critters i ever saw  he dont have to be curried or fed or watered an hes strong as an ox  can he talk dorothy  yes uncle replied the child  but the sawhorse never says much he told me once that he cant talk and think at the same time so he prefers to think  which is very sensible declared the wizard nodding approvingly which way do we go dorothy  straight ahead into the quadling country she answered  ive got a letter of interduction to miss cuttenclip  oh exclaimed the wizard much interested  are we going there then im glad i came for ive always wanted to meet the cuttenclips  who are they inquired aunt em  wait till we get there replied dorothy with a laugh then youll see for yourself  ive never seen the cuttenclips you know so i cant zactly splain em to you  once free of the emerald city the sawhorse dashed away at tremendous speed  indeed he went so fast that aunt em had hard work to catch her breath and uncle henry held fast to the seat of the red wagon  gentlygently my boy called the wizard and at this the sawhorse slackened his speed  whats wrong asked the animal slightly turning his wooden head to look at the party with one eye which was a knot of wood  why we wish to admire the scenery thats all answered the wizard  some of your passengers added the shaggy man have never been out of the emerald city before and the country is all new to them  if you go too fast youll spoil all the fun said dorothy  theres no hurry  very well it is all the same to me observed the sawhorse and after that he went at a more moderate pace  uncle henry was astonished  how can a wooden thing be so intelligent he asked  why i gave him some sawdust brains the last time i fitted his head with new ears explained the wizard  the sawdust was made from hard knots and now the sawhorse is able to think out any knotty problem he meets with  i see said uncle henry  i dont remarked aunt em but no one paid any attention to this statement  before long they came to a stately building that stood upon a green plain with handsome shade trees grouped here and there  what is that asked uncle henry  that replied the wizard is the royal athletic college of oz which is directed by professor h m wogglebug te  lets stop and make a call suggested dorothy  so the sawhorse drew up in front of the great building and they were met at the door by the learned wogglebug himself  he seemed fully as tall as the wizard and was dressed in a red and white checked vest and a blue swallowtailed coat and had yellow knee breeches and purple silk stockings upon his slender legs  a tall hat was jauntily set upon his head and he wore spectacles over his big bright eyes  welcome dorothy said the wogglebug and welcome to all your friends  we are indeed pleased to receive you at this great temple of learning  i thought it was an athletic college said the shaggy man  it is my dear sir answered the wogglebug proudly  here it is that we teach the youth of our great land scientific college athleticsin all their purity  dont you teach them anything else asked dorothy  dont they get any reading writing and rithmetic  oh yes of course  they get all those and more returned the professor  but such things occupy little of their time  please follow me and i will show you how my scholars are usually occupied this is a class hour and they are all busy  they followed him to a big field back of the college building where several hundred young ozites were at their classes  in one place they played football in another baseball  some played tennis some golf some were swimming in a big pool  upon a river which wound through the grounds several crews in racing boats were rowing with great enthusiasm  other groups of students played basketball and cricket while in one place a ring was roped in to permit boxing and wrestling by the energetic youths  all the collegians seemed busy and there was much laughter and shouting  this college said professor wogglebug complacently is a great success  its educational value is undisputed and we are turning out many great and valuable citizens every year  but when do they study asked dorothy  study said the wogglebug looking perplexed at the question  yes when do they get their rithmetic and jogerfy and such things  oh they take doses of those every night and morning was the reply  what do you mean by doses dorothy inquired wonderingly  why we use the newly invented school pills made by your friend the wizard  these pills we have found to be very effective and they save a lot of time  please step this way and i will show you our laboratory of learning  he led them to a room in the building where many large bottles were standing in rows upon shelves  these are the algebra pills said the professor taking down one of the bottles  one at night on retiring is equal to four hours of study  here are the geography pillsone at night and one in the morning  in this next bottle are the latin pillsone three times a day  then we have the grammar pillsone before each mealand the spelling pills which are taken whenever needed  your scholars must have to take a lot of pills remarked dorothy thoughtfully  how do they take em in applesauce  no my dear  they are sugarcoated and are quickly and easily swallowed  i believe the students would rather take the pills than study and certainly the pills are a more effective method  you see until these school pills were invented we wasted a lot of time in study that may now be better employed in practicing athletics  seems to me the pills are a good thing said omby amby who remembered how it used to make his head ache as a boy to study arithmetic  they are sir declared the wogglebug earnestly  they give us an advantage over all other colleges because at no loss of time our boys become thoroughly conversant with greek and latin mathematics and geography grammar and literature  you see they are never obliged to interrupt their games to acquire the lesser branches of learning  its a great invention im sure said dorothy looking admiringly at the wizard who blushed modestly at this praise  we live in an age of progress announced professor wogglebug pompously  it is easier to swallow knowledge than to acquire it laboriously from books  is it not so my friends  some folks can swallow anything said aunt em but to me this seems too much like taking medicine  young men in college always have to take their medicine one way or another observed the wizard with a smile and as our professor says these school pills have proved to be a great success  one day while i was making them i happened to drop one of them and one of billinas chickens gobbled it up  a few minutes afterward this chick got upon a roost and recited the boy stood on the burning deck without making a single mistake  then it recited the charge of the light brigade and afterwards excelsior  you see the chicken had eaten an elocution pill  they now bade goodbye to the professor and thanking him for his kind reception mounted again into the red wagon and continued their journey    10  how the cuttenclips lived  the travelers had taken no provisions with them because they knew that they would be welcomed wherever they might go in the land of oz and that the people would feed and lodge them with genuine hospitality  so about noon they stopped at a farmhouse and were given a delicious luncheon of bread and milk fruits and wheat cakes with maple syrup after resting a while and strolling through the orchards with their hosta round jolly farmerthey got into the wagon and again started the sawhorse along the pretty winding road  there were signposts at all the corners and finally they came to one which read   take this road to the cuttenclips   there was also a hand pointing in the right direction so they turned the sawhorse that way and found it a very good road but seemingly little traveled  ive never seen the cuttenclips before remarked dorothy  nor i said the captain general  nor i said the wizard  nor i said billina  ive hardly been out of the emerald city since i arrived in this country added the shaggy man  why none of us has been there then exclaimed the little girl  i wonder what the cuttenclips are like  we shall soon find out said the wizard with a sly laugh  ive heard they are rather flimsy things  the farmhouses became fewer as they proceeded and the path was at times so faint that the sawhorse had hard work to keep in the road the wagon began to jounce too so they were obliged to go slowly  after a somewhat wearisome journey they came in sight of a high wall painted blue with pink ornaments  this wall was circular and seemed to enclose a large space  it was so high that only the tops of the trees could be seen above it  the path led up to a small door in the wall which was closed and latched  upon the door was a sign in gold letters reading as follows   visitors are requested to move slowly and carefully and to avoid coughing or making any breeze or draught   thats strange said the shaggy man reading the sign aloud  who are the cuttenclips anyhow  why theyre paper dolls answered dorothy  didnt you know that  paper dolls  then lets go somewhere else said uncle henry  were all too old to play with dolls dorothy  but these are different declared the girl  theyre alive  alive gasped aunt em in amazement  yes  lets go in said dorothy  so they all got out of the wagon since the door in the wall was not big enough for them to drive the sawhorse and wagon through it  you stay here toto commanded dorothy shaking her finger at the little dog  youre so careless that you might make a breeze if i let you inside  toto wagged his tail as if disappointed at being left behind but he made no effort to follow them  the wizard unlatched the door which opened outward and they all looked eagerly inside  just before the entrance was drawn up a line of tiny soldiers with uniforms brightly painted and paper guns upon their shoulders  they were exactly alike from one end of the line to the other and all were cut out of paper and joined together in the centers of their bodies  as the visitors entered the enclosure the wizard let the door swing back into place and at once the line of soldiers tumbled over fell flat upon their backs and lay fluttering upon the ground  hi there called one of them what do you mean by slamming the door and blowing us over  i beg your pardon im sure said the wizard regretfully  i didnt know you were so delicate  were not delicate retorted another soldier raising his head from the ground  we are strong and healthy but we cant stand draughts  may i help you up asked dorothy  if you please replied the end soldier  but do it gently little girl  dorothy carefully stood up the line of soldiers who first dusted their painted clothes and then saluted the visitors with their paper muskets from the end it was easy to see that the entire line had been cut out of paper although from the front the soldiers looked rather solid and imposing  ive a letter of introduction from princess ozma to miss cuttenclip announced dorothy  very well said the end soldier and blew upon a paper whistle that hung around his neck  at once a paper soldier in a captains uniform came out of a paper house near by and approached the group at the entrance  he was not very big and he walked rather stiffly and uncertainly on his paper legs but he had a pleasant face with very red cheeks and very blue eyes and he bowed so low to the strangers that dorothy laughed and the breeze from her mouth nearly blew the captain over  he wavered and struggled and finally managed to remain upon his feet  take care miss he said warningly  youre breaking the rules you know by laughing  oh i didnt know that she replied  to laugh in this place is nearly as dangerous as to cough said the captain  youll have to breathe very quietly i assure you  well try to promised the girl  may we see miss cuttenclip please  you may promptly returned the captain  this is one of her reception days  be good enough to follow me  he turned and led the way up a path and as they followed slowly because the paper captain did not move very swiftly they took the opportunity to gaze around them at this strange paper country  beside the path were paper trees all cut out very neatly and painted a brilliant green color  and back of the trees were rows of cardboard houses painted in various colors but most of them having green blinds some were large and some small and in the front yards were beds of paper flowers quite natural in appearance  over some of the porches paper vines were twined giving them a cozy and shady look  as the visitors passed along the street a good many paper dolls came to the doors and windows of their houses to look at them curiously  these dolls were nearly all the same height but were cut into various shapes some being fat and some lean  the girl dolls wore many beautiful costumes of tissue paper making them quite fluffy but their heads and hands were no thicker than the paper of which they were made  some of the paper people were on the street walking along or congregated in groups and talking together but as soon as they saw the strangers they all fluttered into the houses as fast as they could go so as to be out of danger  excuse me if i go edgewise remarked the captain as they came to a slight hill  i can get along faster that way and not flutter so much  thats all right said dorothy  we dont mind how you go im sure  at one side of the street was a paper pump and a paper boy was pumping paper water into a paper pail  the yellow hen happened to brush against this boy with her wing and he flew into the air and fell into a paper tree where he stuck until the wizard gently pulled him out at the same time the pail went into the air spilling the paper water while the paper pump bent nearly double  goodness me said the hen  if i should flop my wings i believe id knock over the whole village  then dont flop themplease dont entreated the captain  miss cuttenclip would be very much distressed if her village was spoiled  oh ill be careful promised billina  are not all these paper girls and women named miss cuttenclips inquired omby amby  no indeed answered the captain who was walking better since he began to move edgewise  there is but one miss cuttenclip who is our queen because she made us all  these girls are cuttenclips to be sure but their names are emily and polly and sue and betty and such things  only the queen is called miss cuttenclip  i must say that this place beats anything i ever heard of observed aunt em  i used to play with paper dolls myself an cut em out but i never thought id ever see such things alive  i dont see as its any more curious than hearing hens talk returned uncle henry  youre likely to see many queer things in the land of oz sir said the wizard  but a fairy country is extremely interesting when you get used to being surprised  here we are called the captain stopping before a cottage  this house was made of wood and was remarkably pretty in design  in the emerald city it would have been considered a tiny dwelling indeed but in the midst of this paper village it seemed immense  real flowers were in the garden and real trees grew beside it  upon the front door was a sign reading   miss cuttenclip   just as they reached the porch the front door opened and a little girl stood before them  she appeared to be about the same age as dorothy and smiling upon her visitors she said sweetly  you are welcome  all the party seemed relieved to find that here was a real girl of flesh and blood  she was very dainty and pretty as she stood there welcoming them  her hair was a golden blonde and her eyes turquoise blue  she had rosy cheeks and lovely white teeth  over her simple white lawn dress she wore an apron with pink and white checks and in one hand she held a pair of scissors  may we see miss cuttenclip please asked dorothy  i am miss cuttenclip was the reply  wont you come in  she held the door open while they all entered a pretty sittingroom that was littered with all sorts of papersome stiff some thin and some tissue  the sheets and scraps were of all colors  upon a table were paints and brushes while several pair of scissors of different sizes were lying about  sit down please said miss cuttenclip clearing the paper scraps off some of the chairs  it is so long since i have had any visitors that i am not properly prepared to receive them  but im sure you will pardon my untidy room for this is my workshop  do you make all the paper dolls inquired dorothy  yes i cut them out with my scissors and paint the faces and some of the costumes  it is very pleasant work and i am happy making my paper village grow  but how do the paper dolls happen to be alive asked aunt em  the first dolls i made were not alive said miss cuttenclip  i used to live near the castle of a great sorceress named glinda the good and she saw my dolls and said they were very pretty  i told her i thought i would like them better if they were alive and the next day the sorceress brought me a lot of magic paper  this is live paper she said and all the dolls you cut out of it will be alive and able to think and to talk  when you have used it all up come to me and i will give you more  of course i was delighted with this present continued miss cuttenclip and at once set to work and made several paper dolls which as soon as they were cut out began to walk around and talk to me  but they were so thin that i found that any breeze would blow them over and scatter them dreadfully so glinda found this lonely place for me where few people ever come  she built the wall to keep any wind from blowing away my people and told me i could build a paper village here and be its queen  that is why i came here and settled down to work and started the village you now see  it was many years ago that i built the first houses and ive kept pretty busy and made my village grow finely and i need not tell you that i am very happy in my work  many years ago exclaimed aunt em  why how old are you child  i never keep track of the years said miss cuttenclip laughing you see i dont grow up at all but stay just the same as i was when first i came here  perhaps im older even than you are madam but i couldnt say for sure  they looked at the lovely little girl wonderingly and the wizard asked  what happens to your paper village when it rains  it does not rain here replied miss cuttenclip  glinda keeps all the rain storms away so i never worry about my dolls getting wet  but now if you will come with me it will give me pleasure to show you over my paper kingdom  of course you must go slowly and carefully and avoid making any breeze  they left the cottage and followed their guide through the various streets of the village  it was indeed an amazing place when one considered that it was all made with scissors and the visitors were not only greatly interested but full of admiration for the skill of little miss cuttenclip  in one place a large group of especially nice paper dolls assembled to greet their queen whom it was easy to see they loved early  these dolls marched and danced before the visitors and then they all waved their paper handkerchiefs and sang in a sweet chorus a song called the flag of our native land  at the conclusion of the song they ran up a handsome paper flag on a tall flagpole and all of the people of the village gathered around to cheer as loudly as they couldalthough of course their voices were not especially strong  miss cuttenclip was about to make her subjects a speech in reply to this patriotic song when the shaggy man happened to sneeze  he was a very loud and powerful sneezer at any time and he had tried so hard to hold in this sneeze that when it suddenly exploded the result was terrible  the paper dolls were mowed down by dozens and flew and fluttered in wild confusion in every direction tumbling this way and that and getting more or less wrinkled and bent  a wail of terror and grief came from the scattered throng and miss cuttenclip exclaimed  dear me dear me and hurried at once to the rescue of her overturned people  oh shaggy man  how could you asked dorothy reproachfully  i couldnt help itreally i couldnt protested the shaggy man looking quite ashamed  and i had no idea it took so little to upset these paper dolls  so little said dorothy  why it was most as bad as a kansas cyclone  and then she helped miss cuttenclip rescue the paper folk and stand them on their feet again  two of the cardboard houses had also tumbled over and the little queen said she would have to repair them and paste them together before they could be lived in again  and now fearing they might do more damage to the flimsy paper people they decided to go away  but first they thanked miss cuttenclip very warmly for her courtesy and kindness to them  any friend of princess ozma is always welcome hereunless he sneezes said the queen with a rather severe look at the shaggy man who hung his head  i like to have visitors admire my wonderful village and i hope you will call again  miss cuttenclip herself led them to the door in the wall and as they passed along the street the paper dolls peeped at them half fearfully from the doors and windows  perhaps they will never forget the shaggy mans awful sneeze and i am sure they were all glad to see the meat people go away    11  how the general met the first and foremost  on leaving the growleywogs general guph had to recross the ripple lands and he did not find it a pleasant thing to do  perhaps having his whiskers pulled out one by one and being used as a pincushion for the innocent amusement of a good natured jailer had not improved the quality of guphs temper for the old nome raved and raged at the recollection of the wrongs he had suffered and vowed to take vengeance upon the growleywogs after he had used them for his purposes and oz had been conquered  he went on in this furious way until he was half across the ripple land  then he became seasick and the rest of the way this naughty nome was almost as miserable as he deserved to be  but when he reached the plains again and the ground was firm under his feet he began to feel better and instead of going back home he turned directly west  a squirrel perched in a tree saw him take this road and called to him warningly look out  but he paid no attention  an eagle paused in its flight through the air to look at him wonderingly and say look out  but on he went  no one can say that guph was not brave for he had determined to visit those dangerous creatures the phanfasms who resided upon the very top of the dread mountain of phantastico  the phanfasms were erbs and so dreaded by mortals and immortals alike that no one had been near their mountain home for several thousand years  yet general guph hoped to induce them to join in his proposed warfare against the good and happy oz people  guph knew very well that the phanfasms would be almost as dangerous to the nomes as they would to the ozites but he thought himself so clever that he believed he could manage these strange creatures and make them obey him  and there was no doubt at all that if he could enlist the services of the phanfasms their tremendous power united to the strength of the growleywogs and the cunning of the whimsies would doom the land of oz to absolute destruction  so the old nome climbed the foothills and trudged along the wild mountain paths until he came to a big gully that encircled the mountain of phantastico and marked the boundary line of the dominion of the phanfasms  this gully was about a third of the way up the mountain and it was filled to the brim with redhot molten lava in which swam fireserpents and poisonous salamanders  the heat from this mass and its poisonous smell were both so unbearable that even birds hesitated to fly over the gully but circled around it  all living things kept away from the mountain  now guph had heard during his long lifetime many tales of these dreaded phanfasms so he had heard of this barrier of melted lava and also he had been told that there was a narrow bridge that spanned it in one place  so he walked along the edge until he found the bridge  it was a single arch of gray stone and lying flat upon the bridge was a scarlet alligator seemingly fast asleep  when guph stumbled over the rocks in approaching the bridge the creature opened its eyes from which tiny flames shot in all directions and after looking at the intruder very wickedly the scarlet alligator closed its eyelids again and lay still  guph saw there was no room for him to pass the alligator on the narrow bridge so he called out to it  good morning friend  i dont wish to hurry you but please tell me if you are coming down or going up  neither snapped the alligator clicking its cruel jaws together  the general hesitated  are you likely to stay there long he asked  a few hundred years or so said the alligator  guph softly rubbed the end of his nose and tried to think what to do  do you know whether the first and foremost phanfasm of phantastico is at home or not he presently inquired  i expect he is seeing he is always at home replied the alligator  ah who is that coming down the mountain asked the nome gazing upward  the alligator turned to look over its shoulder and at once guph ran to the bridge and leaped over the sentinels back before it could turn back again  the scarlet monster made a snap at the nomes left foot but missed it by fully an inch  ah ha laughed the general who was now on the mountain path  i fooled you that time  so you did and perhaps you fooled yourself retorted the alligator go up the mountain if you dare and find out what the first and foremost will do to you  i will declared guph boldly and on he went up the path  at first the scene was wild enough but gradually it grew more and more awful in appearance  all the rocks had the shapes of frightful beings and even the tree trunks were gnarled and twisted like serpents  suddenly there appeared before the nome a man with the head of an owl his body was hairy like that of an ape and his only clothing was a scarlet scarf twisted around his waist  he bore a huge club in his hand and his round owl eyes blinked fiercely upon the intruder  what are you doing here he demanded threatening guph with his club  ive come to see the first and foremost phanfasm of phantastico replied the general who did not like the way this creature looked at him but still was not afraid  ah you shall see him the man said with a sneering laugh  the first and foremost shall decide upon the best way to punish you  he will not punish me returned guph calmly for i have come here to do him and his people a rare favor  lead on fellow and take me directly to your master  the owlman raised his club with a threatening gesture  if you try to escape he said beware  but here the general interrupted him  spare your threats said he and do not be impertinent or i will have you severely punished  lead on and keep silent  this guph was really a clever rascal and it seems a pity he was so bad for in a good cause he might have accomplished much  he realized that he had put himself into a dangerous position by coming to this dreadful mountain but he also knew that if he showed fear he was lost so he adopted a bold manner as his best defense  the wisdom of this plan was soon evident for the phanfasm with the owls head turned and led the way up the mountain  at the very top was a level plain upon which were heaps of rock that at first glance seemed solid  but on looking closer guph discovered that these rock heaps were dwellings for each had an opening  not a person was to be seen outside the rock huts  all was silent  the owlman led the way among the groups of dwellings to one standing in the center  it seemed no better and no worse than any of the others  outside the entrance to this rock heap the guide gave a low wail that sounded like leeowah  suddenly there bounded from the opening another hairy man  this one wore the head of a bear  in his hand he bore a brass hoop  he glared at the stranger in evident surprise  why have you captured this foolish wanderer and brought him here he demanded addressing the owlman  i did not capture him was the answer  he passed the scarlet alligator and came here of his own free will and accord  the first and foremost looked at the general  have you tired of life then he asked  no indeed answered guph  i am a nome and the chief general of king roquat the reds great army of nomes  i come of a longlived race and i may say that i expect to live a long time yet  sit down you phanfasmsif you can find a seat in this wild hauntand listen to what i have to say  with all his knowledge and bravery general guph did not know that the steady glare from the bear eyes was reading his inmost thoughts as surely as if they had been put into words  he did not know that these despised rock heaps of the phanfasms were merely deceptions to his own eyes nor could he guess that he was standing in the midst of one of the most splendid and luxurious cities ever built by magic power  all that he saw was a barren waste of rock heaps a hairy man with an owls head and another with a bears head  the sorcery of the phanfasms permitted him to see no more  suddenly the first and foremost swung his brass hoop and caught guph around the neck with it  the next instant before the general could think what had happened to him he was dragged inside the rock hut here his eyes still blinded to realities he perceived only a dim light by which the hut seemed as rough and rude inside as it was outside  yet he had a strange feeling that many bright eyes were fastened upon him and that he stood in a vast and extensive hall  the first and foremost now laughed grimly and released his prisoner  if you have anything to say that is interesting he remarked speak out before i strangle you  so guph spoke out  he tried not to pay any attention to a strange rustling sound that he heard as of an unseen multitude drawing near to listen to his words  his eyes could see only the fierce bearman and to him he addressed his speech  first he told of his plan to conquer the land of oz and plunder the country of its riches and enslave its people who being fairies could not be killed  after relating all this and telling of the tunnel the nome king was building he said he had come to ask the first and foremost to join the nomes with his band of terrible warriors and help them to defeat the oz people  the general spoke very earnestly and impressively but when he had finished the bearman began to laugh as if much amused and his laughter seemed to be echoed by a chorus of merriment from an unseen multitude  then for the first time guph began to feel a trifle worried  who else has promised to help you finally asked the first and foremost  the whimsies replied the general  again the bearheaded phanfasm laughed  any others he inquired  only the growleywogs said guph  this answer set the first and foremost laughing anew  what share of the spoils am i to have was the next question  anything you like except king roquats magic belt replied guph  at this the phanfasm set up a roar of laughter which had its echo in the unseen chorus and the bearman seemed so amused that he actually rolled upon the ground and shouted with merriment  oh these blind and foolish nomes he said  how big they seem to themselves and how small they really are  suddenly he arose and seized guphs neck with one hairy paw dragging him out of the hut into the open  here he gave a curious wailing cry and as if in answer from all the rocky huts on the mountaintop came flocking a horde of phanfasms all with hairy bodies but wearing heads of various animals birds and reptiles  all were ferocious and repulsivelooking to the deceived eyes of the nome and guph could not repress a shudder of disgust as he looked upon them  the first and foremost slowly raised his arms and in a twinkling his hairy skin fell from him and he appeared before the astonished nome as a beautiful woman clothed in a flowing gown of pink gauze  in her dark hair flowers were entwined and her face was noble and calm  at the same instant the entire band of phanfasms was transformed into a pack of howling wolves running here and there as they snarled and showed their ugly yellow fangs  the woman now raised her arms even as the manbear had done and in a twinkling the wolves became crawling lizards while she herself changed into a huge butterfly  guph had only time to cry out in fear and take a step backward to avoid the lizards when another transformation occurred and all returned instantly to the forms they had originally worn  then the first and foremost who had resumed his hairy body and bear head turned to the nome and asked  do you still demand our assistance  more than ever answered the general firmly  then tell me what can you offer the phanfasms that they have not already inquired the first and foremost  guph hesitated  he really did not know what to say  the nome kings vaunted magic belt seemed a poor thing compared to the astonishing magical powers of these people  gold jewels and slaves they might secure in any quantity without especial effort  he felt that he was dealing with powers greatly beyond him  there was but one argument that might influence the phanfasms who were creatures of evil  permit me to call your attention to the exquisite joy of making the happy unhappy said he at last  consider the pleasure of destroying innocent and harmless people  ah you have answered me cried the first and foremost  for that reason alone we will aid you  go home and tell your bandylegged king that as soon as his tunnel is finished the phanfasms will be with him and lead his legions to the conquest of oz  the deadly desert alone has kept us from destroying oz long ago and your underground tunnel is a clever thought  go home and prepare for our coming  guph was very glad to be permitted to go with this promise  the owlman led him back down the mountain path and ordered the scarlet alligator to crawl away and allow the nome to cross the bridge in safety  after the visitor had gone a brilliant and gorgeous city appeared upon the mountain top clearly visible to the eyes of the gaily dressed multitude of phanfasms that lived there  and the first and foremost beautifully arrayed addressed the others in these words  it is time we went into the world and brought sorrow and dismay to its people  too long have we remained for ourselves upon this mountain top for while we are thus secluded many nations have grown happy and prosperous and the chief joy of the race of phanfasms is to destroy happiness  so i think it is lucky that this messenger from the nomes arrived among us just now to remind us that the opportunity has come for us to make trouble  we will use king roquats tunnel to conquer the land of oz  then we will destroy the whimsies the growleywogs and the nomes and afterward go out to ravage and annoy and grieve the whole world  the multitude of evil phanfasms eagerly applauded this plan which they fully approved  i am told that the erbs are the most powerful and merciless of all the evil spirits and the phanfasms of phantastico belong to the race of erbs    12  how they matched the fuddles  dorothy and her fellow travelers rode away from the cuttenclip village and followed the indistinct path as far as the signpost  here they took the main road again and proceeded pleasantly through the pretty farming country  when evening came they stopped at a dwelling and were joyfully welcomed and given plenty to eat and good beds for the night  early next morning however they were up and eager to start and after a good breakfast they bade their host goodbye and climbed into the red wagon to which the sawhorse had been hitched all night  being made of wood this horse never got tired nor cared to lie down  dorothy was not quite sure whether he ever slept or not but it was certain that he never did when anybody was around  the weather is always beautiful in oz and this morning the air was cool and refreshing and the sunshine brilliant and delightful  in about an hour they came to a place where another road branched off there was a signpost here which read   this way to fuddlecumjig   oh here is where we turn said dorothy observing the sign  what  are we going to fuddlecumjig asked the captain general  yes ozma thought we might enjoy the fuddles  they are said to be very interesting she replied  no one would suspect it from their name said aunt em  who are they anyhow  more paper things  i think not answered dorothy laughing but i cant say zactly aunt em what they are  well find out when we get there  perhaps the wizard knows suggested uncle henry  no ive never been there before said the wizard  but ive often heard of fuddlecumjig and the fuddles who are said to be the most peculiar people in all the land of oz  in what way asked the shaggy man  i dont know im sure said the wizard  just then as they rode along the pretty green lane toward fuddlecumjig they espied a kangaroo sitting by the roadside  the poor animal had its face covered with both its front paws and was crying so bitterly that the tears coursed down its cheeks in two tiny streams and trickled across the road where they formed a pool in a small hollow  the sawhorse stopped short at this pitiful sight and dorothy cried out with ready sympathy  whats the matter kangaroo  boohoo  boohoo wailed the kangaroo ive lost my mimimioh boohoo  boohoo  poor thing said the wizard shes lost her mister  its probably her husband and hes dead  no no no sobbed the kangaroo  itit isnt that  ive lost my mimioh boo boohoo  i know said the shaggy man shes lost her mirror  no its my mimimiboohoo  my mioh boohoo and the kangaroo cried harder than ever  it must be her mincepie suggested aunt em  or her milktoast proposed uncle henry  ive lost my mimimittens said the kangaroo getting it out at last  oh cried the yellow hen with a cackle of relief  why didnt you say so before  boohoo  iicouldnt answered the kangaroo  but see here said dorothy you dont need mittens in this warm weather  yes indeed i do replied the animal stopping her sobs and removing her paws from her face to look at the little girl reproachfully  my hands will get all sunburned and tanned without my mittens and ive worn them so long that ill probably catch cold without them  nonsense said dorothy  i never heard of any kangaroo wearing mittens  didnt you asked the animal as if surprised  never repeated the girl  and youll probably make yourself sick if you dont stop crying  where do you live  about two miles beyond fuddlecumjig was the answer  grandmother gnit made me the mittens and shes one of the fuddles  well youd better go home now and perhaps the old lady will make you another pair suggested dorothy  were on our way to fuddlecumjig and you may hop along beside us  so they rode on and the kangaroo hopped beside the red wagon and seemed quickly to have forgotten her loss  by and by the wizard said to the animal  are the fuddles nice people  oh very nice answered the kangaroo that is when theyre properly put together  but they get dreadfully scattered and mixed up at times and then you cant do anything with them  what do you mean by their getting scattered inquired dorothy  why theyre made in a good many small pieces explained the kangaroo and whenever any stranger comes near them they have a habit of falling apart and scattering themselves around  thats when they get so dreadfully mixed and its a hard puzzle to put them together again  who usually puts them together asked omby amby  any one who is able to match the pieces  i sometimes put grandmother gnit together myself because i know her so well i can tell every piece that belongs to her  then when shes all matched she knits for me and thats how she made my mittens  but it took a good many days hard knitting and i had to put grandmother together a good many times because every time i came near shed scatter herself  i should think she would get used to your coming and not be afraid said dorothy  it isnt that replied the kangaroo  theyre not a bit afraid when theyre put together and usually theyre very jolly and pleasant its just a habit they have to scatter themselves and if they didnt do it they wouldnt be fuddles  the travelers thought upon this quite seriously for a time while the sawhorse continued to carry them rapidly forward  then aunt em remarked  i dont see much use our visitin these fuddles  if we find them scattered all we can do is to sweep em up and then go about our business  oh i blieve wed better go on replied dorothy  im getting hungry and we must try to get some luncheon at fuddlecumjig  perhaps the food wont be scattered as badly as the people  youll find plenty to eat there declared the kangaroo hopping along in big bounds because the sawhorse was going so fast and they have a fine cook too if you can manage to put him together  theres the town nowjust ahead of us  they looked ahead and saw a group of very pretty houses standing in a green field a little apart from the main road  some munchkins came here a few days ago and matched a lot of people together said the kangaroo  i think they are together yet and if you go softly without making any noise perhaps they wont scatter  lets try it suggested the wizard  so they stopped the sawhorse and got out of the wagon and after bidding good bye to the kangaroo who hopped away home they entered the field and very cautiously approached the group of houses  so silently did they move that soon they saw through the windows of the houses people moving around while others were passing to and fro in the yards between the buildings  they seemed much like other people from a distance and apparently they did not notice the little party so quietly approaching  they had almost reached the nearest house when toto saw a large beetle crossing the path and barked loudly at it  instantly a wild clatter was heard from the houses and yards  dorothy thought it sounded like a sudden hailstorm and the visitors knowing that caution was no longer necessary hurried forward to see what had happened  after the clatter an intense stillness reigned in the town  the strangers entered the first house they came to which was also the largest and found the floor strewn with pieces of the people who lived there  they looked much like fragments of wood neatly painted and were of all sorts of curious and fantastic shapes no two pieces being in any way alike  they picked up some of these pieces and looked at them carefully  on one which dorothy held was an eye which looked at her pleasantly but with an interested expression as if it wondered what she was going to do with it  quite near by she discovered and picked up a nose and by matching the two pieces together found that they were part of a face  if i could find the mouth she said this fuddle might be able to talk and tell us what to do next  then let us find it replied the wizard and so all got down on their hands and knees and began examining the scattered pieces  ive found it cried the shaggy man and ran to dorothy with a queershaped piece that had a mouth on it  but when they tried to fit it to the eye and nose they found the parts wouldnt match together  that mouth belongs to some other person said dorothy  you see we need a curve here and a point there to make it fit the face  well it must be here some place declared the wizard so if we search long enough we shall find it  dorothy fitted an ear on next and the ear had a little patch of red hair above it  so while the others were searching for the mouth she hunted for pieces with red hair and found several of them which when matched to the other pieces formed the top of a mans head  she had also found the other eye and the ear by the time omby amby in a far corner discovered the mouth  when the face was thus completed all the parts joined together with a nicety that was astonishing  why its like a picture puzzle exclaimed the little girl  lets find the rest of him and get him all together  whats the rest of him like asked the wizard  here are some pieces of blue legs and green arms but i dont know whether they are his or not  look for a white shirt and a white apron said the head which had been put together speaking in a rather faint voice  im the cook  oh thank you said dorothy  its lucky we started you first for im hungry and you can be cooking something for us to eat while we match the other folks together  it was not so very difficult now that they had a hint as to how the man was dressed to find the other pieces belonging to him and as all of them now worked on the cook trying piece after piece to see if it would fit they finally had the cook set up complete  when he was finished he made them a low bow and said  i will go at once to the kitchen to prepare your dinner  you will find it something of a job to get all the fuddles together so i advise you to begin on the lord high chigglewitz whose first name is larry hes a baldheaded fat man and is dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons a pink vest and drab breeches  a piece of his left knee is missing having been lost years ago when he scattered himself too carelessly  that makes him limp a little but he gets along very well with half a knee  as he is the chief personage in this town of fuddlecumjig he will be able to welcome you and assist you with the others  so it will be best to work on him while im getting your dinner  we will said the wizard and thank you very much cook for the suggestion  aunt em was the first to discover a piece of the lord high chigglewitz  it seems to me like a fool business this matching folks together she remarked but as we havent anything to do till dinners ready we may as well get rid of some of this rubbish  here henry get busy and look for larrys bald head  ive got his pink vest all right  they worked with eager interest and billina proved a great help to them  the yellow hen had sharp eyes and could put her head close to the various pieces that lay scattered around  she would examine the lord high chigglewitz and see which piece of him was next needed and then hunt around until she found it  so before an hour had passed old larry was standing complete before them  i congratulate you my friends he said speaking in a cheerful voice  you are certainly the cleverest people who ever visited us  i was never matched together so quickly in my life  im considered a great puzzle usually  well said dorothy there used to be a picture puzzle craze in kansas and so ive had some sperience matching puzzles  but the pictures were flat while you are round and that makes you harder to figure out  thank you my dear replied old larry greatly pleased  i feel highly complimented  were i not a really good puzzle there would be no object in my scattering myself  why do you do it asked aunt em severely  why dont you behave yourself and stay put together  the lord high chigglewitz seemed annoyed by this speech but he replied politely  madam you have perhaps noticed that every person has some peculiarity  mine is to scatter myself  what your own peculiarity is i will not venture to say but i shall never find fault with you whatever you do  now youve got your diploma em said uncle henry with a laugh and im glad of it  this is a queer country and we may as well take people as we find them  if we did wed leave these folks scattered she returned and this retort made everybody laugh goodnaturedly  just then omby amby found a hand with a knitting needle in it and they decided to put grandmother gnit together  she proved an easier puzzle than old larry and when she was completed they found her a pleasant old lady who welcomed them cordially  dorothy told her how the kangaroo had lost her mittens and grandmother gnit promised to set to work at once and make the poor animal another pair  then the cook came to call them to dinner and they found an inviting meal prepared for them  the lord high chigglewitz sat at the head of the table and grandmother gnit at the foot and the guests had a merry time and thoroughly enjoyed themselves  after dinner they went out into the yard and matched several other people together and this work was so interesting that they might have spent the entire day at fuddlecumjig had not the wizard suggested that they resume their journey  but i dont like to leave all these poor people scattered said dorothy undecided what to do  oh dont mind us my dear returned old larry  every day or so some of the gillikins or munchkins or winkies come here to amuse themselves by matching us together so there will be no harm in leaving these pieces where they are for a time  but i hope you will visit us again and if you do you will always be welcome i assure you  dont you ever match each other she inquired  never for we are no puzzles to ourselves and so there wouldnt be any fun in it  they now said goodbye to the queer fuddles and got into their wagon to continue their journey  those are certainly strange people remarked aunt em thoughtfully as they drove away from fuddlecumjig but i really cant see what use they are at all  why they amused us all for several hours replied the wizard  that is being of use to us im sure  i think theyre more fun than playing solitaire or mumbletypeg declared uncle henry soberly  for my part im glad we visited the fuddles    13  how the general talked to the king  when general guph returned to the cavern of the nome king his majesty asked  well what luck  will the whimsies join us  they will answered the general  they will fight for us with all their strength and cunning  good exclaimed the king  what reward did you promise them  your majesty is to use the magic belt to give each whimsie a large fine head in place of the small one he is now obliged to wear  i agree to that said the king  this is good news guph and it makes me feel more certain of the conquest of oz  but i have other news for you announced the general  good or bad  good your majesty  then i will hear it said the king with interest  the growleywogs will join us  no cried the astonished king  yes indeed said the general  i have their promise  but what reward do they demand inquired the king suspiciously for he knew how greedy the growleywogs were  they are to take a few of the oz people for their slaves replied guph  he did not think it necessary to tell roquat that the growleywogs demanded twenty thousand slaves  it would be time enough for that when oz was conquered  a very reasonable request im sure remarked the king  i must congratulate you guph upon the wonderful success of your journey  but that is not all said the general proudly  the king seemed astonished  speak out sir he commanded  i have seen the first and foremost phanfasm of the mountain of phantastico and he will bring his people to assist us  what cried the king  the phanfasms  you dont mean it guph  it is true declared the general proudly  the king became thoughtful and his brows wrinkled  im afraid guph he said rather anxiously that the first and foremost may prove as dangerous to us as to the oz people  if he and his terrible band come down from the mountain they may take the notion to conquer the nomes  pah  that is a foolish idea retorted guph irritably but he knew in his heart that the king was right  the first and foremost is a particular friend of mine and will do us no harm  why when i was there he even invited me into his house  the general neglected to tell the king how he had been jerked into the hut of the first and foremost by means of the brass hoop  so roquat the red looked at his general admiringly and said  you are a wonderful nome guph  im sorry i did not make you my general before  but what reward did the first and foremost demand  nothing at all answered guph  even the magic belt itself could not add to his powers of sorcery  all the phanfasms wish is to destroy the oz people who are good and happy  this pleasure will amply repay them for assisting us  when will they come asked roquat half fearfully  when the tunnel is completed said the general  we are nearly halfway under the desert now announced the king and that is fast work because the tunnel has to be drilled through solid rock  but after we have passed the desert it will not take us long to extend the tunnel to the walls of the emerald city  well whenever you are ready we shall be joined by the whimsies the growleywogs and the phanfasms said guph so the conquest of oz is assured without a doubt  again the king seemed thoughtful  im almost sorry we did not undertake the conquest alone said he all of these allies are dangerous people and they may demand more than you have promised them  it might have been better to have conquered oz without any outside assistance  we could not do it said the general positively  why not guph  you know very well  you have had one experience with the oz people and they defeated you  that was because they rolled eggs at us replied the king with a shudder  my nomes cannot stand eggs any more than i can myself they are poison to all who live underground  that is true enough agreed guph  but we might have taken the oz people by surprise and conquered them before they had a chance to get any eggs  our former defeat was due to the fact that the girl dorothy had a yellow hen with her  i do not know what ever became of that hen but i believe there are no hens at all in the land of oz and so there could be no eggs there  on the contrary said guph there are now hundreds of chickens in oz and they lay heaps of those dangerous eggs  i met a goshawk on my way home and the bird informed me that he had lately been to oz to capture and devour some of the young chickens  but they are protected by magic so the hawk did not get a single one of them  that is a very bad report said the king nervously  very bad indeed  my nomes are willing to fight but they simply cant face hens eggsand i dont blame them  they wont need to face them replied guph  im afraid of eggs myself and dont propose to take any chances of being poisoned by them  my plan is to send the whimsies through the tunnel first and then the growleywogs and the phanfasms  by the time we nomes get there the eggs will all be used up and we may then pursue and capture the inhabitants at our leisure  perhaps you are right returned the king with a dismal sigh  but i want it distinctly understood that i claim ozma and dorothy as my own prisoners  they are rather nice girls and i do not intend to let any of those dreadful creatures hurt them or make them their slaves  when i have captured them i will bring them here and transform them into china ornaments to stand on my mantle  they will look very prettydorothy on one end of the mantle and ozma on the otherand i shall take great care to see they are not broken when the maids dust them  very well your majesty  do what you will with the girls for all i care  now that our plans are arranged and we have the three most powerful bands of evil spirits in the world to assist us let us make haste to get the tunnel finished as soon as possible  it will be ready in three days promised the king and hurried away to inspect the work and see that the nomes kept busy    14  how the wizard practiced sorcery  where next asked the wizard when they had left the town of fuddlecumjig and the sawhorse had started back along the road  why ozma laid out this trip replied dorothy and she vised us to see the rigmaroles next and then visit the tin woodman  that sounds good said the wizard  but what road do we take to get to the rigmaroles  i dont know zactly returned the little girl but it must be somewhere just southwest from here  then why need we go way back to the crossroads asked the shaggy man we might save a lot of time by branching off here  there isnt any path asserted uncle henry  then wed better go back to the signposts and make sure of our way decided dorothy  but after they had gone a short distance farther the sawhorse who had overheard their conversation stopped and said  here is a path  sure enough a dim path seemed to branch off from the road they were on and it led across pretty green meadows and past leafy groves straight toward the southwest  that looks like a good path said omby amby  why not try it  all right answered dorothy  im anxious to see what the rigmaroles are like and this path ought to take us there the quickest way  no one made any objection to this plan so the sawhorse turned into the path which proved to be nearly as good as the one they had taken to get to the fuddles  as first they passed a few retired farm houses but soon these scattered dwellings were left behind and only the meadows and the trees were before them  but they rode along in cheerful contentment and aunt em got into an argument with billina about the proper way to raise chickens  i do not care to contradict you said the yellow hen with dignity but i have an idea i know more about chickens than human beings do  pshaw replied aunt em  ive raised chickens for nearly forty years billina and i know youve got to starve em to make em lay lots of eggs and stuff em if you want good broilers  broilers exclaimed billina in horror  broil my chickens  why thats what theyre for aint it asked aunt em astonished  no aunt not in oz said dorothy  people do not eat chickens here you see billina was the first hen that was ever seen in this country and i brought her here myself  everybody liked her an respected her so the oz people wouldnt any more eat her chickens than they would eat billina  well i declare gasped aunt em  how about the eggs  oh if we have more eggs than we want to hatch we allow people to eat them said billina  indeed i am very glad the oz folks like our eggs for otherwise they would spoil  this certainly is a queer country sighed aunt em  excuse me called the sawhorse the path has ended and id like to know which way to go  they looked around and sure enough there was no path to be seen  well said dorothy were going southwest and it seems just as easy to follow that direction without a path as with one  certainly answered the sawhorse  it is not hard to draw the wagon over the meadow  i only want to know where to go  theres a forest over there across the prairie said the wizard and it lies in the direction we are going  make straight for the forest sawhorse and youre bound to go right  so the wooden animal trotted on again and the meadow grass was so soft under the wheels that it made easy riding  but dorothy was a little uneasy at losing the path because now there was nothing to guide them  no houses were to be seen at all so they could not ask their way of any farmer and although the land of oz was always beautiful wherever one might go this part of the country was strange to all the party  perhaps were lost suggested aunt em after they had proceeded quite a way in silence  never mind said the shaggy man ive been lost many a timeand so has dorothyand weve always been found again  but we may get hungry remarked omby amby  that is the worst of getting lost in a place where there are no houses near  we had a good dinner at the fuddle town said uncle henry and that will keep us from starving to death for a long time  no one ever starved to death in oz declared dorothy positively but people may get pretty hungry sometimes  the wizard said nothing and he did not seem especially anxious  the sawhorse was trotting along briskly yet the forest seemed farther away than they had thought when they first saw it  so it was nearly sundown when they finally came to the trees but now they found themselves in a most beautiful spot the widespreading trees being covered with flowering vines and having soft mosses underneath them  this will be a good place to camp said the wizard as the sawhorse stopped for further instructions  camp they all echoed  certainly asserted the wizard  it will be dark before very long and we cannot travel through this forest at night  so let us make a camp here and have some supper and sleep until daylight comes again  they all looked at the little man in astonishment and aunt em said with a sniff  a pretty camp well have i must say  i suppose you intend us to sleep under the wagon  and chew grass for our supper added the shaggy man laughing  but dorothy seemed to have no doubts and was quite cheerful  its lucky we have the wonderful wizard with us she said because he can do most anything he wants to  oh yes i forgot we had a wizard said uncle henry looking at the little man curiously  i didnt chirped billina contentedly  the wizard smiled and climbed out of the wagon and all the others followed him  in order to camp said he the first thing we need is tents  will some one please lend me a handkerchief  the shaggy man offered him one and aunt em another  he took them both and laid them carefully upon the grass near to the edge of the forest then he laid his own handkerchief down too and standing a little back from them he waved his left hand toward the handkerchiefs and said    tents of canvas white as snow   let me see how fast you grow   then lo and behold the handkerchiefs became tiny tents and as the travelers looked at them the tents grew bigger and bigger until in a few minutes each one was large enough to contain the entire party  this said the wizard pointing to the first tent is for the accommodation of the ladies  dorothy you and your aunt may step inside and take off your things  every one ran to look inside the tent and they saw two pretty white beds all ready for dorothy and aunt em and a silver roost for billina  rugs were spread upon the grassy floor and some camp chairs and a table completed the furniture  well well well  this beats anything i ever saw or heard of exclaimed aunt em and she glanced at the wizard almost fearfully as if he might be dangerous because of his great powers  oh mr wizard  how did you manage to do it asked dorothy  its a trick glinda the sorceress taught me and it is much better magic than i used to practice in omaha or when i first came to oz he answered  when the good glinda found i was to live in the emerald city always she promised to help me because she said the wizard of oz ought really to be a clever wizard and not a humbug  so we have been much together and i am learning so fast that i expect to be able to accomplish some really wonderful things in time  youve done it now declared dorothy  these tents are just wonderful  but come and see the mens tent said the wizard  so they went to the second tent which had shaggy edges because it has been made from the shaggy mans handkerchief and found that completely furnished also  it contained four neat beds for uncle henry omby amby the shaggy man and the wizard  also there was a soft rug for toto to lie upon  the third tent explained the wizard is our dining room and kitchen  they visited that next and found a table and dishes in the dining tent with plenty of those things necessary to use in cooking  the wizard carried out a big kettle and set it swinging on a crossbar before the tent  while he was doing this omby amby and the shaggy man brought a supply of twigs from the forest and then they built a fire underneath the kettle  now dorothy said the wizard smiling i expect you to cook our supper  but there is nothing in the kettle she cried  are you sure inquired the wizard  i didnt see anything put in and im almost sure it was empty when you brought it out she replied  nevertheless said the little man winking slyly at uncle henry you will do well to watch our supper my dear and see that it doesnt boil over  then the men took some pails and went into the forest to search for a spring of water and while they were gone aunt em said to dorothy  i believe the wizard is fooling us  i saw the kettle myself and when he hung it over the fire there wasnt a thing in it but air  dont worry remarked billina confidently as she nestled in the grass before the fire  youll find something in the kettle when its taken offand it wont be poor innocent chickens either  your hen has very bad manners dorothy said aunt em looking somewhat disdainfully at billina  it seems too bad she ever learned how to talk  there might have been another unpleasant quarrel between aunt em and billina had not the men returned just then with their pails filled with clear sparkling water  the wizard told dorothy that she was a good cook and he believed their supper was ready  so uncle henry lifted the kettle from the fire and poured its contents into a big platter which the wizard held for him  the platter was fairly heaped with a fine stew smoking hot with many kinds of vegetables and dumplings and a rich delicious gravy  the wizard triumphantly placed the platter upon the table in the dining tent and then they all sat down in camp chairs to the feast  there were several other dishes on the table all carefully covered and when the time came to remove these covers they found bread and butter cakes cheese pickles and fruitsincluding some of the luscious strawberries of oz  no one ventured to ask a question as to how these things came there they contented themselves by eating heartily the good things provided and toto and billina had their full share you may be sure  after the meal was over aunt em whispered to dorothy  that may have been magic food my dear and for that reason perhaps it wont be very nourishing but im willing to say it tasted as good as anything i ever et  then she added in a louder voice whos going to do the dishes  no one madam answered the wizard  the dishes have done themselves  la sakes ejaculated the good lady holding up her hands in amazement  for sure enough when she looked at the dishes they had a moment before left upon the table she found them all washed and dried and piled up into neat stacks    15  how dorothy happened to get lost  it was a beautiful evening so they drew their camp chairs in a circle before one of the tents and began to tell stories to amuse themselves and pass away the time before they went to bed  pretty soon a zebra was seen coming out of the forest and he trotted straight up to them and said politely  good evening people  the zebra was a sleek little animal and had a slender head a stubby mane and a paintbrush tailvery like a donkeys  his neatly shaped white body was covered with regular bars of dark brown and his hoofs were delicate as those of a deer  good evening friend zebra said omby amby in reply to the creatures greeting  can we do anything for you  yes answered the zebra  i should like you to settle a dispute that has long been a bother to me as to whether there is more water or land in the world  who are you disputing with asked the wizard  with a softshell crab said the zebra  he lives in a pool where i go to drink every day and he is a very impertinent crab i assure you i have told him many times that the land is much greater in extent than the water but he will not be convinced  even this very evening when i told him he was an insignificant creature who lived in a small pool he asserted that the water was greater and more important than the land  so seeing your camp i decided to ask you to settle the dispute for once and all that i may not be further annoyed by this ignorant crab  when they had listened to this explanation dorothy inquired  where is the softshell crab  not far away replied the zebra  if you will agree to judge between us i will run and get him  run along then said the little girl  so the animal pranced into the forest and soon came trotting back to them  when he drew near they found a softshell crab clinging fast to the stiff hair of the zebras head where it held on by one claw  now then mr crab said the zebra here are the people i told you about and they know more than you do who lives in a pool and more than i do who lives in a forest  for they have been travelers all over the world and know every part of it  there is more of the world than oz declared the crab in a stubborn voice  that is true said dorothy but i used to live in kansas in the united states and ive been to california and to australia and so has uncle henry  for my part added the shaggy man ive been to mexico and boston and many other foreign countries  and i said the wizard have been to europe and ireland  so you see continued the zebra addressing the crab here are people of real consequence who know what they are talking about  then they know theres more water in the world than there is land asserted the crab in a shrill petulant voice  they know you are wrong to make such an absurd statement and they will probably think you are a lobster instead of a crab retorted the animal  at this taunt the crab reached out its other claw and seized the zebras ear and the creature gave a cry of pain and began prancing up and down trying to shake off the crab which clung fast  stop pinching cried the zebra  you promised not to pinch if i would carry you here  and you promised to treat me respectfully said the crab letting go the ear  well havent i demanded the zebra  no you called me a lobster said the crab  ladies and gentlemen continued the zebra please pardon my poor friend because he is ignorant and stupid and does not understand also the pinch of his claw is very annoying  so pray tell him that the world contains more land than water and when he has heard your judgment i will carry him back and dump him into his pool where i hope he will be more modest in the future  but we cannot tell him that said dorothy gravely because it would not be true  what exclaimed the zebra in astonishment do i hear you aright  the softshell crab is correct declared the wizard  there is considerably more water than there is land in the world  impossible protested the zebra  why i can run for days upon the land and find but little water  did you ever see an ocean asked dorothy  never admitted the zebra  there is no such thing as an ocean in the land of oz  well there are several oceans in the world said dorothy and people sail in ships upon these oceans for weeks and weeks and never see a bit of land at all  and the joggerfys will tell you that all the oceans put together are bigger than all the land put together  at this the crab began laughing in queer chuckles that reminded dorothy of the way billina sometimes cackled  now will you give up mr zebra it cried jeeringly now will you give up  the zebra seemed much humbled  of course i cannot read geographys he said  you could take one of the wizards school pills suggested billina and that would make you learned and wise without studying  the crab began laughing again which so provoked the zebra that he tried to shake the little creature off  this resulted in more earpinching and finally dorothy told them that if they could not behave they must go back to the forest  im sorry i asked you to decide this question said the zebra crossly  so long as neither of us could prove we were right we quite enjoyed the dispute but now i can never drink at that pool again without the softshell crab laughing at me  so i must find another drinking place  do  do you ignoramus shouted the crab as loudly as his little voice would carry  rile some other pool with your clumsy hoofs and let your betters alone after this  then the zebra trotted back to the forest bearing the crab with him and disappeared amid the gloom of the trees  and as it was now getting dark the travelers said good night to one another and went to bed  dorothy awoke just as the light was beginning to get strong next morning and not caring to sleep any later she quietly got out of bed dressed herself and left the tent where aunt em was yet peacefully slumbering  outside she noticed billina busily pecking around to secure bugs or other food for breakfast but none of the men in the other tent seemed awake  so the little girl decided to take a walk in the woods and try to discover some path or road that they might follow when they again started upon their journey  she had reached the edge of the forest when the yellow hen came fluttering along and asked where she was going  just to take a walk billina and maybe ill find some path said dorothy  then ill go along decided billina and scarcely had she spoken when toto ran up and joined them  toto and the yellow hen had become quite friendly by this time although at first they did not get along well together  billina had been rather suspicious of dogs and toto had had an idea that it was every dogs duty to chase a hen on sight  but dorothy had talked to them and scolded them for not being agreeable to one another until they grew better acquainted and became friends  i wont say they loved each other dearly but at least they had stopped quarreling and now managed to get on together very well  the day was growing lighter every minute and driving the black shadows out of the forest so dorothy found it very pleasant walking under the trees  she went some distance in one direction but not finding a path presently turned in a different direction  there was no path here either although she advanced quite a way into the forest winding here and there among the trees and peering through the bushes in an endeavor to find some beaten track  i think wed better go back suggested the yellow hen after a time the people will all be up by this time and breakfast will be ready  very well agreed dorothy  lets seethe camp must be over this way  she had probably made a mistake about that for after they had gone far enough to have reached the camp they still found themselves in the thick of the woods  so the little girl stopped short and looked around her and toto glanced up into her face with his bright little eyes and wagged his tail as if he knew something was wrong  he couldnt tell much about direction himself because he had spent his time prowling among the bushes and running here and there nor had billina paid much attention to where they were going being interested in picking bugs from the moss as they passed along  the yellow hen now turned one eye up toward the little girl and asked  have you forgotten where the camp is dorothy  yes she admitted have you billina  i didnt try to remember returned billina  id no idea you would get lost dorothy  its the thing we dont expect billina that usually happens observed the girl thoughtfully  but its no use standing here lets go in that direction pointing a finger at random  it may be well get out of the forest over there  so on they went again but this way the trees were closer together and the vines were so tangled that often they tripped dorothy up  suddenly a voice cried sharply  halt  at first dorothy could see nothing although she looked around very carefully  but billina exclaimed  well i declare  what is it asked the little girl for toto began barking at something and following his gaze she discovered what it was  a row of spoons had surrounded the three and these spoons stood straight up on their handles and carried swords and muskets  their faces were outlined in the polished bowls and they looked very stern and severe  dorothy laughed at the queer things  who are you she asked  were the spoon brigade said one  in the service of his majesty king kleaver said another  and you are our prisoners said a third  dorothy sat down on an old stump and looked at them her eyes twinkling with amusement  what would happen she inquired if i should set my dog on your brigade  he would die replied one of the spoons sharply  one shot from our deadly muskets would kill him big as he is  dont risk it dorothy advised the yellow hen  remember this is a fairy country yet none of us three happens to be a fairy  dorothy grew sober at this  praps youre right billina she answered  but how funny it is to be captured by a lot of spoons  i do not see anything very funny about it declared a spoon  were the regular military brigade of the kingdom  what kingdom she asked  utensia said he  i never heard of it before asserted dorothy  then she added thoughtfully i dont believe ozma ever heard of utensia either tell me are you not subjects of ozma of oz  we have never heard of her retorted a spoon  we are subjects of king kleaver and obey only his orders which are to bring all prisoners to him as soon as they are captured  so step lively my girl and march with us or we may be tempted to cut off a few of your toes with our swords  this threat made dorothy laugh again  she did not believe she was in any danger but here was a new and interesting adventure so she was willing to be taken to utensia that she might see what king kleavers kingdom was like    16  how dorothy visited utensia  there must have been from six to eight dozen spoons in the brigade and they marched away in the shape of a hollow square with dorothy billina and toto in the center of the square  before they had gone very far toto knocked over one of the spoons by wagging his tail and then the captain of the spoons told the little dog to be more careful or he would be punished  so toto was careful and the spoon brigade moved along with astonishing swiftness while dorothy really had to walk fast to keep up with it  by and by they left the woods and entered a big clearing in which was the kingdom of utensia  standing all around the clearing were a good many cookstoves ranges and grills of all sizes and shapes and besides these there were several kitchen cabinets and cupboards and a few kitchen tables  these things were crowded with utensils of all sorts frying pans sauce pans kettles forks knives basting and soup spoons nutmeg graters sifters colanders meat saws flat irons rolling pins and many other things of a like nature  when the spoon brigade appeared with the prisoners a wild shout arose and many of the utensils hopped off their stoves or their benches and ran crowding around dorothy and the hen and the dog  stand back cried the captain sternly and he led his captives through the curious throng until they came before a big range that stood in the center of the clearing  beside this range was a butcher block upon which lay a great cleaver with a keen edge  it rested upon the flat of its back its legs were crossed and it was smoking a long pipe  wake up your majesty said the captain  here are prisoners  hearing this king kleaver sat up and looked at dorothy sharply  gristle and fat he cried  where did this girl come from  i found her in the forest and brought her here a prisoner replied the captain  why did you do that inquired the king puffing his pipe lazily  to create some excitement the captain answered  it is so quiet here that we are all getting rusty for want of amusement  for my part i prefer to see stirring times  naturally returned the cleaver with a nod  i have always said captain without a bit of irony that you are a sterling officer and a solid citizen bowled and polished to a degree  but what do you expect me to do with these prisoners  that is for you to decide declared the captain  you are the king  to be sure to be sure muttered the cleaver musingly  as you say we have had dull times since the steel and grindstone eloped and left us  command my counselors and the royal courtiers to attend me as well as the high priest and the judge  well then decide what can be done  the captain saluted and retired and dorothy sat down on an overturned kettle and asked  have you anything to eat in your kingdom  here  get up  get off from me cried a faint voice at which his majesty the cleaver said  excuse me but youre sitting on my friend the tenquart kettle  dorothy at once arose and the kettle turned right side up and looked at her reproachfully  im a friend of the king so no one dares sit on me said he  id prefer a chair anyway she replied  sit on that hearth commanded the king  so dorothy sat on the hearthshelf of the big range and the subjects of utensia began to gather around in a large and inquisitive throng toto lay at dorothys feet and billina flew upon the range which had no fire in it and perched there as comfortably as she could  when all the counselors and courtiers had assembledand these seemed to include most of the inhabitants of the kingdomthe king rapped on the block for order and said  friends and fellow utensils  our worthy commander of the spoon brigade captain dipp has captured the three prisoners you see before you and brought them here forfori dont know what for  so i ask your advice how to act in this matter and what fate i should mete out to these captives  judge sifter stand on my right  it is your business to sift this affair to the bottom  high priest colender stand on my left and see that no one testifies falsely in this matter  as these two officials took their places dorothy asked  why is the colander the high priest  hes the holiest thing we have in the kingdom replied king kleaver  except me said a sieve  im the whole thing when it comes to holes  what we need remarked the king rebukingly is a wireless sieve  i must speak to marconi about it  these oldfashioned sieves talk too much  now it is the duty of the kings counselors to counsel the king at all times of emergency so i beg you to speak out and advise me what to do with these prisoners  i demand that they be killed several times until they are dead shouted a pepperbox hopping around very excitedly  compose yourself mr paprica advised the king  your remarks are piquant and highlyseasoned but you need a scattering of commonsense it is only necessary to kill a person once to make him dead but i do not see that it is necessary to kill this little girl at all  i dont either said dorothy  pardon me but you are not expected to advise me in this matter replied king kleaver  why not asked dorothy  you might be prejudiced in your own favor and so mislead us he said  now then good subjects who speaks next  id like to smooth this thing over in some way said a flatiron earnestly  we are supposed to be useful to mankind you know  but the girl isnt mankind  shes womankind yelled a corkscrew  what do you know about it inquired the king  im a lawyer said the corkscrew proudly  i am accustomed to appear at the bar  but youre crooked retorted the king and that debars you  you may be a corking good lawyer mr popp but i must ask you to withdraw your remarks  very well said the corkscrew sadly i see i havent any pull at this court  permit me continued the flatiron to press my suit your majesty i do not wish to gloss over any fault the prisoner may have committed if such a fault exists but we owe her some consideration and thats flat  id like to hear from prince karver said the king  at this a stately carvingknife stepped forward and bowed  the captain was wrong to bring this girl here and she was wrong to come he said  but now that the foolish deed is done let us all prove our mettle and have a slashing good time  thats it thats it screamed a fat choppingknife  well make mincemeat of the girl and hash of the chicken and sausage of the dog  there was a shout of approval at this and the king had to rap again for order  gentlemen gentlemen he said your remarks are somewhat cutting and rather disjointed as might be expected from such acute intellects but you give me no reasons for your demands  see here kleaver you make me tired said a saucepan strutting before the king very impudently  youre about the worst king that ever reigned in utensia and thats saying a good deal  why dont you run things yourself instead of asking everybodys advice like the big clumsy idiot you are  the king sighed  i wish there wasnt a saucepan in my kingdom he said  you fellows are always stewing over something and every once in a while you slop over and make a mess of it  go hang yourself sirby the handleand dont let me hear from you again  dorothy was much shocked by the dreadful language the utensils employed and she thought that they must have had very little proper training  so she said addressing the king who seemed very unfit to rule his turbulent subjects  i wish youd decide my fate right away  i cant stay here all day trying to find out what youre going to do with me  this thing is becoming a regular broil and its time i took part in it observed a big gridiron coming forward  what id like to know said a canopener in a shrill voice is why the little girl came to our forest anyhow and why she intruded upon captain dippwho ought to be called dippyand who she is and where she came from and where she is going and why and wherefore and therefore and when  im sorry to see sir jabber remarked the king to the canopener that you have such a prying disposition  as a matter of fact all the things you mention are none of our business  having said this the king relighted his pipe which had gone out  tell me please what is our business inquired a potatomasher winking at dorothy somewhat impertinently  im fond of little girls myself and it seems to me she has as much right to wander in the forest as we have  who accuses the little girl anyway inquired a rollingpin  what has she done  i dont know said the king  what has she done captain dipp  thats the trouble your majesty  she hasnt done anything replied the captain  what do you want me to do asked dorothy  this question seemed to puzzle them all  finally a chafingdish exclaimed irritably  if no one can throw any light on this subject you must excuse me if i go out  at this a big kitchen fork pricked up its ears and said in a tiny voice  lets hear from judge sifter  thats proper returned the king  so judge sifter turned around slowly several times and then said  we have nothing against the girl except the stovehearth upon which she sits  therefore i order her instantly discharged  discharged cried dorothy  why i never was discharged in my life and i dont intend to be  if its all the same to you ill resign  its all the same declared the king  you are freeyou and your companionsand may go wherever you like  thank you said the little girl  but havent you anything to eat in your kingdom  im hungry  go into the woods and pick blackberries advised the king lying down upon his back again and preparing to go to sleep  there isnt a morsel to eat in all utensia that i know of  so dorothy jumped up and said  come on toto and billina  if we cant find the camp we may find some blackberries  the utensils drew back and allowed them to pass without protest although captain dipp marched the spoon brigade in close order after them until they had reached the edge of the clearing  there the spoons halted but dorothy and her companions entered the forest again and began searching diligently for a way back to the camp that they might rejoin their party    17  how they came to bunbury  wandering through the woods without knowing where you are going or what adventure you are about to meet next is not as pleasant as one might think  the woods are always beautiful and impressive and if you are not worried or hungry you may enjoy them immensely but dorothy was worried and hungry that morning so she paid little attention to the beauties of the forest and hurried along as fast as she could go  she tried to keep in one direction and not circle around but she was not at all sure that the direction she had chosen would lead her to the camp  by and by to her great joy she came upon a path  it ran to the right and to the left being lost in the trees in both directions and just before her upon a big oak were fastened two signs with arms pointing both ways  one sign read   take the other road to bunbury   and the second sign read   take the other road to bunnybury   well exclaimed billina eyeing the signs this looks as if we were getting back to civilization again  im not sure about the civilzation dear replied the little girl but it looks as if we might get somewhere and thats a big relief anyhow  which path shall we take inquired the yellow hen  dorothy stared at the signs thoughtfully  bunbury sounds like something to eat she said  lets go there  its all the same to me replied billina  she had picked up enough bugs and insects from the moss as she went along to satisfy her own hunger but the hen knew dorothy could not eat bugs nor could toto  the path to bunbury seemed little traveled but it was distinct enough and ran through the trees in a zigzag course until it finally led them to an open space filled with the queerest houses dorothy had ever seen they were all made of crackers laid out in tiny squares and were of many pretty and ornamental shapes having balconies and porches with posts of breadsticks and roofs shingled with wafercrackers  there were walks of breadcrusts leading from house to house and forming streets and the place seemed to have many inhabitants  when dorothy followed by billina and toto entered the place they found people walking the streets or assembled in groups talking together or sitting upon the porches and balconies  and what funny people they were  men women and children were all made of buns and bread  some were thin and others fat some were white some light brown and some very dark of complexion  a few of the buns which seemed to form the more important class of the people were neatly frosted  some had raisins for eyes and currant buttons on their clothes others had eyes of cloves and legs of stick cinnamon and many wore hats and bonnets frosted pink and green  there was something of a commotion in bunbury when the strangers suddenly appeared among them  women caught up their children and hurried into their houses shutting the cracker doors carefully behind them  some men ran so hastily that they tumbled over one another while others more brave assembled in a group and faced the intruders defiantly  dorothy at once realized that she must act with caution in order not to frighten these shy people who were evidently unused to the presence of strangers  there was a delightful fragrant odor of fresh bread in the town and this made the little girl more hungry than ever  she told toto and billina to stay back while she slowly advanced toward the group that stood silently awaiting her  you must scuse me for coming unexpected she said softly but i really didnt know i was coming here until i arrived  i was lost in the woods you know and im as hungry as anything  hungry they murmured in a horrified chorus  yes i havent had anything to eat since last nights supper she exclaimed  are there any eatables in bunbury  they looked at one another undecidedly and then one portly bun man who seemed a person of consequence stepped forward and said  little girl to be frank with you we are all eatables  everything in bunbury is eatable to ravenous human creatures like you  but it is to escape being eaten and destroyed that we have secluded ourselves in this outoftheway place and there is neither right nor justice in your coming here to feed upon us  dorothy looked at him longingly  youre bread arent you she asked  yes bread and butter  the butter is inside me so it wont melt and run  i do the running myself  at this joke all the others burst into a chorus of laughter and dorothy thought they couldnt be much afraid if they could laugh like that  couldnt i eat something besides people she asked  couldnt i eat just one house or a sidewalk or something  i wouldnt mind much what it was you know  this is not a public bakery child replied the man sternly  its private property  i know mrmr  my name is c bunn esquire said the man  c stands for cinnamon and this place is called after my family which is the most aristocratic in the town  oh i dont know about that objected another of the queer people the grahams and the browns and whites are all excellent families and there is none better of their kind  im a boston brown myself  i admit you are all desirable citizens said mr bunn rather stiffly but the fact remains that our town is called bunbury  scuse me interrupted dorothy but im getting hungrier every minute  now if youre polite and kind as im sure you ought to be youll let me eat something  theres so much to eat here that you will never miss it  then a big puffedup man of a delicate brown color stepped forward and said  i think it would be a shame to send this child away hungry especially as she agrees to eat whatever we can spare and not touch our people  so do i pop replied a roll who stood near  what then do you suggest mr over inquired mr bunn  why ill let her eat my back fence if she wants to  its made of waffles and theyre very crisp and nice  she may also eat my wheelbarrow added a pleasant looking muffin its made of nabiscos with a zuzu wheel  very good very good remarked mr bunn  that is certainly very kind of you  go with pop over and mr muffin little girl and they will feed you  thank you very much said dorothy gratefully  may i bring my dog toto and the yellow hen  theyre hungry too  will you make them behave asked the muffin  of course promised dorothy  then come along said pop over  so dorothy and billina and toto walked up the street and the people seemed no longer to be at all afraid of them  mr muffins house came first and as his wheelbarrow stood in the front yard the little girl ate that first  it didnt seem very fresh but she was so hungry that she was not particular  toto ate some too while billina picked up the crumbs  while the strangers were engaged in eating many of the people came and stood in the street curiously watching them  dorothy noticed six roguish looking brown children standing all in a row and she asked  who are you little ones  were the graham gems replied one and were all twins  i wonder if your mother could spare one or two of you asked billina who decided that they were fresh baked but at this dangerous question the six little gems ran away as fast as they could go  you musnt say such things billina said dorothy reprovingly  now lets go into pop overs back yard and get the waffles  i sort of hate to let that fence go remarked mr over nervously as they walked toward his house  the neighbors back of us are soda biscuits and i dont care to mix with them  but im hungry yet declared the girl  that wheelbarrow wasnt very big  ive got a shortcake piano but none of my family can play on it he said reflectively  suppose you eat that  all right said dorothy i dont mind  anything to be accommodating  so mr over led her into the house where she ate the piano which was of an excellent flavor  is there anything to drink here she asked  yes ive a milk pump and a water pump which will you have he asked  i guess ill try em both said dorothy  so mr over called to his wife who brought into the yard a pail made of some kind of baked dough and dorothy pumped the pail full of cool sweet milk and drank it eagerly  the wife of pop over was several shades darker than her husband  arent you overdone the little girl asked her  no indeed answered the woman  im neither overdone nor done over im just mrs over and im the president of the bunbury breakfast band  dorothy thanked them for their hospitality and went away  at the gate mr cinnamon bunn met her and said he would show her around the town we have some very interesting inhabitants he remarked walking stiffly beside her on his stickcinnamon legs and all of us who are in good health are well bred  if you are no longer hungry we will call upon a few of the most important citizens  toto and billina followed behind them behaving very well and a little way down the street they came to a handsome residence where aunt sally lunn lived  the old lady was glad to meet the little girl and gave her a slice of white bread and butter which had been used as a doormat it was almost fresh and tasted better than anything dorothy had eaten in the town  where do you get the butter she inquired  we dig it out of the ground which as you may have observed is all flour and meal replied mr bunn  there is a butter mine just at the opposite side of the village  the trees which you see here are all doughleanders and doughderas and in the season we get quite a crop of doughnuts off them  i should think the flour would blow around and get into your eyes said dorothy  no said he we are bothered with cracker dust sometimes but never with flour  then he took her to see johnny cake a cheerful old gentleman who lived near by  i suppose youve heard of me said old johnny with an air of pride im a great favorite all over the world  arent you rather yellow asked dorothy looking at him critically  maybe child  but dont think im bilious for i was never in better health in my life replied the old gentleman  if anything ailed me id willingly acknowledge the corn  johnnys a trifle stale said mr bunn as they went away but hes a good mixer and never gets crossgrained  i will now take you to call upon some of my own relatives  they visited the sugar bunns the currant bunns and the spanish bunns the latter having a decidedly foreign appearance  then they saw the french rolls who were very polite to them and made a brief call upon the parker h rolls who seemed a bit proud and overbearing  but theyre not as stuck up as the frosted jumbles declared mr bunn who are people i really cant abide  i dont like to be suspicious or talk scandal but sometimes i think the jumbles have too much baking powder in them  just then a dreadful scream was heard and dorothy turned hastily around to find a scene of great excitement a little way down the street  the people were crowding around toto and throwing at him everything they could find at hand  they pelted the little dog with hardtack crackers and even articles of furniture which were hard baked and heavy enough for missiles  toto howeled a little as the assortment of bake stuff struck him but he stood still with head bowed and tail between his legs until dorothy ran up and inquired what the matter was  matter cried a rye loafer indignantly why the horrid beast has eaten three of our dear crumpets and is now devouring a saltrising biscuit  oh toto  how could you exclaimed dorothy much distressed  totos mouth was full of his saltrising victim so he only whined and wagged his tail  but billina who had flown to the top of a cracker house to be in a safe place called out  dont blame him dorothy the crumpets dared him to do it  yes and you pecked out the eyes of a raisin bunnone of our best citizens shouted a bread pudding shaking its fist at the yellow hen  whats that  whats that wailed mr cinnamon bunn who had now joined them  oh what a misfortunewhat a terrible misfortune  see here said dorothy determined to defend her pets i think weve treated you all pretty well seeing youre eatables an reglar food for us  ive been kind to you and eaten your old wheelbarrows and pianos and rubbish an not said a word  but toto and billina cant be spected to go hungry when the towns full of good things they like to eat cause they cant understand your stingy ways as i do  you must leave here at once said mr bunn sternly  suppose we wont go said dorothy who was now much provoked  then said he we will put you into the great ovens where we are made and bake you  dorothy gazed around and saw threatening looks upon the faces of all she had not noticed any ovens in the town but they might be there nevertheless for some of the inhabitants seemed very fresh  so she decided to go and calling to toto and billina to follow her she marched up the street with as much dignity as possible considering that she was followed by the hoots and cries of the buns and biscuits and other bake stuff    18  how ozma looked into the magic picture  princess ozma was a very busy little ruler for she looked carefully after the comfort and welfare of her people and tried to make them happy  if any quarrels arose she decided them justly if any one needed counsel or advice she was ready and willing to listen to them  for a day or two after dorothy and her companions had started on their trip ozma was occupied with the affairs of her kingdom  then she began to think of some manner of occupation for uncle henry and aunt em that would be light and easy and yet give the old people something to do  she soon decided to make uncle henry the keeper of the jewels for some one really was needed to count and look after the bins and barrels of emeralds diamonds rubies and other precious stones that were in the royal storehouses  that would keep uncle henry busy enough but it was harder to find something for aunt em to do  the palace was full of servants so there was no detail of housework that aunt em could look after  while ozma sat in her pretty room engaged in thought she happened to glance at her magic picture  this was one of the most important treasures in all the land of oz  it was a large picture set in a beautiful gold frame and it hung in a prominent place upon a wall of ozmas private room  usually this picture seemed merely a country scene but whenever ozma looked at it and wished to know what any of her friends or acquaintances were doing the magic of this wonderful picture was straightway disclosed  for the country scene would gradually fade away and in its place would appear the likeness of the person or persons ozma might wish to see surrounded by the actual scenes in which they were then placed  in this way the princess could view any part of the world she wished and watch the actions of any one in whom she was interested  ozma had often seen dorothy in her kansas home by this means and now having a little leisure she expressed a desire to see her little friend again  it was while the travelers were at fuddlecumjig and ozma laughed merrily as she watched in the picture her friends trying to match the pieces of grandmother gnit  they seem happy and are doubtless having a good time the girl ruler said to herself and then she began to think of the many adventures she herself had encountered with dorothy  the image of her friends now faded from the magic picture and the old landscape slowly reappeared  ozma was thinking of the time when with dorothy and her army she marched to the nome kings underground cavern beyond the land of ev and forced the old monarch to liberate his captives who belonged to the royal family of ev  that was the time when the scarecrow nearly frightened the nome king into fits by throwing one of billinas eggs at him and dorothy had captured king roquats magic belt and brought it away with her to the land of oz  the pretty princess smiled at the recollection of this adventure and then she wondered what had become of the nome king since then  merely because she was curious and had nothing better to do ozma glanced at the magic picture and wished to see in it the king of the nomes  roquat the red went every day into his tunnel to see how the work was getting along and to hurry his workmen as much as possible  he was there now and ozma saw him plainly in the magic picture  she saw the underground tunnel reaching far underneath the deadly desert which separated the land of oz from the mountains beneath which the nome king had his extensive caverns  she saw that the tunnel was being made in the direction of the emerald city and knew at once it was being dug so that the army of nomes could march through it and attack her own beautiful and peaceful country  i suppose king roquat is planning revenge against us she said musingly and thinks he can surprise us and make us his captives and slaves  how sad it is that any one can have such wicked thoughts  but i must not blame king roquat too severely for he is a nome and his nature is not so gentle as my own  then she dismissed from her mind further thought of the tunnel for that time and began to wonder if aunt em would not be happy as royal mender of the stockings of the ruler of oz  ozma wore few holes in her stockings still they sometimes needed mending  aunt em ought to be able to do that very nicely  next day the princess watched the tunnel again in her magic picture and every day afterward she devoted a few minutes to inspecting the work  it was not especially interesting but she felt that it was her duty  slowly but surely the big arched hole crept through the rocks underneath the deadly desert and day by day it drew nearer and nearer to the emerald city    19  how bunnybury welcomed the strangers  dorothy left bunbury the same way she had entered it and when they were in the forest again she said to billina  i never thought that things good to eat could be so disgreeble  often ive eaten things that tasted good but were disagreeable afterward returned the yellow hen  i think dorothy if eatables are going to act badly its better before than after you eat them  praps youre right said the little girl with a sigh  but what shall we do now  let us follow the path back to the signpost suggested billina that will be better than getting lost again  why were lost anyhow declared dorothy but i guess youre right about going back to that signpost billina  they returned along the path to the place where they had first found it and at once took the other road to bunnybury  this road was a mere narrow strip worn hard and smooth but not wide enough for dorothys feet to tread  still it was a guide and the walking through the forest was not at all difficult  before long they reached a high wall of solid white marble and the path came to an end at this wall  at first dorothy thought there was no opening at all in the marble but on looking closely she discovered a small square door about on a level with her head and underneath this closed door was a bellpush  near the bellpush a sign was painted in neat letters upon the marble and the sign read   no admittance  except on business   this did not discourage dorothy however and she rang the bell  pretty soon a bolt was cautiously withdrawn and the marble door swung slowly open  then she saw it was not really a door but a window for several brass bars were placed across it being set fast in the marble and so close together that the little girls fingers might barely go between them  back of the bars appeared the face of a white rabbita very sober and sedate facewith an eyeglass held in his left eye and attached to a cord in his buttonhole  well what is it asked the rabbit sharply  im dorothy said the girl and im lost and  state your business please interrupted the rabbit  my business she replied is to find out where i am and to  no one is allowed in bunnybury without an order or a letter of introduction from either ozma of oz or glinda the good announced the rabbit so that settles the matter and he started to close the window  wait a minute cried dorothy  ive got a letter from ozma  from the ruler of oz asked the rabbit doubtingly  of course  ozmas my best friend you know and im a princess myself she announced earnestly  humha  let me see your letter returned the rabbit as if he still doubted her  so she hunted in her pocket and found the letter ozma had given her then she handed it through the bars to the rabbit who took it in his paws and opened it  he read it aloud in a pompous voice as if to let dorothy and billina see that he was educated and could read writing the letter was as follows   it will please me to have my subjects greet princess dorothy the bearer of this royal missive with the same courtesy and consideration they would extend to me   hahum  it is signed ozma of oz continued the rabbit and is sealed with the great seal of the emerald city  well well well  how strange  how remarkable  what are you going to do about it inquired dorothy impatiently  we must obey the royal mandate replied the rabbit  we are subjects of ozma of oz and we live in her country  also we are under the protection of the great sorceress glinda the good who made us promise to respect ozmas commands  then may i come in she asked  ill open the door said the rabbit  he shut the window and disappeared but a moment afterward a big door in the wall opened and admitted dorothy to a small room which seemed to be a part of the wall and built into it  here stood the rabbit she had been talking with and now that she could see all of him she gazed at the creature in surprise  he was a good sized white rabbit with pink eyes much like all other white rabbits but the astonishing thing about him was the manner in which he was dressed  he wore a white satin jacket embroidered with gold and having diamond buttons  his vest was rosecolored satin with tourmaline buttons  his trousers were white to correspond with the jacket and they were baggy at the kneeslike those of a zouavebeing tied with knots of rose ribbons  his shoes were of white plush with diamond buckles and his stockings were rose silk  the richness and even magnificence of the rabbits clothing made dorothy stare at the little creature wonderingly  toto and billina had followed her into the room and when he saw them the rabbit ran to a table and sprang upon it nimbly  then he looked at the three through his monocle and said  these companions princess cannot enter bunnybury with you  why not asked dorothy  in the first place they would frighten our people who dislike dogs above all things on earth and secondly the letter of the royal ozma does not mention them  but theyre my friends persisted dorothy and go wherever i go  not this time said the rabbit decidedly  you yourself princess are a welcome visitor since you come so highly recommended but unless you consent to leave the dog and the hen in this room i cannot permit you to enter the town  never mind us dorothy said billina  go inside and see what the place is like  you can tell us about it afterward and toto and i will rest comfortably here until you return  this seemed the best thing to do for dorothy was curious to see how the rabbit people lived and she was aware of the fact that her friends might frighten the timid little creatures  she had not forgotten how toto and billina had misbehaved in bunbury and perhaps the rabbit was wise to insist on their staying outside the town  very well she said ill go in alone  i spose youre the king of this town arent you  no answered the rabbit im merely the keeper of the wicket and a person of little importance although i try to do my duty  i must now inform you princess that before you enter our town you must consent to reduce  reduce what asked dorothy  your size  you must become the size of the rabbits although you may retain your own form  wouldnt my clothes be too big for me she inquired  no they will reduce when your body does  can you make me smaller asked the girl  easily returned the rabbit  and will you make me big again when im ready to go away  i will said he  all right then im willing she announced  the rabbit jumped from the table and ranor rather hoppedto the further wall where he opened a door so tiny that even toto could scarcely have crawled through it  follow me he said  now almost any other little girl would have declared that she could not get through so small a door but dorothy had already encountered so many fairy adventures that she believed nothing was impossible in the land of oz  so she quietly walked toward the door and at every step she grew smaller and smaller until by the time the opening was reached she could pass through it with ease  indeed as she stood beside the rabbit who sat upon his hind legs and used his paws as hands her head was just about as high as his own  then the keeper of the wicket passed through and she followed after which the door swung shut and locked itself with a sharp click  dorothy now found herself in a city so strange and beautiful that she gave a gasp of surprise  the high marble wall extended all around the place and shut out all the rest of the world  and here were marble houses of curious forms most of them resembling overturned kettles but with delicate slender spires and minarets running far up into the sky the streets were paved with white marble and in front of each house was a lawn of rich green clover  everything was as neat as wax the green and white contrasting prettily together  but the rabbit people were after all the most amazing things dorothy saw  the streets were full of them and their costumes were so splendid that the rich dress of the keeper of the wicket was commonplace when compared with the others  silks and satins of delicate hues seemed always used for material and nearly every costume sparkled with exquisite gems  but the lady rabbits outshone the gentlemen rabbits in splendor and the cut of their gowns was really wonderful  they wore bonnets too with feathers and jewels in them and some wheeled baby carriages in which the girl could see wee bunnies  some were lying asleep while others lay sucking their paws and looking around them with big pink eyes  as dorothy was no bigger in size than the grownup rabbits she had a chance to observe them closely before they noticed her presence  then they did not seem at all alarmed although the little girl naturally became the center of attraction and regarded her with great curiosity  make way cried the keeper of the wicket in a pompous voice make way for princess dorothy who comes from ozma of oz  hearing this announcement the throng of rabbits gave place to them on the walks and as dorothy passed along they all bowed their heads respectfully  walking thus through several handsome streets they came to a square in the center of the city  in this square were some pretty trees and a statue in bronze of glinda the good while beyond it were the portals of the royal palacean extensive and imposing building of white marble covered with a filigree of frosted gold    20  how dorothy lunched with a king  a line of rabbit soldiers was drawn up before the palace entrance and they wore green and gold uniforms with high shakos upon their heads and held tiny spears in their hands  the captain had a sword and a white plume in his shako  salute called the keeper of the wicket  salute princess dorothy who comes from ozma of oz  salute yelled the captain and all the soldiers promptly saluted  they now entered the great hall of the palace where they met a gaily dressed attendant from whom the keeper of the wicket inquired if the king were at leisure  i think so was the reply  i heard his majesty blubbering and wailing as usual only a few minutes ago  if he doesnt stop acting like a crybaby im going to resign my position here and go to work  whats the matter with your king asked dorothy surprised to hear the rabbit attendant speak so disrespectfully of his monarch  oh he doesnt want to be king thats all and he simply has to was the reply  come said the keeper of the wicket sternly lead us to his majesty and do not air our troubles before strangers i beg of you  why if this girl is going to see the king hell air his own troubles returned the attendant  that is his royal privilege declared the keeper  so the attendant led them into a room all draped with clothofgold and furnished with satincovered gold furniture  there was a throne in this room set on a dais and having a big cushioned seat and on this seat reclined the rabbit king  he was lying on his back with his paws in the air and whining very like a puppydog  your majesty your majesty  get up  heres a visitor called out the attendant  the king rolled over and looked at dorothy with one watery pink eye then he sat up and wiped his eyes carefully with a silk handkerchief and put on his jeweled crown which had fallen off  excuse my grief fair stranger he said in a sad voice  you behold in me the most miserable monarch in all the world  what time is it blinkem  one oclock your majesty replied the attendant to whom the question was addressed  serve luncheon at once commanded the king  luncheon for twothats for my visitor and meand see that the human has some sort of food shes accustomed to  yes your majesty answered the attendant and went away  tie my shoe bristle said the king to the keeper of the wicket  ah me how unhappy i am  what seems to be worrying your majesty asked dorothy  why its this king business of course he returned while the keeper tied his shoe  i didnt want to be king of bunnybury at all and the rabbits all knew it  so they elected meto save themselves from such a dreadful fate i supposeand here i am shut up in a palace when i might be free and happy  seems to me said dorothy its a great thing to be a king  were you ever a king inquired the monarch  no she answered laughing  then you know nothing about it he said  i havent inquired who you are but it doesnt matter  while were at luncheon ill tell you all my troubles  theyre a great deal more interesting than anything you can say about yourself  perhaps they are to you replied dorothy  luncheon is served cried blinkem throwing open the door and in came a dozen rabbits in livery all bearing trays which they placed upon the table where they arranged the dishes in an orderly manner  now clear outall of you exclaimed the king  bristle you may wait outside in case i want you  when they had gone and the king was alone with dorothy he came down from his throne tossed his crown into a corner and kicked his ermine robe under the table  sit down he said and try to be happy  its useless for me to try because im always wretched and miserable  but im hungry and i hope you are  i am said dorothy  ive only eaten a wheelbarrow and a piano todayoh yes and a slice of bread and butter that used to be a doormat  that sounds like a square meal remarked the king seating himself opposite her but perhaps it wasnt a square piano  eh  dorothy laughed  you dont seem so very unhappy now she said  but i am protested the king fresh tears gathering in his eyes even my jokes are miserable  im wretched woeful afflicted distressed and dismal as an individual can be  are you not sorry for me  no answered dorothy honestly i cant say i am  seems to me that for a rabbit youre right in clover  this is the prettiest little city i ever saw  oh the city is good enough he admitted  glinda the good sorceress made it for us because she was fond of rabbits  i dont mind the city so much although i wouldnt live here if i had my choice  it is being king that has absolutely ruined my happiness  why wouldnt you live here by choice she asked  because it is all unnatural my dear  rabbits are out of place in such luxury  when i was young i lived in a burrow in the forest  i was surrounded by enemies and often had to run for my life  it was hard getting enough to eat at times and when i found a bunch of clover i had to listen and look for danger while i ate it  wolves prowled around the hole in which i lived and sometimes i didnt dare stir out for days at a time  oh how happy and contented i was then i was a real rabbit as nature made mewild and freeand i even enjoyed listening to the startled throbbing of my own heart  ive often thought said dorothy who was busily eating that it would be fun to be a rabbit  it is funwhen youre the genuine article agreed his majesty  but look at me now  i live in a marble palace instead of a hole in the ground  i have all i want to eat without the joy of hunting for it every day i must dress in fine clothes and wear that horrible crown till it makes my head ache  rabbits come to me with all sorts of troubles when my own troubles are the only ones i care about  when i walk out i cant hop and run i must strut on my rear legs and wear an ermine robe  and the soldiers salute me and the band plays and the other rabbits laugh and clap their paws and cry out hail to the king  now let me ask you as a friend and a young lady of good judgment isnt all this pomp and foolishness enough to make a decent rabbit miserable  once said dorothy reflectively men were wild and unclothed and lived in caves and hunted for food as wild beasts do  but they got civlized in time and now theyd hate to go back to the old days  that is an entirely different case replied the king  none of you humans were civilized in one lifetime  it came to you by degrees  but i have known the forest and the free life and that is why i resent being civilized all at once against my will and being made a king with a crown and an ermine robe  pah  if you dont like it why dont you resign she asked  impossible wailed the rabbit wiping his eyes again with his handkerchief  theres a beastly law in this town that forbids it when one is elected a king theres no getting out of it  who made the laws inquired dorothy  the same sorceress who made the townglinda the good  she built the wall and fixed up the city and gave us several valuable enchantments and made the laws  then she invited all the pinkeyed white rabbits of the forest to come here after which she left us to our fate  what made you cept the invitation and come here asked the child  i didnt know how dreadful city life was and id no idea i would be elected king said he sobbing bitterly  andandnow im itwith a capital iand cant escape  i know glinda remarked dorothy eating for dessert a dish of charlotte russe and when i see her again ill ask her to put another king in your place  will you  will you indeed asked the king joyfully  i will if you want me to she replied  hurroohuray shouted the king and then he jumped up from the table and danced wildly about the room waving his napkin like a flag and laughing with glee  after a time he managed to control his delight and returned to the table  when are you likely to see glinda he inquired  oh praps in a few days said dorothy  and you wont forget to ask her  of course not  princess said the rabbit king earnestly you have relieved me of a great unhappiness and i am very grateful  therefore i propose to entertain you since you are my guest and i am the king as a slight mark of my appreciation  come with me to my reception hall  he then summoned bristle and said to him assemble all the nobility in the great reception hall and also tell blinkem that i want him immediately  the keeper of the wicket bowed and hurried away and his majesty turned to dorothy and continued well have time for a walk in the gardens before the people get here  the gardens were back of the palace and were filled with beautiful flowers and fragrant shrubs with many shade and fruit trees and marblepaved walks running in every direction  as they entered this place blinkem came running to the king who gave him several orders in a low voice  then his majesty rejoined dorothy and led her through the gardens which she admired very much  what lovely clothes your majesty wears she said glancing at the rich blue satin costume embroidered with pearls in which the king was dressed  yes he returned with an air of pride this is one of my favorite suits but i have a good many that are even more elaborate  we have excellent tailors in bunnybury and glinda supplies all the material by the way you might ask the sorceress when you see her to permit me to keep my wardrobe  but if you go back to the forest you will not need clothes she said  no he faltered that may be so  but ive dressed up so long that im used to it and i dont imagine id care to run around naked again so perhaps the good glinda will let me keep the costumes  ill ask her agreed dorothy  then they left the gardens and went into a fine big reception hall where rich rugs were spread upon the tiled floors and the furniture was exquisitely carved and studded with jewels  the kings chair was an especially pretty piece of furniture being in the shape of a silver lily with one leaf bent over to form the seat  the silver was everywhere thickly encrusted with diamonds and the seat was upholstered in white satin  oh what a splendid chair cried dorothy clasping her hands admiringly  isnt it answered the king proudly  it is my favorite seat and i think it especially becoming to my complexion  while i think of it i wish youd ask glinda to let me keep this lily chair when i go away  it wouldnt look very well in a hole in the ground would it she suggested  maybe not but im used to sitting in it and id like to take it with me he answered  but here come the ladies and gentlemen of the court so please sit beside me and be presented    21  how the king changed his mind  just then a rabbit band of nearly fifty pieces marched in playing upon golden instruments and dressed in neat uniforms  following the band came the nobility of bunnybury all richly dressed and hopping along on their rear legs  both the ladies and the gentlemen wore white gloves upon their paws with their rings on the outside of the gloves as this seemed to be the fashion here  some of the lady rabbits carried lorgnettes while many of the gentlemen rabbits wore monocles in their left eyes  the courtiers and their ladies paraded past the king who introduced princess dorothy to each couple in a very graceful manner  then the company seated themselves in chairs and on sofas and looked expectantly at their monarch  it is our royal duty as well as our royal pleasure he said to provide fitting entertainment for our distinguished guest  we will now present the royal band of whiskered friskers  as he spoke the musicians who had arranged themselves in a corner struck up a dance melody while into the room pranced the whiskered friskers  they were eight pretty rabbits dressed only in gauzy purple skirts fastened around their waists with diamond bands  their whiskers were colored a rich purple but otherwise they were pure white  after bowing before the king and dorothy the friskers began their pranks and these were so comical that dorothy laughed with real enjoyment  they not only danced together whirling and gyrating around the room but they leaped over one another stood upon their heads and hopped and skipped here and there so nimbly that it was hard work to keep track of them  finally they all made double somersaults and turned handsprings out of the room  the nobility enthusiastically applauded and dorothy applauded with them  theyre fine she said to the king  yes the whiskered friskers are really very clever he replied  i shall hate to part with them when i go away for they have often amused me when i was very miserable  i wonder if you would ask glinda  no it wouldnt do at all declared dorothy positively  there wouldnt be room in your hole in the ground for so many rabbits specly when you get the lily chair and your clothes there  dont think of such a thing your majesty  the king sighed  then he stood up and announced to the company  we will now hold a military drill by my picked bodyguard of royal pikemen  now the band played a march and a company of rabbit soldiers came in they wore green and gold uniforms and marched very stiffly but in perfect time  their spears or pikes had slender shafts of polished silver with golden heads and during the drill they handled these weapons with wonderful dexterity  i should think youd feel pretty safe with such a fine bodyguard remarked dorothy  i do said the king  they protect me from every harm  i suppose glinda wouldnt  no interrupted the girl im sure she wouldnt  its the kings own bodyguard and when you are no longer king you cant have em  the king did not reply but he looked rather sorrowful for a time  when the soldiers had marched out he said to the company  the royal jugglers will now appear  dorothy had seen many jugglers in her lifetime but never any so interesting as these  there were six of them dressed in black satin embroidered with queer symbols in silvera costume which contrasted strongly with their snowwhite fur  first they pushed in a big red ball and three of the rabbit jugglers stood upon its top and made it roll  then two of them caught up a third and tossed him into the air all vanishing until only the two were left  then one of these tossed the other upward and remained alone of all his fellows  this last juggler now touched the red ball which fell apart being hollow and the five rabbits who had disappeared in the air scrambled out of the hollow ball  next they all clung together and rolled swiftly upon the floor  when they came to a stop only one fat rabbit juggler was seen the others seeming to be inside him  this one leaped lightly into the air and when he came down he exploded and separated into the original six then four of them rolled themselves into round balls and the other two tossed them around and played ball with them  these were but a few of the tricks the rabbit jugglers performed and they were so skillful that all the nobility and even the king applauded as loudly as did dorothy  i suppose there are no rabbit jugglers in all the world to compare with these remarked the king  and since i may not have the whiskers friskers or my bodyguard you might ask glinda to let me take away just two or three of these jugglers  will you  ill ask her replied dorothy doubtfully  thank you said the king thank you very much  and now you shall listen to the winsome waggish warblers who have often cheered me in my moments of anguish  the winsome waggish warblers proved to be a quartette of rabbit singers two gentlemen and two lady rabbits  the gentlemen warblers wore fulldress swallowtailed suits of white satin with pearls for buttons while the lady warblers were gowned in white satin dresses with long trails  the first song they sang began in this way     when a rabbit gets a habit     of living in a city   and wearing clothes and furbelows     and jewels rare and pretty   he scorns the bun who has to run     and burrow in the ground   and pities those whose watchful foes     are man and gun and hound   dorothy looked at the king when she heard this song and noticed that he seemed disturbed and ill at ease  i dont like that song he said to the warblers  give us something jolly and rollicking  so they sang to a joyous tinkling melody as follows         bunnies gay       delight to play   in their fairy town secure       evry frisker       flirts his whisker   at a pinkeyed girl demure       evry maid       in silk arrayed   at her partner shyly glances       paws are grasped       waists are clasped   as they whirl in giddy dances       then together       through the heather   neath the moonlight soft they stroll       each is very       blithe and merry   gamboling with laughter droll       life is fun       to evry one   guarded by our magic charm       for to dangers       we are strangers   safe from any thought of harm   you see said dorothy to the king when the song ended the rabbits all seem to like bunnybury except you  and i guess youre the only one that ever has cried or was unhappy and wanted to get back to your muddy hole in the ground  his majesty seemed thoughtful and while the servants passed around glasses of nectar and plates of frosted cakes their king was silent and a bit nervous  when the refreshments had been enjoyed by all and the servants had retired dorothy said  i must go now for its getting late and im lost  ive got to find the wizard and aunt em and uncle henry and all the rest sometime before night comes if i possbly can  wont you stay with us asked the king  you will be very welcome  no thank you she replied  i must get back to my friends  and i want to see glinda just as soon as i can you know  so the king dismissed his court and said he would himself walk with dorothy to the gate  he did not weep nor groan any more but his long face was quite solemn and his big ears hung dejectedly on each side of it  he still wore his crown and his ermine and walked with a handsome goldheaded cane  when they arrived at the room in the wall the little girl found toto and billina waiting for her very patiently  they had been liberally fed by some of the attendants and were in no hurry to leave such comfortable quarters  the keeper of the wicket was by this time back in his old place but he kept a safe distance from toto  dorothy bade good bye to the king as they stood just inside the wall  youve been good to me she said and i thank you ever so much  as soon as possble ill see glinda and ask her to put another king in your place and send you back into the wild forest  and ill ask her to let you keep some of your clothes and the lily chair and one or two jugglers to amuse you  im sure she will do it cause shes so kind she doesnt like any one to be unhappy  ahem said the king looking rather downcast  i dont like to trouble you with my misery so you neednt see glinda  oh yes i will she replied  it wont be any trouble at all  but my dear continued the king in an embarrassed way ive been thinking the subject over carefully and i find there are a lot of pleasant things here in bunnybury that i would miss if i went away  so perhaps id better stay  dorothy laughed  then she looked grave  it wont do for you to be a king and a crybaby at the same time she said  youve been making all the other rabbits unhappy and discontented with your howls about being so miserable  so i guess its better to have another king  oh no indeed exclaimed the king earnestly  if you wont say anything to glinda ill promise to be merry and gay all the time and never cry or wail again  honor bright she asked  on the royal word of a king i promise it he answered  all right said dorothy  youd be a reglar lunatic to want to leave bunnybury for a wild life in the forest and im sure any rabbit outside the city would be glad to take your place  forget it my dear forget all my foolishness pleaded the king earnestly  hereafter ill try to enjoy myself and do my duty by my subjects  so then she left him and entered through the little door into the room in the wall where she grew gradually bigger and bigger until she had resumed her natural size  the keeper of the wicket let them out into the forest and told dorothy that she had been of great service to bunnybury because she had brought their dismal king to a realization of the pleasure of ruling so beautiful a city  i shall start a petition to have your statue erected beside glindas in the public square said the keeper  i hope you will come again some day and see it  perhaps i shall she replied  then followed by toto and billina she walked away from the high marble wall and started back along the narrow path toward the signpost    22  how the wizard found dorothy  when they came to the signpost there to their joy were the tents of the wizard pitched beside the path and the kettle bubbling merrily over the fire  the shaggy man and omby amby were gathering firewood while uncle henry and aunt em sat in their camp chairs talking with the wizard  they all ran forward to greet dorothy as she approached and aunt em exclaimed goodness gracious child  where have you been  youve played hookey the whole day added the shaggy man reproachfully  well you see ive been lost explained the little girl and ive tried awful hard to find the way back to you but just couldnt do it  did you wander in the forest all day asked uncle henry  you must be amost starved said aunt em  no said dorothy im not hungry  i had a wheelbarrow and a piano for breakfast and lunched with a king  ah exclaimed the wizard nodding with a bright smile  so youve been having adventures again  shes stark crazy cried aunt em  whoever heard of eating a wheelbarrow  it wasnt very big said dorothy and it had a zuzu wheel  and i ate the crumbs said billina soberly  sit down and tell us about it begged the wizard  weve hunted for you all day and at last i noticed your footsteps in this pathand the tracks of billina  we found the path by accident and seeing it only led to two places i decided you were at either one or the other of those places  so we made camp and waited for you to return  and now dorothy tell us where you have beento bunbury or to bunnybury  why ive been to both she replied but first i went to utensia which isnt on any path at all  she then sat down and related the days adventures and you may be sure aunt em and uncle henry were much astonished at the story  but after seeing the cuttenclips and the fuddles remarked her uncle we ought not to wonder at anything in this strange country  seems like the only common and ordinary folks here are ourselves rejoined aunt em diffidently  now that were together again and one reunited party observed the shaggy man what are we to do next  have some supper and a nights rest answered the wizard promptly and then proceed upon our journey  where to asked the captain general  we havent visited the rigmaroles or the flutterbudgets yet said dorothy  id like to see themwouldnt you  they dont sound very interesting objected aunt em  but perhaps they are  and then continued the little wizard we will call upon the tin woodman and jack pumpkinhead and our old friend the scarecrow on our way home  that will be nice cried dorothy eagerly  cant say they sound very interesting either remarked aunt em  why theyre the best friends i have asserted the little girl and youre sure to like them aunt em cause everbody likes them  by this time twilight was approaching so they ate the fine supper which the wizard magically produced from the kettle and then went to bed in the cozy tents  they were all up bright and early next morning but dorothy didnt venture to wander from the camp again for fear of more accidents  do you know where theres a road she asked the little man  no my dear replied the wizard but ill find one  after breakfast he waved his hand toward the tents and they became handkerchiefs again which were at once returned to the pockets of their owners  then they all climbed into the red wagon and the sawhorse inquired  which way  never mind which way replied the wizard  just go as you please and youre sure to be right  ive enchanted the wheels of the wagon and they will roll in the right direction never fear  as the sawhorse started away through the trees dorothy said  if we had one of those newfashioned airships we could float away over the top of the forest and look down and find just the places we want  airship  pah retorted the little man scornfully  i hate those things dorothy although they are nothing new to either you or me  i was a balloonist for many years and once my balloon carried me to the land of oz and once to the vegetable kingdom  and once ozma had a gump that flew all over this kingdom and had sense enough to go where it was told towhich airships wont do  the house which the cyclone brought to oz all the way from kansas with you and toto in itwas a real airship at the time so you see weve got plenty of experience flying with the birds  airships are not so bad after all declared dorothy  some day theyll fly all over the world and perhaps bring people even to the land of oz  i must speak to ozma about that said the wizard with a slight frown  it wouldnt do at all you know for the emerald city to become a waystation on an airship line  no said dorothy i dont spose it would  but what can we do to prevent it  im working out a magic recipe to fuddle mens brains so theyll never make an airship that will go where they want it to go the wizard confided to her  that wont keep the things from flying now and then but itll keep them from flying to the land of oz  just then the sawhorse drew the wagon out of the forest and a beautiful landscape lay spread before the travelers eyes  moreover right before them was a good road that wound away through the hills and valleys  now said the wizard with evident delight we are on the right track again and there is nothing more to worry about  its a foolish thing to take chances in a strange country observed the shaggy man  had we kept to the roads we never would have been lost  roads always lead to some place else they wouldnt be roads  this road added the wizard leads to rigmarole town  im sure of that because i enchanted the wagon wheels  sure enough after riding along the road for an hour or two they entered a pretty valley where a village was nestled among the hills the houses were munchkin shaped for they were all domes with windows wider than they were high and pretty balconies over the front doors  aunt em was greatly relieved to find this town neither paper nor patchwork and the only surprising thing about it was that it was so far distant from all other towns  as the sawhorse drew the wagon into the main street the travelers noticed that the place was filled with people standing in groups and seeming to be engaged in earnest conversation  so occupied with themselves were the inhabitants that they scarcely noticed the strangers at all  so the wizard stopped a boy and asked  is this rigmarole town  sir replied the boy if you have traveled very much you will have noticed that every town differs from every other town in one way or another and so by observing the methods of the people and the way they live as well as the style of their dwelling places it ought not to be a difficult thing to make up your mind without the trouble of asking questions whether the town bears the appearance of the one you intended to visit or whether perhaps having taken a different road from the one you should have taken you have made an error in your way and arrived at some point where  land sakes cried aunt em impatiently whats all this rigmarole about  thats it said the wizard laughing merrily  its a rigmarole because the boy is a rigmarole and weve come to rigmarole town  do they all talk like that asked dorothy wonderingly  he might have said yes or no and settled the question observed uncle henry  not here said omby amby  i dont believe the rigmaroles know what yes or no means  while the boy had been talking several other people had approached the wagon and listened intently to his speech  then they began talking to one another in long deliberate speeches where many words were used but little was said  but when the strangers criticized them so frankly one of the women who had no one else to talk to began an address to them saying  it is the easiest thing in the world for a person to say yes or no when a question that is asked for the purpose of gaining information or satisfying the curiosity of the one who has given expression to the inquiry has attracted the attention of an individual who may be competent either from personal experience or the experience of others to answer it with more or less correctness or at least an attempt to satisfy the desire for information on the part of the one who has made the inquiry by  dear me exclaimed dorothy interrupting the speech  ive lost all track of what you are saying  dont let her begin over again for goodness sake cried aunt em  but the woman did not begin again  she did not even stop talking but went right on as she had begun the words flowing from her mouth in a stream  im quite sure that if we waited long enough and listened carefully some of these people might be able to tell us something in time said the wizard  lets dont wait returned dorothy  ive heard of the rigmaroles and wondered what they were like but now i know and im ready to move on  so am i declared uncle henry were wasting time here  why were all ready to go said the shaggy man putting his fingers to his ears to shut out the monotonous babble of those around the wagon  so the wizard spoke to the sawhorse who trotted nimbly through the village and soon gained the open country on the other side of it dorothy looked back as they rode away and noticed that the woman had not yet finished her speech but was talking as glibly as ever although no one was near to hear her  if those people wrote books omby amby remarked with a smile it would take a whole library to say the cow jumped over the moon  perhaps some of em do write books asserted the little wizard ive read a few rigmaroles that might have come from this very town  some of the college lecturers and ministers are certainly related to these people observed the shaggy man and it seems to me the land of oz is a little ahead of the united states in some of its laws  for here if one cant talk clearly and straight to the point they send him to rigmarole town while uncle sam lets him roam around wild and free to torture innocent people  dorothy was thoughtful  the rigmaroles had made a strong impression upon her  she decided that whenever she spoke after this she would use only enough words to express what she wanted to say    23  how they encountered the flutterbudgets  they were soon among the pretty hills and valleys again and the sawhorse sped up hill and down at a fast and easy pace the roads being hard and smooth  mile after mile was speedily covered and before the ride had grown at all tiresome they sighted another village  the place seemed even larger than rigmarole town but was not so attractive in appearance  this must be flutterbudget center declared the wizard  you see its no trouble at all to find places if you keep to the right road  what are the flutterbudgets like inquired dorothy  i do not know my dear  but ozma has given them a town all their own and ive heard that whenever one of the people becomes a flutterbudget he is sent to this place to live  that is true omby amby added flutterbudget center and rigmarole town are called the defensive settlements of oz  the village they now approached was not built in a valley but on top of a hill and the road they followed wound around the hill like a corkscrew ascending the hill easily until it came to the town  look out screamed a voice  look out or youll run over my child  they gazed around and saw a woman standing upon the sidewalk nervously wringing her hands as she gazed at them appealingly  where is your child asked the sawhorse  in the house said the woman bursting into tears but if it should happen to be in the road and you ran over it those great wheels would crush my darling to jelly  oh dear oh dear  think of my darling child being crushed into jelly by those great wheels  giddap said the wizard sharply and the sawhorse started on  they had not gone far before a man ran out of a house shouting wildly help  help  the sawhorse stopped short and the wizard and uncle henry and the shaggy man and omby amby jumped out of the wagon and ran to the poor mans assistance  dorothy followed them as quickly as she could  whats the matter asked the wizard  help help screamed the man my wife has cut her finger off and shes bleeding to death  then he turned and rushed back to the house and all the party went with him  they found a woman in the front dooryard moaning and groaning as if in great pain  be brave madam said the wizard consolingly  you wont die just because you have cut off a finger you may be sure  but i havent cut off a finger she sobbed  then what has happened asked dorothy  ii pricked my finger with a needle while i was sewing andand the blood came she replied  and now ill have bloodpoisoning and the doctors will cut off my finger and that will give me a fever and i shall die  pshaw said dorothy ive pricked my finger many a time and nothing happened  really asked the woman brightening and wiping her eyes upon her apron  why its nothing at all declared the girl  youre more scared than hurt  ah thats because shes a flutterbudget said the wizard nodding wisely  i think i know now what these people are like  so do i announced dorothy  oh boohoohoo sobbed the woman giving way to a fresh burst of grief  whats wrong now asked the shaggy man  oh suppose i had pricked my foot she wailed  then the doctors would have cut my foot off and id be lamed for life  surely maam replied the wizard and if youd pricked your nose they might cut your head off  but you see you didnt  but i might have she exclaimed and began to cry again  so they left her and drove away in their wagon  and her husband came out and began calling help as he had before but no one seemed to pay any attention to him  as the travelers turned into another street they found a man walking excitedly up and down the pavement  he appeared to be in a very nervous condition and the wizard stopped him to ask  is anything wrong sir  everything is wrong answered the man dismally  i cant sleep  why not inquired omby amby  if i go to sleep ill have to shut my eyes he explained and if i shut my eyes they may grow together and then id be blind for life  did you ever hear of any ones eyes growing together asked dorothy  no said the man i never did  but it would be a dreadful thing wouldnt it  and the thought of it makes me so nervous im afraid to go to sleep  theres no help for this case declared the wizard and they went on  at the next street corner a woman rushed up to them crying  save my baby  oh good kind people save my baby  is it in danger asked dorothy noticing that the child was clasped in her arms and seemed sleeping peacefully  yes indeed said the woman nervously  if i should go into the house and throw my child out of the window it would roll way down to the bottom of the hill and then if there were a lot of tigers and bears down there they would tear my darling babe to pieces and eat it up  are there any tigers and bears in this neighborhood the wizard asked  ive never heard of any admitted the woman but if there were  have you any idea of throwing your baby out of the window questioned the little man  none at all she said but if  all your troubles are due to those ifs declared the wizard  if you were not a flutterbudget you wouldnt worry  theres another if replied the woman  are you a flutterbudget too  i will be if i stay here long exclaimed the wizard nervously  another if cried the woman  but the wizard did not stop to argue with her  he made the sawhorse canter all the way down the hill and only breathed easily when they were miles away from the village  after they had ridden in silence for a while dorothy turned to the little man and asked  do ifs really make flutterbudgets  i think the ifs help he answered seriously  foolish fears and worries over nothing with a mixture of nerves and ifs will soon make a flutterbudget of any one  then there was another long silence for all the travelers were thinking over this statement and nearly all decided it must be true  the country they were now passing through was everywhere tinted purple the prevailing color of the gillikin country but as the sawhorse ascended a hill they found that upon the other side everything was of a rich yellow hue  aha cried the captain general here is the country of the winkies we are just crossing the boundary line  then we may be able to lunch with the tin woodman announced the wizard joyfully  must we lunch on tin asked aunt em  oh no replied dorothy  nick chopper knows how to feed meat people and he will give us plenty of good things to eat never fear ive been to his castle before  is nick chopper the tin woodmans name asked uncle henry  yes thats one of his names answered the little girl and another of his names is empror of the winkies  hes the king of this country you know but ozma rules over all the countries of oz  does the tin woodman keep any flutterbudgets or rigmaroles at his castle inquired aunt em uneasily  no indeed said dorothy positively  he lives in a new tin castle all full of lovely things  i should think it would rust said uncle henry  he has thousands of winkies to keep it polished for him explained the wizard  his people love to do anything in their power for their beloved emperor so there isnt a particle of rust on all the big castle  i suppose they polish their emperor too said aunt em  why some time ago he had himself nickelplated the wizard answered so he only needs rubbing up once in a while  hes the brightest man in all the world is dear nick chopper and the kindesthearted  i helped find him said dorothy reflectively  once the scarecrow and i found the tin woodman in the woods and he was just rusted still that time an no mistake  but we oiled his joints an got em good and slippery and after that he went with us to visit the wizard at the emrald city  was that the time the wizard scared you asked aunt em  he didnt treat us well at first acknowledged dorothy for he made us go away and destroy the wicked witch  but after we found out he was only a humbug wizard we were not afraid of him  the wizard sighed and looked a little ashamed  when we try to deceive people we always make mistakes he said  but im getting to be a real wizard now and glinda the goods magic that i am trying to practice can never harm any one  you were always a good man declared dorothy even when you were a bad wizard  hes a good wizard now asserted aunt em looking at the little man admiringly  the way he made those tents grow out of handkerchiefs was just wonderful  and didnt he enchant the wagon wheels so theyd find the road  all the people of oz said the captain general are very proud of their wizard  he once made some soapbubbles that astonished the world  the wizard blushed at this praise yet it pleased him  he no longer looked sad but seemed to have recovered his usual good humor  the country through which they now rode was thickly dotted with farmhouses and yellow grain waved in all the fields  many of the winkies could be seen working on their farms and the wild and unsettled parts of oz were by this time left far behind  these winkies appeared to be happy lighthearted folk and all removed their caps and bowed low when the red wagon with its load of travelers passed by  it was not long before they saw something glittering in the sunshine far ahead  see cried dorothy thats the tin castle aunt em  and the sawhorse knowing his passengers were eager to arrive broke into a swift trot that soon brought them to their destination    24  how the tin woodman told the sad news  the tin woodman received princess dorothys party with much grace and cordiality yet the little girl decided that something must be worrying with her old friend because he was not so merry as usual  but at first she said nothing about this for uncle henry and aunt em were fairly bubbling over with admiration for the beautiful tin castle and its polished tin owner  so her suspicion that something unpleasant had happened was for a time forgotten  where is the scarecrow she asked when they had all been ushered into the big tin drawingroom of the castle the sawhorse being led around to the tin stable in the rear  why our old friend has just moved into his new mansion explained the tin woodman  it has been a long time in building although my winkies and many other people from all parts of the country have been busily working upon it  at last however it is completed and the scarecrow took possession of his new home just two days ago  i hadnt heard that he wanted a home of his own said dorothy  why doesnt he live with ozma in the emerald city  he used to you know and i thought he was happy there  it seems said the tin woodman that our dear scarecrow cannot be contented with city life however beautiful his surroundings might be originally he was a farmer for he passed his early life in a cornfield where he was supposed to frighten away the crows  i know said dorothy nodding  i found him and lifted him down from his pole  so now after a long residence in the emerald city his tastes have turned to farm life again continued the tin man  he feels that he cannot be happy without a farm of his own so ozma gave him some land and every one helped him build his mansion and now he is settled there for good  who designed his house asked the shaggy man  i believe it was jack pumpkinhead who is also a farmer was the reply  they were now invited to enter the tin dining room where luncheon was served  aunt em found to her satisfaction that dorothys promise was more than fulfilled for although the tin woodman had no appetite of his own he respected the appetites of his guests and saw that they were bountifully fed  they passed the afternoon in wandering through the beautiful gardens and grounds of the palace  the walks were all paved with sheets of tin brightly polished and there were tin fountains and tin statues here and there among the trees  the flowers were mostly natural flowers and grew in the regular way but their host showed them one flower bed which was his especial pride  you see all common flowers fade and die in time he explained and so there are seasons when the pretty blooms are scarce  therefore i decided to make one tin flower bed all of tin flowers and my workmen have created them with rare skill  here you see tin camelias tin marigolds tin carnations tin poppies and tin hollyhocks growing as naturally as if they were real  indeed they were a pretty sight and glistened under the sunlight like spun silver  isnt this tin hollyhock going to seed asked the wizard bending over the flowers  why i believe it is exclaimed the tin woodman as if surprised  i hadnt noticed that before  but i shall plant the tin seeds and raise another bed of tin hollyhocks  in one corner of the gardens nick chopper had established a fishpond in which they saw swimming and disporting themselves many pretty tin fishes  would they bite on hooks asked aunt em curiously  the tin woodman seemed hurt at this question  madam said he do you suppose i would allow anyone to catch my beautiful fishes even if they were foolish enough to bite on hooks no indeed  every created thing is safe from harm in my domain and i would as soon think of killing my little friend dorothy as killing one of my tin fishes  the emperor is very kindhearted maam explained the wizard  if a fly happens to light upon his tin body he doesnt rudely brush it off as some people might do he asks it politely to find some other resting place  what does the fly do then enquired aunt em  usually it begs his pardon and goes away said the wizard gravely flies like to be treated politely as well as other creatures and here in oz they understand what we say to them and behave very nicely  well said aunt em the flies in kansas where i came from dont understand anything but a swat  you have to smash em to make em behave and its the same way with skeeters  do you have skeeters in oz  we have some very large mosquitoes here which sing as beautifully as song birds replied the tin woodman  but they never bite or annoy our people because they are well fed and taken care of  the reason they bite people in your country is because they are hungrypoor things  yes agreed aunt em theyre hungry all right  an they aint very particular who they feed on  im glad youve got the skeeters educated in oz  that evening after dinner they were entertained by the emperors tin cornet band which played for them several sweet melodies  also the wizard did a few sleightofhand tricks to amuse the company after which they all retired to their cozy tin bedrooms and slept soundly until morning  after breakfast dorothy said to the tin woodman  if youll tell us which way to go well visit the scarecrow on our way home  i will go with you and show you the way replied the emperor for i must journey today to the emerald city  he looked so anxious as he said this that the little girl asked  there isnt anything wrong with ozma is there  not yet said he but im afraid the time has come when i must tell you some very bad news little friend  oh what is it cried dorothy  do you remember the nome king asked the tin woodman  i remember him very well she replied  the nome king has not a kind heart said the emperor sadly and he has been harboring wicked thoughts of revenge because we once defeated him and liberated his slaves and you took away his magic belt  so he has ordered his nomes to dig a long tunnel underneath the deadly desert so that he may march his hosts right into the emerald city when he gets there he intends to destroy our beautiful country  dorothy was much surprised to hear this  how did ozma find out about the tunnel she asked  she saw it in her magic picture  of course said dorothy i might have known that  and what is she going to do  i cannot tell was the reply  pooh cried the yellow hen  were not afraid of the nomes  if we roll a few of our eggs down the tunnel theyll run away back home as fast as they can go  why thats true enough exclaimed dorothy  the scarecrow once conquered all the nome kings army with some of billinas eggs  but you do not understand all of the dreadful plot continued the tin woodman  the nome king is clever and he knows his nomes would run from eggs so he has bargained with many terrible creatures to help him  these evil spirits are not afraid of eggs or anything else and they are very powerful  so the nome king will send them through the tunnel first to conquer and destroy and then the nomes will follow after to get their share of the plunder and slaves  they were all startled to hear this and every face wore a troubled look  is the tunnel all ready asked dorothy  ozma sent me word yesterday that the tunnel was all completed except for a thin crust of earth at the end  when our enemies break through this crust they will be in the gardens of the royal palace in the heart of the emerald city  i offered to arm all my winkies and march to ozmas assistance but she said no  i wonder why asked dorothy  she answered that all the inhabitants of oz gathered together were not powerful enough to fight and overcome the evil forces of the nome king  therefore she refuses to fight at all  but they will capture and enslave us and plunder and ruin all our lovely land exclaimed the wizard greatly disturbed by this statement  i fear they will said the tin woodman sorrowfully  and i also fear that those who are not fairies such as the wizard and dorothy and her uncle and aunt as well as toto and billina will be speedily put to death by the conquerors  what can be done asked dorothy shuddering a little at the prospect of this awful fate  nothing can be done gloomily replied the emperor of the winkies but since ozma refuses my army i will go myself to the emerald city the least i may do is to perish beside my beloved ruler    25  how the scarecrow displayed his wisdom  this amazing news had saddened every heart and all were now anxious to return to the emerald city and share ozmas fate  so they started without loss of time and as the road led past the scarecrows new mansion they determined to make a brief halt there and confer with him  the scarecrow is probably the wisest man in all oz remarked the tin woodman when they had started upon their journey  his brains are plentiful and of excellent quality and often he has told me things i might never have thought of myself  i must say i rely a great deal upon the scarecrows brains in this emergency  the tin woodman rode on the front seat of the wagon where dorothy sat between him and the wizard  has the scarecrow heard of ozmas trouble asked the captain general  i do not know sir was the reply  when i was a private said omby amby i was an excellent army as i fully proved in our war against the nomes  but now there is not a single private left in our army since ozma made me the captain general so there is no one to fight and defend our lovely ruler  true said the wizard  the present army is composed only of officers and the business of an officer is to order his men to fight since there are no men there can be no fighting  poor ozma whispered dorothy with tears in her sweet eyes  its dreadful to think of all her lovely fairy country being destroyed  i wonder if we couldnt manage to escape and get back to kansas by means of the magic belt  and we might take ozma with us and all work hard to get money for her so she wouldnt be so very lonely and unhappy about the loss of her fairyland  do you think there would be any work for me in kansas asked the tin woodman  if you are hollow they might use you in a canning factory suggested uncle henry  but i cant see the use of your working for a living you never eat or sleep or need a new suit of clothes  i was not thinking of myself replied the emperor with dignity  i merely wondered if i could not help to support dorothy and ozma  as they indulged in these sad plans for the future they journeyed in sight of the scarecrows new mansion and even though filled with care and worry over the impending fate of oz dorothy couldnt help a feeling of wonder at the sight she saw  the scarecrows new house was shaped like an immense ear of corn  the rows of kernels were made of solid gold and the green upon which the ear stood upright was a mass of sparkling emeralds  upon the very top of the structure was perched a figure representing the scarecrow himself and upon his extended arms as well as upon his head were several crows carved out of ebony and having ruby eyes  you may imagine how big this ear of corn was when i tell you that a single gold kernel formed a window swinging outward upon hinges while a row of four kernels opened to make the front entrance  inside there were five stories each story being a single room  the gardens around the mansion consisted of cornfields and dorothy acknowledged that the place was in all respects a very appropriate home for her good friend the scarecrow  he would have been very happy here im sure she said if only the nome king had left us alone  but if oz is destroyed of course this place will be destroyed too  yes replied the tin woodman and also my beautiful tin castle that has been my joy and pride  jack pumpkinheads house will go too remarked the wizard as well as professor wogglebugs athletic college and ozmas royal palace and all our other handsome buildings  yes oz will indeed become a desert when the nome king gets through with it sighed omby amby  the scarecrow came out to meet them and gave them all a hearty welcome  i hear you have decided always to live in the land of oz after this he said to dorothy and that will delight my heart for i have greatly disliked our frequent partings  but why are you all so downcast  have you heard the news asked the tin woodman  no news to make me sad replied the scarecrow  then nick chopper told his friend of the nome kings tunnel and how the evil creatures of the north had allied themselves with the underground monarch for the purpose of conquering and destroying oz well said the scarecrow it certainly looks bad for ozma and all of us  but i believe it is wrong to worry over anything before it happens  it is surely time enough to be sad when our country is despoiled and our people made slaves  so let us not deprive ourselves of the few happy hours remaining to us  ah that is real wisdom declared the shaggy man approvingly after we become really unhappy we shall regret these few hours that are left to us unless we enjoy them to the utmost  nevertheless said the scarecrow i shall go with you to the emerald city and offer ozma my services  she says we can do nothing to oppose our enemies announced the tin woodman  and doubtless she is right sir answered the scarecrow  still she will appreciate our sympathy and it is the duty of ozmas friends to stand by her side when the final disaster occurs  he then led them into his queer mansion and showed them the beautiful rooms in all the five stories  the lower room was a grand reception hall with a handorgan in one corner  this instrument the scarecrow when alone could turn to amuse himself as he was very fond of music the walls were hung with white silk upon which flocks of black crows were embroidered in black diamonds  some of the chairs were made in the shape of big crows and upholstered with cushions of corncolored silk  the second story contained a fine banquet room where the scarecrow might entertain his guests and the three stories above that were bedchambers exquisitely furnished and decorated  from these rooms said the scarecrow proudly one may obtain fine views of the surrounding cornfields  the corn i grow is always husky and i call the ears my regiments because they have so many kernels of course i cannot ride my cobs but i really dont care shucks about that  taken altogether my farm will stack up with any in the neighborhood  the visitors partook of some light refreshment and then hurried away to resume the road to the emerald city  the scarecrow found a seat in the wagon between omby amby and the shaggy man and his weight did not add much to the load because he was stuffed with straw  you will notice i have one oatfield on my property he remarked as they drove away  oatstraw is i have found the best of all straws to restuff myself with when my interior gets musty or out of shape  are you able to restuff yourself without help asked aunt em  i should think that after the straw was taken out of you there wouldnt be anything left but your clothes  you are almost correct madam he answered  my servants do the stuffing under my direction  for my head in which are my excellent brains is a bag tied at the bottom  my face is neatly painted upon one side of the bag as you may see  my head does not need restuffing as my body does for all that it requires is to have the face touched up with fresh paint occasionally  it was not far from the scarecrows mansion to the farm of jack pumpkinhead and when they arrived there both uncle henry and aunt em were much impressed  the farm was one vast pumpkin field and some of the pumpkins were of enormous size  in one of them which had been neatly hollowed out jack himself lived and he declared that it was a very comfortable residence  the reason he grew so many pumpkins was in order that he might change his head as often as it became wrinkled or threatened to spoil  the pumpkinheaded man welcomed his visitors joyfully and offered them several delicious pumpkin pies to eat  i dont indulge in pumpkin pies myself for two reasons he said one reason is that were i to eat pumpkins i would become a cannibal and the other reason is that i never eat not being hollow inside  very good reasons agreed the scarecrow  they told jack pumpkinhead of the dreadful news about the nome king and he decided to go with them to the emerald city and help comfort ozma  i had expected to live here in ease and comfort for many centuries said jack dolefully but of course if the nome king destroys everything in oz i shall be destroyed too  really it seems too bad doesnt it  they were soon on their journey again and so swiftly did the sawhorse draw the wagon over the smooth roads that before twilight fell they had reached the royal palace in the emerald city and were at their journeys end    26  how ozma refused to fight for her kingdom  ozma was in her rose garden picking a bouquet when the party arrived and she greeted all her old and new friends as smilingly and sweetly as ever  dorothys eyes were full of tears as she kissed the lovely ruler of oz and she whispered to her  oh ozma ozma  im so sorry  ozma seemed surprised  sorry for what dorothy she asked  for all your trouble about the nome king was the reply  ozma laughed with genuine amusement  why that has not troubled me a bit dear princess she replied then looking around at the sad faces of her friends she added have you all been worrying about this tunnel  we have they exclaimed in a chorus  well perhaps it is more serious than i imagined admitted the fair ruler but i havent given the matter much thought  after dinner we will all meet together and talk it over  so they went to their rooms and prepared for dinner and dorothy dressed herself in her prettiest gown and put on her coronet for she thought that this might be the last time she would ever appear as a princess of oz  the scarecrow the tin woodman and jack pumpkinhead all sat at the dinner table although none of them was made so he could eat  usually they served to enliven the meal with their merry talk but tonight all seemed strangely silent and uneasy  as soon as the dinner was finished ozma led the company to her own private room in which hung the magic picture  when they had seated themselves the scarecrow was the first to speak  is the nome kings tunnel finished ozma he asked  it was completed today she replied  they have built it right under my palace grounds and it ends in front of the forbidden fountain  nothing but a crust of earth remains to separate our enemies from us and when they march here they will easily break through this crust and rush upon us  who will assist the nome king inquired the scarecrow  the whimsies the growleywogs and the phanfasms she replied  i watched today in my magic picture the messengers whom the nome king sent to all these people to summon them to assemble in his great caverns  let us see what they are doing now suggested the tin woodman  so ozma wished to see the nome kings cavern and at once the landscape faded from the magic picture and was replaced by the scene then being enacted in the jeweled cavern of king roquat  a wild and startling scene it was which the oz people beheld  before the nome king stood the chief of the whimsies and the grand gallipoot of the growleywogs surrounded by their most skillful generals  very fierce and powerful they looked so that even the nome king and general guph who stood beside his master seemed a bit fearful in the presence of their allies  now a still more formidable creature entered the cavern  it was the first and foremost of the phanfasms and he proudly sat down in king roquats own throne and demanded the right to lead his forces through the tunnel in advance of all the others  the first and foremost now appeared to all eyes in his hairy skin and the bears head  what his real form was even roquat did not know  through the arches leading into the vast series of caverns that lay beyond the throne room of king roquat could be seen ranks upon ranks of the invadersthousands of phanfasms growleywogs and whimsies standing in serried lines while behind them were massed the thousands upon thousands of general guphs own army of nomes  listen whispered ozma  i think we can hear what they are saying  so they kept still and listened  is all ready demanded the first and foremost haughtily  the tunnel is finally completed replied general guph  how long will it take us to march to the emerald city asked the grand gallipoot of the growleywogs  if we start at midnight replied the nome king we shall arrive at the emerald city by daybreak  then while all the oz people are sleeping we will capture them and make them our slaves  after that we will destroy the city itself and march through the land of oz burning and devastating as we go  good cried the first and foremost  when we get through with oz it will be a desert wilderness  ozma shall be my slave  she shall be my slave shouted the grand gallipoot angrily  well decide that by and by said king roquat hastily  dont let us quarrel now friends  first let us conquer oz and then we will divide the spoils of war in a satisfactory manner  the first and foremost smiled wickedly but he only said  i and my phanfasms go first for nothing on earth can oppose our power  they all agreed to that knowing the phanfasms to be the mightiest of the combined forces  king roquat now invited them to attend a banquet he had prepared where they might occupy themselves in eating and drinking until midnight arrived  as they had now seen and heard all of the plot against them that they cared to ozma allowed her magic picture to fade away  then she turned to her friends and said  our enemies will be here sooner than i expected  what do you advise me to do  it is now too late to assemble our people said the tin woodman despondently  if you had allowed me to arm and drill my winkies we might have put up a good fight and destroyed many of our enemies before we were conquered  the munchkins are good fighters too said omby amby and so are the gillikins  but i do not wish to fight declared ozma firmly  no one has the right to destroy any living creatures however evil they may be or to hurt them or make them unhappy  i will not fight even to save my kingdom  the nome king is not so particular remarked the scarecrow  he intends to destroy us all and ruin our beautiful country  because the nome king intends to do evil is no excuse for my doing the same replied ozma  selfpreservation is the first law of nature quoted the shaggy man  true she said readily  i would like to discover a plan to save ourselves without fighting  that seemed a hopeless task to them but realizing that ozma was determined not to fight they tried to think of some means that might promise escape  couldnt we bribe our enemies by giving them a lot of emeralds and gold asked jack pumpkinhead  no because they believe they are able to take everything we have replied the ruler  i have thought of something said dorothy  what is it dear asked ozma  let us use the magic belt to wish all of us in kansas  we will put some emeralds in our pockets and can sell them in topeka for enough to pay off the mortgage on uncle henrys farm  then we can all live together and be happy  a clever idea exclaimed the scarecrow  kansas is a very good country  ive been there said the shaggy man  that seems to me an excellent plan approved the tin woodman  no said ozma decidedly  never will i desert my people and leave them to so cruel a fate  i will use the magic belt to send the rest of you to kansas if you wish but if my beloved country must be destroyed and my people enslaved i will remain and share their fate  quite right asserted the scarecrow sighing  i will remain with you  and so will i declared the tin woodman and the shaggy man and jack pumpkinhead in turn  tiktok the machine man also said he intended to stand by ozma  for said he i should be of no use at all in kansas  for my part announced dorothy gravely if the ruler of oz must not desert her people a princess of oz has no right to run away either im willing to become a slave with the rest of you so all we can do with the magic belt is to use it to send uncle henry and aunt em back to kansas  ive been a slave all my life aunt em replied with considerable cheerfulness and so has henry  i guess we wont go back to kansas anyway  id rather take my chances with the rest of you  ozma smiled upon them all gratefully  there is no need to despair just yet she said  ill get up early tomorrow morning and be at the forbidden fountain when the fierce warriors break through the crust of the earth  i will speak to them pleasantly and perhaps they wont be so very bad after all  why do they call it the forbidden fountain asked dorothy thoughtfully  dont you know dear returned ozma surprised  no said dorothy  of course ive seen the fountain in the palace grounds ever since i first came to oz and ive read the sign which says all persons are forbidden to drink at this fountain  but i never knew why they were forbidden  the water seems clear and sparkling and it bubbles up in a golden basin all the time  that water declared ozma gravely is the most dangerous thing in all the land of oz  it is the water of oblivion  what does that mean asked dorothy  whoever drinks at the forbidden fountain at once forgets everything he has ever known ozma asserted  it wouldnt be a bad way to forget our troubles suggested uncle henry  that is true but you would forget everything else and become as ignorant as a baby returned ozma  does it make one crazy asked dorothy  no it only makes one forget replied the girl ruler  it is said that oncelong long agoa wicked king ruled oz and made himself and all his people very miserable and unhappy  so glinda the good sorceress placed this fountain here and the king drank of its water and forgot all his wickedness  his mind became innocent and vacant and when he learned the things of life again they were all good things but the people remembered how wicked their king had been and were still afraid of him  therefore he made them all drink of the water of oblivion and forget everything they had known so that they became as simple and innocent as their king  after that they all grew wise together and their wisdom was good so that peace and happiness reigned in the land  but for fear some one might drink of the water again and in an instant forget all he had learned the king put that sign upon the fountain where it has remained for many centuries up to this very day  they had all listened intently to ozmas story and when she finished speaking there was a long period of silence while all thought upon the curious magical power of the water of oblivion  finally the scarecrows painted face took on a broad smile that stretched the cloth as far as it would go  how thankful i am he said that i have such an excellent assortment of brains  i gave you the best brains i ever mixed declared the wizard with an air of pride  you did indeed agreed the scarecrow and they work so splendidly that they have found a way to save ozto save us all  im glad to hear that said the wizard  we never needed saving more than we do just now  do you mean to say you can save us from those awful phanfasms and growleywogs and whimsies asked dorothy eagerly  im sure of it my dear asserted the scarecrow still smiling genially  tell us how cried the tin woodman  not now said the scarecrow  you may all go to bed and i advise you to forget your worries just as completely as if you had drunk of the water of oblivion in the forbidden fountain  im going to stay here and tell my plan to ozma alone but if you will all be at the forbidden fountain at daybreak youll see how easily we will save the kingdom when our enemies break through the crust of earth and come from the tunnel  so they went away and let the scarecrow and ozma alone but dorothy could not sleep a wink all night  he is only a scarecrow she said to herself and im not sure that his mixed brains are as clever as he thinks they are  but she knew that if the scarecrows plan failed they were all lost so she tried to have faith in him    27  how the fierce warriors invaded oz  the nome king and his terrible allies sat at the banquet table until midnight  there was much quarreling between the growleywogs and phanfasms and one of the weeheaded whimsies got angry at general guph and choked him until he nearly stopped breathing  yet no one was seriously hurt and the nome king felt much relieved when the clock struck twelve and they all sprang up and seized their weapons  aha shouted the first and foremost  now to conquer the land of oz  he marshaled his phanfasms in battle array and at his word of command they marched into the tunnel and began the long journey through it to the emerald city  the first and foremost intended to take all the treasures of oz for himself to kill all who could be killed and enslave the rest to destroy and lay waste the whole country and afterward to conquer and enslave the nomes the growleywogs and the whimsies  and he knew his power was sufficient to enable him to do all these things easily  next marched into the tunnel the army of gigantic growleywogs with their grand gallipoot at their head  they were dreadful beings indeed and longed to get to oz that they might begin to pilfer and destroy  the grand gallipoot was a little afraid of the first and foremost but had a cunning plan to murder or destroy that powerful being and secure the wealth of oz for himself  mighty little of the plunder would the nome king get thought the grand gallipoot  the chief of the whimsies now marched his falseheaded forces into the tunnel  in his wicked little head was a plot to destroy both the first and foremost and the grand gallipoot  he intended to let them conquer oz since they insisted on going first but he would afterward treacherously destroy them as well as king roquat and keep all the slaves and treasure of ozmas kingdom for himself  after all his dangerous allies had marched into the tunnel the nome king and general guph started to follow them at the head of fifty thousand nomes all fully armed  guph said the king those creatures ahead of us mean mischief they intend to get everything for themselves and leave us nothing  i know replied the general but they are not as clever as they think they are  when you get the magic belt you must at once wish the whimsies and growleywogs and phanfasms all back into their own countriesand the belt will surely take them there  good cried the king  an excellent plan guph  ill do it  while they are conquering oz ill get the magic belt and then only the nomes will remain to ravage the country  so you see there was only one thing that all were agreed uponthat oz should be destroyed  on on on the vast ranks of invaders marched filling the tunnel from side to side  with a steady tramp tramp they advanced every step taking them nearer to the beautiful emerald city  nothing can save the land of oz thought the first and foremost scowling until his bear face was as black as the tunnel  the emerald city is as good as destroyed already muttered the grand gallipoot shaking his war club fiercely  in a few hours oz will be a desert said the chief of the whimsies with an evil laugh  my dear guph remarked the nome king to his general at last my vengeance upon ozma of oz and her people is about to be accomplished  you are right declared the general  ozma is surely lost  and now the first and foremost who was in advance and nearing the emerald city began to cough and to sneeze  this tunnel is terribly dusty he growled angrily  ill punish that nome king for not having it swept clean  my throat and eyes are getting full of dust and im as thirsty as a fish  the grand gallipoot was coughing too and his throat was parched and dry  what a dusty place he cried  ill be glad when we reach oz where we can get a drink  who has any water asked the whimsie chief gasping and choking  but none of his followers carried a drop of water so he hastened on to get through the dusty tunnel to the land of oz  where did all this dust come from demanded general guph trying hard to swallow but finding his throat so dry he couldnt  i dont know answered the nome king  ive been in the tunnel every day while it was being built but i never noticed any dust before  lets hurry cried the general  id give half the gold in oz for a drink of water  the dust grew thicker and thicker and the throats and eyes and noses of the invaders were filled with it  but not one halted or turned back  they hurried forward more fierce and vengeful than ever    28  how they drank at the forbidden fountain  the scarecrow had no need to sleep neither had the tin woodman or tiktok or jack pumpkinhead  so they all wandered out into the palace grounds and stood beside the sparkling water of the forbidden fountain until daybreak  during this time they indulged in occasional conversation  nothing could make me forget what i know remarked the scarecrow gazing into the fountain for i cannot drink the water of oblivion or water of any kind  and i am glad that this is so for i consider my wisdom unexcelled  you are certainly very wise agreed tiktok  for my part i can only think by machinery so i do not pretend to know as much as you do  my tin brains are very bright but that is all i claim for them said nick chopper modestly  yet i do not aspire to being very wise for i have noticed that the happiest people are those who do not let their brains oppress them  mine never worry me jack pumpkinhead acknowledged  there are many seeds of thought in my head but they do not sprout easily  i am glad that it is so for if i occupied my days in thinking i should have no time for anything else  in this cheery mood they passed the hours until the first golden streaks of dawn appeared in the sky  then ozma joined them as fresh and lovely as ever and robed in one of her prettiest gowns  our enemies have not yet arrived said the scarecrow after greeting affectionately the sweet and girlish ruler  they will soon be here she said for i have just glanced at my magic picture and have seen them coughing and choking with the dust in the tunnel  oh is there dust in the tunnel asked the tin woodman  yes ozma placed it there by means of the magic belt explained the scarecrow with one of his broad smiles  then dorothy came to them uncle henry and aunt em following close after her  the little girls eyes were heavy because she had had a sleepless and anxious night  toto walked by her side but the little dogs spirits were very much subdued  billina who was always up by daybreak was not long in joining the group by the fountain  the wizard and the shaggy man next arrived and soon after appeared omby amby dressed in his best uniform  there lies the tunnel said ozma pointing to a part of the ground just before the forbidden fountain and in a few moments the dreadful invaders will break through the earth and swarm over the land  let us all stand on the other side of the fountain and watch to see what happens  at once they followed her suggestion and moved around the fountain of the water of oblivion  there they stood silent and expectant until the earth beyond gave way with a sudden crash and up leaped the powerful form of the first and foremost followed by all his grim warriors  as the leader sprang forward his gleaming eyes caught the play of the fountain and he rushed toward it and drank eagerly of the sparkling water  many of the other phanfasms drank too in order to clear their dry and dusty throats  then they stood around and looked at one another with simple wondering smiles  the first and foremost saw ozma and her companions beyond the fountain but instead of making an effort to capture her he merely stared at her in pleased admiration of her beautyfor he had forgotten where he was and why he had come there  but now the grand gallipoot arrived rushing from the tunnel with a hoarse cry of mingled rage and thirst  he too saw the fountain and hastened to drink of its forbidden waters  the other growleywogs were not slow to follow suit and even before they had finished drinking the chief of the whimsies and his people came to push them away while they one and all cast off their false heads that they might slake their thirst at the fountain  when the nome king and general guph arrived they both made a dash to drink but the general was so mad with thirst that he knocked his king over and while roquat lay sprawling upon the ground the general drank heartily of the water of oblivion  this rude act of his general made the nome king so angry that for a moment he forgot he was thirsty and rose to his feet to glare upon the group of terrible warriors he had brought here to assist him  he saw ozma and her people too and yelled out  why dont you capture them  why dont you conquer oz you idiots why do you stand there like a lot of dummies  but the great warriors had become like little children  they had forgotten all their enmity against ozma and against oz  they had even forgotten who they themselves were or why they were in this strange and beautiful country  as for the nome king they did not recognize him and wondered who he was  the sun came up and sent its flood of silver rays to light the faces of the invaders  the frowns and scowls and evil looks were all gone even the most monstrous of the creatures there assembled smiled innocently and seemed lighthearted and content merely to be alive  not so with roquat the nome king  he had not drunk from the forbidden fountain and all his former rage against ozma and dorothy now inflamed him as fiercely as ever  the sight of general guph babbling like a happy child and playing with his hands in the cool waters of the fountain astonished and maddened red roquat  seeing that his terrible allies and his own general refused to act the nome king turned to order his great army of nomes to advance from the tunnel and seize the helpless oz people  but the scarecrow suspected what was in the kings mind and spoke a word to the tin woodman  together they ran at roquat and grabbing him up tossed him into the great basin of the fountain  the nome kings body was round as a ball and it bobbed up and down in the water of oblivion while he spluttered and screamed with fear lest he should drown  and when he cried out his mouth filled with water which ran down his throat so that straightway he forgot all he had formerly known just as completely as had all the other invaders  ozma and dorothy could not refrain from laughing to see their dreaded enemies become as harmless as babies  there was no danger now that oz would be destroyed  the only question remaining to solve was how to get rid of this horde of intruders  the shaggy man kindly pulled the nome king out of the fountain and set him upon his thin legs  roquat was dripping wet but he chattered and laughed and wanted to drink more of the water  no thought of injuring any person was now in his mind  before he left the tunnel he had commanded his fifty thousand nomes to remain there until he ordered them to advance as he wished to give his allies time to conquer oz before he appeared with his own army  ozma did not wish all these nomes to overrun her land so she advanced to king roquat and taking his hand in her own said gently  who are you  what is your name  i dont know he replied smiling at her  who are you my dear  my name is ozma she said and your name is roquat  oh is it he replied seeming pleased  yes you are king of the nomes she said  ah i wonder what the nomes are returned the king as if puzzled  they are underground elves and that tunnel over there is full of them she answered  you have a beautiful cavern at the other end of the tunnel so you must go to your nomes and say march home  then follow after them and in time you will reach the pretty cavern where you live  the nome king was much pleased to learn this for he had forgotten he had a cavern  so he went to the tunnel and said to his army march home  at once the nomes turned and marched back through the tunnel and the king followed after them laughing with delight to find his orders so readily obeyed  the wizard went to general guph who was trying to count his fingers and told him to follow the nome king who was his master  guph meekly obeyed and so all the nomes quitted the land of oz forever  but there were still the phanfasms and whimsies and growleywogs standing around in groups and they were so many that they filled the gardens and trampled upon the flowers and grass because they did not know that the tender plants would be injured by their clumsy feet  but in all other respects they were perfectly harmless and played together like children or gazed with pleasure upon the pretty sights of the royal gardens  after counseling with the scarecrow ozma sent omby amby to the palace for the magic belt and when the captain general returned with it the ruler of oz at once clasped the precious belt around her waist  i wish all these strange peoplethe whimsies and the growleywogs and the phanfasmssafe back in their own homes she said  it all happened in a twinkling for of course the wish was no sooner spoken than it was granted  all the hosts of the invaders were gone and only the trampled grass showed that they had ever been in the land of oz    29  how glinda worked a magic spell  that was better than fighting said ozma when all our friends were assembled in the palace after the exciting events of the morning and each and every one agreed with her  no one was hurt said the wizard delightedly  and no one hurt us added aunt em  but best of all said dorothy the wicked people have all forgotten their wickedness and will not wish to hurt any one after this  true princess declared the shaggy man  it seems to me that to have reformed all those evil characters is more important than to have saved oz  nevertheless remarked the scarecrow i am glad oz is saved  i can now go back to my new mansion and live happily  and i am glad and grateful that my pumpkin farm is saved said jack  for my part added the tin woodman i cannot express my joy that my lovely tin castle is not to be demolished by wicked enemies  still said tiktok other enemies may come to oz some day  why do you allow your clockwork brains to interrupt our joy asked omby amby frowning at the machine man  i say what i am wound up to say answered tiktok  and you are right declared ozma  i myself have been thinking of this very idea and it seems to me there are entirely too many ways for people to get to the land of oz  we used to think the deadly desert that surrounds us was enough protection but that is no longer the case  the wizard and dorothy have both come here through the air and i am told the earth people have invented airships that can fly anywhere they wish them to go  why sometimes they do and sometimes they dont asserted dorothy  but in time the airships may cause us trouble continued ozma for if the earth folk learn how to manage them we would be overrun with visitors who would ruin our lovely secluded fairyland  that is true enough agreed the wizard  also the desert fails to protect us in other ways ozma went on thoughtfully  johnny dooit once made a sandboat that sailed across it and the nome king made a tunnel under it  so i believe something ought to be done to cut us off from the rest of the world entirely so that no one in the future will ever be able to intrude upon us  how will you do that asked the scarecrow  i do not know but in some way i am sure it can be accomplished tomorrow i will make a journey to the castle of glinda the good and ask her advice  may i go with you asked dorothy eagerly  of course my dear princess and i also invite any of our friends here who would like to undertake the journey  they all declared they wished to accompany their girl ruler for this was indeed an important mission since the future of the land of oz to a great extent depended upon it  so ozma gave orders to her servants to prepare for the journey on the morrow  that day she watched her magic picture and when it showed her that all the nomes had returned through the tunnel to their underground caverns ozma used the magic belt to close up the tunnel so that the earth underneath the desert sands became as solid as it was before the nomes began to dig  early the following morning a gay cavalcade set out to visit the famous sorceress glinda the good  ozma and dorothy rode in a chariot drawn by the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger while the sawhorse drew the red wagon in which rode the rest of the party  with hearts light and free from care they traveled merrily along through the lovely and fascinating land of oz and in good season reached the stately castle in which resided the sorceress  glinda knew that they were coming  i have been reading about you in my magic book she said as she greeted them in her gracious way  what is your magic book like inquired aunt em curiously  it is a record of everything that happens replied the sorceress as soon as an event takes place anywhere in the world it is immediately found printed in my magic book  so when i read its pages i am well informed  did it tell you how our enemies drank the water of blivion asked dorothy  yes my dear it told all about it  and also it told me you were all coming to my castle and why  then said ozma i suppose you know what is in my mind and that i am seeking a way to prevent any one in the future from discovering the land of oz  yes i know that  and while you were on your journey i have thought of a way to accomplish your desire  for it seems to me unwise to allow too many outside people to come here  dorothy with her uncle and aunt has now returned to oz to live always and there is no reason why we should leave any way open for others to travel uninvited to our fairyland  let us make it impossible for any one ever to communicate with us in any way after this  then we may live peacefully and contentedly  your advice is wise returned ozma  i thank you glinda for your promise to assist me  but how can you do it asked dorothy  how can you keep every one from ever finding oz  by making our country invisible to all eyes but our own replied the sorceress smiling  i have a magic charm powerful enough to accomplish that wonderful feat and now that we have been warned of our danger by the nome kings invasion i believe we must not hesitate to separate ourselves forever from all the rest of the world  i agree with you said the ruler of oz  wont it make any difference to us asked dorothy doubtfully  no my dear glinda answered assuringly  we shall still be able to see each other and everything in the land of oz  it wont affect us at all but those who fly through the air over our country will look down and see nothing at all  those who come to the edge of the desert or try to cross it will catch no glimpse of oz or know in what direction it lies  no one will try to tunnel to us again because we cannot be seen and therefore cannot be found  in other words the land of oz will entirely disappear from the knowledge of the rest of the world  thats all right said dorothy cheerfully  you may make oz invisble as soon as you please for all i care  it is already invisible glinda stated  i knew ozmas wishes and performed the magic spell before you arrived  ozma seized the hand of the sorceress and pressed it gratefully  thank you she said    30  how the story of oz came to an end  the writer of these oz stories has received a little note from princess dorothy of oz which for a time has made him feel rather disconcerted the note was written on a broad white feather from a storks wing and it said   you will never hear anything more about oz because we are now cut off forever from all the rest of the world  but toto and i will always love you and all the other children who love us  dorothy gale   this seemed to me too bad at first for oz is a very interesting fairyland  still we have no right to feel grieved for we have had enough of the history of the land of oz to fill six story books and from its quaint people and their strange adventures we have been able to learn many useful and amusing things  so good luck to little dorothy and her companions  may they live long in their invisible country and be very happy
