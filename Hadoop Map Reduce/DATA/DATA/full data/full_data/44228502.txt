44228502	captains all  by ww jacobs    the white cat  illustration the white cat  the traveller stood looking from the taproom window of the cauliflower at the falling rain  the village street below was empty and everything was quiet with the exception of the garrulous old man smoking with much enjoyment on the settle behind him  itll do a power o good said the ancient craning his neck round the edge of the settle and turning a bleared eye on the window  i aint like some folk i never did mind a drop o rain  the traveller grunted and returning to the settle opposite the old man fell to lazily stroking a cat which had strolled in attracted by the warmth of the small fire which smouldered in the grate  hes a good mouser said the old man but i expect that smith the landlord would sell im to anybody for arf a crown but we ad a cat in claybury once that you couldnt ha bought for a hundred golden sovereigns  the traveller continued to caress the cat  a white cat with one yaller eye and one blue one continued the old man  it sounds queer but its as true as i sit ere wishing that i ad another mug o ale as good as the last you gave me  the traveller with a start that upset the cats nerves finished his own mug and then ordered both to be refilled  he stirred the fire into a blaze and lighting his pipe and putting one foot on to the hob prepared to listen  it used to belong to old man clark young joe clarks uncle said the ancient smacking his lips delicately over the ale and extending a tremulous claw to the tobaccopouch pushed towards him and he was never tired of showing it off to people  he used to call it is blueeyed darling and the fuss e made o that cat was sinful  young joe clark couldnt bear it but being down in is uncles will for five cottages and a bit o land bringing in about forty pounds a year he ad to ide his feelings and pretend as he loved it  he used to take it little drops o cream and titbits o meat and old clark was so pleased that e promised im that he should ave the cat along with all the other property when e was dead  young joe said he couldnt thank im enough and the old man who ad been ailing a long time made im come up every day to teach im ow to take care of it arter he was gone  he taught joe ow to cook its meat and then chop it up fine ow it liked a clean saucer every time for its milk and ow he wasnt to make a noise when it was asleep  take care your children dont worry it joe he ses one day very sharp  one o your boys was pulling its tail this morning and i want you to clump his ead for im  which one was it ses joe  the slobberynosed one ses old clark  ill give im a clout as soon as i get ome ses joe who was very fond of is children  go and fetch im and do it ere ses the old man thatll teach im to love animals  joe went off ome to fetch the boy and arter his mother ad washed his face and wiped his nose an put a clean pinneyfore on im he took im to is uncles and clouted his ead for im  arter that joe and is wife ad words all night long and next morning old clark coming in from the garden was just in time to see im kick the cat right acrost the kitchen  he could ardly speak for a minute and when e could joe see plain wot a fool hed been  fust of all e called joe every name he could think of which took im a long timeand then he ordered im out of is house  you shall ave my money wen your betters have done with it he ses and not afore  thats all youve done for yourself  joe clark didnt know wot he meant at the time but when old clark died three months arterwards e found out  his uncle ad made a new will and left everything to old george barstow for as long as the cat lived providing that he took care of it  when the cat was dead the property was to go to joe  the cat was only two years old at the time and george barstow who was arf crazy with joy said it shouldnt be is fault if it didnt live another twenty years  the funny thing was the quiet way joe clark took it  he didnt seem to be at all cut up about it and when henery walker said it was a shame e said he didnt mind and that george barstow was a old man and he was quite welcome to ave the property as long as the cat lived  it must come to me by the time im an old man he ses ard thats all i care about  henery walker went off and as e passed the cottage where old clark used to live and which george barstow ad moved into e spoke to the old man over the palings and told im wot joe clark ad said  george barstow only grunted and went on stooping and prying over is front garden  bin and lost something ses henery walker watching im  no im finding ses george barstow very fierce and picking up something  thats the fifth bit o powdered liver ive found in my garden this morning  henery walker went off whistling and the opinion hed ad o joe clark began to improve  he spoke to joe about it that arternoon and joe said that if e ever accused im o such a thing again hed knock is ead off  he said that he oped the cat ud live to be a hundred and that ed no more think of giving it poisoned meat than henery walker would of paying for is drink so long as e could get anybody else to do it for im  they ad bets up at this ere cauliflower publicouse that evening as to ow long that cat ud live  nobody gave it more than a month and bill chambers sat and thought o so many ways o killing it on the sly that it was wunnerful to hear im  george barstow took fright when he eard of them and the care e took o that cat was wunnerful to behold  arf its time it was shut up in the back bedroom and the other arf george barstow was fussing arter it till that cat got to hate im like pison  instead o giving up work as hed thought to do e told henery walker that ed never worked so ard in his life  wot about fresh air and exercise for it ses henery  wot about joe clark ses george barstow  im tied and and foot  i dursent leave the house for a moment  i aint been to the cauliflower since ive ad it and three times i got out o bed last night to see if it was safe  mark my words ses henery walker if that cat dont ave exercise youll lose it  i shall lose it if it does ave exercise ses george barstow that i know  he sat down thinking arter henery walker ad gone and then he ad a little collar and chain made for it and took it out for a walk  pretty nearly every dog in claybury went with em and the cat was in such a state o mind afore they got ome he couldnt do anything with it  it ad a fit as soon as they got indoors and george barstow who ad read about childrens fits in the almanac gave it a warm bath  it brought it round immediate and then it began to tear round the room and up and downstairs till george barstow was afraid to go near it  illustration he ad a little collar and chain made for it and took it out for a walk  it was so bad that evening sneezing that george barstow sent for bill chambers whod got a good name for doctoring animals and asked im to give it something  bill said hed got some powders at ome that would cure it at once and he went and fetched em and mixed one up with a bit o butter  thats the way to give a cat medicine he ses smear it with the butter and then itll lick it off powder and all  he was just going to rub it on the cat when george barstow caught old of is arm and stopped im  how do i know it aint pison he ses  youre a friend o joe clarks and for all i know he may ha paid you to pison it  i wouldnt do such a thing ses bill  you ought to know me better than that  all right ses george barstow you eat it then and ill give you two shillings in stead o one  you can easy mix some more  not me ses bill chambers making a face  well three shillings then ses george barstow getting more and more suspicious like four shillingsfive shillings  bill chambers shook his ead and george barstow more and more certain that he ad caught im trying to kill is cat and that e wouldnt eat the stuff rose im up to ten shillings  bill looked at the butter and then e looked at the ten shillings on the table and at last he shut is eyes and gulped it down and put the money in is pocket  you see i ave to be careful bill ses george barstow rather upset  bill chambers didnt answer im  he sat there as white as a sheet and making such extraordinary faces that george was arf afraid of im  anything wrong bill he ses at last  bill sat staring at im and then all of a sudden he clapped is andkerchief to is mouth and getting up from his chair opened the door and rushed out  george barstow thought at fust that he ad eaten pison for the sake o the ten shillings but when e remembered that bill chambers ad got the most delikit stummick in claybury he altered is mind  the cat was better next morning but george barstow had ad such a fright about it e wouldnt let it go out of is sight and joe clark began to think that e would ave to wait longer for that property than e had thought arter all  to ear im talk anybodyd ha thought that e loved that cat  we didnt pay much attention to it up at the cauliflower ere except maybe to wink at ima thing he couldnt a bearbut at ome o course his young uns thought as everything he said was gospel and one day coming ome from work as he was passing george barstows he was paid out for his deceitfulness  ive wronged you joe clark ses george barstow coming to the door and im sorry for it  oh ses joe staring  give that to your little jimmy ses george barstow giving im a shilling  ive give im one but i thought arterwards it wasnt enough  what for ses joe staring at im agin  for bringing my cat ome ses george barstow  ow it got out i cant think but i lost it for three hours and id about given it up when your little jimmy brought it to me in is arms  hes a fine little chap and e does you credit  joe clark tried to speak but he couldnt get a word out and henery walker wot ad just come up and eard wot passed took hold of is arm and helped im home  he walked like a man in a dream but arfway he stopped and cut a stick from the hedge to take ome to little jimmy  he said the boy ad been asking him for a stick for some time but up till then ed always forgotten it  at the end o the fust year that cat was still alive to everybodys surprise but george barstow took such care of it e never let it out of is sight  every time e went out he took it with im in a hamper and to prevent its being pisoned he paid isaac sawyer who ad the biggest family in claybury sixpence a week to let one of is boys taste its milk before it had it  the second year it was ill twice but the horsedoctor that george barstow got for it said that it was as ard as nails and with care it might live to be twenty  he said that it wanted more fresh air and exercise but when he eard ow george barstow come by it he said that praps it would live longer indoors arter all  at last one day when george barstow ad been living on the fat o the land for nearly three years that cat got out agin  george ad raised the frontroom winder two or three inches to throw something outside and afore he knew wot was appening the cat was outside and going up the road about twenty miles an hour  george barstow went arter it but he might as well ha tried to catch the wind  the cat was arf wild with joy at getting out agin and he couldnt get within arf a mile of it  he stayed out all day without food or drink follering it about until it came on dark and then o course he lost sight of it and hoping against ope that it would come home for its food he went ome and waited for it  he sat up all night dozing in a chair in the front room with the door left open but it was all no use and arter thinking for a long time wot was best to do he went out and told some o the folks it was lost and offered a reward of five pounds for it  you never saw such a hunt then in all your life  nearly every man woman and child in claybury left their work or school and went to try and earn that five pounds  by the arternoon george barstow made it ten pounds provided the cat was brought ome safe and sound and people as was too old to walk stood at their cottage doors to snap it up as it came by  joe clark was hunting for it igh and low and so was is wife and the boys  in fact i blieve that everybody in claybury excepting the parson and bob pretty was trying to get that ten pounds  o course we could understand the parsonis pride wouldnt let im but a low poaching thieving rascal like bob pretty turning up is nose at ten pounds was more than we could make out  even on the second day when george barstow made it ten pounds down and a shilling a week for a year besides he didnt offer to stir all he did was to try and make fun o them as was looking for it  have you looked everywhere you can think of for it bill he ses to bill chambers  yes i ave ses bill  well then you want to look everywhere else ses bob pretty  i know where i should look if i wanted to find it  why dont you find it then ses bill  cos i dont want to make mischief ses bob pretty  i dont want to be unneighbourly to joe clark by interfering at all  not for all that money ses bill  not for fifty pounds ses bob pretty you ought to know me better than that bill chambers  its my belief that you know more about where that cat is than you ought to ses joe gubbins  you go on looking for it joe ses bob pretty grinning its good exercise for you and youve only lost two days work  ill give you arf a crown if you let me search your ouse bob ses bill chambers looking at im very ard  i couldnt do it at the price bill ses bob pretty shaking his ead im a pore man but im very partikler who i ave come into my ouse  o course everybody left off looking at once when they heard about bob not that they believed that hed be such a fool as to keep the cat in his ouse and that evening as soon as it was dark joe clark went round to see im  dont tell me as that cats found joe ses bob pretty as joe opened the door  not as ive eard of said joe stepping inside  i wanted to speak to you about it the sooner its found the better i shall be pleased  it does you credit joe clark ses bob pretty  its my belief that its dead ses joe looking at im very ard but i want to make sure afore taking over the property  bob pretty looked at im and then he gave a little cough  oh you want it to be found dead he ses  now i wonder whether that cats worth most dead or alive  joe clark coughed then  dead i should think he ses at last george barstows just ad bills printed offering fifteen pounds for it ses bob pretty  ill give that or more when i come into the property ses joe clark  theres nothing like readymoney though is there ses bob  ill promise it to you in writing bob ses joe trembling  theres some things that dont look well in writing joe says bob pretty considering besides why should you promise it to me  o course i meant if you found it ses joe  well ill do my best joe ses bob pretty and none of us can do no more than that can they  they sat talking and argufying over it for over an hour and twice bob pretty got up and said e was going to see whether george barstow wouldnt offer more  by the time they parted they was as thick as thieves and next morning bob pretty was wearing joe clarks watch and chain and mrs pretty was up at joes ouse to see whether there was any of is furniture as she ad a fancy for  she didnt seem to be able to make up er mind at fust between a chest o drawers that ad belonged to joes mother and a grandfather clock  she walked from one to the other for about ten minutes and then bob who ad come in to elp her told er to ave both  youre quite welcome he ses aint she joe  joe clark said yes and arter he ad helped them carry em ome the prettys went back and took the best bedstead to pieces cos bob said as it was easier to carry that way  mrs clark ad to go and sit down at the bottom o the garden with the neck of er dress undone to give herself air but when she saw the little prettys each walking ome with one of er best chairs on their eads she got and walked up and down like a mad thing  im sure i dont know where we are to put it all ses bob pretty to joe gubbins wot was looking on with other folks but joe clark is that generous he wont ear of our leaving anything  has e gorn mad ses bill chambers staring at im  not as i knows on ses bob pretty  its is goodartedness thats all  he feels sure that that

and joe clark ad to go and get clean straw for his wife and children to sleep on not that mrs clark ad any sleep that night nor joe neither  henery walker was the fust to see what it really meant and he went rushing off as fast as e could run to tell george barstow  george couldnt believe im at fust but when e did he swore that if a air of that cats head was harmed ed ave the law o bob pretty and arter henery walker ad gone e walked round to tell im so  youre not yourself george barstow else you wouldnt try and take away my character like that ses bob pretty  wot did joe clark give you all them things for ses george pointing to the furniture  took a fancy to me i spose ses bob  people do sometimes  theres something about me at times that makes em like me  he gave em to you to kill my

pounds like that made im think that joe clark ad promised to pay im more if the cat was dead and at last arter worrying about it for a couple o hours e came up to this ere cauliflower and offered bob

and down with his ands in is pockets looking over garden fences and calling puss  he asked everybody e see whether they ad seen a white cat with one blue eye and one yaller one and every time e came into the cauliflower he put his ead over the bar and called puss cos as e said it was as likely to be there as anywhere else  it was about a week after the cat ad disappeared that george barstow was standing at is door talking to joe clark who was saying the cat must be dead and e wanted is property when he sees a man coming up the road carrying a basket stop and speak to bill chambers  just as e got near them an awful miaow come from the basket and george barstow and joe clark started as if theyd been shot  hes found it shouts bill chambers pointing to the man  its been living with me over at

policeman white over from cudford and george barstow signed a paper to pay five shillings a week till the reward was paid  george barstow ad the cat for five years arter that but he never let it get away agin  they got to like each other in time and died within a fortnight of each other so that joe clark got is property arter all
