96969309	personal reminiscences of book making by rm ballantyne 18251894    he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northen canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the lifeboat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  in this book of personal reminiscences the author hearing in the distance the grim reaper is at his most pi  the first few chapters describe the effort he had to make to gain the background information he needed to write the books but suddenly he tells us that he doesnt feel at all well that his time may well be near and he fills out the book with halfa dozen short stories all very moralist but still well up to his usual quality of output  recreated as an etext by nick hodson august 2003    personal reminiscences of book making by rm ballantyne    chapter one  incidents in book makingintroductory  book making is mixed up more or less with difficulties  it is sometimes disappointing often amusing occasionally lucrative frequently expensive and always interestingat least to the maker  of course i do not refer to that sort of book making which is connected with the too prevalent and disgraceful practice of gambling but to the making of literary booksespecially storybooks for the young  for over eightandthirty years i have had the pleasure of making such books and of gathering the material for them in many and distant lands  during that period a considerable number of the juvenile public have accepted me as one of their guides in the world of fiction and through many scenes in the wildest and most outoftheway regions of our wonderful world  surely then it is not presumptuous in me to supposeat least to hopethat a rambling account of some of the curious incidents which have occurred now and then in connection with my book making will interest the young people of the present day  indeed i entertain a hope that some even of the old boys and girls who condescended to follow me in the days gone by may perchance derive some amusement if not profit from a perusal of these reminiscences  the shadows of life are lengthening and for me that night in which no man can work may not be far off  before it is too late and while yet the flame of the lamp burns with sufficient clearness i would fain have a personal chat with those for whom by gods blessing i have been permitted to cater so long  but fear not dear reader that i shall inflict on you a complete autobiography  it is only the great ones of the earth who are entitled to claim attention to the record of birth and parentage and schooldays etcetera  to trace my ancestry back through the conquerors to adam would be presumptuous as well as impossible  nevertheless for the sake of aspirants to literary fame it may be worth while to tell here how one of the rank and file of the moderately successful brotherhood was led to authorship as a profession and how he followed it out  i say led advisedly because i made no effort whatever to adopt this line of life and never even dreamed of it as a possibility until i was over twentyeight years of age  let me commence then by at once taking a header into the middle of that period when godall unknown to and unrecognised by myselfwas furnishing me with some of the material and weapons for the future battle of life  one day my dear father was reading in the newspapers some account of the discoveries of dease and simpson in the neighbourhood of the famous northwest passage  looking at me over his spectacles with the perplexed air of a man who has an idle son of sixteen to start in the race of life he said  how would you like to go into the service of the hudsons bay company and discover the northwest passageor words to that effect  all right father said ior something of that sort  i was at that age and in that frame of mind which regards difficulties with consummate presumption and profound inexperience  if the discovery of the northpole had been suggested or the southpole or any other terrestrial pole that happened to exist at the time i was quite ready to rush in where even a franklin might fear to tread  this incident was but a slight one yet it was the little hinge on which turned my future career  we had a relationi wont say what because distant relationships especially if complicated are utterly beyond my mental graspwho was high up in the service of the hudsons bay fur company  through iain i became a clerk in the service with a salary of 20 pounds for the first year  having been born without a silver spoon in my mouth i regarded this as an adequate though not a princely provision  in due time i found myself in the heart of that vast north american wilderness which is variously known as ruperts land the territories of the hudsons bay company and the great norwest many hundreds of miles north of the outmost verge of canadian civilisation  i am not learned in the matter of statistics but if a rough guess may be allowed i should say that the population of some of the regions in which i and my few fellowclerks vegetated might have been about fifty to the hundred square mileswith uninhabited regions around  of course we had no libraries magazines or newspapers out there  indeed we had almost no books at all only a stray file or two of american newspapers one of which made me acquainted with some of the works of dickens and of lever  while in those northern wilds i also metas with dear old friendssome stray copies of chamberss edinburgh journal and the penny magazine  we had a mail twice in the yearonce by the hudsons bay ship in summer and once through the trackless wilderness by sledge and snowshoe in winter  it will easily be understood that surroundings of such a nature did not suggest or encourage a literary career  my comrades and i spent the greater part of our time in furtrading with the red indians doing a little officework and in much canoeing boating fishing shooting wishing and skylarking  it was a jolly life no doubt while it lasted but not elevating  we did not drink  happily there was nothing alcoholic to be had out there for love or money  but we smoked more or less consumedly morning noon and night  before breakfast the smoking began after supper it went on far into the night it continued  some of us even went to sleep with the pipes in our mouths and dropped them on our pillows  being of such an immature age i laboured under the not uncommon delusion that to smoke looked manly and therefore did my best to accommodate myself to my surroundings but i failed signally having been gifted with a blessed incapacity for tobaccosmoking  this afflicted me somewhat at the time but ever since i have been unmistakably thankful  but this is wandering  to return  with a winter of eight months duration and temperature sometimes at 50 below zero of fahrenheit little to do and nothing particular to think of time occasionally hung heavy on our hands  with a view to lighten it a little i began to write long and elaborate letters to a loving mother whom i had left behind me in scotland  the fact that these letters could be despatched only twice in the year was immaterial whenever i felt a touch of homesickness and at frequent intervals i got out my sheet of the largestsized narrowruled imperial paperi think it was called imperialand entered into spiritual intercourse with home  to this longletter writing i attribute whatever small amount of facility in composition i may have acquired  yet not the faintest idea of storywriting crossed the clear sky of my unliterary imagination  i am not conscious of having had at that time a love for writing in any formvery much the reverse  of course i passed through a highly romantic period of lifemost youths do soand while in that condition i made a desperate attempt to tackle a poem  most youths do that also  the first two lines ran thus    close by the shores of hudsons bay   where arctic wintersstern and grey  i must have gloated long over this couplet for it was indelibly stamped upon my memory and is as fresh today as when the lines were penned this my first literary effort was carried to somewhere about the middle of the first canto  it stuck therei am thankful to sayand like the smoking never went further  ruperts land at that time was little known and very seldom visited by outsiders  during several years i wandered to and fro in it meeting with a few savages fewer white menservants of the companyand becoming acquainted with modes of life and thought in what has been aptly styled the great lone land  hearing so seldom from or of the outside world things pertaining to it grew dim and shadowy and began to lose interest  in these circumstances if it had not been that i knew full well my mothers soul was ready to receive any amount of outpourings of which i was capable i should have almost forgotten how to use the pen  it was in circumstances such as i have described that i began my first book but it was not a storybook and i had no idea that it would ever become a printed book at all  it was merely a freeandeasy record of personal adventure and everyday life written like all else that i penned solely for the uncritical eye of that longsuffering and too indulgent mother  i had reached the advanced age of twentytwo at the time and had been sent to take charge of an outpost on the uninhabited northern shores of the gulf of saint lawrence named seven islands  it was a dreary desolate littleknown spot at that time  the gulf just opposite the establishment was about fifty miles broad  the ships which passed up and down it were invisible not only on account of distance but because of seven islands at the mouth of the bay coming between them and the outpost  my next neighbour in command of a similar post up the gulf was if i remember rightly about seventy miles distant  the nearest house down the gulf was about eighty miles off and behind us lay the virgin forests with swamps lakes prairies and mountains stretching away without break right across the continent to the pacific ocean  the outpostwhich in virtue of a ships carronade and a flagstaff was occasionally styled a fortconsisted of four wooden buildings  one of thesethe largest with a verandahwas the residency  there was an offshoot in rear which served as a kitchen  the other houses were a store for goods wherewith to carry on trade with the indians a stable and a workshop  the whole population of the establishmentindeed of the surrounding districtconsisted of myself and one manalso a horse the horse occupied the stable i dwelt in the residency the rest of the population lived in the kitchen  there were indeed other five men belonging to the establishment but these did not affect its desolation for they were away netting salmon at a river about twenty miles distant at the time i write of  my fridaywho was a frenchcanadianbeing cook as well as manofallwork found a little occupation in attending to the duties of his office but the unfortunate governor had nothing whatever to do except await the arrival of indians who were not due at that time  the horse was a bad one without a saddle and in possession of a pronounced backbone  my friday was not sociable  i had no books no newspapers no magazines or literature of any kind no game to shoot no boat wherewith to prosecute fishing in the bay and no prospect of seeing any one to speak to for weeks if not months to come  but i had pen and ink and by great good fortune was in possession of a blank paper book fully an inch thick  when two or three years after a printercousin seeing the manuscript offered to print it and the wellknown blackwood of edinburgh seeing the book offered to publish itand did publish itmy ambition was still so absolutely asleep that i did not again put pen to paper in that way for eight years thereafter although i might have been encouraged thereto by the fact that this first booknamed hudsons baybesides being a commercial success received favourable notice from the press  it was not until the year 1854 that my literary path was opened up  at that time i was a partner in the late publishing firm of thomas constable and company of edinburgh  happening one day to meet with the late william nelson publisher i was asked by him how i should like the idea of taking to literature as a profession  my answer i forget  it must have been vague for i had never thought of the subject at all  well said he what would you think of trying to write a story  somewhat amused i replied that i did not know what to think but i would try if he wished me to do so  do so said he and go to work at onceor words to that effect  i went to work at once and wrote my first story or work of fiction it was published in 1855 under the name of snowflakes and sunbeams or the young furtraders  afterwards the first part of the title was dropped and the book is now known as the young furtraders  from that day to this i have lived by making storybooks for young folk  from what i have said it will be seen that i have never aimed at the achieving of this position and i hope that it is not presumptuous in me to thinkand to derive much comfort from the thoughtthat god led me into the particular path along which i have walked for so many years  the scene of my first story was naturally laid in those backwoods with which i was familiar and the story itself was founded on the adventures and experiences of my companions and myself  when a second book was required of me i stuck to the same regions but changed the locality while casting about in my mind for a suitable subject i happened to meet with an old retired norwester who had spent an adventurous life in ruperts land  among other duties he had been sent to establish an outpost of the hudsons bay company at ungava bay one of the most dreary parts of a desolate region  on hearing what i wanted he sat down and wrote a long narrative of his proceedings there which he placed at my disposal and thus furnished me with the foundation of ungava a tale of eskimoland  but now i had reached the end of my tether and when a third story was wanted i was compelled to seek new fields of adventure in the books of travellers  regarding the southern seas as the most romantic part of the worldafter the backwoodsi mentally and spiritually plunged into those warm waters and the dive resulted in the coral island  it now began to be borne in upon me that there was something not quite satisfactory in describing expatiating on and energising in regions which one has never seen  for one thing it was needful to be always carefully on the watch to avoid falling into mistakes geographical topographical naturalhistorical and otherwise  for instance despite the utmost care of which i was capable while studying up for the coral island i fell into a blunder through ignorance in regard to a familiar fruit  i was under the impression that cocoanuts grew on their trees in the same form as that in which they are usually presented to us in grocers windowsnamely about the size of a large fist with three spots suggestive of a monkeys face at one end  learning from trustworthy books that at a certain stage of development the nut contains a delicious beverage like lemonade i sent one of my heroes up a tree for a nut through the shell of which he bored a hole with a penknife and drank the lemonade  it was not till long after the story was published that my own brotherwho had voyaged in southern seaswrote to draw my attention to the fact that the cocoanut is nearly as large as a mans head and its outer husk over an inch thick so that no ordinary penknife could bore to its interior  of course i should have known this and perhaps should be ashamed of my ignorancebut somehow im not  i admit that this was a slip but such and other slips hardly justify the remark that some people have not hesitated to make namely that i have a tendency to draw the long bow  i feel almost sensitive on this point for i have always laboured to be true to fact and to nature even in my wildest flights of fancy  this reminds me of the remark made to myself once by a lady in reference to this same coral island  there is one thing mr ballantyne she said which i really find it hard to believe  you make one of your three boys dive into a clear pool go to the bottom and then turning on his back look up and wink and laugh at the other two  no no peterkin did not laugh said i remonstratively  well then you make him smile  ah that is true but there is a vast difference between laughing and smiling under water  but is it not singular that you should doubt the only incident in the story which i personally verified  i happened to be in lodgings at the seaside while writing that story and after penning the passage you refer to i went down to the shore pulled off my clothes dived to the bottom turned on my back and looking up i smiled and winked  the lady laughed but i have never been quite sure from the tone of that laugh whether it was a laugh of conviction or of unbelief  it is not improbable that my fair friends mental constitution may have been somewhat similar to that of the old woman who declined to believe her sailorgrandson when he told her he had seen flyingfish but at once recognised his veracity when he said he had seen the remains of pharaohs chariotwheels on the shores of the red sea  recognising then the difficulties of my position i formed the resolution always to visitwhen possiblethe scenes in which my stories were laid converse with the people who under modification were to form the dramatis personae of the tales and generally to obtain information in each case as far as lay in my power from the fountainhead  thus when about to begin the lifeboat i went to ramsgate and for some time was hand and glove with jarman the heroic coxswain of the ramsgate boat a lionlike as well as lionhearted man who rescued hundreds of lives from the fatal goodwin sands during his career  in like manner when getting up information for the lighthouse i obtained permission from the commissioners of northern lights to visit the bell rock lighthouse where i hobnobbed with the three keepers of that celebrated pillarinthesea for three weeks and read stevensons graphic account of the building of the structure in the library or visitors room just under the lantern  i was absolutely a prisoner there during those three weeks for boats seldom visited the rock and it need scarcely be said that ships kept well out of our way  by good fortune there came on a pretty stiff gale at the time and stevensons thrilling narrative was read to the tune of whistling winds and roaring seas many of which sent the spray right up to the lantern and caused the building more than once to quiver to its foundation  in order to do justice to fighting the flames i careered through the streets of london on fireengines clad in a peajacket and a black leather helmet of the salvage corpsthis to enable me to pass the cordon of police without questionthough not without recognition as was made apparent to me on one occasion at a fire by a fireman whispering confidentially i know what you are sir youre a hamitoor  right you are said i and moved away in order to change the subject  it was a glorious experience by the way this galloping on fireengines through the crowded streets  it had in it much of the excitement of the chasepossibly that of warwith the noble end in view of saving instead of destroying life  such tearing along at headlong speed such wild roaring of the firemen to clear the way such frantic dashing aside of cabs carts buses and pedestrians such reckless courage on the part of the men and volcanic spoutings on the part of the fires  but i must not linger  the memory of it is too enticing  deep down took me to cornwall where over two hundred fathoms beneath the green turf and more than halfamile out under the bed of the sea i saw the sturdy miners at work winning copper and tin from the solid rock and acquired some knowledge of their life sufferings and toils  in the land of the vikings i shot ptarmigan caught salmon and gathered material for erling the bold  a winter in algiers made me familiar with the pirate city  i enjoyed a fortnight with the hearty inhabitants of the gull lightship off the goodwin sands from which resulted the floating light and went to the cape of good hope and up into the interior of the colony to spy out the land and hold intercourse with the settler and the savagealthough i am bound to confess that with regard to the latter i talked to him only with mine eyes  i also went afloat for a short time with the fishermen of the north sea in order to be able to do justice to the young trawler  to arrive still closer at the truth and to avoid errors i have always endeavoured to submit my proofsheets when possible to experts and men who knew the subject well  thus captain shaw late chief of the london fire brigade kindly read the proofs of fighting the flames and prevented my getting off the rails in matters of detail and sir arthur blackwood financial secretary to the general post office obligingly did me the same favour in regard to post haste  in conclusion there are some things that i shrink from flaunting in the eyes of the public  personal religion is one of these  nevertheless there are a few words which i feel constrained to write before closing this chapter  during all the six years that i spent in ruperts land i was without god  he was around me and within me guarding me bestowing upon me the physical and mental health by which alone i could fully enjoy a life in the wilderness and furnishing me with much of the material that was to serve as my stockintrade during my subsequent career yeti confess it with shamei did not recognise or think of or care for him  it was not until after i had returned home that he opened my eyes to see myself a lost soul and jesus christgod with usan allsufficient redeemer able and willing to save me from sin as he is to save all sinnerseven the chief  more than this i will not say  less i could not say without being unfaithful to my creator    chapter two  life in the bell rock lighthouse  one of my most interesting experiences in hunting up materials for books was at the bell rock lighthouse interesting because of the novelty of the situation the pleasant intercourse with the keepers and the grandeur of the subjects brought under my observation  the lighthouses of this kingdom present in their construction a remarkable evidence of the capacity of man to overcome almost insurmountable difficulties and his marvellous power of adapting means to ends  they also stand forth as a grand army of sentinels who with unobtrusive regularity open their brilliant eyes on the great deep night after nightfrom year to yearfrom age to age and gaze arguslikeall around our shores to guard our shipping from the dangers of the sea perhaps i should rather say from the dangers of the coast for it must be wellknown to most people that the sailor regards blue water as his safe and native home and that it is only when he enters the green and shallow waters of the coast that a measure of anxiety overclouds his freeandeasy spirit  it is when he draws near to port that the chief dangers of his career surround him and it is then that the lighthouse is watched for anxiously and hailed with satisfaction  these observations scarce need confirmatory proof  of all the vessels great and small that annually seek and leave our ports a large proportion meet their doom and despite all our lighthouses beacons and buoys lay their timbers and cargoes in fragments on our shores this is a significant fact for if those lost ships beas they area mere fraction of our commerce how great must be the fleet how vast the wealth that our lighthouses guide safely into port every year  if all our coastlights were to be extinguished for only a single night the loss of property and life would be terrible beyond conception  but such an event can never happen for our coastlights arise each evening at sunset with the regularity of the sun himself  like the stars they burst out when darkness begins to brood upon land and sea like them too their action and aspect are varied  some at great heights in exposed places blaze bright and steady like stars of the first magnitude  others in the form of revolving lights twinkle like the lesser starsnow veiling now flashing forth their beams  one set of lights shine rubyred like mars another set are white like venus while those on our pierheads and at our harbour mouths are green and in one or two instances if not more they shine by means of reflecting prisms with borrowed light like the moon but all whether revolving or fixed large or small red or white or greenbeam forth like good angels offering welcome and guidance to the mariner approaching from beyond seas with godlike impartiality shedding their radiance on friend and foe and encirclingas with a chaplet of living diamonds rubies and emeraldsour highly favoured little islands of the sea  lighthouses may be divided into two classes namely those which stand on cliffs and elsewhere somewhat above the influence of the waves and those built on outlying rocks which are barely visible at high tide or invisible altogether except at lowwater  the north and south foreland lights in kent the girdleness in aberdeenshire and inchkeith in the forth are examples of the former  the eddystone bell rock and skerryvore are wellknown examples of the latter also the wolf rock off the lands end  in one of the latternamely the bell rocki obtained permission a good many years ago from the commissioners of northern lights to spend a fortnight for literary purposesto be imprisoned in fact for that period  this lighthouse combines within itself more or less of the elements of all lighthouses  the principles on which it was built are much the same with those of skerryvore  it is founded on a tidal rock is exposed to the full fetch and fury of an open sea and it has stood for the greater part of a century exposed to inconceivable and constantly recurring violence of wind and wavenot indeed unshaken but altogether undamaged  the bell rock lies on the east of scotland off the mouths of the forth and tay 12 miles from the forfarshire coast which is the nearest land its foundation is always under water except for an hour or two at lowtide  at high tides there are about 12 or 16 feet of water above the highest ledge of the bell rock which consists of a series of sandstone ridges  these at ordinary lowtides are uncovered to the extent of between 100 and 200 yards  at neap tides the rock shows only a few black teeth with seaweed gums above the surface  there is a boat which attends upon this lighthouse  on the occasion of my visit i left arbroath in it one morning before daybreak and reached the rock about dawn  we cast anchor on arrivingnot being able to land for as yet there was no land  the lighthouse rose out of the sea like a bulrush out of a pond  no foundation rock was visible and the water played about the tower in a fashion that would have knocked our boat to pieces had we ventured to approach the entrancedoor  in a short time the crest of the rock began to show above the foam there was little or no wind but the ordinary swell of the calm ocean rolled in upon these rocks and burst upon them in such a way that the tower seemed to rise out of a caldron of boiling milk  at last we saw the three keepers moving amid the surges  they walked on an iron platform which being light and open and only a few feet above the waves was nearly invisible  when the tide was near its lowest ebb so that there was a piece of smooth water under the lee of the rock we hoisted out our little twin boat  this was a curious contrivance being simply a small boat cut across amidships so as to form two parts which fitted into each other like saucers and were thus rendered small enough to be easily carried in the larger boat  when about to be used the twins are put into the water and their sterns brought together and screwed tight  thus one little boat sharp at each end is formed  embarking in this we rowed between tanglecovered ridges up to the wroughtiron landingplace  the keepers looked surprised as we drew near  it was evident that visitors were not common objects of the shore out there  there were three keepers  one the chief was very tall dark and thin of grave temperament and sedate mien  another was a florid hearty young fellow full of fire and energy  the third was a stout short thickset man with placidity and goodhumour enthroned on his fat countenance  he was a firstrate man  i shall call him stout his comrade young  the chief may appropriately be named long  there was no time for more than a hurried introduction at first for the fresh watercasks and fortnightly allowance of fresh provisions had to be hoisted into the tower the empty casks got out and the boat reloaded and despatched before the tidealready risingshould transform the little harbour into a wild whirlpool  in little more than an hour the boat was gone and i proceeded to make myself at home with my new friends  probably every one knows that the bell rock is the inch cape rock immortalised by southey in his poem of sir ralph the rover in which he tells how that in the olden time    the abbot of aberbrothock   had placed a bell on the inch cape rock   on a buoy in the storm it floated and swung   and over the waves its warning rung  a pirate named sir ralph the rover came there one day and cut away the bell in a wicked frolic  long years after returning with a rich cargo of illgotten wealth retributive justice overtook sir ralph caused his vessel to strike on the inch cape rockfor want of the warning bell which he had cut awayand sent him and his belongings to the bottom  whether this legend be true or not there is no doubt that the rock had been so dangerous to shipping that seamen often avoided the firths of forth and tay in bad weather for fear of it and many captains in their anxiety to keep clear of it ran their vessels in the neighbouring coasts and perished  another proof that numerous wrecks took place there lay in the fact that the fishermen were wont to visit the rock after every gale for the purpose of gathering wreckage  it was resolved therefore about the beginning of this century to erect a lighthouse on the inchcape rock and to mr robert stevenson engineer at that time to the board of northern lights was assigned the task of building it  he began the work in august 1807 and finished it in february 1811  i began my sojourn in the bell rock lighthouse with breakfast  on ascending to the kitchen i found stout preparing it  mr long the chief offered with delicate hospitality to carry my meals up to the library so that i might feast in dignified solitude but i declined the honour preferring to fraternise with the men in the kitchen  breakfast over they showed me through the towerpointed out and explained everythingespecially the lantern and the libraryin which last i afterwards read mr stevensons interesting volume on the building of the bell rock a book which has been most appropriately styled the robinson crusoe of engineering literature  on returning to the entrancedoor i found that there was now no land the tide had risen  the lighthouse was a mere pillar in the sea water water everywherenothing else visible save the distant coast of forfarshire like a faint blue line on the horizon  but in the evening the tide again fell and the moment the rock was uncovered we descended  then mr long showed me the various points of interest about the rock and stout volunteered anecdotes connected with these and young corroborated and expounded everything with intense enthusiasm evidently young rejoiced in the rare opportunity my visit afforded him of breaking the monotony of life on the bell rock  he was like a caged bird and on one occasion expressed his sentiments very forcibly by saying to me oh sir i sometimes wish i could jump up and never come doon  as for long and stout they had got used to lighthouses and monotony  the placid countenance of each was a sure index of the profound tranquillity within  small though it was the rock was a very world in itself to the residentscrowded with ports and wharves and ledges which had reference to the buildingtime  there were sir ralph the rovers ledge and the abbots ledge and the engineers ledge and cunninghams ledge and the smiths ledge etcetera  then there were port stevenson and port boyle and port hamilton and many otherseach port being a mere hole capable of holding a boat or two besides which there were tracks leading to these portssuch as wilsons track and macurichs track and gloags track  and then there were hopes wharf and raes wharf and watts reach and scoresby point while among numerous outlying groups of rocklets there were the royal burghs the crown lawyers and the maritime sheriffseach and all teeming with interesting associations to those who know the story of the rockall comprehended within an area of a few hundred yardsthe whole affair being wiped entirely and regularly off the face of nature by every rising tide  close beside raes wharf on which we stood mr long showed me the holes in which had been fixed the ends of the great beams of the beacon the beacon was a point of considerable interest to me  if you had seen the rock as i saw it reader in a storm with the water boiling all over and round it for more than a mile like seething milkand if you had reflected that the first beacon built there was carried away in a gale you would have entertained very exalted ideas of the courage of the men who built the bell rock lighthouse  while the tower was building mr stevenson and his men were exposed for many days and nights in this beaconthis erection of timberbeams with a mere pigeonhouse on the top of it for a dwelling  before the beacon was built the men lived in the pharos floating light a vessel which was moored not far from the rock  every dayweather permittingthey rowed to the rock landed and worked for one two or three hours when they were drowned out so to speak and obliged to return to their floating home  sometimes the landing was easy  more frequently it was difficult  occasionally it was impossible  when a landing was accomplished they used to set to work without delay  there was no time to lose  some bored holes in the rock for holdfasts others with pick and chisel cut out the foundationpit  then the courses began to be laid  on each occasion of landing the smith had to set up his bellows light his fire and work in hot haste because his whole shop except the anvil had to be taken down and carried away every tide frequently in fine weather this enterprising son of vulcan might have been seen toiling with his head enveloped in volumes of smoke and sparks and his feet in the water which gradually rose to his ankles and knees until with a sudden hiss it extinguished his fire and ended his labours for the day  then he was forced to pack up his bellows and tools and decamp with the rest of the men  sometimes they wrought in calm sometimes in storm always more or less in water  three hours was considered a fair days work  when they had the good fortune to work double tides in a day they made five or fiveandahalf hours but this was of rare occurrence  you see that mark there sir on smiths ledge said mr long to me one day that was the place where the forge stood and the ledge beyond with the old bit of iron on it is the last hope where mr stevenson and his men were so nearly lost  then he went on to tell me the following incident as illustrating one of the many narrow escapes made by the builders  one day soon after the men had commenced work it began to blow hard and the crew of the boat belonging to the attending vessel named the smeaton fearing that her moorings might be insufficient went off to examine them  this was wrong  the workmen on the rock were sufficiently numerous to completely fill three boats  for one of these to leave the rock was to run a great risk as the event proved  almost as soon as they reached the smeaton her cables parted and she went adrift carrying the boat with her away to leeward and although sail was instantly made they found it impossible to regain the rock against wind and tide  mr stevenson observed this with the deepest anxiety but the men busy as bees about the rock were not aware of it at first  the situation was terrible  there were thirtytwo men left on a rock which would in a short time be overflowed to a depth of twelve or fifteen feet by a stormy sea and only two boats in which to remove them  these two boats if loaded to the gunwales could have held only a few more than the half of them  while the sound of the numerous hammers and the ring of the anvil were heard the situation did not appear so hopeless but soon the men at the lowest part of the foundation were driven from work by the rising tide then the forgefire was extinguished and the men generally began to make towards their respective boats for their jackets and dry socks when it was discovered that one of the three boats was gone not a word was uttered but the men looked at each other in evident perplexity they seemed to realise their position at once  in a few minutes some of that band must inevitably be left to perish for the absent boat and vessel were seen drifting farther and farther away to leeward  mr stevenson knew that in such a case where life and death were in the balance a desperate struggle among the men for precedence would be certain  indeed he afterwards learned that the pickmen had resolved to stick by their boat against all hazards  while they were thus gazing in silence at each other and at the distant vessel their enterprising leader had been casting about in his mind as to the best method of at least attempting the deliverance of his men and he finally turned round to propose as a forlorn hope that all hands should strip off their upper clothing that every unnecessary article should be removed from the boats that a specified number should get into each and that the remainder should hang on by the gunwales and thus be dragged through the water while they were rowed cautiously towards the smeaton  but when he tried to speak his mouth was so parched that his tongue refused utterance and then he discovered as he says himself that saliva is as necessary to speech as the tongue itself  turning to a pool he moistened his lips with seawater and found immediate relief  he was again about to speak when some one shouted a boat a boat and sure enough a large boat was seen through the haze making towards the rock  this timely visitor was james spink the bell rock pilot who had come off express from arbroath with letters  his visit was altogether an unusual one and his truly providential appearance unquestionably prevented loss of life on that critical occasion  this is one specimenselected from innumerable instances of danger and riskwhich may give one some idea of what is encountered by those who build such lighthouses as the bell rock  our rambles on the rock were necessarily of short duration  we used to stand in the doorway watching the retreating waves and the moment the rails were uncovered we hurried down the ladderall of us bent on getting as much exercise as possible on land  we marched in single file up and down the narrow rails until the rock was uncoveredthen we rambled over the slippery ledges  sometimes we had one hoursometimes two or even three hours according to the state of the tides  then the returning waves drove us gradually from the rocks to the rails from the rails to the ladderand so back into the lighthouse  among other things that impressed me deeply was the grandeur of the waves at the bell rock  one enjoys an opportunity there of studying the form and colour of ocean billows which cannot be obtained on any ordinary shore because the water being deep alongside the rock these waves come up to it in all their unbroken magnificence  i tried to paint them but found it difficult owing to the fact that like refractory children they would not stand still to be painted  it was not only in stormy weather that these waves arose  i have seen them during a dead calm when the sea was like undulating glass  no doubt the cause of them was a gale in some distant part of the seainducing a heavy groundswell but be the cause what it might these majestic rollers often came in without a breath of air to help them and with the sun glittering on their lightgreen crystal sides  their advance seemed slow and solemn amid the deep silence which made them all the more impressive  the rise of each wave was so gradual that you could not tell where it began in the distant sea  as it drew near it took definite form and swelled upwards and at last came on like a wall of glassprobably ten or twelve feet highso high at all events that i felt as if looking up at it from my position on the low rock  when close at hand its green edge lipped over and became fringed with whitethen it bent forward with a profound obeisance to the bell rock and broke the silence with a grand reverberating roar as it fell in a ruin of foam and rushed up to my very feet  when those waves began to paint the canvas with their own spray and change the oil into a watercolour i was constrained to retire to the lighthouse where mr long a deeply interested student watched me as i continued my studies from the doorway  mr long had an inquiring mind and closely observed all that went on around him  among other things he introduced me to a friend of his a species of fish which he called a paddle  stout called it a sucker in virtue of an arrangement on its breast whereby it could fasten itself to a rock and hold on  this fish dwelt in port hamilton near sir ralph the rovers ledge and could be visited at lowtide  he happened to be engaged at that time in watching his wifes spawn and could not be induced to let go his hold of the rock on any account  mr long pulled at him pretty forcibly once or twice but with no effect and the fish did not seem in the least alarmed  while mr paddle did duty in the nursery mrs paddle roamed the sea at large apparently womens rights have made some progress in that quarter  it was supposed by stout that she took the nightwatches  mr young inclined to the opinion that she attended to the commissariatwas out marketing in fact and brought food to her husband  all that i can say on the matter is that i visited the family frequently and always saw the father on duty but only once found mrs paddle at home  the tameness of this kind of fish is very remarkable  one day i saw a large one in a pool which actually allowed me to put my hand under him and lift him gently out  suddenly it occurred to me that i might paint him the palette chanced to be at hand so i began at once  in about two minutes the paddle gave a flop of discomfort as he lay on the rock i therefore put him into a small pool for a minute or so to let him breathe then took him out and had a second sitting after which he had another rest and a little refreshment in the pool  thus in about ten minutes i had his portrait and put him back into his native element  i am inclined to think that this is the only fish in the sea that has had his portrait taken and returned to tell the tale to his admiring perhaps unbelieving friends  of course one of the most interesting points in the lighthouse was the lantern  i frequently sat in it at night with the man on duty who expounded the lighting apparatus to me or spun yarns  the fifth day of my sojourn on the bell rock was marked by an event of great interestthe arrival of a fishingboat with letters and newspapers  i had begun by that time to feel some degree of longing to hear something about the outer world though i had not felt lonely by any meansmy companions were too pleasant to admit of that  our little world contained a large amount of talent  mr long had a magnificent bass voice and made good use of it  then young played the violin not so badly and sang tenornot quite so well besides which he played the accordion  his instrument however was not perfect  one of the bass notes would not sound and one of the treble notes could not by any means be silenced  between the two some damage was done to the harmony but we were not particular  as to stouthe could neither sing nor play but he was a splendid listener and the sight of his goodhumoured face smiling through clouds of tobacco smoke as he sat by the kitchen fire was of itself sufficient to encourage us  but stout could do more than listen and admire  he was cook to the establishment during my visit  the men took this duty by turnseach for a fortnightand stout excelled the others  it was he who knew how to extract sweet music from the teakettle and the fryingpan  but stouts forte was buttered toast  he was quite an adept at the formation of this luxury  if i remember rightly it was an entire loaf that stout cut up and toasted each morning for breakfast  he knew nothing of delicate treatment  every slice was an inch thick at the least  it was quite a study to see him go to work  he never sawed with the knife  having a powerful hand and arm one sweep of the blade sufficed for one slice and he cut up the whole loaf before beginning to toast  then he always had the fire well prepared  you never saw alternate stripes of black and white on stouts toast and he laid on the butter as he might have laid tar on the side of a ship thick and heavy  he never scraped it off one part to put it on anotherand he never picked the lumps out of the holes  truly stout was quite a genius in this matter  the fisherman who brought off our letters could not have landed if the weather had not been fine  poor fellow after i left he lost his boat in consequence of being on too familiar terms with the bell rock  he was in the habit of fishing near the rock and occasionally ran in at lowwater to smoke a pipe with the keepers  one morning he stayed too long  the large green billows which had been falling with solemn boom on the outlying rocks began to lip over into the pool where his boat layport stevenson  embarking in haste with his comrade he pushed off just then there came a tremendous wave the crest of which toppled over smiths ledge fell into the boat and sank it like a stone  the men were saved by the keepers but their boat was totally destroyed  they never saw a fragment of it again  what a commentary this was on the innumerable wrecks that have taken place on the inch cape rock in days gone by  sometimes on a dark stormy night i used to try to realise something of this  turning my back on the lighthouse i tried to forget it and imagine what must have been the feelings of those who had actually stood there and been driven inch by inch to the higher ledges with the certain knowledge that their doom was fixed and without the comfort and assurance that behind them stood a strong tower of refuge from the storm  i was fortunate during my stay in having experience of every variety of weatherfrom a dead calm to a regular gale  it was towards the end of my visit that the gale came on and it lasted two days  no language can convey an adequate idea of the sublimity of the scene and the sense of power in the seething waves that waged furious war over the rock during the height of that gale  the spray rose above the kitchen windows 70 feet on the tower in such solid masses as to darken the room in passing and twice during the storm we were struck by waves with such force as to shake the tower to its foundation  this storm delayed the relief boat a day  next day however it succeeded in getting alongsideand at length after a most agreeable and interesting sojourn of two weeks i parted from the hospitable keepers with sincere regret and bade adieu to a lighthouse which is not only a monument of engineering skill but a source of safety to the shipping and of confidence to the mariners frequenting these waters  in former days men shunned the dreaded neighbourhood of the inch cape rock with anxious care  now they look out for that    ruddy gem of changeful light   bound on the dusky brow of night  and make for it with perfect safety  in time past human lives and noble ships and costly merchandise were lost on the bell rock every year  now disaster to shipping there is not even dreamed of and one of the most notable proofs of the value of the lighthouse and indirectly of all other lighthouses lies in the fact that not a single wreck has occurred on the bell rock since that auspicious evening in 1811 when the sturdy pillar opened its eyes for the first time and threw its bright beams far and wide over the north sea    chapter three  nights with the fire brigade  there are few lives we should think more trying or more full of curious adventure and thrilling incident than that of a london fireman  he must always be on the alert  no hour of the day or night can he ever count on as being his own unless on those occasions when he obtains leave of absence which i suppose are not frequent  if he does not absolutely sleep in his clothes he sleeps beside themarranged in such a way that he can jump into them at a moments notice  when the summons comes there must be no preliminary yawning no soft transition from the land of dreams to the world of reality  he jumps into his boots which stand invitingly ready pulls on his trousers buttons his braces while descending to the street and must be brasshelmeted on the engine and away like a fiery dragongonemad within three minutes of the call or thereabouts if he is to escape a fine  moreover the london fireman must be prepared to face death at any moment  when the call comes he never knows whether he is turning out to something not much more serious than a chimney or to one of those devastating conflagrations on the riverside in which many thousand pounds worth of property are swept away and his life may go along with them  far more frequently than the soldier or sailor is he liable to be ordered on a duty which shall turn out to be a forlorn hope and not less pluckily does he obey  there is no respite for him  the field which the london brigade covers is so vast that the liability to be sent into action is continuous chiefly of course at night  at one moment he may be calmly polishing up the brasses of his engine or skylarking with his comrades or sedately reading a book or snoozing in bed and the next he may be battling fiercely with the flames  unlike the lifeboat heroes who may sleep when the world of waters is calm he must be ever on the watch for his enemy is a lurking foelike the red indian who pounces on you when you least expect him and does not utter his warwhoop until he deems his victory secure  the little spark smoulders while the fireman on guard booted and belted keeps watch at his station  it creeps while he waits and not until its energies have gained considerable force does it burst forth with a grand roar and bid him fierce defiance  even when conquered in one quarter it often leaps up in another so that the fireman sometimes returns from the field twice or thrice in the same night to find that the enemy is in force elsewhere and that the fight must be resumed  in the spring of 1867 i went to london to gather material for my book fighting the flames and was kindly permitted by captain shawthen chief of the fire brigadeto spend a couple of weeks at one of the principal westend stations and accompany the men to fires  my first experience was somewhat stirring  my plan was to go to the station late in the evening and remain up all night with the men on guard waiting for fires  one day in the afternoon when it was growing dusk and before i had made my first visit to the station a broadshouldered joviallooking fellow in blue coat belted and with a sailors cap called on me and asked if i should like to see a ouse as ad bin blowed up with gas  of course i was only too glad to follow him  he conducted me to an elegant mansion in bayswater and chatted pleasantly as we went along in somewhat nautical tones for he had been a manofwars man  his name was flaxmore  i may remark here that the men of the london brigade were and still are i believe chosen from among seamen  you see sir said flaxmore in explanation of this fact sailors are found to be most suitable for the brigade because theyre accustomed to strict disciplineto turn out suddenly at all hours in all weathers and to climbing in dangerous circumstances  arrived at the mansion we found that the outside looked all right except that most of the windows were broken  the interior however presented a sad and curious appearance  the house had been recently done up in the most expensive style and its gilded cornices painted pilasters and other ornaments with the lath and plaster of walls and ceilings had been blown into the rooms in dire confusion  bin a pretty considerable smash here sir said flaxmore with a genial smile on his broad countenance  i admitted the fact and asked how it happened  well sir you see said he there was an orrid smell of gas in the ouse an the missus she sent for a gas man to find out where it was and would you believe it sir they went to look for it with a candle  sure enough they found it too in a small cupboard  the gas had been escapin it had but couldnt git out o that there cupboard cause the door was a tight fit so it had made its way all over the ouse between the lath and plaster and the walls  as soon as ever it caught light sir it blowed the whole place into smashas you see  it blowed the gas man flat on his back an sarved him right it blowed the missus through the doorway an it blowed the cookas was on the landin outsideright down the kitchen stairs it didbut there was none of em much hurt sir they wasnt beyond a bruise or two  after examining this house flaxmore proposed that i should go and see his engine  he was proud of his engine evidently and spoke of it as a man might speak of his wife  on our way to the station the driver of a passing bus called out  fireman theres a fire in new bond street  one word flaxmore exchanged with the driver and then turning to me said come on sir ill give you a ride  off we went at a run and burst into the station  get her out jim cried flaxmore her being the engine  jim the man on duty put on his helmet without saying a word and hauled out the fireengine while a comrade ran for the horses and another called up the men  in five minutes more i was seated beside seven men in blue uniforms and brass helmets dashing through the streets of london at full gallop  now those who have never seen a london fireengine go to a fire have no conception of what it ismuch less have they any conception of what it is to ride on the engine  to those accustomed to it no doubt it may be tame enoughi cannot tell but to those who mount an engine for the first time and dash through the crowded thoroughfares at a wild tearing gallop it is probably the most exciting drive conceivable  it beats steeplechasing  it feels like driving to destructionso desperate and reckless is it  and yet it is not reckless in the strict sense of that word for there is a stern needbe in the case  every moment not to mention minutes or hours is of the utmost importance in the progress of a fire for when it gets the mastery and bursts into flames it flashes to its work and completes it quickly  at such times one moment wasted may involve the loss of thousands of pounds ay and of human lives also  this is wellknown to those whose profession it is to fight the flames  hence the union of apparent mad desperation with cool quiet selfpossession in their proceedings  when firemen can work in silence they do so  no unnecessary word is uttered no voice is needlessly raised but when occasion requires it their course is a tumultuous rush amid a storm of shouting and gesticulation  so was it on the present occasion  had the fire been distant they would have had to commence their gallop somewhat leisurely for fear of breaking down the horses but it was not far offnot much more than a couple of milesso they dashed round the corner of their own street and swept into the edgeware road at full speed  here the noise of our progress began for the great thoroughfare was crowded with vehicles and pedestrians  to pass through such a crowd without coming into collision with anything required not only dexterous driving but rendered it necessary that two of the men on the engine should stand up and shout incessantly as we whirled along clearing everything out of our way  the men seemed to shout with the memory of the boatswain strong upon them for their tones were pitched in the deepest and gruffest basskey sometimes there was a lull for a moment as a comparatively clear space of 100 yards or so lay before us then their voices rose like the roaring of the gale as a stupid or deaf cabman got in our way or a plethoric bus threatened to interrupt our furious career  the cross streets were the points where the chief difficulties met us  there cab and vandrivers turned into or crossed the great thoroughfare all ignorant of the thunderbolt that was rushing on like a fiery meteor with its lanterns casting a glare of light before and the helmets of the stern charioteers flashing back the rays from streetlamps and windows  at the corner of one of the streets the crowd of vehicles was so great that the driver of the engine began to tighten his reins while flaxmore and his comrades raised a furious roar  cabs buses and pedestrians scattered right and left in a marvellous manner the driver slackened his reins cracked his whip and the horses stretched out again  there it shows a light observed flaxmore as we tore along oxford street  at that moment a stupid cabman blocked up the way  there was a terrific shout from all the firemen at once but the man did not hear our driver attempted both to pull up and to turn aside the first was impossible the latter he did so effectively that he not only cleared the cab but made straight at a lamppost on the other side  a crash seemed inevitable but flaxmore observing the danger seized the rein next to him and swung the horses round  we flew past just shaving the lamppost and in three minutes more pulled up at a house which was blazing in the upper floors  three engines were already at work on it flaxmore and his men at once entered the burning house which by that time was nearly gutted  i stood outside looking on but soon became anxious to know what was doing inside and attempted to enter  a policeman stopped me but at that moment flaxmore came out like a halfdrowned rat his face streaked with brickdust and charcoal seeing what i wanted he led me into the house and immediately i found myself in a hot showerbath which did not improve my coat or hat  at the same time i stepped up to the ankles in hot water  tons of water were being poured on the house by three powerful engines and this in passing through so much heated material had become comfortably warm the first thing i saw on entering was a foaming cataract  this was the staircase down which the water rushed breaking over masses of fallen brickwork and debris with a noise like a goodly highland burn  up this we waded but could get no further than the room above as the upper stair had fallen in  i was about to descend in order to try to reach the roof by some other way when a fireman caught me by the collar exclaiminghold on sir  he thought the staircase was about to fall bolt now sir he added releasing me  i bolted and was out in the street in a moment where i found that some of the firemen who had first arrived and were much exhausted were being served with a glass of brandy  if there were any case in which a teetotaller might be justified in taking spirits it would be i think when exhausted by toiling for hours amid the heat and smoke and danger of a fire nevertheless i found that several of the firemen there were teetotallers  there was a shout of laughter at this moment occasioned by one of the firemen having accidentally turned the branch or delivery pipe full on the faces of the crowd and drenched some of them  this was followed by a loud cheer when another fireman was seen to have clambered to the roof whence he could apply the water with better effect  at last their efforts were crowned with success  before midnight the fire was extinguished and we drove back to the paddington station at a more leisurely pace  thus ended my first experience of a london fire  accidents as may be easily believed are of frequent occurrence  accidents  there were between forty to fifty a year  in 1865 they were as follows   cuts and lacerated wounds12  contusions               15  fractures                 2  sprains                   9  burns and scalds          3  injury to eyes            5                           46   my friend flaxmore himself met with an accident not long afterwards  he slipped off the roof of a house and fell on his back from a height of about fifteen feet  being a heavy man the fall told severely on him  for about two weeks i went almost every evening to the regent street station and spent the night with the men in the hope of accompanying them to fires  the lobbyas the watch room of the station was namedwas a small one round the walls of which the brass helmets and hatchets of the men were hung  here each night two men slept on two trestlebeds  they were fully equipped with the exception of their helmets  their comrades slept at their own homes which were within a few yards of the station  the furniture of the lobby was scantya desk a bookcase two chairs a clock an alarmbell and four telegraphic instruments comprised it all  these last formed part of a network of telegraphs which extended from the central station to nearly all the other stations in london  by means of the telegraph a call is givenie a fire is announced to the firemen all over london if need be in a very few minutes  those who are nearest to the scene of conflagration hasten to it at once with their engines while each outlying or distant station sends forward a man on foot  these men coming up one by one relieve those who have first hastened to the fire  calls however are not always sent by telegraph  sometimes a furious ring comes to the alarmbell and a man or a boy rushes in shouting fire with all his might  people are generally much excited in such circumstancessometimes half mad  in one case a man came with a call in such perturbation of mind that he could not tell where the fire was at all for nearly five minutes  on another occasion two men rushed in with a call at the same moment and both were stutterers  my own opinion is that one stuttered by nature and the other from agitation  be that as it may they were both half mad with excitement  ffffire roared one  ffffire yelled the other  where away asked a fireman as he quietly buckled his belt and put on his helmet  bbbromptonbbbayswater burst from them both at the same moment  then one cried ii sssay brompton and the other shouted ii ssay bayswater  what street asked the fireman  wwwalton street cried one  nnopporchester terrace roared the other and at the word the walton street man hit the porchester terrace man between the eyes and knocked him down  a regular scuffle ensued in the midst of which the firemen got out two enginesand before the stutterers were separated went off full swing one to brompton the other to bayswater and found that as they had guessed there were in reality two fires  one nights experience in the lobby will give a specimen of the firemans work  i had spent the greater part of the night there without anything turning up  about three in the morning the two men on duty lay down on their trestlebeds to sleep and i sat at the desk reading the reports of recent fires  the place was very quietthe sounds of the great city were hushedthe night was calm and nothing was heard but the soft breathing of the sleepers and the ticking of the clock as i sat there waiting for a fire  i often looked at the telegraph needles and i am half ashamed to say it longed for them to move and give us a call  at last when i had begun to despair the sharp little telegraph bell rang  up i started in some excitementup started one of the sleepers too quite as quickly as i did but without any excitement whateverhe was accustomed to alarms  reading the telegraph with sleepy eyes he said with a yawn its only a stop for a chimbley  he lay down again to sleep and i sat down again to read and wait  soon after the foreman came downstairs to have a smoke and a chat  among the many anecdotes which he told me was one which had a little of the horrible in it  he said he was once called to a fire in a cemetery where workmen had been employed in filling some of the vaults with sawdust and closing them up  they had been smoking down there and had set fire to the sawdust which set light to the coffins and when the firemen arrived these were burning fiercely and the stench and smoke were almost overpoweringnevertheless one of the men ran down the stair of the vaults but slipped his foot and fell  next moment he rushed up with a face like a ghost having fallen he said between two coffins quickly recovering from his fright he again descended with his comrades and they soon managed to extinguish the fire  the foreman went off to bed after relating this pleasant little incident and left me to meditate on it  presently a sound of distant wheels struck my ear  on they came at a rattling pace  in a few minutes a cab dashed round the corner and drew up sharply at the door which was severely kicked while the bell was rung furiously  up jumped the sleepers again and in rushed a cabman backed by a policeman with the usual shout of fire  then followed question brief and quick replya fire in great portland street close at hand  get her out bill was the order  bill darted to the engineshed and knocked up the driver in passing  he got out the horses while the other man ran from house to house of the neighbouring firemen giving a double ring to their bells  before the engine was horsed one and another and another of the men darted into the station donned his helmet and buckled on his axe then they all sprang to their places the whip cracked and off we went at full gallop only eight minutes after the alarmbell rang  we spun through the streets like a rocket with a tail of sparks behind us for the fire of the engine had been lighted before starting  on reaching the fire it was found to be only smouldering in the basement of the house and the men of another engine were swarming through the place searching for the seat of it  i went in with our men and the first thing i saw was a coffin lying ready for use  the foreman led me down into a vaulted cellar and here strange to say i found myself in the midst of coffins  it seemed like the realisation of the story i had just heard  there were not fewer than thirty of them on the floor and ranged round the walls  happily however they were not tenanted  in fact the fire had occurred in an undertakers workshop and in looking through the premises i came upon several coffins laid out ready for immediate use  two of these impressed me much  they lay side by side one was of plain black wooda paupers coffin evidently  the other was covered with fine cloth and gilt ornaments and lined with padded white satin  i was making some moral reflections on the curious difference between the last restingplace of the rich man and the poor when i was interrupted by the firemen who had discovered the fire and put it out so we jumped on the engine once more and galloped back to the station most of the men went off immediately to bed the engine was housed the horses were stabled the men on guard hung up their helmets and lay down again on their trestlebeds the foreman bade me goodnight and i was left once more in a silence that was broken only by the deep breathing of the sleepers and the ticking of the clockscarcely able to believe that the stirring events of the previous hour were other than a vivid dream  all over london at short distances apart fireescapes may be seen rearing their tall heads in recesses and corners formed by the angles in churches or other public buildings  each night these are brought out to the streets where they stand in readiness for instant use  at the present time the escapes are in charge of the fire brigade  when i visited the firemen they were under direction of the royal society for the protection of life from fire and in charge of conductors who sat in sentryboxes beside the escapes every night summer and winter ready for action  these conductors were clad like the firemenexcept that their helmets were made of black leather instead of brass  they were not very different from other mortals to look at but they were picked menevery onebold as lions true as steel ready each night at a moments notice to place their lives in jeopardy in order to rescue their fellowcreatures from the flames  of course they were paid for the work but the pay was small when we consider that it was the price of indomitable courage tremendous energy great strength of limb and untiring perseverance in the face of appalling danger  here is a specimen of the way in which the escapes were worked  on the night of the 2nd march 1866 the premises of a blockmaker named george milne caught fire  the flames spread with great rapidity arousing milne and his family which consisted of his wife and seven children  all these sought refuge in the attics  at first milne thought he could have saved himself but with so many little children round him he found himself utterly helpless  not far from the spot henry douglas a fireescape conductor sat in his sentrybox reading a book perchance or meditating mayhap on the wife and little ones slumbering snugly at home while he kept watch over the sleeping city soon the shout of fire reached his ears  at once his clothcap was exchanged for the black helmet and in a few seconds the escape was flying along the streets pushed by the willing hands of policemen and passersby  the answer to the summons was very prompt on this occasion but the fire was burning fiercely when conductor douglas arrived and the whole of the lower part of the house was so enveloped in flames and smoke that the windows could not be seen at all  douglas therefore pitched his escape at a venture on what he thought would bring him to the secondfloor windows and up he went amid the cheers of the onlookers  entering a window he tried to search the room and the cheers were hushed while the excited multitude gazed and listened with breathless anxietyfor they knew that the man was in a position of imminent danger  in a few moments he reappeared on the escape half suffocated  he had heard screams in the room above and at once threw up the flyladder by which he ascended to the parapet below the attic rooms  here he discovered milne and his family grouped together in helpless despair  we may conceive the gush of hope that must have thrilled their breasts when conductor douglas leaped through the smoke into the midst of them but we can neither describe nor conceive unless we have heard it in similar circumstances the tone of the deafening cheers that greeted the brave man when he reappeared on the ladders and with the aid of a policeman named john pead bore the whole family one by one in safety to the ground  for this deed conductor douglas received the silver medal of the society and pead the policeman received a written testimonial and a sovereign subsequently in consequence of conductor douglass serious illness resulting from his efforts on this occasionthe society voted him a gratuity of 5 pounds beyond his sick allowance to mark their strong approbation of his conduct  now in this case it is obvious that but for the fireescape the blockmaker and his family must have perished  here is another case  i quote the conductors own account of it as given in the fire escape societys annual report  the conductors name was shaw  he writes    upon my arrival from aldersgate street station the fire had gained   strong hold upon the lower portion of the building and the smoke   issuing therefrom was so dense and suffocating as to render all escape   by the staircase quite impossible  hearing cries for help from the   upper part of the house i placed my fire escape ascended to the   third floor whence i rescued four personsviz mrs ferguson her   two children and a lodger named gibson  they were all leaning   against the windowsill almost overcome  i carried each down the   escape a height of nearly fifty feet in perfect safety and   afterwards entered the back part of the premises and took five young   children from a yard where they were exposed to great danger from the   fire  there was a man in the london brigade who deserves special noticeviz conductor samuel wood  wood had been many years in the service and had in the course of his career saved no fewer than 168 lives  on one occasion he was called to a fire in church lane  he found a mr nathan in the firstfloor unable to descend the staircase as the ground floor was in flames  he unshipped his firstfloor ladder and with the assistance of a policeman brought mr nathan down  being informed that there was a servant girl in the kitchen wood took his crowbar wrenched up the grating and brought the young woman out in safety  now this i give as a somewhat ordinary case  it involved danger but not so much as to warrant the bestowal of the silver medal  nevertheless wood and the policeman were awarded a written testimonial and a sum of money  i have had some correspondence with conductor wood whose broad breast was covered with medals and clasps won in the service of the fe society  at one fire he rushed up the escape before it was properly pitched and caught in his arms a man named middleton as he was in the act of jumping from a window  at another time on arriving at a fire he found that the family thought all had escaped but wrote the conductor to me they soon missed the old grandmotheri immediately broke the shop door open and passed through to the firstfloor landing where i discovered the old lady lying insensible  i placed her on my back and crawled back to the door and i am happy to say she is alive now and doing well  so risky was a conductors work that sometimes he had to be rescued by othersas the following extract will illustrate  it is from one of the societys reports    case 10620    awarded to james griffin inspector of the k division of police the   societys silver medal for the intrepid and valuable assistance   rendered to fire escape conductor rickell at a fire at the rose and   crown publichouse bridge street at one oclock on the morning of   february 1st when but for his assistance there is little doubt that   the conductor would have perished  on the arrival of conductor   rickell with the mile end fire escape not being satisfied that all   the inmates had escaped the conductor entered the house the upper   part of which was burning fiercely the conductor not being seen for   some time the inspector called to him and not receiving an answer   entered the house and ascended the stairs and saw the conductor lying   on the floor quite insensible  with some difficulty the inspector   reached him and dragging him down the staircase carried him into   the air where he gradually recovered  while attending fires in london i wore one of the black leather helmets of the salvage corps  this had the double effect of protecting my head from falling bricks and enabling me to pass the cordon of police unquestioned  after a night of it i was wont to return home about dawn as few fires occur after that  on these occasions i felt deeply grateful to the keepers of small coffeestalls who wheeling their entire shop and stockintrade in a barrow supplied early workmen with cups of hot coffee at a halfpenny a piece and slices of bread and butter for the same modest sum  at such times i came to know that man wants but little here below if he only gets it hot and substantial  fire is such an important subject and an element that any one may be called on so suddenly and unexpectedly to face that at the risk of being deemed presumptuous i will for a few minutes turn aside from these reminiscences to put a few plain questions to my reader  has it ever occurred to you to think what you would do if your house took fire at night  do you know of any other mode of exit from your house than by the front or back doors and the staircase  have you a rope at home which would support a mans weight and extend from an upper window to the ground  nothing easier than to get and keep such a rope  a few shillings would purchase it  do you know how you would attempt to throw water on the walls of one of your rooms if it were on fire near the ceiling  a teacup would be of no use  a saucepan would not be much better  as for buckets or basins the strongest man could not heave such weights of water to the ceiling with any precision or effect  but there are garden handpumps in every seedsmans shop with which a man could deluge his property with the greatest ease  do you know how to tie two blankets or sheets together so that the knot shall not slip  your life may one day depend on such a simple piece of knowledge  still further do you know that in retreating from room to room before a fire you should shut doors and windows behind you to prevent the supply of air which feeds the flames  are you aware that by creeping on your hands and knees and keeping your head close to the ground you can manage to breathe in a room where the smoke would suffocate you if you stood upalso that a wet sponge or handkerchief held over the mouth and nose will enable you to breathe with less difficulty in the midst of smokedo you know that many persons especially children lose their lives by being forgotten by the inmates of a house in cases of fire and that if a fire came to you you ought to see to it that every member of your household is present to take advantage of any means of escape that may be sent to you  these subjects deserve to be considered thoughtfully by every one especially by heads of familiesnot only for their own sakes but for the sake of those whom god has committed to their care  for suppose that despite the improbability of such an event your dwelling really did catch fire how inconceivable would be the bitterness added to your despair if in the midst of gathering smoke and flameswith death staring you in the face and rescue all but hopelessyou were compelled to feel that you and yours might have escaped the impending danger if you had only bestowed on fireprevention fireextinction and fireescape a very little forethought and consideration    chapter four  a war of mercy  there is a great war in which the british nation is at all times engaged  no bright seasons of peace mark the course of this war  year by year it is waged unceasingly though not at all times with the same fury nor always with the same results  sometimes as in ordinary warfare there are minor skirmishes in which many a deed of heroism is done though not recorded and there are pitched battles in which all our resources are called into action and the papers teem with the news of the defeats disasters and victories of the great fight  this war costs us hundreds of lives thousands of ships and millions of money every year  our undying and unconquerable enemy is the storm and our great engines of war with which through the blessing of god we are enabled to fight more or less successfully against the foe are the lifeboat and the rocket  these engines and the brave men who work them are our sentinels of the coast  when the storm is brewing when grey clouds lower and muttering thunder comes rolling over the sea men with hard hands and bronzed faces clad in oilskin coats and souwesters saunter down to our quays and headlands all round the kingdom  these are the lifeboat crews on the lookout  the enemy is moving and the sentinels are being posted or rather they are posting themselvesfor the night for all the fighting men in this great war are volunteers  they need no drilling to prepare them for the field no bugle or drum to sound the charge  their drum is the rattling thunder their trumpet the roaring storm  they began to train for this warfare when they were not so tall as their fathers boots and there are no awkward squads among them now  their organisation is rough and ready like themselves and simple too  the heavens call them to action the coxswain grasps the helm the men seize the oars the word is given and the rest is straightforward fighting over everything through everything in the teeth of everything until the victory is gained and rescued men and women and children are landed in safety on our shores  in the winter of 1863 my enthusiasm in the lifeboat cause was aroused by the reading in the papers of that wonderful achievement of the famous ramsgate lifeboat which on a terrible night in that year fought against the storm for sixteen hours and rescued a hundred and twenty souls from death  a strange fatality attaches to me somehownamely that whenever i have an attack of enthusiasm a book is the result  immediately after reading this episode in the great war i called on the secretary of the royal national lifeboat institution who kindly gave me minute information as to the working of his society and lent me its journals  then i took train to the coast of deal and spent a considerable part of the succeeding weeks in the company of isaac jarmanat that time the coxswain of the ramsgate lifeboat and the chief hero in many a gallant fight with the sea  the splendid craft which he commanded was one of the selfrighting insubmergible boats of the institution  jarmans opinion of her was expressed in the words shes parfect sir and if you tried to improve her youd only spile her  from him i obtained much information and many a yarn about his experiences on the famous and fatal goodwin sands which if recorded would fill a volume  indeed a volume has already been written about them and other deeds of daring on those sands by one of the clergymen of ramsgate  i also saw the captain of the steamtug that attends upon that boat  he took me on board his vessel and showed me the gold and silver medals he had received from his own nation and from the monarchs of foreign lands for rescuing human lives  i chatted with the men of deal whose profession it is to work in the storm and succour ships in distress and who have little to do but lounge on the beach and spin yarns when the weather is fine  i also listened to the thrilling yarns of jarman until i felt a strong desire to go off with him to a wreck  this however was not possible  no amateur is allowed to go off in the ramsgate boat on any pretext whatever but the restriction is not so absolute in regard to the steamer which attends on her  i obtained leave to go out in this tug which always lies with her fires banked up ready to take the lifeboat off to the sands if her services should be required  jarman promised to rouse me if a summons should come  as in cases of rescue from fire speed is allimportant  i slept for several nights with my clothes onboots and allat the hotel nearest to the harbour  but it was not to be  night after night continued exasperatingly calm  no gale would arise or wreck occur  this was trying as i lay there wakeful and hopeful with plenty of time to study the perplexing question whether it is legitimate under any circumstance to wish for a wreck or a fire  when patience was worn out i gave it up in despair  at another time however i had an opportunity of seeing the lifeboat in action  it was when i was spending a couple of weeks on board of the gull lightship which lies between ramsgate and the goodwins  a dirty day had culminated in a tempestuous night  the watch on deck clad in drenched oilskins was tramping overhead rendering my repose fitful  suddenly he opened the skylight and shouted that the southsand head lightship was firing and sending up rockets  as this meant a wreck on the sands we all rushed on deck and saw the flare of a tarbarrel in the far distance  already our watch was loading and firing our signalgun and sending up rockets for the purpose of calling off the ramsgate lifeboat  it chanced that the broadstairs boat observed the signals first and not long after she flew past us under sail making for the wreck  a little later we saw the signallight of the ramsgate tug looming through the mist like the great eye of the stormfiend  she ranged close up in order to ask whereaway the wreck was  being answered she sheared off and as she did so the lifeboat towing astern came full into view  it seemed as if she had no crew save only one man doubtless my friend jarmanholding the steering lines but on closer inspection we could see the men crouching down like a mass of oilskin coats and souwesters  in a few minutes they were out of sight and we saw them no more but afterwards heard that the wrecked crew had been rescued and landed at deal  in this manner i obtained information sufficient to enable me to write the lifeboat a tale of our coast heroes and the floating light of the goodwin sands  a curious coincidence occurred when i was engaged with the lifeboat story which merits notice  being much impressed with the value of the lifeboat service to the nation i took to lecturing as well as writing on this subject  one night while in edinburgh in the spring of 1866 a deputation of working men some of whom had become deeply interested in lifeboat work asked me to redeliver my lecture  i willingly agreed to do so and the result was that the working men of edinburgh resolved to raise 400 pounds among themselves and present a boat to the institution  they set to work energetically appointed a committee which met once a week divided the city into districts canvassed all the principal trades and workshops and before the year was out had almost raised the necessary funds  in the end the boat was ordered and paid for and sent to edinburgh to be exhibited  it was drawn by six magnificent horses through the principal streets of the city with a real lifeboat crew on board in their souwesters and cork lifebelts  then it was launched in saint margarets loch at the foot of arthurs seat where it was upsetwith great difficulty by means of a large erection with blocks and ropesin order to show its selfrighting and selfemptying qualities to the thousands of spectators who crowded the hillsides  at this time the good people of glasgow had been smitten with a desire to present a lifeboat to the institution and in order to create an interest in the movement asked the loan of the edinburgh boat for exhibition  the boat was sent and placed on view in a conspicuous part of the city  among the thousands who paid it a visit was a lady who took her little boy to see it and who dropped a contribution into the box which stood invitingly alongside  that lady was the wife of a seacaptain who lost his ship on the coast of wigton where the edinburgh boat was stationed and whose life was saved by that identical boat  and not only so but the rescue was accomplished on the anniversary of the very day on which his wife had put her contribution into the collectingbox  sixteen lives were saved by it at that time and not long afterwards fourteen more people were rescued by it from the insatiable sea so that the working men of edinburgh have reason to be thankful for the success which has attended them in their effort to rescue the perishing  moreover some time afterwards the ladies of edinburghsmitten with zeal for the cause of suffering humanity and for the honour of their own romantic townput their pretty if not lusty shoulders to the wheel raised a thousand pounds and endowed the boat so that with gods blessing it will remain in all time coming on that exposed coast ready for action in the good cause    chapter five  descent into the cornish mines  from lighthouses lifeboats and firebrigades into the tin and copper mines of cornwall is a rather violent leap but by no means an unpleasant one  in the year 1868 i took this leap when desirous of obtaining material for deep down a tale of the cornish mines  for three months my wife and i stayed in the town of saint just close to the lands end during which time i visited some of the principal mines in cornwall associated with the managers captains and miners and tried my best to become acquainted with the circumstances of the people  the cornish tin trade is very old  in times so remote that historical light is dim the phoenicians came in their galleys to trade with the men of cornwall for tin  herodotus writing 450 years bc mentions the tin islands of britain under the name of the cassiterides and diodorus siculus writing about half a century bc says  the inhabitants of that extremity of britain which is called bolerion excel in hospitality and also by their intercourse with foreign merchants they are civilised in their mode of life  these prepare the tin working very skilfully the earth which produces it  there is said to be ground for believing that cornish tin was used in the construction of the temple of jerusalem  at the present time the men of cornwall are to be found toiling as did their forefathers in the days of old deep down in the bowels of the earthand even out under the bed of the seain quest of tin  tin copper and fish is one of the standing toasts in cornwall and in these three words lie the head backbone and tail of the county the sources of its wealth and the objects of its energies  as my visit however was paid chiefly for the purpose of investigating the mines i will not touch on fish here  having obtained introduction to the managers of botallackthe most famous of the cornish minesi was led through miles of subterranean tunnels and to depths profound by the obliging amiable and anecdotal captain janone of the captains or overseers of the mine  he was quite an original this captain jan a man who knew the forty miles of underground workings in botallack as well i suppose as a postman knows his beat a man who dived into the bowels of the earth with the vigour and confidence of a mole and the simpleminded serenity of a seraph  the land at this part of cornwall is not picturesque except at the seacliffs which rise somewhere about three hundred feet sheer out of deep water where there is usually no strip of beach to break the rush of the great atlantic billows that grind the rocks incessantly  the most prominent objects elsewhere are masses of debris huge pieces of wornout machinery tall chimneys and old enginehouses with big ungainly beams or bobs projecting from them  these bobs are attached to pumps which work continually to keep the mines dry  they move up and down very slowly with a pause between each stroke as if they were seriously considering whether it was worth while continuing the dreary work any longer and could not make up their minds on the point  their slow motions however give evidence of life and toil below the surface  other bobs standing idle tell of disappointed hopes and broken fortunes  there are not a few such landmarks at the lands endstern monitors warning wild and wicked speculators to beware  one dayit might have been night as far as our gloomy surroundings indicatedcaptain jan and i were stumbling along one of the levels of botallack i know not how many fathoms down  we wore miners hats with a candle stuck in front of each by means of a piece of clay  the hats were thicker than a firemans helmet though by no means as elegant you might have plunged upon them head first without causing a dint  captain jan stopped beside some fallen rocks  we had been walking for more than an hour in these subterranean labyrinths and felt inclined to rest  you were asking about the word wheal said the captain sticking his candle against the wall of the level and sitting down on a ledge it do signify a mine as wheal frances wheal owles wheal edwards and the like  when cornishmen do see a london company start a mine on a grand scale with a deal of fuss and superficial show and an imposing staff of directors etcetera while down in the mine itself where the real work ought to be done perhaps only two men and a boy are known to be at work they shake their heads and button up their pockets perhaps they call the affair wheal doem and when that mine stops becomes what we call a knacked bal it may be styled wheal donem  a traveller chanced to pass a waterwheel not long ago near saint just  whats that he said to a miner who sat smoking his pipe beside it  that sur why thats a pump that is  what does it pump asked the traveller  pump sur replied the man with a grim smile why et do pump gold out o the londoners  there have been too many wheal doems in cornwall  botallack mine is not i need scarcely say a wheal doem  it is a grand old minegrand because its beginning is enveloped in the mists of antiquity because it affords now and has afforded for ages back sustenance to hundreds of miners and their families besides enriching the country because its situation on the wild cliffs is unusually picturesque and because its dark shafts and levels not only descend to an immense depth below the surface but extend far out under the bottom of the sea  its enginehouses and machinery are perched upon the edge of a steep cliff and scattered over its face and down among its dark chasms in places where one would imagine that only a seagull would dare to venture  underground there exists a vast region of shafts and levels or tunnelsmostly low narrow and crooked placesin which men have to stoop and walk with caution and where they work by candlelighta region which is measured to the inch and has all its parts mapped out and named as carefully as are the fields above  some idea of the extent of this mine may be gathered from the fact that it is 245 fathoms 1470 feet deep and that all the levels put together form an amount of cutting through almost solid granite equal to nearly 40 miles in extent the deepest part of the mine is that which lies under the bottom of the sea threequarters of a mile from the shore and strange to say that is also the driest part of the mine  the great eastern would find depth of water sufficient to permit of her anchoring and floating securely in places where miners are at work blowing up the solid rock 1470 feet below her keela depth so profound that the wildest waves that ever burst upon the shore or the loudest thunder that ever reverberated among the cliffs could not send down the faintest echo of a sound  the ladderway by which the men descend to their work is 1230 feet deep it takes half an hour to descend and an hour to climb to the surface  it was a bright morning in may when i walked over from saint just with captain jan to pay my first underground visit to botallack  arrayed in the redstained canvas coat and trousers of the mine with a candle stuck in the front of our very strong hats and three spare ones each hung at our breasts we proceeded to the ladderway  this was a small platform with a hole in it just big enough to admit a man out of which projected the head of a strong ladder  before descending captain jan glanced down the hole and listened to a distant regular clicking soundlike the ticking of a clock  a man coming up said he well wait a minute  i looked down and in the profound abyss saw the twinkling of apparently a little star  the steady click of the miners nailed shoes on the iron rounds of the ladder continued and the star advanced until by its feeble light i saw the hat to which it was attached presently a man emerged from the hole and raising himself erect gave vent to a long deepdrawn sigh  it was i may say a suggestive sigh for there was a sense of intense relief conveyed by it  the man had just completed an hour of steady continuous climbing up the ladders after eight hours of nightwork in impure atmosphere and the first great draught of the fresh air of heaven must have seemed like nectar to his soul  his red garments were soaking perspiration streamed from every pore in his body and washed the red earth in streaks down his pale countenance  although pale however the miner was strong and in the prime of life  chills and bad air the two great demons of the mines had not yet smitten his sturdy frame with miners complaint he looked tired but not exhausted and bestowed a grave glance on me and a quiet nod on captain jan as he walked away to change his dress in the dryinghouse  my contemplation of the retiring miner was interrupted by captain jan sayingill go first sir to catch you if you should fall  this remark reminded me of many stories i had heard of men falling away from the ladders of beams breaking and letting them tumble into awful gulfs of stones giving way and coming down the shafts like grape or cannonshot and the like  however i stepped on the ladder and prepared to follow my guide into the regions of unchanging night  a few fathoms descent brought us into twilight and to a small platform on which the foot of the first ladder rested through a hole in this the head of the second ladder appeared  here we lighted the candles for the next laddera longer one 50 feet or sowould have landed us in midnight darkness  half way down it i looked up and saw the hole at the top like a large white star  at the foot i looked up again the star was gone and i felt that we were at last in a region where from the time of creation sunlight had never shone  down down ever downwards was the uppermost idea in my mind for some time after that  other thoughts there were of course but that one of neverending descent outweighed them all for a time  as we got lower the temperature increased then perspiration broke out  never having practised on the treadmill my muscles ere long began to feel the unwonted exercise and i thought to myself if you are in this state so soon what will you be when you get to the bottom and how will you get up again  at this point we reached the foot of another ladder and captain jan said well walk a bit in the level here and then go down the pumpshaft  the change of posture and action in the level we had now entered was agreeable but the path was not a good one  it was an old low and irregular level with a rugged floor full of holes with water in them and with projections in the roof that rendered frequent stooping necessary  the difficulty of ones progress in such places is that while you are looking out for your head you stumble into the holes and when the holes claim attention you run your head against the roof but thanks to the miners hat no evil follows  we were now in a region of profound silence  when we paused for a minute to rest it felt as if the silence of the tomb itself had surrounded usfor not the faintest echo reached us from the world above and the miners at work below us were still far down out of earshot  in a few seconds we came to a yawning hole in the path bridged by a single plank  captain jan crossed  how deep is it  i asked preparing to follow  about 60 feet said he its a winze and goes down to the next level  i held my breath and crossed with caution  are there many winzes captain jan  yes dozens of em  there are nigh 40 miles of levels and lots of winzes everywhere  the possibility of anything happening to captain jan and my light getting blown out occurred to me but i said nothing  when we had walked a quarter of a mile in this level we came to the point where it entered the pumpshaft  the shaft itself was narrowabout 8 or 10 feet in diameterbut everything in it was ponderous and gigantic  the engine that drove the pump was 70 horse power the pumprod was a succession of wooden beams each like the ridgepole of a house jointed togethera rugged affair with iron bolts and nuts and projections at the joints  in this shaft the kibbles were worked  these kibbles are iron buckets by which ore is conveyed to the surface  two are worked together by a chainone going up full while the other comes down empty both are free to clatter about the shaft and bang against each other in passing but they are prevented from damaging the pumprod by a wooden partition  between this partition and the pump was the ladder we had now to descend with just space for a man to pass  captain jan got upon it and as he did so the pump went up a sweep of 10 or 12 feet with a deep watery gurgle as if a giant were being throttled  as i got upon the ladder the pump came down with another gurgle close to my shoulder in passing  to avoid this i kept close to the planks on the other side but at that moment i heard a noise as if of distant thunder  its only the kibbles said captain jan  up came one and down went the other passing each other with a dire crash not far from where we stood and causing me to shrink into the smallest possible space  theres no danger said the captain encouragingly if you only keep cool and hold on  water was coursing freely down the shaft and spirting over us in fine spray so that ere long we were as wet and dirty as any miner in botallack  at last we reached the 120 fathom level 720 feet from grass  here the captain told me men were at work not far off and he wished to visit them  would i wait where i was until he returned  what said i wait in a draughty level with an extinguishable candle close to the main shaft with 30 or 40 miles of levels around and no end of winzes  no no captain jan go on ill stick to you now through thick and thin like your own shadow  with one of his benignant smiles the captain resumed his progress  in a few minutes i heard the clink of hammers and soon after came to a singular cavern  it was a place where the lode had been very wide and rich  years before it had been all cut away from level to level leaving a void space so high and deep that the rays of our candles were lost in obscurity  we walked through it in midair as it were supported on cross beams with planks laid thereon  beyond this we came to a spot where a number of miners were at work in various places and positions  one a big broadshouldered man named dan was seated on a wooden box hammering at the rock with tremendous energy  with him captain jan conversed a few minutes on the appearance of the lode and then whispered to me a good specimen of a man that sir and hes got an uncommon large familythen turning to the mani say dan youve got a biggish family havent you  iss aw iss capn jan ive a braave lot o childn  how many have you had altogether dan  ive had seventeen sur but ten of ems gone deadonly seven left my brother jim though hes had more than me  after a few more words we left this man and in another place found this brother jim working in the roof of the level with several others they had cut so high up in a slanting direction that they appeared to be in another chamber which was brilliantly lighted with their candles jim stripped naked to the waist stood on the end of a plank hammering violently  looking up into his curious burrow captain jan shoutedhallo  jim  hallo captain jan  heres a gentleman wants to know how many children youve had  how many childn say ee  why ive had nineteen sur but theres eleven of em gone dead  seven of em did come in three years and a halfthree doubles and a singlebut theres only eight of em alive now  i afterwards found that although this man and his brother were exceptions the miners generally had very large families  while we were talking a number of shots were heard going off in various directions  this was explained by captain jan  all the forenoon the miners employ their time in boring and charging the blastholes  about midday they fire them and then hasten to a clear part of the mine to eat luncheon and smoke their pipes while the gunpowder smoke clears away  this it does very slowly taking sometimes more than an hour to clear sufficiently so as to let the men resume work  immediately after the shots were heard the men began to assemble  they emerged from the gloom on all sides like red hobgoblinswet and perspiring  some walked out of darkness from either end of the level some stalked out from diverging levels others slid feet first from holes in the roof and sides and some rose headforemost from yawning gulfs in the floor  they all saluted captain jan as they came up and each stuck his candle against the wall and sat down on a heap of wet rubbish to lunch  some had cornish pasty and others a species of heavy cakeso heavy that the fact of their being able to carry it at all said much for their digestive organsbut most of them ate plain bread and all of them drank water which had been carried down from the realms of light in little canteens  frugal though the fare was it sufficed to brace them for the rest of the days work  after a short talk with these men captain jan and i continued our descent of the laddersdown we went ever downwards until at last we reached the very bottom of that part of the mine1230 feet below the surface  here we found only two men at work with whom captain jan conversed for a time while we rested and then proceeded to ascend to grass by the same ladderways  if i felt that the descent was like never getting to the bottom much more did the ascent seem like never getting to the top  i may remark here that the bottom which we had reached was not the bottom under the sea  at another time captain jan took me to that submarine cavern where as i have said no sound ever reaches the ear from the world above  there is however a level close under the sea where the roar of ocean is distinctly heard  it is in a part of botallack mine named wheal cock  it was very rich in copper ore and the miners worked at the roof of it so vigorously that they began to fear it would give way  one of them therefore in order to ascertain what thickness of solid rock still lay between them and the sea bored a small hole upwards and advanced about three feet or so before the water rushed in  of course they had a wooden plug ready and stopped up the hole  but as it was dangerous to cut away any more of the roof they were finally obliged unwillingly to forsake that part of the mine  this occurred some thirty years before my visit yet when i went to see the place i found the wooden plug still hard and fast in the hole and quite immoveable  as i stood and listened i could well understand the anxiety of the miners for at the upward rush of each wave i could hear the rattle of the boulders overhead like monster cannon balls and a repetition of the thunder when the waves retreated  on our way up the ladders we stopped several times to rest  at such times captain jan related various anecdotes illustrative of mining life  this is a place said he on one occasion which reminds me of a man who was always ready to go in for dangerous work  his name was old maggot  he was not really old but he had a son named after himself and his friends had to distinguish him from the young maggot  so saying captain jan trimmed his candle with natures own pair of snuffersthe finger and thumband proceeded as follows  some time ago the miners in botallack came to an old deserted mine that was full of waterthis is what miners call a house of water  the ore there was rich but the men were afraid to work it lest they should come suddenly on the old mine and break a hole through to itin other words hole to that house of water  they stopped working at last and no one seemed willing to run the risk of driving the hole and letting out the water  in this difficulty they appealed to old maggot who at once agreed to do it  the old mine was about threequarters of a mile back from the seashore but at that time it could only be got at by entering the adit level from the shore  it was through this level that the water would have to escape  at the mouth of it a number of men assembled to see old maggot go in  in he went alone with a bunch of candles and as he walked along he stuck a lighted candle every here and there against the wall to light him outfor he expected to have to run for it  when he came to the place the water was spirting out everywhere  but old maggot didnt mind  he grasped his hammer and borer and began  the work was done sooner than he had expected  suddenly the rock gave way and the water burst upon him putting out his candle and turning him heels over head  he jumped up and tried to run but the flood rose on him carried him off his legs swept him right through the level and hurled him through the aditmouth at last upon the seashore  he was stunned a little but soon recovered and beyond a few bruises and a wetting was nothing the worse of his adventure  that said captain jan pointing to the rock beside us was the place where old maggot holed to the house of water and this was the level through which he was washed and through part of which i will now conduct you  accordingly we traversed the level and coming to another shaft continued our upward progress  while we were slowly toiling up step by step we were suddenly arrested by the sound of voices singing in the far distance above us  the music was slow and solemn  coming as it did so unexpectedly in such a strange place it sounded quite magical and inexpressibly sweet  miners descending to work said my guide as we listened  the air was familiar to me and as it grew louder and louder i recognised that beautiful tune called french to which we are accustomed to sing the 121st psalm i to the hills will lift mine eyes  gradually the men came down to us  we stood on one side  as they passed they ceased singing and nodded to captain jan  there were five or six stout fellows and a boy  the latter was as active as his companions and his treble voice mingled tunefully with theirs as they continued the descent and resumed the psalm keeping time to the slow measured tread of their steps  we watched until their lights disappeared and then resumed our upward way while the sweet strains grew fainter and fainter until they were gradually lost in the depths below  the pleasant memory of that psalm still remained with me when i emerged from the laddershaft of botallack mine andafter having been five hours undergroundonce more drank in with a new and intensified power of appreciation the fresh air of heaven and the blessed influences of green fields and sunshine  to many a weird and curious part of the great mine did the obliging captain jan lead me but perhaps the most interesting part was the lowest depth under the sea to which my wife accompanied us  this part is reached by the boscawen shaft a sloping one which the men descend in an iron car or gig  the car is let down and hauled up by an iron rope once this rope broke the car flew to the bottom was dashed against the rock and all the meneight in numberwere killed  in 1865 the prince and princess of wales descended this shaft and captain jan was their amiable not to say eccentric guide  the captain was particularly enthusiastic in praise of the princess  he said that she was a fine intelligent young lady that she asked no end of questions would not rest until she understood everything and afterwards undertook to explain it all to her lessinformed companions a somewhat amusing incident occurred while they were underground  when about to begin his duty as guide it suddenly flashed across the mind of poor captain jan that in the excitement of the occasion he had forgotten to take gloves with him  he was about to lead the princess by the hand over the rugged floors of the levels  to offer to do so without gloves was not to be thought of  to procure gloves 200 fathoms below the sea was impossible  to borrow from the prince or the duke of sutherland who were of the party was out of the question  what was he to do  suddenly he remembered that he had a newspaper in his pocket in desperation he wrapped his right hand in a piece of this and thus covered held it out to the princess  she innocently supposing that the paper was held up to be looked at attempted to read  this compelled captain jan to explain himself whereupon she burst into a hearty fit of laughter and flinging away the paper took the ungloved hand of the loyal but bashful miner    chapter six  the land of the vikings  to this romantic land of mountain and flood i paid four visits at various times  these were meant as holiday and fishing rambles but were also utilised to gather material for future books  norway as every one knows was the land of the ancient vikingsthose grand old rascally freebooterswhose indomitable pluck carried them in their open galleys little better than big boats all round the coasts of europe across the unknown sea to iceland and even to the shores of america itself before the other nations dreamed of such a continent and long before columbus was born who possessed a literature long before we did whose blood we britons carry in our veins and from whom we have inherited many of our best laws much of our nautical enterprise and not a little of our mischief and pugnacity  norway too is the land where liberty once found refuge in distress that much abused goddess whom since the fall of adam and eve license has been endeavouring to defame and tyranny to murder but who is still alive and kickingay and will continue to kick and flourish in spite of all her enemies  liberty found a home and a rough welcome strange to say among those pagans of the north at a time when she was banished from every other spot even from the socalled christian states in europe  no wonder that that grand old country with its towering snowclad mountains its mighty fords its lonesome glens and its historical memories should be styled gamle norge old norwayas we speak of old england with feelings of affection by its energetic and now peaceful inhabitants  i was privileged to go to norway as one of a yachting party  there were twelve of us altogether three ladies three gentlemen and a crew of six sailors  our object was to see the land and take what of amusement discomfort or otherwise might chance to come in our way  we had a rough passage over and were very sick sailors included except the captain an old scotch highlander who may be described as a compound of obstinacy and guttapercha  it took us four days to cross  we studied the norse language till we became seasick wished for land till we got well then resumed the study of norse until we sighted the outlying islands and finally cast anchor in the quaint old city and port of bergen  now it is well to admit at once that some of us were poor linguists but it is only just to add that we could not be expected to learn much of any language in four days during intervals of internal derangement however it is curious to observe how very small an amount of norse will suffice for ordinary travellersespecially for scotchmen  the danish language is the vernacular tongue of norway and there is a strong affinity between danish or norse and broad scotch  roughly speaking i should say that a mixture of three words of norse to two of broad scotch with a powerful emphasis and a strong infusion of impudence will carry you from the naze to the north cape in perfect comfort  bergen is a most interesting city and our party had many small adventures in it which however i will not touch on here  but one scenethe fishmarketmust not be passed over  there must certainly be something in the atmosphere of a fishmarket which tends to call forth the mental and physical energies of mankind perhaps i should rather say of womankind and which calls forth a tremendous flow of abusive language  billingsgate is notorious but i think that the bergen fishmarket beats it hollow  one or two phases of the national character are there displayed in perfection  it is the billingsgate of norwaythe spot where norse females are roused to a pitch of frenzy that is not equalled i believe in any other country  there are one or two peculiarities about the bergen market too which are noteworthy and which account in some degree for the frantic excitement that reigns there  the sellers of the fish in the first place are not women but men  the pier and fleet of boats beside it constitute the marketplace  the fishermen row their cargoes of fish direct from the sea to the pier and there transact sales  there is a stout iron railing along the edge of that piera most needful safeguardover which the servant girls of the town lean and look down at the fishermen who look up at them with a calm seriocomic dontyouwishyoumaygetit expression that is deeply impressive bargains of course are not easily made and it is in attempting to make these that all the hubbub occurs  the noise is all on the womens side  the men secure in their floating position and certain of ultimate success pay very little attention to the flaxenhaired blueeyed damsels who shout at them like maniacs waving their arms shaking their fists snapping their fingers and flourishing their umbrellas  they all carry umbrellascotton onesof every colour in the rainbow chiefly pink and skyblue for bergen is celebrated as being the most rainy city in europe  the shouting of the girls is not only a safetyvalve to their feelings but is absolutely necessary in order to attract the attention of the men  as 15 or 20 of them usually scream at once it is only she who screams loudest and flourishes her umbrella most vigorously that can obtain a hearing  the calm unruffled demeanour of the men is as much a feature in the scene as is the frenzy of the women  during one of my visits i saw a fisherman there who was the most interesting specimen of cool impudence i ever encountered  he wore a blue coat kneebreeches white worsted stockings and on his head of long yellow hair a red nightcap with a tall hat on top of all  when i discovered him he was looking up with a grave sarcastic expression into the flushed countenance of a stout blueeyed lass who had just eagerly offered him syv skillings seven skillings for a lot of fish  that was about 3 and a half pence the skilling being half a penny  the man had declined by look not by tongue and the girl began to grow angry  haere du fiskman hear you fisherman she cried vil du har otte skillings  will you have eight skillings  the fisherman turned away and gazed out to sea  the girl grew crimson in the face at this  fiskman fiskman she cried vil du har ni nine skillings  the fisherman kicked out of the way a lobster that was crawling too near his naked toes and began to bale out the boat  the girl now seemed to become furious  her blue eyes flashed like those of a tiger  she gasped for breath while her cotton umbrella flashed over the fishermans head like a pink meteor  had that umbrella been only a foot longer the tall black hat would have come to grief undoubtedly suddenly she paused and in a tone of the deepest solemnity said  haere du fiskman vil du har ti ten shillings  the rock of gibraltar is not more unyielding than was that fiskman he took off his hat removed his nightcap smoothed his yellow hair and wiped his forehead then replacing the cap and hat he thrust both hands into his coat pockets turned his back on the entire market and began to whistle  this was too much  it was past female endurance  the girl turned round scattered the bystanders right and left and fled as if she had resolved then and there to dash out her brains on the first post she met and so have done with men and fish for ever  but she was not done with them yet  the spell was still upon her  ere she had got a dozen yards away she paused stood one moment in uncertainty and then rushing back forced her way to the old position and shouted in a tone that might have moved the hearts even of the dead fish  fiskman here du vil du hav tolve  tolve or twelve skillings was apparently not quite the sum he meant to take but he could hold out no longerhe waveredand the instant man wavers womans victory is gained  smiling benignly he handed up the fish to the girl and held out his baling dish for the money  the storm was over  the girl walked off in triumph with her fish not a trace of her late excitement visible the pink cotton umbrella tucked under her arm and her face beaming with the consciousness of having conquered a fiskman in fair and open fight  steamers ply regularly between the north and south of norway in summer and an excursion in one of these is very enjoyable not only on account of the scenery but because of the opportunity afforded of making the acquaintance of the people  i once made a voyage in one of those steamers from the nordfjord to bergen and one thing struck me very particularly on that occasion namely the quietness that seemed to be cultivated by the people as if it were a virtue  i do not mean to say that the passengers and crew were taciturnfar from it  they bustled about actively they were quite sociable and talkative but no voice was ever raised to a loud pitch  even the captain gave his orders in a quiet tone  whether this quietness of demeanour is peculiar to norwegian steamers in general or was a feature of this steamer in particular i am not prepared to say  i can only state the fact of the prevailing quietude on that particular occasion without pretending to explain it  the state of quiescence culminated at the dinnertable for there the silence was total  i never saw anything like it  when we had all assembled in the cabin at the almost whispered invitation of the steward and had stood for a few minutes looking benign and expectant but not talking the captain entered bowed to the company was bowed to by the company motioned us to our seats whispered ver so goot and sat down  now this phrase ver so goot merits particular notice  it is an expression that seems to me capable of extension and distension  it is a flexible comfortable jovial rollicking expression  to give a perfect translation of it is not easy but i cannot think of a better way of conveying its meaning than by saying that it is a compound of the phrasesbe so good by your leave whats your will bless your heart all serene and thats your sort  the first of these be so good is the literal translationthe others are the superinduced sentiments resulting from the tone and manner in which it is said  you may rely on it that when a norwegian offers you anything and says ver so goot he means you well and hopes you will make yourself comfortable  well there was no carving at that dinner  the dishes were handed round by waiters  first we had very thin rice soup with wine and raisins in itthe eating of which seemed to me like spoiling ones dinner with a bad pudding  this finished the plates were removed  now thought i surely some one will converse with his neighbour during this interval  no not a lip moved  i looked at my right and lefthand men i thought for a moment of venturing out upon the unknown deep of a foreign tongue and cleared my throat for that purpose but every eye was on me in an instant and the sound of my own voice even in that familiar process was so appalling that i said nothing  i looked at a pretty girl opposite me  i felt certain that the youth beside her was about to speakhe looked as if he meant to but he didnt  in a few minutes the next course came on  this was a dish like breadpudding minus currants and raisins it looked like a sweet dish but it turned out to be saltand pure melted butter without any admixture of flour or water was handed round as sauce  after this came veal and beef cutlets which were eaten with cranberry jam pickles and potatoes fourth and last came a course of cold spongecake with almonds and raisins stewed over it so that when we had eaten the cake as a sort of cold pudding we slid naturally and pleasantly into dessert without the delay of a change of plates  there was no remaining to drink at that dinner  when the last knife and fork were laid down we all rose simultaneously and then a general process of bowing ensued  in regard to this proceeding i have never been able to arrive at a clear understanding as to what was actually done or intended to be done but my impression is that each bowed to the other and all bowed to the captain then the captain bowed to each individually and to all collectively after which a comprehensive bow was made by everybody to all the rest all roundand then we went on deck to smoke  as each guest passed out he or she said to the captain tak for mad which is a manner and custom and means thanks for meat  with the exception of these three words not a single syllable to the best of my belief was uttered by any one during the whole course of that meal  of course the gentlemen of our party performed many wonderful exploits in fishing for seatrout and salmon abound in norway and the river beds are very rugged  in that land fishing cannot be styled the gentle art  it is a tearing wearing rasping style of work  an account of the catching of one fish will prove this  one morning i had gone off to fish by myself with a norwegian youth to gaff and carry the fish  coming to a sort of weir with a deep pool above and a riotous rapid below i put on a salmon fly and cast into the pool  at once a fish rose and was hooked  it was not a big oneonly 12 pounds or thereaboutsbut quite big enough to break rod and line if not played respectfully  for some time as is usual with salmon he rushed about the pool leaped out of the water and bored up stream  then he took to going down stream steadily  now this was awkward for when a fish of even that size resolves to go down stream nothing can stop him  my efforts were directed to turning him before he reached the rapid for once into that i should be compelled to follow him or break the lineperhaps the rod also  at last he reached the head of the rapid  i put on a heavy strain  the rod bent like a hoop and finally began to crack so i was compelled to let him go  at the lower end of the pool there was a sort of dam along which i ran but soon came to the end of it where it was impossible to reach the shore owing to the dense bushes which overhung the stream  but the fish was now in the rapid and was forced down by the foaming water  being very unwilling to break the line or lose the fish i went slowly into the rapid until the water reached the top of my long wading boots another step and it was over them but that salmon would notindeed could notstop  the water filled my boots at once and felt very cold at first but soon became warm and each boot was converted into a warmish bath in which the legs felt reasonably comfortable  i was reckless now and went on step by step until i was up to the waist then to the armpits and then i spread out one arm and swam off while with the other i held up the rod  the rapid was strong but deep so that nothing obstructed me till i reached the lower end when a rock caught my legs and threw me into a horizontal position with the rod flat on the water  i was thrown against the bank where my norwegian boy was standing mouth open eyes blazing and hand extended to help me out  when i stood panting on the bank i found that the fish was still on and still inclined to descend but i found that i could not follow for my legs were heavy as leadthe boots being full of water  to take the latter off in a hurry and empty them was impossible  to think of losing the fish after all was maddening  suddenly a happy thought struck me handing the rod to the boy i lay down on my back cocked my legs in the air and the water ran like a deluge out at the back of my neck  much relieved i resumed the rod but now i found that the fish had taken to sulking  this sulking is very perplexing for the fish bores its nose into some deep spot below a stone and refuses to budge  pulling him this way and that way had no effect  jerking him was useless  even throwing stones at him was of no avail  i know not how long he kept me there but at last i lost patience and resolved to force him out or break the line but the line was so good and strong that it caused the rod to show symptoms of giving way  just then it struck me that as there were several posts of an old weir in the middle of the stream he must have twisted the line round one of these broken himself off and left me attached to it  i made up my mind therefore to wade out to the old weir and unwind the line and gave the rod to the boy to hold while i did so  the water was deep  it took me nearly up to the neck before i reached the shallow just above the posts but being thoroughly wet that did not matter  on reaching the post and unwinding the line i found to my surprise that the fish was still there  at first i thought of letting go the line and leaving the boy to play him but thought i the boy will be sure to lose him so i held on to the line and played it with my hands  gradually the fish was tired out  i drew him slowly to my side and gaffed him in four feet of water  even then i was not sure of him for when i got him under one arm he wriggled violently so that it was difficult to wade ashore with him in this difficulty i took him to a place where the shoal in the middle of the stream was about three inches deep  there i lay down on him picked up a stone and hammered his head with it while the purling water rippled pleasantly over my face  the whole of this operation took me upwards of two hours  it will be seen therefore that fishing in norway as i have said cannot be called the gentle art  one extremely interesting excursion that we made was to a place named the esse fjord  the natives here were very hospitable and kind besides that they were fat  it would almost seem as if fat and goodhumour were invariably united for nearly all the natives of the esse fjord were goodhumoured and stout  the language at this place perplexed me not a little  nevertheless the old proverb where theres a will theres a way held good for the way in which i conversed with the natives of that region was astounding even to myself  one bluff goodhumoured fellow took me off to see his house and family i may as well admit here that i am not a good linguist and usually left our ladies to do the talking  but on this occasion i found myself for the first time alone with a norwegian fairly left to my own resources  well i began by stringing together all the norse i knew which wasnt much and endeavoured to look as if i knew a great deal more  but i soon found that the list of sentences which i had learned from murrays handbook did not avail much in a lengthened conversation  my speech quickly degenerated into sounds that were almost unintelligible to either my new friend or myself and i terminated at last in a mixture of bad norse and broad scotch  i have already remarked on the strong familylikeness between norse and broad scotch  here are a few specimens  they call a cow a coo  a house is a hoose and a mouse is a moose  gaae til land is go to land or go ashore  tak ain stole is take a stool or sit down  vil du tak am dram scarcely needs translationwill you take a dram and the usual answer to that question is equally clear and emphaticya jeg vil tak am dram  one day our pilot saw the boat of a fisherman or fiskman not far off  he knew we wanted fish so putting his hands to his mouth he shouted fiskman har du fisk to sell  if you talk of bathing they will advise you to dook oonder and should a mother present her baby to you she will call it her smook barnher pretty bairnsmook being the norse word for pretty and barn for child and it is a curious fact worthy of particular note that all the mothers in norway think their bairns smookvery smook and they never hesitate to tell you sowhy i cannot imagine unless it be that if you were not told you would not be likely to find it out for yourself  despite our difficulty of communication my fat friend and i soon became very amicable and talkative  he told me no end of stories of which i did not comprehend a sentence but looked as if i didsmiled nodded my head and said ya yato which he always replied ya yawaving his arms and slapping his breast and rolling his eyes as he bustled along beside me towards his dwelling  the house was perched on a rock close to the waters edge  here my host found another subject to expatiate upon and dance round in the shape of his own baby a soft smooth little imitation of himself which lay sleeping in its crib like a small cupid  the man was evidently extremely fond of this infant  he went quite into ecstasies about it now gazing at it with looks of pensive admiration anon starting and looking at me as if to say did you ever in all your life see such a beautiful cherub the mans enthusiasm was really catchingi began to feel quite a fatherly interest in the cherub myself  oh he cried in rapture det er smook barn  ya ya said i megit smook very prettyalthough i must confess that smoked bairn would have been nearer the mark for it was as brown as a redherring  i spent an agreeable though i must confess mentally confused afternoon with this gentleman who when he succeeded in tearing himself away from that muchloved and megit smook barn introduced me to his two sisters who were stout and goodhumoured like himself  they treated me to a cup of excellent coffee and to a good deal more of incomprehensible conversation  altogether the natives of the esse fjord made a deep impression on us and we parted from their grand and gloomy but hospitable shores with much regret  i had hoped good reader to have jotted down some more of my personal reminiscences of travelin algiers the pirate city at the cape of good hope and elsewherebut bad health is not to be denied and i find that i must hold my hand  perchance this may be no misfortune for possibly the garrulity of age is descending on me  before closing this sketch however i would say briefly that in all my writings i have always triedhow far successfully i know notto advance the cause of truth and light and to induce my readers to put their trust in the love of god our saviour for this life as well as the life to come    chapter seven  the burglars and the parson  a country mansion in the south of england  the sun rising over a laurelhedge flooding the ivycovered walls with light and blazing in at the large baywindow of the diningroom  take my word for it robin if ever this ouse is broke into it will be by the dininroom winder  so spake the gardener of the mansionwhich was also the parsonageto his young assistant as they passed one morning in front of the window in question  for why he continued the winder is low an the catches aint overstrong an theres no bells on the shutters an it lies handy to the wall o the back lane  to this robin made no response for robin was young and phlegmatic  he was also strong  the gardener simon by name was not one of the prophetsthough in regard to the weather and morals he considered himself onebut if any person had chanced to overhear the conversation of two men seated in a neighbouring publichouse that morning that person would have inclined to give the gardener credit for some sort of second sight  bill growled one of the said men over his beer in a low almost inaudible tone ive bin up to look at the ouse an the dininroom winderll be as easy to open as a door on the latch  i had a good look at it  you are the man for cheek an pluck growled the other man over his beer with a glance of admiration at his comrade  how ever did you manage it dick  the usual way in course  comed it soft over the ousemaid said i was a gardener in search of a job an would she mind tellin me where the headgardener was  you see bill i had twigged him in front o the ouse five minutes before  i dont know as hes got any odd jobs to give ee says she but hes in the front garden at this minute  if you goes round youll find him  hall right my dear says i an away i goes right round past the dininroom winder where i stops an looks about like as if i was awful anxious to find somebody  in coorse i glanced in an saw the fastenins  they couldnt keep out a babby  sideboard all right at the tother end with a lookinglass over itto help folk i fancy to see what they look like wen theyre aeatin their wittles  anyhow it helped me to see the gardener comin up one o the side walks so i wheels about double quick an looked pleased to see him  hallo cries he  i was lookin for you says i quite easy like  did you expect to find me in the dininroom says he  not just that says i but its natral for a feller to look at a andsome room wen he chances to pass it  ah says he in a sort o way as i didnt quite like  what dee want wi me  i wants a job says i  are you a gardener he axed  yesleastwise says i ive worked a goodish bit in gardings in my time an can turn my and to amost anythink  oh says he  look ere my man what dee call that there tree he pinted to one close alongside  that says i  well itit looks uncommon like a happle  do it says he  now look ere you be off as fast as your legs can take you or ill set the ousedog at ee  wen he said that bill i do assure you lad that my experience in the ring seemed to fly into my knuckles an it was as much as ever i could do to keep my left off his nob and my right out of his breadbasket  but i restrained myself  if theres one thing im proud of bill its the wirtue o selfrestraint in the way o business  i wheeled about held up my nose an walked off wi the air of a dook you see i didnt want for to have no more words wi the gardenerfor why because id seen all i wanted to seedee see  but there was oneno twothings i saw which it was as well i did see  an what was they asked bill  two statters  an what are statters  man alive i dont ye know  its them things that they make out o stone an marable an chalksometimes men sometimes women sometimes babbies an mostly with no cloes on to speak of  oh  i know but i call em statoos  fire away dick what seed you about the statoos  why i seed that they wasnt made in the usual way of stone or chalk but of iron  i have heerd say that sodgers long ago used to fight in them sort o dresses though i dont believe it myself  anyhow there they was the two of em one on each side of the winder that stiff that they could stand without nobody inside of em an one of em with a big thing on his shoulder as if he wor ready to smash somebody over the head  i thought to myself if you an me bill had come on em unbeknown like wed ha got such a start as might have caused us to make a noise  but i hadnt time to think much for it was just then i got sight o the gardener  now my plan is continued dick swigging off his beer and lowering his voice to a still more confidential tone as he looked cautiously round my plan is to hang about here till dark then take to the nearest plantation an wait till the moon goes down which will be about two oclock i the morninwhen it will be about time for us to go in and win  all right said bill who was not loquacious  but bill was mistaken for it was all wrong  there was indeed no one in the public at that early hour of the day to overhear the muttered conversation of the plotters and the box in which they sat was too remote from the bar to permit of their words being overheard but there was a broken pane of glass in a window at their elbow with a seat outside immediately below it  just before the burglars entered the house they had observed this seat and noticed that no one was on it but they failed to note that a small sleepyheaded potboy lay at full length underneath it basking in the sunshine and meditating on nothingthat is nothing in particular  at first little pat paid no attention to the monotonous voices that growled softly over his head but one or two words that he caught induced him to open his eyes very wide rise softly from his lair and sit down on the seat cock one ear intelligently upward and remain so absolutely motionless that dick had he seen him might have mistaken him for a very perfect human statter  when little pat thought that he had heard enough he slid off the seat crawled close along the side of the house doubled round the corner rose up and ran off towards the parsonage as fast as his little legs could go  the reverend theophilus stronghand was a younger son of a family so old that those families which came over with the conqueror were mere moderns in comparison  its origin indeed is lost in those mists of antiquity which have already swallowed up so many millions of the human race and seem destined to go on swallowing with everincreasing appetite to the end of time  the stronghands were great warriorsof course  they could hardly have developed into a family otherwise  the reverend theophilus however was a man of peace  we do not say this to his disparagement  he was by no means a degenerate son of the family physically he was powerful broad and tall and his courage was high but spiritually he was gentle and in manner urbane  he drew to the church as naturally as a duck draws to the water and did not by any means grudge to his elder brothers the army the navy and the bar  one of his pet theories was to overcome by love and he carried this theory into practice with considerable success  perhaps no one put this theory to the test more severely or frequently than his only son harry  war had been that young gentlemans chief joy in life from the cradle  he began by shaking his fat fists at the universe in general  wartotheknife with nurse was the chronic condition of a stormy childhood  intermittent warfare with his only sister emmie chequered the sky of his early boyhood and a decided tendency to disobey wrung the soul of his poor mother and was the cause of no little anxiety to his father while mischief pure and simple for its own sake was the cherished object of his life  nevertheless harry stronghand was a lovable boy and love was the only power that could sway him  the lad grew better as he grew older  love began to gain the day and peace beganslowly at firstto descend on the parsonage but the desire for mischiefwhich the boy named funhad not been quite dislodged at the time we write of  as harry had reached the age of fifteen feared nothing and was quickwitted and ingenious his occasional devices not only got him into frequent hot water but were the source of some amusement to his peopleand he still pretty well ruled his easygoing father and the house generally with a rod of iron  it was to harry stronghand that little pat directed his steps after overhearing the conversation which we have related  pat knew that the son of the parsonage was a hero and in his opinion the most intelligent member of the family and the best fitted to cope with the facts which he had to reveal  he met the object of his search on the road  plaze yer honour said patwho was an irishman and therefore honoured everybodytheres two tramps at the public as is plottin to break into your house i the mornin  you dont mean it do you returned harry with a smile and raised eyebrows  thats just what i do yer honour  i heard em reel off the whole plan  hereupon the boy related all that he knew to the youth who leaned against a gate and nodded his curly head approvingly until the story was finished  youve not mentioned this to any one have you pat  niver a sowl but yersilf sir  youre a sensible boy pat  heres a shilling for youand look here pat if you keep dark upon the matter till after breakfast tomorrow and dont open your lips to a living soul about it ill give you half a crown  thank yer honour  now mindno hints to the police no remarks to your master  be dumb in fact from this moment else i wont give you a penny  sure ive forgot all about it already sir said the boy with a wink so expressive that harry felt his word to be as good as his bond and went back to the parsonage laughing  arrived there he went in search of his sister but found that she was out  just as well he muttered descending to the diningroom with his hands deep in his pockets a pleased expression on his handsome mouth and a stern frown on his brows  it would not be safe to make a confidant of her in so delicate a matter  no ill do it all alone but how to do it  that is the question  shall i invite the aid of the police  perish the thought  shall i consult the pater  better not the dear selfdevoted man might take it out of my hands altogether  harry paused in profound meditation  he was standing near the window at the time with the statters on either hand of him  they were complete suits of armourone representing a knight in plate armour the other a crusader in chainmail  both had been in the family since two of the stronghand warriors had followed richard of the lion heart to the east  as the eldest brother of the reverend theophilus was in india the second was on the deep and the lawyer was dead the iron shells of the ancient warriors had naturally found a restingplace in the parsonage along with several family portraits which seemed to show that the males of the race were prone to look very stern and to stand in the neighbourhood of pillars and red curtains in very dark weather while the females were addicted to old lace scant clothing and benign smiles  one of the warriors stood contemplatively leaning on his sword the other rested a heavy mace on his shoulder as if he still retained a faint hope that something might turn up to justify his striking yet one more blow  what would you advise old man said harry glancing up at the crusader with the mace  the question was put gravely for ever since he could walk or do anything the boy had amused himself by putting freeandeasy questions to the suits of armour or defying them to mortal combat  as he was true to ancient friendships he had acquired the habit of giving the warriors an occasional nod or word of recognition long after he had ceased to play with them  shades of my ancestors exclaimed harry with sudden animation gazing earnestly at the crusader on his right the very thing  ill do it  that evening after tea he went to his fathers study  may i sit up in the diningroom tonight father till two in the morning  well it will puzzle you to do that tonight my son but you may if you have a good reason  my reason is that i have a problema very curious problemto work out and as i positively shant be able to sleep until ive done it i may just as well sit up as not  do as you please harry i shall probably be up till that hour myself if not laterfor unexpected calls on my time have prevented the preparation of a sermon about which i have had much anxious thought of late  indeed father remarked the son in a sympathetic tone on observing that the reverend theophilus passed his hand somewhat wearily over his brow  what may be your text  be gentle showing meekness to all men answered the worthy man with an abstracted faraway look as if he were wrestling in anticipation with the seventh head  well goodnight father and please dont think it necessary to come in upon me to see how i am getting on  i never can work out a difficult problem if there is a chance of interruption  all right my songoodnight  hm thought harry as he returned to the diningroom in a meditative mood i am afraid daddy that youll find it hard to be gentle to some men tonight  however we shall see  ringing the bell he stood with his back to the fire gazing at the ceiling  the summons was answered by the gardener who also performed the functions of footman and manofallwork at the parsonage  simon i am going out and may not be home till late  i want either you or robin to sit up for me  very well sir  and continued the youth with an air of offhand gravity i shall be obliged to sit up working well into the morning so you may have a cup of strong coffee ready for me  wait until i ring for itperhaps about two in the morning  i shall sit in the diningroom but dont bring it until i ring  mind that for i cant stand interruptionas you know  yes sir  simon knew his imperious young master too well to make any comment on his commands  he returned therefore to the kitchen told the cook of the order he had received to sit up and take master harrys coffee to him when he should ring and made arrangements with robin to sit up and help him to enliven his vigil with a game of draughts  having thus made his arrangements harry stronghand went out to enjoy a walk  he was a tremendous walkerthought nothing of twenty or thirty miles and rather preferred to walk at night than during the day especially when moon and stars were shining  perhaps it was a dash of poetry in his nature that induced this preference  about midnight he returned went straight to the diningroom and entering shut the door while simon retired to his own regions and resumed his game with robin  a small fire was burning in the diningroom grate the flickering flames of which leaped up occasionally illuminated the frowning ancestors on the walls and gleamed on the armour of the ancient knight and the crusader  walking up to the latter harry looked at him sternly but as he looked his mouth relaxed into a peculiar smile and displayed his magnificent teeth as far back as the molars  then he went to the window saw that the fastenings were right and drew down the blinds  he did not think it needful to close the shutters but he drew a thick heavy curtain across the opening of the baywindow so as to shut it off effectually from the rest of the room  this curtain was so arranged that the iron sentinels were not covered by it but were left in the room as it were to mount guard over the curtain  this done the youth turned again to the crusader and mounted behind him on the low pedestal on which he stood  unfastening his chainmail armour at the back he opened him up so to speak and went in  the suit fitted him fairly well for harry was a tall strapping youth for his years and when he looked out at the aperture of the headpiece and smiled grimly he seemed by no means a degenerate warrior  returning to the fireplace he sat down in an easy chair and buried himself in a favourite author  one oclock struck  harry glanced up nodded pleasantly as if on familiar terms with time and resumed his author  the timepiece chimed the quarters  this was convenient  it prevented anxious watchfulness the halfhour chimed  harry did not move  then the threequarters rang out in silvery tones  thereupon harry arose shut up his author blew out his light drew back the heavy curtains and returning to the armchair sat down to listen in comparative darkness  the moon by that time had set and darkness profound had settled down upon that part of the universe  the embers in the grate were just sufficient to render objects in the room barely visible and ghostlike  presently there was the slightest imaginable sound near the baywindow it might have been the crusaders ghost but that was not likely for at the moment something very like harrys ghost flitted across the room and entered into the warrior  again the sound was heard more decidedly than before  it was followed by a sharp click as the inefficient catch was forced back  then the sash began to rise softly slowlyan eighth of an inch at a time during this process harry remained invisible and inactive paterfamilias in the study addressed himself to the sixth head of his discourse and the gardener with his satellite hung in silent meditation over the draughtboard in the kitchen  after the sash stopped rising the centre blind was moved gently to one side and the head of dick appeared with a furtive expression on the countenance  for a few seconds his eyes roved around without much apparent purpose then as they became accustomed to the dim light a gleam of intelligence shot from them the rugged head turned to one side the coarse mouth turned still more to one side in its effort to address some one behind and in a whisper that would have been hoarse had it been loud enough dick said  hall right bill  we wont need matches  keep clear o the statters in passin  as he spoke dicks hobnailed boot appeared his corduroy leg followed and next moment he stood in the room with a menacing look and attitude and a short thick bludgeon in his knuckly hand  bill quickly stood beside him  after another cautious look round the two advanced with extreme careeach step so carefully taken that the hobnails fell like roseleaves on the carpet  feeling that the coast was clear dick advanced with more confidence until he stood between the ancient warriors whose pedestals raised them considerably above his head  at that moment there was a sharp click as of an iron hinge  dicks heart seemed to leap into his throat  before he could swallow it the iron mace of the crusader descended with stunning violence on his crown  well was it for the misguided man that morning that he happened to have purchased a new and strong billycock the day before else would that mace have sent himas it had sent many a saracen of oldto his long home  the blow effectually spoilt the billycock however and stretched its owner insensible on the floor  the other burglar was too close behind his comrade to permit of a second blow being struck  the lively crusader however sprang upon him threw his mailed arms round his neck and held him fast  and now began a combat of wondrous ferocity and rare conditions  the combatants were unequally matched for the man was huge and muscular while the youth was undeveloped and slender but what the latter lacked in brute force was counterbalanced by the weight of his armour his youthful agility and his indomitable pluck  by a deft movement of his legs he caused bill to come down on his back and fell upon him with all his weight plus that of the crusader  annoyed at this and desperately anxious to escape before the house should be alarmed bill delivered a roundabout blow with his practised fist that ought to have driven in the skull of his opponent but it only scarified the mans knuckles on the crusaders helmet  he tried another on the ribs but the folds of chainmail rendered that abortive  then the burglar essayed strangulation but there again the folds of mail foiled him  during these unavailing efforts the unconscious dick came in for a few accidental raps and squeezes as he lay prone beside them  meanwhile the crusader adopted the plan of masterly inactivity by simply holding on tight and doing nothing  he did not shout for help because being bulldoggish in his nature he preferred to fight in silent ferocity  exasperated as well as worn by this method bill became reckless and made several wild plunges to regain his feet  he did not succeed but he managed to come against the pedestal of the knight in mail with great violence  the iron warrior lost his balance toppled over and came down on the combatants with a hideous crash suggestive of coalscuttles and fireirons  sleep sermons and draughts could no longer enchain  mrs stronghand awoke buried her startled head in the bedclothes and quaked  emmie sprang out of bed and huddled on her clothes under the impression that fireengines were at work  the reverend theophilus leaped up seized the study poker and a lamp and rushed towards the diningroom overturning the draughtboard simon grasped a rollingpin robin the tongs and both made for the same place  they all collided at the door burst it open and advanced to the scene of war  it was a strange scene  bill and the crusader still struggling were giving the remains of the other knight a lively time of it and dick just beginning to recover was sitting with a dazed look in a sea of iron debris  thats right hit him hard father cried harry trying to look round  no dont sir cried the burglar i gives in  let my sonlet the crusalet him go then said the reverend gentleman raising his poker  i cant sir cause he wont let me go  all right ill let you go now said harry unclasping his arms and rising with a longdrawn sigh  now you  come to the light and lets have a look at you  so saying the lad thrust his mailed hand into the burglars neckerchief and assisted by the reverend theophilus led his captive to the light which had been put on the table  the gardener and robin did the same with dick  for one moment it seemed as if the two men meditated a rush for freedom for they both glanced at the still open window but the stalwart simon with the rollingpin and the sturdy robin with the tongs stood between them and that mode of exit while the crusader with his mace and huge mr stronghand with the study poker stood on either side of them  they thought better of it  bring two chairs here said the clergyman in a gentle yet decided tone  robin and harry obeyedthe latter wondering what the governor was going to be up to  sit down said the clergyman quietly and with much solemnity  the burglars humbly obeyed  now my men i am going to preach you a sermon  thats right father interrupted harry in gleeful surprise  give it em hot  dont spare them  put plenty of brimstone into it  but to harrys intense disgust his father put no brimstone into it at all  on the contrary without availing himself of heads or subdivisions he pointed out in a few plain words the evil of their course and the only method of escaping from that evil  then he told them that penal servitude for many years was their due according to the law of the land  now said he in conclusion you are both of you young and strong men who may yet do good service and honest work in the land  i have no desire to ruin your lives  penal servitude might do so  forgiveness may save youtherefore i forgive you  there is the open window  you are at liberty to go  the burglars had been gazing at their reprover with wideopen eyes they now turned and gazed at each other with halfopen mouths then they again turned to the clergyman as if in doubt but with a benignant smile he again pointed to the open window  they rose like men in a dream went softly across the room stepped humbly out and melted into darkness  the parsons conduct may not have been in accordance with law but it was eminently successful for it is recorded that those burglars laid that sermon seriously to heartat all events they never again broke into that parsonage and never again was there occasion for harry to call in the services of the ancient knight or the crusader    chapter eight  jim greely the north sea skipper  when nellie sumner married james greelythe strapping skipper of a yarmouth fishingsmackthere was not a prettier girl in all the town at least so said or thought most of the men and many of the women who dwelt near her  of course there were differences of opinion on the point but there was no doubt whatever about it in the mind of james greely who was overwhelmed with astonishment as well as joy at what he styled his luck in catching such a splendid wife  and there was good ground for his strong feeling for nellie was neat tidy and goodhumoured as well as goodlooking and she made jims home as neat and tidy as herself  theres always sunshine inside o my house said greely to his mates once no matter what sort o weather there may be outside  ere long a squall struck that housea squall that moved the feelings of our fisherman more deeply than the fiercest gale he had ever faced on the wild north sea for it was the squall of a juvenile jim  from that date the fisherman was wont to remark with a quiet smile of satisfaction that he had got moonlight now as well as sunshine in the yarmouth home  the only matter that distressed the family at first was that the father saw so little of his lightsome home for his calling being that of a deepsea smacksman or trawler by far the greater part of our fishermans rugged life was spent on the restless ocean  two months at sea and eight days ashore was the unvarying routine of jims life summer and winter all the year round  that is to say about fifty days on shore out of the year and three hundred and fifteen days on what the cockney greengrocer living next door to jim styled the owlin deep  and truly the greengrocer was not far wrong for the wild north sea does a good deal of howling off and on during the year to say nothing of whistling and shrieking and other boisterous practices when the winter gales are high  but a cloud began to descend very gradually at first on james greelys dwelling for a demona very familiar one on the north seahad been twining his arms for a considerable time round the stalwart fisherman  at the time of jims marriage those missionships of the dutchand we may add of the devilnamed copers or floating grogshops were plying their deadly traffic in strong drink full swing among the trawlers of the north sea  through gods blessing the missionships of the cross have now nearly driven the copers off the sea but at the time we write of the dutchmen had it all their own way and many a splendid man whom toil cold hardship and fierce conflict with the elements could not subdue was laid low by the poisonous spirits of the coper  greely went to the copers at first to buy tobacco but being a hearty sociable fellow he had no objection to take an occasional friendly dram  gradually imperceptibly he became enslaved he did not give way at once  he was too much of a man for that  many a deadly battle had he with the demonknown only to himself and god but as he fought in his own strength of course he failed failed again and again until he finally gave way to despair  poor nellie was quick to note the change and tried with a brave heart at first but a sinking heart at last to save him but without success the eight days which used to be spent in the sunny home came at last to be spent in the green dragon publichouse and in course of time nellie was taught by bitter experience that if her husband on his periodical return from the sea went straight from the smack to the publichouse it was little that she would see of him during his spell on shore  even curlyheaded juvenile jimmiehis fathers prideceased to overcome the counterattraction of strong drink  is it to be wondered at that nellie lost some of her old characteristicsthat the wages being spent on drink she found it hard to provide the mere necessaries of life for herself and her boy and that she finally gave up the struggle to keep either person or house as neat and orderly as of yore while a haggard look and lines of care began to spoil the beauty of her countenance  or is it a matter for surprise that her temper began to give way under the strain  you are ruining yourself and killing me said the sorelytried wife one eveningthe last evening of a spell on shoreas jim staggered into the once sunny home to bid his wife goodbye  it was the first time that nellie had spoken roughly to him  he made no answer at first  he was angry  the green dragon had begun to demoralise him and the reproof which ought to have melted only hardened him  the last of the coals are gone continued the wife with bitterness in her tone and theres scarcely enough of bread in the house for a good supper to jimmie  you should be ashamed of yourself jim  a glare of drunken anger shot fiercely from the fishermans eyes  no word did he utter  turning on his heel he strode out of the house and shut the door after him with cannonshot violence  o jimstop jim burst from timid nellie  ill never  she ceased abruptly for the terrified jimmie was clinging to her skirts and her husband was beyond the reach of her voice  falling on her knees she prayed to god passionately for pardon  it was their first quarrel  she ended by throwing herself on her bed and bursting into a fit of sobbing that not only horrified but astounded little jim to see his mother sobbing wildly while he was quiet and grave was a complete inversion of all his former experiences  as if to carry out the spirit of the situation he proceeded to act the part of comforter by stroking his mothers brown hair with his fat little hand until the burst of grief subsided  dare yous dood now muzzer  tiss me he said  nellie flung her arms round the child and kissed him fervently  meanwhile james greelys smack the dolphin was running down the yare before a stiff breeze and jim himself had commenced the most momentous and in one sense disastrous voyage of his life  as he stood at the tiller guiding his vessel with consummate skill out into the darkening waters his heart felt like lead  he would have given all he possessed to recall the past hour to have once again the opportunity of bidding nellie goodbye as he had been wont to do in the days that were gone but it was too late  wishes and repentance he knew avail nothing to undo a deed that is done  jim toiled with that branch of the north sea fleets which is named the short blue  it was trawling at a part of the north sea called botney gut at that time but our fisherman had been told that it was fishing at another part named the silverpits  it blew hard from the norwest with much snow so that jim took a long time to reach his destination but no short blue fleet was to be seen at the silverpits  to the eyes of ordinary men the north sea is a uniform expanse of water calm or raging as the case may be  not so to the deepsea trawler jims intimate knowledge of localities his soundinglead and the nature of the bottom etcetera enabled him at any time to make for and surely find any of the submarine banks  but fleets though distinguished by a name have no local habitation  they may be on the dogger bank today on the swarte bank or the great silverpits tomorrow  with hundreds of miles of open sea around and neither milestone nor fingerpost to direct a lost fleet is not unlike a lost needle in a haystack  fortunately jim discovered a brother smacksman looking like himself for his own fleet  being to windward the brother ran down to him  what cheer o  have ee seen anything o the red cross fleet roared the skipper with the power of a brazen trumpet  no shouted jim in similar tones  im lookin for the short blue  i passed it yesterday bearin away for botney gut  bout ship went jim and away with a stiff breeze on his quarter  he soon found the fleeta crowd of smacks all heading in the same direction with their huge trawling nets down and bending over before what was styled a good fishingbreeze  it requires a stiff breeze to haul a heavy net with its forty or fifty feet beam and other gear over the rough bottom of the north sea  with a slight breeze and the net down a smack would be simply anchored by the stern to her own gear  down went jims net and like a welldrilled fisherman he fell into line  it was a rough grey day with a little snow falling which whitened all the ropes and covered the decks with slush  greelys crew had become demoralised like their skipper  there were five men and a fairhaired boy  all could drink and swear except the boy  charlie was the only son of his mother and she was a good woman besides being a widow  charlie was the smacks cook  grubs ready cried the boy putting his head up the hatchway after the gear was down  he did not name the meal  smacksmen have a way of taking food irregularly at all or any hours when circumstances permit and are easy about the name so long as they get it and plenty of it  a breakfast at midday after a night of hardest toil might be regarded indifferently as a luncheon or an early dinner  black whistler the mate who stood at the helm pronounced a curse upon the weather by way of reply to charlies summons  you should rather bless the ladies on shore that sent you them wursted mittens an elmet you ungrateful dog returned the boy with a broad grin for he and whistler were on familiar terms  the man growled something inaudible while his mates went below to feed  each north sea trawling fleet acts unitedly under an admiral  it was early morning when the signal was given by rocket to haul up the nets between two and three hours at the capstanslow heavy toil with every muscle strained to the utmostwas the result of the admirals order bitter cold driving snow cutting flashes of salt spray and dark as erebus save for the light of a lantern lashed to the mast  tramp tramp tramp the seemingly everlasting round went on with the clank of heavy seaboots and the rustle of hard oilskins and the sound of labouring breath as accompaniment while the endless cable came slowly up from the vasty deep  but everything comes to an end even on the north sea  at last the great beam appears and is secured  with a sigh of relief the capstan bars are thrown down and the men vary their toil by clawing up the net with scarred and benumbed fingers  it is heavy work causes much heaving and gasping and at times seems almost too much for all hands to manage  again black whistler pronounces a malediction on things in general and is mockingly reminded by the boycook that he ought to bless the people as sends him wursted cuffs to save his wrists from seablisters  seems to me weve got a hold of a bit o noahs ark growled one of the hands as something black and big begins to appear  he is partially right for a bit of an old wreck is found to have been captured with a ton or so of fish  when this is disengaged the net comes in more easily and the fish are dropped like a silver cataract on the wet deck  one might imagine that there was rest for the fishermen now  far from it  the fish had to be cleanedie gutted and the superfluous portions cut off and packed in boxes for the london market  the grey light of a bleak winter morning dawned before the work was finished during the operation the third hand lively dick ran a fishbone deeply into his hand and laid a foundation for future trouble  it was noon before the trunks or fishboxes were packed  then the little boat had to be launched over the side loaded with fish and ferried to one of the steamers which ply daily and regularly between billingsgate and the fleets  three men jumped into it and pushed offa mere cockleshell on a heaving flood now dancing on a wavecrest now lost to view in a watervalley  whats that said whistler as they pulled towards the steamer looks bigger than the ornary missionships  why that must be the noo hospitalship the queen victoria answered lively dick glancing over his shoulder at a large vessel smackrigged which loomed up through the haze to leeward  they had no time for further remark for the great side of the steamer was by that time frowning over them  it was dangerous work they had to do  the steamer rolled heavily in the rough sea  the boat among a dozen other boats was soon attached to her by a strong rope  men had to be athletes and acrobats in order to pass their fishboxes from the leaping and plunging boats to the deck of the rolling steamer  the shouting and noise and bumping were tremendous  an awkward heave occasionally sent a box into the sea amid oaths and laughter  jims cargo was put safely on board and the boat was about to cast off when a heavier lurch than usual caused black whistler to stagger  to save himself from plunging overboard he laid both hands on the gunwale of the boata dangerous thing to do at any time when alongside of a vessel before he could recover himself the boat went crashing against the steamers iron side and the fishermans hands were crushed  he fell back into the boat almost fainting with agony  no cry escaped him however  lively dick saw the blood streaming and while his mate shoved off the boat he wrapped a piece of canvas in a roughandready fashion round the quivering hands  im done for this trip groaned whistler for this means go ashore weeks in hospitalwages stopped and wife and chicks starving  never a bit mate said dick didnt you know that the noo missionship does hospital work afloat and that theyll keep you aboard of her and lend us one o their hands till youre fit for work again  whether poor whistler believed or understood or was comforted by this we cannot say for he made no reply and appeared to be almost overcome with pain  on reaching the dolphin a signal of distress was made to the floating hospital which at once bore down to them  the injured man was transferred to it and there in the pleasant airy cabin black whistler made acquaintance with men who were anxious to cure his soul as well as his body  up to this time he had resolutely declined to visit the missionships but now when a skilled medical man tenderly dressed his terrible wounds and a sympathetic skipper led him to a berth and supplied him with some warm coffee telling him that he would be free to remain there without charge as long as was needed and that meanwhile one of the mission hands would take his place in the dolphin till he was able to resume work his opinion of missionships and work underwent modification and he began to think that mission crews were not such a bad lot after all  meanwhile skipper greely leaving his man in the queen victoria returned to his smack accompanied by george king the new hand  kings position was by no means an enviable one for he found himself thus suddenly in the midst of a set of men who had no sympathy with him in religious matters and whose ordinary habits and conversation rendered remonstrance almost unavoidable  unwilling to render himself obnoxious at first the man resolved to try the effect of music on his new shipmates  he happened to possess a beautiful tenor voice and the first nighta calm bright onewhile taking his turn at the helm he sang in a soft sweet voice one after another of those hymns which mr sankey has rendered so popular  he began with come to the saviour make no delay and the first effect on his mates most of whom were below was to arouse a feeling of contempt  but they could not resist the sweetness of the voice  in a few minutes they were perfectly silent and listening with a species of fascinationeach being wafted both by words and music to scenes on shore and to times when his spirit had not been so demoralised by sin  greely in particular was transported back to the sunny home in yarmouth and to the days of firstlove before the demon had gained the mastery and clouded the sunshine  as the night wore on a fog settled down over the north sea and the smacks of the short blue fleet began to blow their foghorns while the crews became more on the alert and kept a bright lookout  suddenly and without warning a dull beating sound was heard by the lookout on the dolphin  next moment a dark object like a phantom ship loomed out of the fog and a wild cry arose as the men saw the bows of a huge ocean steamer coming apparently straight at them  the smack was absolutely helpless without steering way  for an instant there was shouting on board the steamer and she fell off slightly as she rushed into the small circle of the dolphins light  a tremendous crash followed but the change of direction had been sufficient to prevent a fatal collision  another moment and the great steamer was gone while the little smack rocked violently from the blow as well as from the swell left in the steamers wake  this was but the beginning of a night of disaster  skipper greely and his men had scarcely recovered from the surprise of this incident when the fog lifted and quickly cleared away revealing the short blue fleet floating all round with flapping sails but it was observed also that a very dark cloud rested on the northwestern horizon  soon a stiffish breeze sprang up and the scattered fleet drew together lay on the same tack and followed the lead of their admiral to whom they looked for the signal to shoot the trawls  but instead of giving this order the admiral signalled to layto  being disgusted as well as surprised that their leader was not going to fish jim greely being also exhausted by long watching went below and turned in to have a sleep  he had not been long asleep when fairhaired charlie came to tell him that lively dick who acted as mate in whistlers absence wanted him on deck  he ran up at once  looks like dirty weather skipper said dick pointing to windward  right you are lad said jim and called all hands to closereef  this being done and everything made snug the skipper again turned in with orders to call him if things should get worse  soon after dick who was at the helm saw a squall bearing down on them but did not think it worth while to call the skipper  it broke on them with a clap like thunder but the good dolphin stood the shock well and dick was congratulating himself when he saw a sea coming towards them but sufficiently astern he thought to clear them  he was wrong  it broke aboard right into the mainsail cleared the deck and hove the smack on her beamends  this effectually aroused the skipper who made desperate but at first ineffectual efforts to get out of his berth for the water which poured down the hatchway washed gear tackles turpentinetins paintpots and nearly everything moveable from the iron locker on the weatherside down to leeward and blocked up the openings  making another effort he cleared all this away and sprang out of the berth which was half full of water  pitchy darkness enshrouded him for the water had put out the lights as well as the fire  just then the vessel righted a little  are you all right on deck shouted jim as he scrambled up the hatchway  all right as far as i can see answered dick  hold on ive a bottle o matches in my bunk cried the skipper returning to the flooded cabin  fortunately the matches were dry a light was struck and a candle and lamp lighted  the scene revealed was not reassuring  the water in the cabin was kneedeep  a flare made of a woollen scarf soaked in paraffin was lighted on deck and showed that the mainsail had been split the boat hopelessly damaged and part of the lee bulwarks broken  the mast also was leaning aft the forestay having been carried away  a few minutes later lively dick went tumbling down into the cabin all of a heap to avoid the mast as it went crashing over the side in such a way as to prevent the use of the pumps and carrying the mizzenmast along with it  go to work with buckets boys or shell sink shouted the skipper himself setting the example for the ballast had shifted and the danger was great  meanwhile george king seized an axe and cut away the rigging that held on to the wrecked masts and fairhaired charlie laboured like a hero to clear the pumps  the rays of the cabin lights did not reach the deck so that much of the work had to be done in what may be styled darkness visible while the little vessel kicked about like a wild thing in the raging sea and the torn canvas flapped with a horrible noise pitiless wind laden with sleet howled over them as if thirsting impatiently for the fishermens lives  at last they succeeded in clearing the pumps and worked them with untiring energy for hours but could not tell how many for the thick end of a marlinespike had been driven through the clockface and stopped it  it was still dark when they managed to rig up a jurymast on the stump of the old one and hoist a shred of sail  george king was ordered to the tiller  as he passed greely he said in a cheerful voice trust in the lord skipper he can bring us out o worse than this  it might have been half an hour later when another sea swept the deck jim took shelter under the stump of the mast and held on for dear life charlie got inside the coil of the derrickfall and so was saved while the others dived into the cabin  when that sea had passed they found no one at the tiller  poor king had been washed overboard  nothing whatever could be done for him even if he had been seen but the greedy sea had swallowed him and he was taken to swell with his tuneful voice the company of those who sing on high the praises of redeeming love  the sea which swept him into eternity also carried away the jurymast and as the smack was now a mere wreck liable to drift on shore if the gale should continue long jim let down an anchor after removing its stock so that it might drag on the bottom and retard the drifting while it kept the vessels head to the sea  a watch was then set and the rest of the crew went below to wait and wish for daybreak  it was a dreary vigil under appalling circumstances for although the smack had not actually sprung a leak there was always the danger of another sea overwhelming and altogether sinking her  her crew sat there for hours utterly helpless and literally facing death fortunately their matches had escaped the water so that they were able to kindle a fire in the stove and obtain a little warmth as well as make a pot of tea and eat some of their seasoaked biscuit  it is wonderful how man can accommodate himself to circumstances  no sooner had the crew in this wreck felt the stimulating warmth of the hot tea than they began to spin yarns not indeed of a fanciful kindthey were too much solemnised for thatbut yarns of their experience of gales in former times  it minds me o this wery night last year said lively dick endeavouring to light his damp pipe  i was mate o the beauty at the time  we was workin wi the short blues on the dogger when a tremendous squall struck us an it began to snow that thick we could scarce see the end o the jibboom  well the gale came on in real arnest before long so we had to layto all that night  when it came day we got some sail set and i went below to have a hot pot o tea when the skipper suddenly sang out jump up here dick an i did jump up double quick to find that we was amost runnin slap into a dismasted craft  we shoved the tiller hard astarboard and swung round as if we was on a swivel goin crash through the rackage alongside an shavin her by a hair  we could just see through the snow one of her hands choppin away at the riggin and made out that her name was the henry and thomas  an did ye see nothin more of er arter that asked the boy charlie with an eager look  nothin more  she was never heard of arter that mornin  while the men were thus talking the watch on deck shouted that one of the missionships was close alongside  every one ran on deck to hail her for they stood much in need of assistance two of their watercasks having been stove in and everything in the hold turned topsyturvy beef potatoes flour all mixed up in horrible confusion  just then another sea came on board and the crew had to dive again to the cabin for safety  that sea carried away the boat and the rest of the starboard bulwarks besides starting a plank and letting the water in at a rate which the pumps could not keep down  quickly the missionship loomed up out of the grey snowcloud and ran past  youll want help shouted the mission skipper  ay we do shouted jim greely in reply  were sinkin and our boats gone  an arm thrown up indicated that the words were understood  a few minutes later and the crew of the dolphin saw the mission crew launching their little boat  with such a sea running the venture was perilous in the extreme but when the mission skipper said wholl go he had no lack of volunteers  the boat was manned at once and the crew of the dolphin were rescued a few minutes before the dolphin herself went headforemost to the bottom  just as they got safely on deck the missionship herself shipped a heavy sea which washed several of the men into the lee scuppers  they jumped up immediatelysome with thank god on their lips others with a laughbut james greely did not rise he lay stunned and rolling about in the water  it was found on raising him that his right leg was broken at the thigh  when jim recovered consciousness he did not complain  he was a man of stern mould and neither groaned nor spoke but he was not the less impressed with the kindness and apparent skill with which the mission skipper treated him  having received a certain amount of surgical training the skipper although unlearned and a fishermanknew well how to put the leg in splints and otherwise to treat the patient  its pretty bad i fear he said soothingly observing that jims lips were compressed and that beads of perspiration were standing on his brow  jim did not reply but smiled grimly and nodded for the rolling of the ship caused him increasing agony as the injured parts began to inflame  im not very good at this sort o work said the mission skipper modestly but thank god the new hospitalship is cruisin wi the short blue just now  i saw her only yesterday so well put you aboard of her and there youll find a reglar shoregoin surgeon up to everything and with all the gimcracks and arrangements of a reglar shoregoin hospital  theyve got a new contrivance tooa sort o patent stretcher invented by a mr dark o the head office in londonwhichll take you out o the boat into the ship without movin a bone or muscle so keep your mind easy skipper for youll be aboard the queen victoria before many hours go by  poor greely appreciated the statement about the stretcher more than all the rest that was said for he was keenly alive to the difficulty of passing a brokenboned man out of a little boat into a smack or steamer in a heavy sea having often had to do it  the mission skipper was right for early the next day jim was strapped to a wonderful frame and passed into the hospitalship without shake or shock and his comrades were retained in the mission smack until they could be sent on shore  greely and his men learned many lessons which they never afterwards forgot on board of the queen victoriathe foundation lesson being that they were lost sinners and that jesus christ came to seek and to save the lost  slowly and at first unwillingly skipper greely took the great truths in  several weeks passed and he began to move about with some of his wonted energy  much to his surprise he found himself one morning signing the temperance pledgebooks persuaded thereto by the skipper of the queen victoria  still more to his surprise he found himself one sunday afternoon listening with unwonted tears in his eyes to some of his mates as they told their spiritual experiences to an assembly of some hundred or so of weatherbeaten fishermen  before quitting that vessel he discovered that he possessed a powerful and tuneful voice admirably adapted for singing hymns and that he was capable of publicly stating the fact that he was an unworthy sinner saved by grace  when at last he returned ashore and unexpectedly entered the yarmouth home nellie could scarcely believe her senses so great was the change  jim she cried with opening eyes and beating heart youre like your old self again  thank god said jim clasping her in his strong arms  but he could say no more for some time  then he turned suddenly on curlyheaded jimmie who had been fiercely embracing one of his enormous seaboots and began an incoherent conversation and a riotous romp with that juvenile fisherman  a brighter sunshine than had ever been there before enlightened that yarmouth home for god had entered it and the hearts of its occupants  example is wellknown to be infectious  in course of time a number of brother fishermen began to think as jim greely thought and feel as he felt  his house also became the centre or headquarters of an informal association got up for the purpose of introducing warmth and sunshine into poor homes in all weathers and there were frequently such large meetings of the members of that association that it taxed nellies ingenuity to supply seats and stow them all away  she managed it however for as jim was wont to remark nellie had a powerful intellec for her size  among the frequenters of this yarmouth home were several of the men who had once been staunch supporters of the green dragon and of these the most enthusiastic perhaps if not the most noisy were black whistler lively dick and fairhaired charlie    chapter nine  a northern waif  if a waif is a lost wanderer then little poosk was a decided waif for he had gone very much astray indeed in the north american backwoods  it was a serious matter for an indian child of six years of age to become a waif in the dead of winter with four feet of snow covering the entire wilderness and the thermometer far below zero  yes little poosk was lost  his indian mother when she tied up his little head in a fur cap with earpieces had said to him that morning and it was a new years day morningpoosk you go straight to the missionhouse  the feast will be a very grand oneoh such a good one  better than the feast we have when the geese and ducks come back in spring  go straight dont wander follow in your fathers tracks and you cant go wrong  ah what a compliment to father would have been implied in these words had the mother meant his moral tracks  but she did not she referred to his snowshoe tracks which would serve as a sure guide to the missionhouse if closely followed  poosk had promised to obey orders of course as readily as if he had been a civilised white boy and with equal readiness had forgotten his promise when the first temptation came  that temptation had come in the form of a woodpartridge in chase of which with the spirit of a true son of the forest poosk had bolted and soon left his fathers tracks far behind him  thus it came to pass that in the pursuit of game our little savage became a waif and stray  had he been older he would doubtless have returned on his own little track to the spot where he had left that of his father but being so young he fancied that he could reach it by bending round towards it as he advanced  poosk was uncommonly small for his agehence his name which in the cree language means half  he came at the tailend of a very large family  being remarkably small from the first he was regarded as the extreme tip of that tail  his father styled him half a childpoosk but his lack of size was counterbalanced by great physical activity and sharp intelligence  wrapped in his warm deerskin coat which was lined with flannel and edged with fur and secured with a scarlet belt with his little legs in ornamented leggings his little feet in new moccasins and shod with little snowshoes not more than twentyfour inches long by eight broadhis fathers being fivefeet by fifteen inchesand his little hands in leather mittens of the bagandthumb order poosk went over the snow at an amazing rate for his size but failed to rejoin his fathers track  suddenly he stopped and a pucker on his brow betrayed anxiety  compressing his little lips he looked round him with an expression of serious determination in his large brown eyes  was he not in his native wilds  was he not the son of a noted brave  was he going to submit to the disgrace of losing his way and what was much worse losing his feast  certainly not  with stern resolve on every lineament of his infantile visage he changed his direction and pushed on  we need scarcely add that he soon stopped again resolved and reresolved to succeed and changed his direction again and again till he became utterly bewildered and finally sitting down on the trunk of a fallen tree shut his eyes opened his little mouth and howled  it was sad but it was natural that at so early a period of life the stoicism of the savage should be overcome by the weakness of the child  finding after a while that howling resulted in nothing but noise poosk suddenly shut his mouth and opened his eyes there seemed to be some intimate connection between the two operations perhaps there was  the opening of the eyes went on to the uttermost and then became a fixed glare for right in front of him sat a white rabbit on its hind legs and from its expression evidently filled with astonishment equal to his own  the spirit of the hunter arose and that of the child vanished as little poosk sprang up and gave chase  of course the rabbit sloped and in a few minutes both pursued and pursuer were lost in the depths of the snowencumbered forest  on a point of rocks which jutted out into a frozen lake stood a small church with a small spire small porch and diminutive windows  the pastor of that church dwelt close to it in a wooden house or log cabin which possessed only one window and a door  a much larger hut alongside of it served as a schoolhouse and meetinghall  in this little building the man of god assisted by a red indian convert taught the red men of the wilderness the way of life through jesus christ besides giving them a little elementary and industrial education suited to their peculiar circumstances and here on the day of which we write he had prepared the sumptuous feast to which reference has just been made  the pastors wife and daughter had prepared it  there were venison pies and ptarmigan pasties there were roasts of fowls and roasts of rabbits and stews of many things which we will not venture to describe besides puddings of meat and puddings of rice and puddings of plums also tea and coffee to wash it all down  there was no strong drink  strong health and appetite were deemed sufficient to give zest to the proceedings  the company was remarkably savage to look at but wonderfully civilised in conduct for the influence of christian love was there and that influence is the same everywhere  leathern garments clothed the men curtailed petticoats adorned the women both wore leggings and moccasins  the boys and girls were similarly costumed and all had brilliant teeth brown faces glittering eyes lank black hair and a look of eager expectancy  the pastor went to the head of the table and silence ensued while he briefly asked gods blessing on the feast  then when expectation had reached its utmost point there was a murmur  where was the smallest mite of all the guests  nobody knew  poosks mother said she had sent him off hours ago and had thought that he must be there  poosks fathera very tall man with remarkably long legshearing this crossed the room in three strides put on his fivefeet by fifteeninch snowshoes and went off into the forest at express speed  anxiety is not an easilyroused condition in the north american indian the feast began despite the absence of our waif and the waifs mother set to work with undiminished appetite  meanwhile the waif himself went farther and farther astrayswayed alternately by the spirit of the stoic and the spirit of the little child  but little poosk was made of sterling stuff and the two spirits had a hard battle in him for the mastery that wintry afternoon  his chase of the rabbit was brought to an abrupt conclusion by a twig which caught one of his snowshoes tripped him up and sent him headlong into the snow  when snow averages four feet in depth it affords great scope for ineffectual floundering the snowshoes kept his feet near the surface and the depth prevented his little arms from reaching solid ground  when at last he recovered his perpendicular his hair eyes nose ears sleeves and mittens were stuffed with snow and the childspirit began to whimper but the stoic sprang on him and quickly crushed him down  drawing his little body up with a look of determination and wiping away the tears which had already begun to freeze on his eyelashes our little hero stepped out more vigorously than ever in the full belief that every yard carried him nearer home though in reality he was straying farther and farther from his fathers track  well was it for little poosk that day that his hope of reaching home did not depend on his own feeble efforts  already the father was traversing the wilderness in search of his lost lamb though the lamb knew it not  but poosks disasters were not yet over  although brave at heart and for his years sturdy of frame he could not withstand the tremendous cold peculiar to those regions of ice and snow and ere long the fatal lethargy that is often induced by extreme frost began to tell  the first symptom was that poosk ceased to feel the cold as much as he had felt it some time before  then a drowsy sensation crept over him and he looked about for a convenient spot on which to sit down and rest alas for the little savage if he had given way at that time fortunately a small precipice was close in front of him its upper edge concealed by wreaths of snow  he fell over it turning a somersault as he went down and alighted safely in a snowbed at the bottom  the shock revived him but it also quelled the stoic in his breast  rising with difficulty he wrinkled up his brown visage and once again took to howling  half an hour later his father steadily following up the little track in the snow reached the spot and heard the howls  a smile lit up his swarthy features and there was a gleam of satisfaction in his black eyes as he descended to the spot where the child stood  sudden calm after a storm followed the shutting of poosks mouth and the opening of his eyes  another moment and his father had him in his strong arms turned him upside down felt him over quietly shook him a little ascertained that no bones were broken put him on his broad shoulders and carried him straight back to the mission hall where the feasters were in full swinghaving apparently quite forgotten the little waif and stray  north american indians as is wellknown are not demonstrative  there was no shout of joy when the lost one appeared  even his mother took no further notice of him than to make room for him on the form beside her she was a practical mother  instead of fondling him she proceeded to stuff him which she was by that time at leisure to do having just finished stuffing herself  the father stalking sedately to a seat at another table proceeded to make up for lost time  he was marvellously successful in his efforts  he was one of those indian braves who are equal to any emergency  although near the end of the feast and with only debris left to manipulate he managed to refresh himself to his entire satisfaction before the tables were cleared  the feast of reason which followed was marked by one outstanding and important failure  the pastor had trained the indian boys and girls of his school to sing several hymns and repeat several pieces in prose and verse  our waif besides being the smallest boy possessed the sweetest voice in the school  he was down on the programme for a hymna solo having fallen sound asleep after being stuffed it was found difficult to awake him when his turn came  by dint of shaking however his mother roused him up and set him on his legs on a table where he was steadied a little by the pastors wife and gently bid to begin by the pastors daughter  poosk was very fond of the pastors daughter  he would have done anything for her  he opened his large eyes from which a sleepy gleam of intelligence flashed  he opened his little mouth from which rolled the sweetest of little voices  the indians who had been purposely kept in ignorance of this musical treat were ablaze with surprise and expectation but the sound died away the mouth remained open and the eyes shut suddenly as poosk fell over like a ninepin sound asleep into the arms of the pastors daughter  nothing more was to be got out of him that day  even the boisterous laugh which greeted his breakdown failed to rouse him and finally our northern waif was carried home and put to bed beside a splendid fire in a warm robe of rabbit skins    chapter ten  how to make the best of life from a young mans standpoint  this world is full of niches that have to be filled of paths that have to be trod of work that has to be done  pouring continually into it there are millions of human beings who are capable of being fitted to fill those niches to traverse those paths and to do that work  i venture a step further and assert that every human being without exception who arrives at the years of maturity must in the nature of things have a particular niche and path and work appointed for him and just in proportion as a man finds out his exact work and walks in or strays from his peculiar path will be the success of his life  he may miss his aim altogether and his life turn out a failure because of his selfwill or perhaps his mistaken notions and there are few sights more depressing than that of a round young man rushing into a square hole except that of a square young man trying to wriggle himself into a round hole  what the world wants is the right man in the right place  what each man wants is to find his right place  but the fact that man may and often does make a wrong choice that he may try to traverse the wrong path to accomplish the wrong work and do many things in the wrong way is a clear proof that his course in life is not arbitrarily fixed that he has been left to the freedom of his own will and may therefore fall short of the best though he may be fortunate enough to attain the good or the better  hence devolves upon every one the responsibility of putting and finding an answer to the questionhow shall i make the best of life  and let me say here in passing that i venture to address young men on this subject not because i conceive myself to be gifted with superior wisdom but because being an old man i stand on the heights and vantage ground of experience and looking back can see the rocks and shoals and quicksands in lifes ocean which have damaged and wellnigh wrecked myself  i would not only try my hand as a pilot to guide but as in some sense a buoy or beacon to warn from dangers that are not only unseen but unsuspected  every young man of ordinary common sense will at least aim at what he believes to be best in life and the question will naturally arisewhat is best  if a youths chief idea of felicity is to have a good time to enjoy himself to the utmost to cram as much of sport fun and adventure into his early manhood as possible with a happygolucky indifference as to the future he is not yet in a frame of mind to consider our question at all  i feel disposed to say to himin paraphrasebe serious man or if ye cant be serious be as serious as ye can while we consider a subject that is no trifling matter  what then is best  i replyso to live and work that we shall do the highest good of which we are capable to the world and in the doing thereof achieve the highest possible happiness to ourselves and to those with whom we are connected  in the end to leave the world better than we found it  now there is only one foundation on which such a life can be reared and that foundation is god  to attempt the building on any other or to neglect a foundation altogether is to solicit and ensure disaster  but supposing young man that you agree with me in this are fully alive to the importance of the question and are desirous of obtaining all the light you can on it then i would with all the earnestness of which i am capable urge you to begin on this sure foundation by asking god to guide you and open up your way  ask and ye shall receive seek and ye shall find  commit thy way unto the lord and he will bring it to pass  without this beginning there is there can be no possibility of real success no hope of reaching the best  with it there may still be partial mistakeowing to sin and liability to err but there can be no such thing as absolute failure  mans first prayer in all his plans of life should belord what wilt thou have me to do  many people think that they have put up that petition and got no answer when the answer is obviously before their eyes  it seems to me that gods answers are always indicative and not very difficult to understand  an anxious father saysif he does not also praywhat shall i train my boy to be  god through the medium of common sense replies watch your son observe his tastes and especially his powers and train him accordingly  his capacities whatever they are were given to him by his maker for the express purpose of being developed  if you dont develop them you neglect a clear indication unless indeed it be held that men were made in some haphazard way for no definite purpose at all but this would be equivalent to making out the creator to be less reasonable than most of his own creatures  if a lad has a strong liking for some particular sort of work or pursuit and displays great aptitude for it there is no need of an audible voice to tell what should be his path in life  contrariwise strong dislike coupled with incapacity indicates the path to be avoided with equal precision  of course liking and disliking are not a sufficient indication for both may be based upon partial ignorance  the sea as a profession is a case in point  how many thousands of lads have an intense liking for the idea of a sailors life  but the liking is not for the sea it is for some romantic notion of the sea and the romancers aptitude for a sea life must at first be taken for granted while his experience is nil  he dreams probably of majestic storms or heavenly calms of coral islands and palm groves and foreign lands and peoples  if very imaginative he will indulge in malay pirates and wrecks and lifeboats and desert islands on which he will always land safely and commence a second edition of robinson crusoe  but he will scarcely think till bitter experience compels him of very long watches in dirty unromantic weather of holystoning the decks scraping down the masts and clearing out the coalhole  happily for our navy and the merchant service there are plenty of lads who go through all this and stick to it their love of the ocean is triumphantbut there are a few exceptions  on the other hand liking and fitness may be discovered by experience i know a man who from childhood took pleasure in construction and invention  at the age of nine he made a real steam engine which could go with steam and which was small enough to be carried in his pocket he was encouraged to follow the providential indication went through all the drudgery of workshops and is now a successful engineer  of course there are thousands of lads whose paths are not so clearly marked out but does it not seem reasonable to expect that with prayer for guidance and thoughtful consideration on the part of the boys parents as well as of the boy himself the best path in life may be discovered for each  no doubt there are many difficulties in the way as when parents are too ambitious or when sons are obstinate and selfwilled or when both are antagonistic to each other  if as is not infrequently the case a youth has no particular taste for any profession and shows no very obvious capacity for anything is it not a pretty strong indication that he was meant to tread one of the many subordinate paths of life and be happy therein  all men cannot be generals  some must be content to rub shoulders with the rank and file  if a lad is fit only to dig in a coal pit or sweep the streets he is as surely intended to follow these honourable callings as is the captain who has charge of an ocean steamer to follow the sea  and even in the selection of these lowly occupations the path is divinely indicated while the freewill is left to the influence of common sense so that the robust youth with powerful frame and sinews will probably select the pit and the comparatively delicate man will prefer the crossing  i repeat to say that any creature was called into being for no purpose at all is to question the wisdom of the almighty  even if a babe makes its appearance on this terrestrial scene and wails out its brief career in a single day it was sent here for a special purpose else it would not have been sent and that purpose must have been fully accomplished else it would not have died  to my mind this is an exceedingly cheering view of things for it encourages the belief that however poor or feeble may have been our efforts to live a good life these efforts cannot have been made in vain even although they may fall very far short of the best  and there is also this very hopeful consideration to comfort us that the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong that wisdom sometimes proceeds out of the mouths of babes and that we little know what great things from little things may rise  to be sure that cuts both ways for what sometimes are called little sins may result in tremendous evil but equally efforts that seem insignificant may be the cause of great and unexpected blessing  if then as i sincerely believe every living being has a special work to door rather has a variety of appropriate paths in any one of which he may walk with more or less advantage to himself and his fellowmenit behoves every young man to find out what path is the best one for him and to walk in it vigorously  fatalism is folly  no one believes in it  at least no one in this country acts upon it  when i say that every being has a special work to do i dont mean that it has been decreed exactly what each man has to do  were this so he would have to do it nolens volens and there would be no such thing as responsibilityfor it would be gross injustice to hold a man responsible for that which he could by no means prevent or accomplish that which has really been decreed is that man shall have freewill and be allowed to exercise that freewill in the conduct of his affairs  it is a most mysterious gift but there it isan unquestionable factand it must be taken into account in all our reasoning  there is a confusion here into which men are sometimes liable to fall  mans will is absolutely free but his action is not so  he may will just as he pleases but all experience tells us that he may not do just as he pleases  whether his intentions be good or bad they are frequently and effectively interfered with but his willnever  seeing then that there is a best way for every one and that there are sundry common sense methods by which the path may be discovered it may be well to consider for a moment whether there are not some obstacles which stand in the way of a young mans success in life not only because they are providentially allowed to lie there but because the young man himself either carelessly or unwittingly has planted them in his own path  selfishness is one of those obstacles  and by selfishness i do not mean that gross form of it which secures for the man who gives way to it a bad name but those subtle phases of it which may possibly be allied with much that is good amiable and attractive  it is not unfrequently the consequence of that thoughtlessness which results in evil not less than does want of heart  talking too much about oneself and ones own affairs and being too little interested in the affairs of others is one aspect of the selfishness to which i refer  some men the moment they meet you begin to talk energetically about what they have been doing or thinking or about what they are going to do and if you encourage them they will go on talking in the same strain totally forgetting that you may chance to be interested in other things  such men if they begin young and are not checked soon degenerate into bores and no bore however wellmeaning or even religious ever succeeded in making the best of life  the cure for this is to be foundas usualin the scripture wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereto according to thy word  and what says the word  look not only on your own things but upon the things of others  i have a friend who was the confidant of a large number of his kindred and of many other people besides  it was said of him that everybody went to him for sympathy and advice  i can well believe it for he never spoke about himself at all that i can remember  he was not unusually wise or superlatively clever but he had a heart at leisure from itself to soothe and sympathise  the consequence was that in spite of a good many faults he was greatly beloved  and it is certain reader that to gain the affection of your fellowmen is one of the surest steps in the direction of success in life  to be too much concerned in conversation about yourself your affairs and your opinions will prove to be a mighty obstruction in your way  perhaps one of the best methods of fighting against this tendency is to resolve when meeting with friends never to begin with self but always with them  but it is hard to crucify self  this mode of procedure be it observed would not be a hypocritical exhibition of interest where none was felt but an honest attempt to snub self by deliberately putting your friends interests before your own  it is probable that we are not sufficiently alive to the influence of comparatively insignificant matters on success in life  illegible handwriting for instance may go far to retard or arrest a youths success  it sometimes interferes with friendly intercourse  i once had a friend whose writing was so illegible and the cause of so much worry in mere decipherment that i was constrained to give up epistolary correspondence with him altogether  there can be little doubt that many a wouldbe author fails of success because of the illegibility of his penmanship for it is impossible that an editor or publisher can form a fair estimate of the character or value of a manuscript which he has much difficulty in reading  there is one thing which men are prone to do and which it would be well that they should not do and that is nail their colours to the mast in early youth  the world is a school  we are ever learningor ought to beand in some cases never coming to a knowledge of the truth is not this partly owing to that fatal habit of nailing the colours  i do not for a moment advocate the holding of opinions loosely  on the contrary whether a man be young or old whenever he gets hold of what he believes to be true he ought to grasp it tenaciously and with a firm grip but he should never nail it  being fallible man is liable to more or less of error and therefore ought to hold himself open to correctionay even to conversion  new or stronger light may convince him that he has been wrongand if a man will not change when he is convinced or fully persuaded in his own mind he has no chance of finding out how to make the best of life either from a young or middleaged or old mans standpoint  why new or stronger lightif he would let it illumine himmight even convince him that his opinion was not only true but involved much greater and grander truths than he supposed  it is difficult to go more minutely into details even if it were advisable to do so  i may fittingly conclude by saying that the sum of all that might be written is comprehended in the statement that obedience to god in all things is the sure and only road to success  of all the bright and glorious truths with which our fallen world is enlightened there is onea duplex truthwhich lies at the foundation of everything  it is unchangeable  without it all other facts would be valueless and i would recommend every man woman and child to nail it to the mast without hesitation namelygod is love and love is the fulfilling of the law    chapter eleven  forgive and forget a lifeboat story  old captain bolter said he would never forgive jo grainnever  and what captain bolter said he meant for he was a strong and selfwilled man  there can be no doubt that the captain had some ground of complaint against grain for he had been insulted by him grosslyat least so he thought  it happened thus  joseph grain was a young fisherman and the handsomest tallest strongest and most active among the youths of the little seaport town in which he dwelt  he was also one of the lifeboats crew and many a time had his strong hand been extended in the midst of surging sea and shrieking tempest to save the perishing  moreover he was of a frank generous disposition was loved by most of his comrades envied by a few hated by none  but with all his fine qualities young grain had a great and serious faulthe was rather fond of strong drink  it must not however be supposed that he was a drunkard in the ordinary sense at least of that term  no he was never seen to stagger homeward or to look idiotic but being gifted with a robust frame and finelystrung nerves a very small quantity of alcohol sufficed to rouse within him the spirit of combativeness inducing him sometimes to say and do things which afterwards could not be easily unsaid or undone however much he might repent  one afternoon grain and some of his mates were sauntering towards the little lighthouse that stood at the end of their pier  it was an oldfashioned stone pier with a dividing wall or parapet down the middle of it  as they walked along some of the younger men began to question jo about a rumour that had recently been spread abroad  come now jo said one named blunt dont try to deceive us you cant deny that youre after cappen bolters little gal  well i wont deny it replied jo with sudden energy and somewhat forced gaiety while the blood mounted to his bronzed cheeks moreover i dont care who knows it for theres not a sweeter lass in all the town than mary bolter an the man that would be ashamed to own his fondness for her dont deserve to have her  thats true said a young fisherman named guy with a nod of approvalthough there may be two opinions as to which is the sweetest lass in all the town  i tell ee what jo remarked a stern and rather crossgrained bachelor named grime you may save yourself the trouble of givin chase to that little craft for although old bolter aint much to boast ofbein nothin more than the skipper of a small coastin crafthe thinks hisself far too big a man to give his darter to a fisherman  does he exclaimed grain with vehemence and then suddenly checked himself  ay that does he returned grime with something of a sneer in his tone  it chanced that jo grain had been to the publichouse that day and the sneer which at other times would have been passed over with indifference stung himcoupled as it was with a slur on his lowly position  he looked fiercely at grime and said in a loud angry tone its a matter of moonshine to me what bolter thinks of himself  if the girls willin to have me ill wed her in spite o the old grampus  now unhappily for jo grain the old grampus chanced at that very time to be sunning himself and enjoying his pipe on the other side of the pierwall and heard distinctly what jo said  moreover there was some truth in what grime had said about the old skipper looking down on the young fishermans position so that although he could not deny that jo was a firstrate man and knew that mary was fond of him he had hitherto felt a strong disinclination to allow his darling and only child to wed as he considered it beneath her  when therefore the speech above quoted broke harshly on his ears the matter became finally settled in his mind  he dropped his pipe set his heel on it and ground it to powder  he also ground his teeth and turning round with a snort worthy of the creature to which he had been compared sailed wildly homewards  next day jo grain chanced to meet him in the street and held out his hand as usual but the captain thrusting both hands deep into his trousers pockets looked the young man firmly in the face  no grain he said sternly  ive done with you  why so captain bolter asked jo in great surprise  because hissed the captain as his wrath rose an old grampus dont choose to have anything more to do with a young puppy  instantly his reckless speech of the day before flashed into jos mind  forgive me captain bolter he said respectfully forgive me and try to forget iti didnt mean it believe meii wasnt quite myself sir when  no interrupted the captain fiercely ill never forgive you nor forget it  with that he turned away and left jo grain to meditate on the folly of indulging in a stimulant which robbed him of his selfcontrol  but youth is very hopeful  jo did not quite believe in the captains sincerity  he comforted himself with the thought that time would soften the old mans feelings and meanwhile he would continue to court mary when opportunity offered  the captain however soon proved that he was thoroughly in earnest for instead of leaving his daughter under the care of a maiden aunt as had been his custom previously during his frequent absences from home he took her to sea with him and left jo with an extra supply of food for meditation  poor jo struggled hard under this his first severe trial but struggled in his own strength and failed  instead of casting away the glass which had already done him so much damage he madly took to it as a solace to his secret grief  yet jo took good care that his comrades should see no outward trace of that grief  he was not however suffered to remain long under the baleful influence of drink  soon after the departure of captain bolter a missionary visited the little seaport to preach salvation from sin through jesus christ and being a man of prayer and faith his mission was very successful  among the many sins against which he warned the people he laid particular stress on that of drunkenness  this was long before the days of the blue ribbon movement but the spirit of that movement was there though the particular title had not yet arisen  the missionary preached christ the saviour of sinners and temperance as one of the fruits of salvation  many of the rough fishermen were convertedbowed their heads and wills and ceased to resist god  among them was joseph grain  there was not indeed a remarkably great outward change in jo after this for he had always been an amiable hearty sweettempered fellow but there was nevertheless a radical change for whereas in time past he had acted to please himself he now acted to please his lord  to natural enthusiasm which had previously made him the hero of the town was now superadded the enthusiasm of a soldier of the cross and when lifeboat duty called him as in days gone by to hold out his hand to the perishing even while in the act of saving their bodies he prayed that the result might be salvation to their souls  you may be sure that jo did not forget mary but his thoughts about her were wonderfully changed for in this affair of the heart despair had given place to trust and submission  time passed by and one night in the dreary month of november the stormfiend was let loose on the shores of england  all round the coast the crews of our lifeboats assembled at pierheads and other points of vantage to watch the enemy and prepare for action  among others jo grain and his comrades assembled at their post of duty  it was an awful nightsuch as happily does not often visit our shores  thick darkness seemed to brood over land and sea  only the robust and hardy dared to show face to the keen withering blast which was laden with sleet  sometimes a gleam of lightning would dart through the raging elements occasionally the murky clouds rolled off the sky for a short time allowing the moon to render darkness hideously visible  tormented foam came in from the sea in riven masses and the hoarse roaring of the breakers played a bass accompaniment to the yelling blast which dashed gravel and sand as well as sleet in the faces of those who had courage enough to brave it  therewasnt that a light cried the coxswain of the lifeboat as he cowered under the shelter of the pierwall and gazed seaward with difficulty  ay responded blunt who was bowman of the boat there it goes again  and a rocket shouted jo grain starting up  no mistake now cried the coxswain  look alive lads  he ran as he spoke to the spot where the lifeboat lay ready under the shelter of the pier but jo was on board before him  almost simultaneously did a dozen strong and fearless men leap into the noble craft and don their cork lifebelts  a few seconds sufficed  every man knew well his place and his duty  the short powerful oars were shipped  give way cried the coxswain  there was no cheerno onlooker to encourage  silently the strong backs were bent and the lively boat shot away towards the entrance of the harbour like a thing of life  no description can adequately convey to landsmen the work to be done and the conditions under which it was performed  on passing the shelter of the pierhead the boat and her crew were met not only by the tumultuous surging of cross seas but by a blast which caught the somewhat high bow and almost whirled them into the air while in its now unbroken force the cold blast seemed to wither up the powers of the men  then in the dark distance an unusually huge billow was seen rushing down on them to meet it straight as an arrow and with all possible speed was essential  failure hereand the boat turning side on would have been rolled over and swept back into the harbour if not wrecked against the breakwater  the coxswain strained at the steering oar as a man strains for life the billow was fairly met  the men also strained till the stout oars were ready to snap for they knew that the billow must be cut through if they were to reach the open sea but it was so high that the bow of the boat was lifted up and for one instant it seemed as if she were to be hurled backward right over the stern  the impulse given however was sufficient  the crest of the wave was cut and next moment the bow fell forward plunging deep into the trough of the sea  at the same time a crosswave leaped right over the boat and filled it to the gunwales  this initial danger past it was little the men cared for their drenching  as little did the boat mind the water which she instantly expelled through the discharging tubes in her floor  but the toil now began  in the teeth of tide and tempest they had to pull with might and main advancing foot by foot sometimes only inch by inch  no rest no breathing time nothing but continuous tearing at the oars if progress was to be made while the spray enveloped them perpetually and at frequent intervals the solid water plunging inboard almost swept the heroes from their seats  but if the raging sea through which the lifeboat struggled was dreadful much more terrible was the turmoil on the outlying sands where the wreck was being gradually dashed to pieces  there the mad billows held high revelry  rushing in from all sides twisted and turned in their courses by the battered shoals they met not far from the wreck with the shock of opposing armies and clouds of foam sprang upward in dire indescribable confusion  the vessel in distress was a small brig  she had been lifted like a plaything by the waves and hurled high on the sand where although now unable to lift her up they rolled her to and fro with extreme violence rocket after rocket had been sent up until the drenching seas had rendered the firing of them impossible  the foremast had already gone by the board carrying most of the crew with it  on the crosstrees of the mainmast only two remaineda man and a woman who could barely maintain their hold as the battered craft swayed from side to side  the end comes at last darling mary said the man as he grasped the woman tightly with one arm and the mast with the other  no fathernot yet gasped the woman seethe lifeboat  i felt sure that god would send it  on came the gallant little craft  there was just light enough to enable those on the wreck to see dimly her white and blue sides as she laboured through the foam towards them  they have missed us father they dont see us cried the girl  the blast blew her long hair about adding wildness to the look of alarm which she cast on the man while speaking  nay darling its all right  theyve only pulled a bit to windard keep on praying mary  when well to windward of the wreck the anchor of the lifeboat was let go and they began to drop down towards the vessel by the cable  then for the first time the men could draw a long breath and relax their efforts at the oars for wind and waves were now in their favour though they still dashed and tossed and buffeted them  soon they were nearly alongside and the man on the crosstrees was heard to shout but his words could not be made out  what could it be that caused jo grains heart to beat against his strong ribs with the force of a sledgehammer and his eyes to blaze with excitement as he turned on his thwart and crouched like a tiger ready to spring  there was tremendous danger in drawing near for at one moment the boat rushed up on a sea as if about to plunge through the rigging of the vessel and the next she was down in a seething caldron with the black hull looming over her  it was observed that the two figures aloft which could barely be seen against the dark sky were struggling with some difficulty  they had lashed themselves to the mast and their benumbed fingers could not undo the fastenings  haul off shouted the coxswain as the boat was hurled with such force towards the vessels hull that destruction seemed imminent  no hold on roared jo grain  the men obeyed their coxswain but as the boat heaved upwards jo sprang with all his might and fell into the rigging of the wreck  a few seconds later and he was on the crosstrees knife in hand and the lashings were cut  at the same moment a rending crash was heard and again the stentorian voice of the coxswain was heard shouting to the men  the lifeboat was pulled off just in time to escape from the mainmast as it fell burying its crosstrees and all its tangled gearing in the sea  the bowman and young guy leaned over the side and at the risk of their lives grasped at a drowning man  they caught him and captain bolter was dragged into the boat insensible  a moment later and a hand was seen to rise in the midst of the wreckage  guy knew it well  he grasped it and held on  a few seconds more and jo grain with blood pouring down his face from a deep cut in his head was raised to the gunwale  have a care he gasped faintly  his right arm encircled an inanimate form  both were dragged on board and then it was seen that the form was that of mary bolter uninjured though insensible  to haul up to the anchor was a slow process and laborious but it was done cheerily for the hearts of the men were aglow with satisfaction three lives saved  it was what blunt styled a grand haul  not many indeed but was not one that of a loved comrade and was not another that of the sweetest lass in all the town in spite of young guys difference of opinion  it was grey dawn when the lifeboat returned to port under sail with a small flag flying in token of success and it would have done your heart good reader to have seen the faces of the crowds that lined the pier and heard the ringing cheers that greeted the gallant rescuers as they brought the rescued safe to land  six hours after that captain bolter sat at the bedside of jo grain  youve been hard hit jo i fear he said kindly  yes rather hard but the doctor says ill be all right in a week or two and its little ill care about it captain if youll only agree to forgive and forget  the captain seized jos hand and tried to speak but could not  after an abortive effort he turned away with a grunt and left the room  six months after that joseph grain transformed into a coastguardsman led the sweetest lass in all the town to the village church and young guy still objecting to the title was groomsman  jo said captain bolter that day at parting ive forgiven you long ago but i cant forget for you said the truth that time  i was an old grampus or a fool if you like and im not much better now however goodbye dear boy and take care of her for theres not another like her in all england  except one murmured young guy as he squeezed his friends hand and quietly attached an old slipper to their cab as they drove away thereafter he swaggered off to a certain familiar cottage to talk over the wedding with one whom he considered the sweetest lass in all the town    chapter twelve  rescue the perishing  proverbial philosophy asserts that the iron should be struck when it is hot  i sympathise with proverbial philosophy in this case but that teacher says nothing whatever about striking the iron when it is cold and experienceat least that of blacksmithsgoes to prove that cold iron may be struck till heat is evolved and once heated who knows what intensity of incandescence may be attained  i will try it  my hammer may not be a large one  a sledgehammer it certainly is not  such as it is i wield it under the impulse of great heat within me and will direct my blows at the presumably cold iron around  i say presumablybecause if you good reader have not been subjected to the same influences with myself you cannot reasonably be expected to be even warmmuch less whitehot  the cause of all this heat was dr barnardos splendid meeting held recently in the royal albert hall  i came home from that meeting incandescentthrowing off sparks of enthusiasm and eagerly clutching at every cold or lukewarm creature that came in my way with a view to expend on it some of my surplus heat  the great albert hall filled is enough of itself to arouse enthusiasm whatever the object of the gathering may be  ten thousand human beings more or less swarming on the floor clustering on the walls rising tier above tier until in dim distance the pigmy throng seems soaring up into the very heavens is a tremendous a solemn a heartstirring sight suggestivei write with reverenceof the judgment day  and when such an assembly is convened for the purpose of considering matters of urgent importance matters affecting the wellbeing of multitudes matters of life and death which call for instant and vigorous action then the enthusiasm is naturally intensified and needs but little hammering to rouse it to the fiercest glow  it was no ordinary gathering thisno mere annual meeting of a grand society  it was indeed that but a great deal more  there was a noble chairman of course and an address and several speeches by eminent men but i should suppose that onehalf of the audience could not well see the features of the speakers or hear their words  these were relatively insignificant matters  the business of the evening was to present to the people a great object lesson and the only figure on the platform that bulked largeat least in my esteemwas that of dr barnardo himself and a magical master of the ceremonies did the doctor prove himself to be  being unable to induce the west end to visit the east end he had simply cut several enormous slices out of the slums and set them down in the royal albert hall for inspection  the display was set forth interestingly and with emphasis insomuch that things almost spoke for themselves and wherein they failed to do so the doctor supplemented in a satisfactorily sonorous voice  one of the slumslices was a large one  it consisted of thirteen hundred childrenboys and girlsin bright light smart dresses who clustered on the orchestra and around the great organ like flowers in june  looking at their clean wholesome faces neat attire and orderly demeanour i thought is it possible that these are the sweepings of the streets  the question was tellingly answered later on but here it may be stated that this beautiful band of 1300 was only a slicea sampleof the doctors large family which at present numbers nearly 3500  it now in 1893 numbers nearly 5000  it was grand to hear them sing  the great organ itself had to sing small beside them for wood and metal can never hope to equal the living human voice even though it be but a voice from the slums  not only hymns but humorous songs they sang and heroic  a telling effect was produced while singing one of the latter by the sudden display of 1300 union jacks each the size of a kerchief which the singers waved in time to the chorus  it seemed as though a stiff breeze had swept over the flowerbed and kissed the national flag in passing  another surprise of this kind was given during the stirring song of the fire brigade when 1300 bits of gold and silver paper waved to and fro seemed to fill the orchestra with flashing fire  but much of this was for show to tickle our eyes and ears and prepare the way as it were for the grave and stern realities yet to come  there was a mighty platform covered with crimson cloth in the centre of the hall in front of the orchestra  on it were several mysterious objects covered with sheets  at a signala whistlegiven by the doctor a band of sturdy boys clad in their workaday uniform scampered down the central passage of the hall jumped on the platform flung off the sheets and discovered carpenters benches saws hammers woodin short all the appliances with which they carry on the various trades at their home in the east end  in a few seconds as if by magic the platform was a workshop in full swinghammering sawing chiselling woodchopping clattering and indescribable din which was enhanced but not drowned by the applause of the astonished audience the little fellows worked as though life depended on their activity for the space it seemed to me of half a minute  then the shrill whistle sounded again and the work ceased as if the springs of life had been suddenly cut off  dead silence ensued each worker remaining in the attitude in which he had been petrifieda group of artisan statuary in colour  the doctor was thus enabled quietly to explain that the display represented only a very few of the trades taught and carried on by his rescued boys at stepney causeway  at another signal the splendidly drilled young fellows scampered off carrying not only their tools but their benches tables stools and even debris along with them and disappearing in less than a couple of minutes left not a chip or shaving behind  it would take a good many pages of close writing to give anything like a detailed account of all that i saw  i must pass over much in order to emphasise one or two very telling incidents  the doctor presented a sample of all his wares  one of these was a very touching sample namely a band of cripples who made their way slowly on crutches down the passage to the platformfor it is one of the noteworthy points in this mission that no destitute boy is turned away whether he be well or ill crippled or sound  so also there was a small procession of neat pleasantlooking nurses each leading one or more mites of forsaken humanity from babies castle  but it seemed to me that the kernel of the nut had been reached and the foundation of the godlike mission laid bare for our inspection when the raw material was led forth  we had got accustomed by that time to turn an expectant gaze at a far distant door when the doctors voice ceased or his whistle sounded  presently a solitary nurse with the neat familiar white cap and apron appeared at the door leading two little creatures by the hand  a husha distinct though indescribable sensationas of profound pity and pathospassed over the vast assembly as a little boy and girl direct from the slums were led forward  the nurse had to walk slowly to accommodate her pace to theirs  half naked ragged dirty unkempt bereft of their natural guardians or forsaken by themhelpless yet left to help themselves almost before they could walk  forward they came to the central platform casting timid wondering glances around at the mighty host of welltodo beings not one of whom perhaps ever knew what it is to hunger for a whole day and lie down at night with a doorstep for a pillow  oh it was pitiful the doctor advanced to these forlorn ones and took them by the hands with inexpressible tenderness and then facing the assembly broke the silence and presented the human material which it was under god his mission in life to rescue  then turning abruptly to the flowerbed in the orchestra he signalled with his finger  a flower that might well have been styled a rosebuda neat little girl in pink with a natty straw hattripped lightly down and stood on the platform beside the poor waifs  looking up once more to the entranced audience and pointing to the children the doctor said  such as these are she was but a few months ago and such as she is now they will soon become with gods blessing  i may not quote the words correctly but that is my recollection of the substance  the doctor was not content however to show us the foundation and progress of his work  he showed us the work as it were completed in the form of a band of sturdy young men in their working costume ready to start as rescued trained useful earnest labourers for the fields of manitobayoung men who all had once been lost waifs and strays  still further he as it were put the copestone on his glorious work by presenting a band of men and womenold boys and girlswho had been tested by rough contact with the world and its temptations and had come off victorious by keeping their situations with credit for periods varying from one to nine yearskept by the power of christ  when i saw the little waifs and looked up at the bands of happy children before me and thought of the thousands more in the homes and of the multitudes which have passed through these homes in years gone by the gladness and the great boon to humanity which must have resulted and of the terrible crime and degradation that might have beenmy heart offered the prayer which at that moment my voice could not have utteredgod bless and prosper dr barnardo and his work  i hear a voice from the back of beyont or some such far off localitya timid voice perhaps that of a juvenile who knows little and can scarce be expected to care much about londonasking who is dr barnardo  for the sake of that innocent one i reply that he is a scavengerthe chief of london scavengers  he and his subordinates sweep up the human rubbish of the slums and shoot it into a receptacle at 18 stepney causeway where they manipulate and wash it and subject it to a variety of processes which result with gods blessing in the recovery of innumerable jewels of inestimable value  i say inestimable because men have not yet found a method of fixing the exact value of human souls and rescued lives  the rubbish which is gathered consists of destitute children  the assistant scavengers are men and women who love and serve the lord jesus christ    chapter thirteen  a knotty question  tom blunt said richard sharp i deny your premises condemn your reasoning as illogical and reject your conclusions with scorn  the youth who made this remark with very considerable assurance and emphasis was a student  his fellowstudent received it with an air of bland goodnature  dick said he your oratory is rotund and if it were convincing might be impressive but it fails to some extent in consequence of a certain smack of selfassertion which is unphilosophical  suppose now that we have this matter out in a calm dispassionate manner without tooth or egotism or prejudice which tend so powerfully to mar human disputation and render it abortive  with all my heart tom said the other drawing close to the fire placing one foot against the mantelpiece as being a comfortable though not elegant posture resting his elbows on the arms of his chair and placing his hands in that positionwith all the finger tips touching each otherwhich seems from the universal practice of civilised society to assist mental elucidation  i am quite prepared  come on  stay while my mind is working i like to have my hands employed  i will proceed with my monkey while we talk said blunt taking up a walkingstick the head of which he had carved into the semblance of a monkey  sweet creature he added kissing the object of his affection and holding it out at armslength  silent companion of my solitary rambles and patient auditor of my most secret aspirations you are becoming quite a work of art  a few more touches of the knife and something like perfection shall have been attained  look here dick when i turn it towards the lightsoisnt there a beauty about the contour of that upper lip and nose which  dont be a fool tom interrupted his friend somewhat impatiently you seem to me to be growing more and more imbecile every day  we did not sit down to discuss fine art  true richard true but there is a power in the consideration of fine art which when judiciously interpolated in the affairs of life tends to soften the asperities to round away as it were the ruggedness of human intercourse and produce a tranquillity of mind which is eminently conducive totodont you see  no i dont see  then continued blunt applying his knife to one of the monkeys eyes there arises the questionhow far is this intellectual blindness the result of incapacity of intellectual vision or of averted gaze or of the wilful shutting of the intellectual eyelids  well well tom let that question alone for the present  let us come to the point for i wish to have my mind cleared up on the subject  you hold that gambling is wrongessentially wrong  i do but let us not have a misunderstanding at the very beginning said blunt  by gambling i do not mean the playing of games  that is not gambling  what i understand by gambling is betting on gamesor on anythingand the playing of games for the purpose of winning money or anything that possesses value great or small  such gambling i hold to be wrongessentially morally absolutely wrong without one particle of right or good in it whatever  as he spoke blunt became slightly more earnest in tone and less devoted to the monkey  well now tom do you know i dont see that  if you did see it my dear fellow returned blunt resuming his airy tone our discussion of the subject would be useless  well then i cant see it to be wrong  here are you and i  we want to have a game of billiards  it is uninteresting to play even billiards for nothing but we each have a little money and choose to risk a small sum  our object is not gain therefore we play for merely sixpenny points  we both agree to risk that sum  if i lose all right  if you lose all right  thats fair isnt it  no it is undoubtedly equal but not necessarily fair  fair means free from blemish pure in other words right  two thieves may make a perfectly fair division of spoil but the fairness of the division does not make their conduct fair or right  neither of them is entitled to divide their gains at all  their agreeing to do so does not make it fair  agreed tom as regards thieves but you and i are not thieves  we propose to act with that which is our own  we mutually agree to run the risk of loss and to take our chance of gain  we have a right to do as we choose with our own  is not that fair  you pour out so many fallacies and half truths dick that it is not easy to answer you right off  morally and politically you are wrong  politically a man is not entitled to do what he chooses with his own  there are limitations for instance a man owns a house  abstractly he is entitled to burn it down if he chooses  but if his house abuts upon mine he may not set it on fire if he chooses because in so doing he would set fire to my house also which is very much beyond his right  then  oh man i understand all that said sharp quickly  of course a man may put what he likes in his garden but with suchlike limitations as that he shall not set up a limekiln to choke his neighbours or a piggery to breed disease but gambling does nothing like that  does it not exclaimed blunt  does it not ruin hundreds of men turning them into sots and paupers whereby the ruined gamblers become unable to pay their fair share of taxation and in addition lay on the shoulders of respectable people the unfair burden of supporting them and perhaps their families  but what if the gambler has no family  there still remains his ruined self to be maintained  but suppose he is not ruinedthat he manages by gambling to support himself  in that case he still remains guilty of two mean and contemptible acts on the one hand he produces nothing whatever to increase the wealth or happiness of the world and on the other hand whatever he gains is a matter of direct loss and sorrow to others without any tangible equivalent  it is not so with the orator or the musician  though their products are not indeed tangible they are distinctly real and valuable during the hour of action the orator charms the ear eye and intellect so does the musician  when the hour is past the heart is gladdened by the memory of what has been and the hopes are aroused in anticipation of what may yet be in the future  as regards the orator the lessons inculcated may be a lasting gain and pleasure and source of widespread benefit through life  to a great extent this may also be said of the musician when words are wedded to music  who has not heard of souls being delivered from spiritual darkness and brought into spiritual light by means of songa benefit which will last through eternity as well as time  even the man of wealth who lives on the interest of his possessions is not necessarily a drone in the human hive  he may by wise and careful use of his wealth greatly increase the worlds riches by the mere management of it he may fill up his days with useful and happy employment and by devoting it and himself to god he may so influence the world for good that men shall bless him while he lives and mourn him profoundly when he dies  but what fraction of good is done by the gambler in all the wide world  much the same that is accomplished by the others put in sharp at this point  the orator gives pleasure to those who are fond of recitation or declamation the musician pleases those who are fond of sweet sounds and the gambler gives pleasure to men who are fond of the excitement of play  besides by paying his way he gives benefit to all whom he employs  he rents a house he buys furniture he eats food all of which brings profit to houseowners cabinetmakers butchers bakers etcetera and is good done to the world by the gambler  nay friend richard not by the gambler but by the money which the gambler spends  isnt that much the same thing  by no means  the moneyor its equivalentis created by some one else  the gambler merely passes it on  if he had never been born the same money would have been there for some one else to spend  the labour of the gambler has not added one penny to it  he brought nothing into the world and has added nothing to the worlds pile though he has managed to consume a good deal of its produce  is there not something very mean and contemptible in this state of being  on the other hand the orator has spent laborious days and exerted much brainpower before he made himself capable of pleasing and benefiting his fellows  the musician has gone through exhausting drudgery and practice before being fit to thrill or instruct by means of his sweet sounds and the man of wealth has had to be educated up to the point of using his possessions to profitable accountso that his fields shall grow heavier crops than they did when he began his work his tenants shall be better housed than they were at first and shall lead healthier and happier lives to the great moral and material advantage of the community  nearly all the other members of the hive produce or help to produce some sort of equivalent for the money they obtain  even those who produce what is bad have still something to show for their money and that something bad though it be in one form may be decidedly good in another form or if put to another use  the gambler aloneexcept perhaps the absolute idlerenjoys the unenviable position of a thorough outandout unmitigated drone  he does absolutely nothing except produce unhealthy excitement in himself and his fellows  he has nothing whatever to show for the money he has obtained except risk and that can hardly be styled a commodity  i beg pardon interrupted sharp the gambler produces skill and there can be no doubt that hundreds of men derive as much pleasure from an exhibition of skill with the billiardcue as others derive from an exhibition of skill with the flute or violin  you forget dick my boy that skill with the billiardcue is not gambling  what i condemn as being morally and politically wrong is betting on games and staking anything upon the issue of them  gamblers are if i may say so a set of living pockets which circulate money about amongst themselves one pocket gaining neither more nor less than what another pocket loses  but you are now talking of professional gamblers tom  of course i dont defend these  what i do defend is my right to play now and then for sixpenny or say shilling or even halfcrown points without laying myself open to the charge of having been guilty of what you term a mean dishonourable unjust contemptible act  in other words you wish to steal now and then without being called a thief  but come old man i wont call you bad names  i know you dont look at this matter as i do and therefore i dont think that you are either mean or contemptible  nevertheless we must bear in mind that honourable upright men may sometimes be reasoned into false beliefs so that for a time they may fail to see the evil of that which they uphold i am not infallible  if my reasoning is false i stand open to correction  laying the monkey down on the table at this point and looking earnestly at his friend tom blunt continued  let me ask a question dick  is it for the sake of getting money that you gamble  certainly not returned his friend with a slight touch of indignation  you know that i never play for high stakes and with penny or sixpenny points you know it is impossible for me either to win or lose any sum that would be worth a moments consideration  the game is all that i care for  if so why do you lose interest in the game when there are no stakes  ohwell its hard to say but the value of the stake cannot be that which adds interest for it is so trifling  im not so sure of that dick  you have heard gambling talked of as a disease  yes but i dont believe it is  do you believe that a miser is a morally diseased man  well perhaps he is returned sharp but a gambler is not necessarily a miser  yet the two have some symptoms of this moral disease in common  the miser is sometimes rich nevertheless the covetous spirit is so strong in him that he gloats over a sixpence has profound interest in gaining it and mourns over it if lost  you being well off with a rich and liberal father yet declare that the interest of a game is much decreased if there are no stakes on it  the cases are not parallel  i did not say they were but you must admitindeed you have admitted that you have one symptom of this disease in common with the miser  what disease  the love of money  richard sharp burst into a laugh at this a goodhumoured laugh in which there was more of amusement than annoyance  tom tom he said how your notions about gambling seem to blind you to the true character of your friends  did you ever see me gloating over gold or hoarding sixpences or going stealthily in the dead of night to secret places for the purpose of counting over my wealth  have i not rather on the contrary got credit among my friends for being somewhat of a spendthrift  but go on old fellow what more have you to say against gamblingfor you have not yet convinced me  hold on a bit  let me pare off just a morsel of my monkeys nose there thats about as near perfection as is possible in a monkey  what a pity that he has not life enough to see his beautiful face in a glass but perhaps its as well for he would never see himself as others see him  men never do  no doubt monkeys are the same  well now continued blunt again laying down the stick and becoming serious try if you can see the matter in this light  two gamblers meet  not blacklegs observe but respectable men who nevertheless bet much and play high and keep books etcetera  one is rich the other poor each wishes ardently to gain money from his friend  this is a somewhat low unmanly wish to begin with but let it pass  the poor one has a wife and family to keep and debts to pay  many thousands of men ay and women are in the same condition and work hard to pay their debts our poor gambler however does not like work  he prefers to take his chance at gambling it is easier he thinks and it is certainly in a way more exciting than work  our rich gambler has no need to work but he also likes excitement and he loves money  neither of these men would condescend for one moment to ask a gift of money from the other yet each is so keen to obtain his friends money that they agree to stake it on a chance or on the issue of a contest  for one to take the money from the other who does not wish to part with it would be unfair and wrong of course but their agreement gets rid of the difficulty  it has not altered the conditions observe  neither of them wishes to give up his money but an arrangement has been come to in virtue of which one consents to be a defrauder and the other to be defrauded  does the agreement make wrong right  i think it does because the gamblers have a right to make what agreement they please as it is between themselves  hold there dick  suppose that the poor man loses  is it then between themselves  does not the rich gambler walk away with the money that was due to the poor ones butcher baker brewer etcetera  but the rich one did not know that  it is not his fault  that does not free the poor gambler from the dishonourable act of risking money which was not his own and do you really think that if the rich one did know it he would return the money  i think not  the history of gambling does not point to many if any such cases of selfsacrifice  the truth is that selfishness in its meanest form is at the bottom of all gambling though many gamblers may not quite see the fact  i want your money  i am too proud to ask it  i dare not demand it  i cannot cajole you out of it  i will not rob you  you are precisely in the same mind that i am  come let us resort to a trick let us make an arrangement whereby one of us at least shall gain his sneaking nefarious unjust end and we will anyhow have the excitement of leaving to chance which of us is to be the lucky man chance and luck  dick sharp there is no such condition as chance or luck  it is as surely fixed in the mind of god which gambler is to gain and which to lose as it is that the morrow shall follow today  my dear blunt i had no idea you were such a fatalist said sharp in surprise  i am not a fatalist in the sense you mean returned his friend everything has been fixed from the beginning  is not that fatalism of the most pronounced nature tom  you dont seem to see that among other fixtures it was fixed that freewill should be given to man and with it the right as well as the power to fix many things for himself also the responsibility  without freewill we could have had no responsibility  the mere fact that god of course knew what each man would will did not alter the fixed arrangement that man has been left perfectly free to will as he pleases i do not say that man is free to do as he pleases  sometimes the doing is permitted sometimes it is interfered withnever the willing that is always and for ever free  gamblers use their freewills often to their own great damage and ruin just as good men use their freewills to their great advantage and happiness  in both cases they make free use of the freewills that have been bestowed on them  then i suppose that you consider gambling even to the smallest extent to be sin  i do  under which of the ten commandments does it fall  thou shalt not covet    chapter fourteen  two remarkable dreams  some natures are better than others  there can be no question about that  some dispositions are born moderately sweet others are born slightly sour  if you doubt the fact reader go study nature or get you to an argumentative friend and dispute the point  we refuse flatly to enter into a discussion of the subject  look at that little boy sleeping there under the railway arch in the east end of londonnot the boy with the black hair and the hook nose and the square underjaw but the one with the curly head the extremely dirty face and the dimpled chin on the tip of whose snub nose the rising sun shines with a power that causes it to resemble a glowing carbuncle on a visage still lying in shadow  that little boys disposition is sweet  you can see it in every line in every curve in every dimple of his dirty little face  he has not been sweetened by training he has had no trainingat least none from man or woman with a view to his good  he has no settled principles of any kind good or bad  all his actions are the result of impulse based on mere animal propensity but like every other human being he has a conscience  at the time of his introduction to the reader his conscience is like himself asleep and it has not as yet been much enlightened  his name is stumpy but he was never christened  critical minds will object here that a boy would not be permitted to sleep under a railway arch and that london houses would effectually prevent the rising sun from entering such a place  to which we reply that the arch in question was a semisuburban arch that it was the last or the first of a series of arches an insignificant arch under which nothing ever ran except stray cats and rats and that it spanned a morsel of waste ground which gave upon a shabby street running due east up which every fine morning the rising sun gushed in a flood of glory  each fleeting moment increased the light on stumpys upturned nose until it tipped the dimpled chin and cheeks and at last kissed his eyelids  this appeared to suggest pleasant dreams for the boy smiled like a dirtyfaced angel  he even gave vent to an imbecile laugh and then awoke  stumpys eyes were huge and blue  the opening of them was like the revealing of unfathomable sky through clouds of roseate hue  they sparkled with a light all their own in addition to that of the sun for there was in them a gleam of mischief as their owner poked his companion in the ribs and then tugged his hair  i say you let me alone growled the companion turning uneasily on his hard couch  i say you get up answered stumpy giving the companion a pinch on the tender part of his arm  come look alive howlet  i sees a railway porter and a bobby  owlet whose nose had suggested his name had been regardless of the poke the tug and the pinch but was alive to the hint  he at once came to the sitting posture on hearing the dreaded name of bobby and rubbed his eyes  on seeing that there was neither policeman nor guard near he uttered an uncomplimentary remark and was about to lie down again but was arrested by the animated expression of his comrades face and the heaving of his shoulders  why what ever is the matter with you he demanded  are you goin to bust yourself wi larfin by way of gettin a happetite for the breakfast that you haint no prospect of  to this stumpy replied by pulling from his trousers pocket four shining pennies which he held out with an air of triumph  oh exclaimed owlet and then being unable to find words sufficiently expressive he rubbed the place where the front of his waistcoat would have been if he had possessed one  yes said stumpy regarding the coppers with a pensive air ive slep with you all night in my and an my and in my pocket an my knees doubled up to my chin to make all snug an now im going to have a tuck ina blow outa bustera  he paused abruptly and looking with a gleeful air at his companion said  but that wasnt what i was laughin at  well i suppose it warnt  what was it then  the boys eyes sparkled again and for some moments a halfsuppressed chuckling prevented speech  it was a dream he said at last  a dream exclaimed owlet contemptuously  i hate dreams  when i dreams em theyre always about bobbies and maginstrates an wittles an when other fellows tells about em theyre so longwinded an prosy  but i had a dream too  what was yours  my dream was about a bobby returned his friend  see here it is an i wont be longwinded or prosy howlet so dont growl and spoil your happetite for that ere breakfast thats acomin  i dreamedlet me see was it in piccadillyno it was oxford street close by regent street where all the swells go to promynade you know  well i sees a bobbyof course i never can go the length my little toe without seein a bobby but this bobby was a stunner  you never seed sitch a feller not that he was big or fierce but he had a nose just twofootsix long  i know for certain for im a good judge o size besides i went straight up to him as bold as brass and axed him how long it was an he told me without winkin  the strange thing about it is that i wasnt a bit surprised at his nose  wery odd aint it eh howlet that people never is surprised at anything they sees in dreams  i do blieve now if i was to see a man takin a walk of a arternoon with his head in his coattail pocket id take it quite as a matter of course  well wen that bobby had told me his nose was twofootsix inches long i feels a most unaccountable and astonishin gush of indignation come over me  what it was at i dont know no more nor the man in the moon praps it was the sudden thought of all the troubles that bobbies has brought on me from the day i was born till now  anyhow i was took awful bad  my buzzum felt fit to bust  i knowed that i must do somethin to him or die so i seized that bobby by the nose and hauled him flat down on his breast  he was so took with surprise that he never made any struggle but gived vent to a most awful howl  my joy at havin so easily floored my natural enemy was such that i replied with a cherokee yell  then i gave his nose a pull up so strong that it wellnigh broke his neck an set him straight on his pins again  oh howlet you cant think what a jolly dream it was  to do it all so easy too  well what happened arter that asked owlet  nothin happened after that returned stumpy with a somewhat sad expression on his usually gleeful visage  its a wery strange thing howlet that dreams inwariably wanishes away just at the most interestin pint  did you ever notice that  notice it  i should think i did  why the dream that i had wen i was layin alongside o you was o that sort exactly  it was all about wittles too an its made me that ungry i feels like a ravagin wolf  come along then howlet an you an me will ravage somethin wi them browns o mine  well ave a good breakfast though it should be our last an ill stand treat  youre a trump stumpy an ill tell you my dream as we goes along  hall rightbut mind you dont come prosy over me  i cant stand it no more nor yourself  you mind dick wilkin dont you  whatthe young man from the country as ive seed standin at the dock gates day after day for weeks without getting took on  thats him continued owlet with a nod as he shoved his hand into his trousers pockets  he brought a wife and five kids from the country with himthinkin to better hisself in london  ha a sweet little town for a cove as is ard up to better hisself inho yes certingly remarked the precocious boy in a tone of profound sarcasm  well he continued dick wilkin came to better hisself an he set about it by rentin a single room in cherubs courta fine saloobrious spot as you know not far from the tower  he ad a few bobs when he came and bought a few sticks o furniture but i dont need for to tell you stumpy that the most o that soon went up the spout and the wilkins was redooced to beggarywaried off an on with an odd job at the docks  it was when they first comed to town that i was down wi that fever or flenzy or somethink o that sort  the streets bein my usual abitation i ad no place in partikler to go to an by good luck when i gave in i lay down at the wilkins door  o but i was badthat bad that it seemed as if i should be cleared out o my mortal carcase entirely  mulligrumps inquired his sympathetic friend  no no  nothin o that sort but a kind of hot alloverishness wi pains thatbut you cant understand it stumpy if youve never ad it  then i dont want to understand it  but what has all this to do wi your dream  everythink to do with it cause it was about them i was dreamin  as i was sayin i fell down at their door an they took me in and mrs wilkin nussed me for weeks till i got better  oh shes a rare nuss is mrs wilkin  an when i began to get better the kids all took to me  i dont know when i would have left them but when times became bad an dick couldnt git work and mrs wilkin and the kids began to grow thin i thought it was time for me to look out for myself an not remain a burden on em no longer  i knowd they wouldnt let me away without a rumpus so i just gave em the slip and thats ow i came to be on the streets again an fell in wi you stumpy  ave you never seen em since  never  you ungrateful wagibone  what was the use o my goin to see em wen i ad nothin to give em returned owlet in an apologetic tone  you might ave given em the benefit of your adwice if you ad nothin else  but what did you dream about em  i dreamt that they was all starvinwhich aint unlikely to be true an i was so cut up about it that i went straight off to a butchers shop and stole a lot o sasengers then to a bakers and stole a loaf the size of a wheelbarrer then to a grocers and stole tea an sugar an the strange thing was that neither the people o the shops nor the bobbies seemed to think i was stealin  another coorious thing was that i carried all the things in my pocketsstuffed em in quite easy though there was arf a sack o coals among em  always the way in dreams remarked his friend philosophically  yesaint it jolly convenient continued the other  well wen i got to the ouse i set to work made a rousin fire put on the kettle cooked the wittles as if id bin born and bred in a otel and in less than five minutes ad a smokin dinner on the table that would ave busted an alderman  in course the wilkins axed no questions  father mother five kids and self all drew in our chairs and sot down  what fun exclaimed stumpy  ay but you spoilt the fun for it was just at that time you shoved your fist into my ribs and woke me before one of us could get a bite o that grub into our mouths  if wed even ad time to smell it that would ave bin somethink to remember  howlet said the other impressively dye think the wilkins is livin in the same place still  as like as not  could you find it again  could i find saint pauls or the moniment  i should think so  come along then and lets pay em a wisit  they were not long in finding the placea dirty court at the farther end of a dark passage  owlet led the way to the top of a rickety stair and knocked at one of the doors which opened on the landing  no answer was returned but after a second application of the knuckles accompanied by a touch of the toe a growling voice was heard then a sound of some one getting violently out of bed a heavy tread on the floor and the door was flung open  what dee want demanded a fierce halfdrunken man  please sir does the wilkins stop here  no they dont and the door was shut with a bang  sweet creature observed stumpy as they turned disappointed away  wonder if his mother as any more like im said owlet  theyve ad to change to the cellar said a famishedlooking woman putting her head out of a door on the same landing  dye want em  in course we does mother else we wouldnt ax for em  wereabouts is the cellar  foot o this stair  descending to the regions below the two boys groped their way along an underground passage till they came to a door  it was opened by a woman who timidly demanded what they wanted  its me missis wilkin  ave you forgotten howlet  with an exclamation of surprise and joy the woman flung the door wide seized owlet dragged him into the room and embraced him with as much affection as if he had been her own child  instantly there arose a shout of juvenile joy and stumpy could see in the semidarkness that four little creatures were helping their mother to overwhelm his friend while a fiftha biggish girlwas prevented from joining them by the necessity that lay on her to take care of the baby  when the greetings were over the sad condition of the family was soon explained and a single glance round sufficed to show that they had reached the lowest state of destitution  it was a back room rather than a cellar but the dirty pane of thick glass near the roof admitted only enough of light to make its wretchedness visible  a rickety table two broken chairs and a bedstead without a bottom was all the furniture left and the grate was empty  weve been obleeged to pawn everything said mrs wilkin with difficulty suppressing a sob and i need hardly tell you why she added with a glance at the children who were living skeletons  the baby was perhaps the saddest object there for it was so thin and weak that it had not strength to crythough the faces which it frequently made were obviously the result of an effort to do so  much interested in the scene young stumpy stood admiring it patronisingly for a little but when he heard the poor woman tell of their desperate struggle to merely keep themselves alive his feelings were touched and when he learned that not a bite of food had passed their lips since the previous morning a sudden impulse swelled his little breast  he clutched his four pennies tightly glanced quickly round observed an empty basket in a corner caught it up and left the place hurriedly  he had scarcely gone when the father of the family entered  the expression of his face and his whole bearing and aspect told eloquently of disappointment as he sat down with a heavy sigh  stumped again he said only a few hands took on  the words sounded as a deathknell to the famishing family and the man himself was too much cut up to take notice of the return of his friend owlet except by a slight nod of recognition  meanwhile stumpy ran along several streets in quest of food  he had not far to run in such a locality  at a very small grocers shop he purchased one halfpenny worth of tea and put it in his basket  to this he added one farthings worth of milk which the amiable milkman let him have in a small phial on promise of its being returned  two farthings more procured a small supply of coal which he wrapped in two cabbage leaves  then he looked about for a baker  one penny farthing of his fund having been spent it behoved him to consider that the staff of life must be secured in preference to luxuries  at this point the boys nose told him of a most delicious smell which pervaded the air  he stood still for a moment and sniffed eagerly  ah aint it prime  ive jist ad some said another much smaller and very ragged streetboy who had noticed the sniff  what ever is it demanded stumpy  peasoup answered the other  where  right round the corner  look alive theyre shovellin it out like one oclock for fardns  our hero waited for no more  he dashed round the corner and found a place where the salvation army was dispensing farthing and halfpenny breakfasts to a crowd of the hungriest and raggedest creatures he had ever seen though his personal experience of london destitution was extensive  here you are said a smiling damsel in a poke bonnet  i see youre in a hurry how much do you want  ow much for a fardn asked stumpy with the caution natural to a man of limited means  a small bowl full of steaming soup was placed before him and a hunk of bread  for one fardn inquired the boy in surprise  for one farthing replied the presiding angel in the poke bonnet  here young ooman said stumpy setting down his basket let me ave eleven fardns worth right away  theres a big family awaitin for it an theyre all starvin so do make haste  but dear boy youve brought nothing to carry the soup in  stumpys visage fell  the basket could not serve him here and the rate at which the soup was being ladled out convinced him that if he were to return for a jug there would not be much left for him  observing his difficulty the attendant said that she would lend him a jug if he would promise to bring it back  are you an honest boy she asked with an amused look  about as honest as most kids o the same sort  well ill trust youand mind god sees you  there now dont you fall and break it  our hero was not long in returning to the dreary cellar with the eleven basins of soup and eleven hunks of breadall of which with the previously purchased luxuries he spread out on the rickety table to the unutterable amazement and joy of the wilkin family  need we say that it was a glorious feast  as there were only two chairs the table was lifted inside of the bottomless bed and some of the young people sat down on the frame thereof on one side and some on the other side while mrs wilkin and her husband occupied the places of honour at the head and foot  there was not much conversation at first hunger was too exacting but in a short time tongues began to wag  then the fire was lighted and the kettle boiled and the halfpennyworth of tea infused and thus the sumptuous meal was agreeably washed down even the baby beganto recover under the genial influence of warm food and made faces indicative of a wish to crowbut it failed and went to sleep on sisters shoulder instead  when it was all over poor mrs wilkin made an attempt to return thanks for the meal but broke down and sobbed her gratitude  reader this is no fancy sketch  it is founded on terrible fact and gives but a faint idea of the wretchedness and poverty that prevail in londoneven the london of today  the end
