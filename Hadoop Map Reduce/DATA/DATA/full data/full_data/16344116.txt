16344116	the heritage of dedlow marsh and other tales   by  bret harte     contents    the heritage of dedlow marsh   a knighterrant of the foothills   a secret of telegraph hill   captain jims friend    the heritage of dedlow marsh  i  the sun was going down on the dedlow marshes  the tide was following it fast as if to meet the reddening lines of sky and water in the west leaving the foreground to grow blacker and blacker every moment and to bring out in startling contrast the few halffilled and halflit pools left behind and forgotten  the strong breath of the pacific fanning their surfaces at times kindled them into a dull glow like dying embers  a cloud of sandpipers rose white from one of the nearer lagoons swept in a long eddying ring against the sunset and became a black and dropping rain to seaward  the long sinuous line of channel fading with the light and ebbing with the tide began to give off here and there light puffs of graywinged birds like sudden exhalations high in the darkening sky the long arrowheaded lines of geese and brant pointed towards the upland  as the light grew more uncertain the air at times was filled with the rush of viewless and melancholy wings or became plaintive with faroff cries and lamentations  as the marshes grew blacker the farscattered tussocks and accretions on its level surface began to loom in exaggerated outline and two human figures suddenly emerging erect on the bank of the hidden channel assumed the proportion of giants  when they had moored their unseen boat they still appeared for some moments to be moving vaguely and aimlessly round the spot where they had disembarked  but as the eye became familiar with the darkness it was seen that they were really advancing inland yet with a slowness of progression and deviousness of course that appeared inexplicable to the distant spectator  presently it was evident that this seemingly even vast black expanse was traversed and intersected by inky creeks and small channels which made human progression difficult and dangerous as they appeared nearer and their figures took more natural proportions it could be seen that each carried a gun that one was a young girl although dressed so like her companion in shaggy peajacket and souwester as to be scarcely distinguished from him above the short skirt that came halfway down her high indiarubber fishingboots  by the time they had reached firmer ground and turned to look back at the sunset it could be also seen that the likeness between their faces was remarkable  both had crisp black tightly curling hair both had dark eyes and heavy eyebrows both had quick vivid complexions slightly heightened by the sea and wind  but more striking than their similarity of coloring was the likeness of expression and bearing both wore the same air of picturesque energy both bore themselves with a like graceful effrontery and selfpossession  the young man continued his way  the young girl lingered for a moment looking seaward with her small brown hand lifted to shade her eyesa precaution which her heavy eyebrows and long lashes seemed to render utterly gratuitous  come along mag  what are ye waitin for said the young man impatiently  nothin  lookin at that boat from the fort  her clear eyes were watching a small skiff invisible to less keensighted observers aground upon a flat near the mouth of the channel them chaps will have a high ole time gunnin thar stuck in the mud and the tide goin out like sixty  never you mind the sodgers returned her companion aggressively they kin take care o their own precious skins or uncle sam will do it for em i reckon  anyhow the peoplethats you and me magis expected to pay for their foolishness  thats what theyre sent yer for  ye oughter to be satisfied with that he added with deep sarcasm  i reckon they aint expected to do much off o dry land and they cant help bein queer on the water returned the young girl with a reflecting sense of justice  then they aint no call to go gunnin and wastin guvnment powder on ducks instead o injins  thets so said the girl thoughtfully  wonder ef guvnment pays for them frocks the kernels girls went cavortin round logport in last sundaythey looked like a cirkis  like ez not the old kernel gets it outer contractsone way or another  we pay for it all the same he added gloomily  jest the same ez if they were my clothes said the girl with a quick fiery little laugh aint it  wonder how theyd like my sayin that to em when they was prancin round eh jim  but her companion was evidently unprepared for this sweeping feminine deduction and stopped it with masculine promptitude  look yerinstead o botherin your head about what the fort girls wear youd better trot along a little more lively  its late enough now  but these darned boots hurt like pizen said the girl limping they swallowed a lot o water over the tops while i was wadin down there and my feet go swashin around like in a churn every step  lean on me baby he returned passing his arm around her waist and dropping her head smartly on his shoulder  thar  the act was brotherly and slightly contemptuous but it was sufficient to at once establish their kinship  they continued on thus for some moments in silence the girl i fear after the fashion of her sex taking the fullest advantage of this slightly sentimental and caressing attitude  they were moving now along the edge of the marsh parallel with the line of rapidly fading horizon following some trail only known to their keen youthful eyes it was growing darker and darker  the cries of the seabirds had ceased even the call of a belated plover had died away inland the hush of death lay over the black funereal pall of marsh at their side the tide had run out with the day  even the seabreeze had lulled in this dead slackwater of all nature as if waiting outside the bar with the ocean the stars and the night  suddenly the girl stopped and halted her companion  the faint far sound of a bugle broke the silence if the idea of interruption could have been conveyed by the two or three exquisite vibrations that seemed born of that silence itself and to fade and die in it without break or discord  yet it was only the retreat call from the fort two miles distant and invisible  the young girls face had become irradiated and her small mouth half opened as she listened  do you know jim she said with a confidential sigh i allus put words to that when i hear itits so powful pretty  it allus goes to me like this goes the day far away with the light and the night comes alongcomes alongcomes alonglike aa sooong  she here lifted her voice a sweet fresh boyish contralto in such an admirable imitation of the bugle that her brother after the fashion of more select auditors was for a moment quite convinced that the words meant something  nevertheless as a brother it was his duty to crush this weakness  yes and it saysshut your head go to bed he returned irascibly and youd better come along if were goin to hev any supper  theres yeller bob hez got ahead of us over there with the game already  the girl glanced towards a slouching burdened figure that now appeared to be preceding them straightened herself suddenly and then looked attentively towards the marsh  not the sodgers again said her brother impatiently  no she said quickly but if that dont beat anythin  id hev sworn jim that yeller bob was somewhere behind us  i saw him only jest now when taps sounded somewhere over thar  she pointed with a halfuneasy expression in quite another direction from that in which the slouching yellow bob had just loomed  tell ye what mag makin poetry outer bugle calls hez kinder muddled ye  thats yeller bob ahead and ye orter know injins well enuff by this time to remember that they allus crop up jest when ye dont expect them  and theres the bresh jest afore us  come  the bresh or low bushes was really a line of stunted willows and alders that seemed to have gradually sunk into the level of the plain but increased in size farther inland until they grew to the height and density of a wood  seen from the channel it had the appearance of a green cape or promontory thrust upon the marsh passing through its tangled recesses with the aid of some unerring instinct the two companions emerged upon another and much larger level that seemed as illimitable as the bay  the strong breath of the ocean lying just beyond the bar and estuary they were now facing came to them salt and humid as another tide  the nearer expanse of open water reflected the afterglow and lightened the landscape  and between the two wayfarers and the horizon rose bleak and startling the strange outlines of their home  at first it seemed a ruined colonnade of many pillars whose base and pediment were buried in the earth supporting a long parallelogram of entablature and cornices  but a second glance showed it to be a onestoried building upheld above the marsh by numberless piles placed at regular distances some of them sunken or inclined from the perpendicular increasing the first illusion between these pillars which permitted a free circulation of air and at extraordinary tides even the waters of the bay itself the level waste of marsh the bay the surges of the bar and finally the red horizon line were distinctly visible  a railed gallery or platform supported also on piles and reached by steps from the marsh ran around the building and gave access to the several rooms and offices  but if the appearance of this lacustrine and amphibious dwelling was striking and not without a certain rude and massive grandeur its grounds and possessions through which the brother and sister were still picking their way were even more grotesque and remarkable  over a space of half a dozen acres the flotsam and jetsam of years of tidal offerings were collected and even guarded with a certain care  the blackened hulks of huge uprooted trees scarcely distinguishable from the fragments of genuine wrecks beside them were securely fastened by chains to stakes and piles driven in the marsh while heaps of broken and disjointed bamboo orange crates held together by ropes of fibre glistened like ligamented bones heaped in the dead valley  masts spars fragments of shellencrusted boats binnacles roundhouses and galleys and part of the afterdeck of a coasting schooner had ceased their wanderings and found rest in this vast cemetery of the sea  the legend on a wheelhouse the lettering on a stern or bow served for mortuary inscription  wailed over by the trade winds mourned by lamenting seabirds once every year the tide visited its lost dead and left them wet with its tears  to such a spot and its surroundings the atmosphere of tradition and mystery was not wanting  six years ago boone culpepper had built the house and brought to it his wifevariously believed to be a gypsy a mexican a bright mulatto a digger indian a south sea princess from tahiti somebody elses wifebut in reality a little creole woman from new orleans with whom he had contracted a marriage with other gambling debts during a winters vacation from his home in virginia at the end of two years she had died succumbing as differently stated from perpetual wet feet or the misanthropic idiosyncrasies of her husband and leaving behind her a girl of twelve and a boy of sixteen to console him  how futile was this bequest may be guessed from a brief summary of mr culpeppers peculiarities  they were the development of a singular form of aggrandizement and misanthropy  on his arrival at logport he had bought a part of the apparently valueless dedlow marsh from the government at less than a dollar an acre continuing his singular investment year by year until he was the owner of three leagues of amphibious domain  it was then discovered that this property carried with it the water front of divers valuable and convenient sites for manufactures and the commercial ports of a noble bay as well as the natural embarcaderos of some lumbering inland settlements  boone culpepper would not sell  boone culpepper would not rent or lease  boone culpepper held an invincible blockade of his neighbors and the progress and improvement he despisedgranting only after a royal fashion occasional license revocable at pleasure in the shape of tolls which amply supported him with the game he shot in his kingfishers eyrie on the marsh  even the government that had made him powerful was obliged to condemn a part of his property at an equitable price for the purposes of fort redwood in which the adjacent town of logport shared  and boone culpepper unable to resist the act refused to receive the compensation or quitclaim the town  in his scant intercourse with his neighbors he always alluded to it as his own showed it to his children as part of their strange inheritance and exhibited the starry flag that floated from the fort as a flaunting insult to their youthful eyes hated feared and superstitiously shunned by some regarded as a madman by others familiarly known as the kingfisher of dedlow boone culpepper was one day found floating dead in his skiff with a charge of shot through his head and shoulders  the shotgun lying at his feet at the bottom of the boat indicated the accident as recorded in the verdict of the coroners jurybut not by the people  a thousand rumors of murder or suicide prevailed but always with the universal rider served him right so invincible was this feeling that but few attended his last rites which took place at high water  the delay of the officiating clergyman lost the tide the homely catafalquehis own boatwas left aground on the marsh and deserted by all mourners except the two children  whatever he had instilled into them by precept and example whatever took place that night in their lonely watch by his bier on the black marshes it was certain that those who confidently looked for any change in the administration of the dedlow marsh were cruelly mistaken  the old kingfisher was dead but he had left in the nest two young birds more beautiful and graceful it was true yet as fierce and tenacious of beak and talon   ii  arriving at the house the young people ascended the outer flight of wooden steps which bore an odd likeness to the companionway of a vessel and the gallery or deck as it was calledwhere a number of nets floats and buoys thrown over the railing completed the nautical resemblance  this part of the building was evidently devoted to kitchen diningroom and domestic offices the principal room in the centre serving as hall or livingroom and communicating on the other side with two sleeping apartments  it was of considerable size with heavy lateral beams across the ceilingbuilt like the rest of the house with a certain maritime strengthand looked not unlike a saloon cabin  an enormous open franklin stove between the windows as large as a chimney blazing with driftwood gave light and heat to the apartment and brought into flickering relief the boarded walls hung with the spoils of sea and shore and glittering with gunbarrels fowlingpieces of all sizes from the long duckinggun mounted on a swivel for boat use to the light singlebarrel or carbine stood in racks against the walls gamebags revolvers in their holsters hunting and fishing knives in their sheaths depended from hooks above them in one corner stood a harpoon in another two or three indian spears for salmon  the carpetless floor and rude chairs and settles were covered with otter mink beaver and a quantity of valuable sealskins with a few larger pelts of the bear and elk the only attempt at decoration was the displayed wings and breasts of the wood and harlequin duck the muir the cormorant the gull the gannet and the femininely delicate halfmourning of petrel and plover nailed against the wall  the influence of the sea was dominant above all and asserted its saline odors even through the spice of the curling driftwood smoke that half veiled the ceiling  a berryeyed old indian woman with the complexion of dried salmon her daughter also with berry eyes and with a face that seemed wholly made of a moist laugh yellow bob a digger buck so called from the prevailing ochre markings of his cheek and washooh an exchief a nondescript in a blanket looking like a cheap and dirty doll whose fibrous hair was badly nailed on his carved wooden head composed the culpepper household  while the two former were preparing supper in the adjacent diningroom yellow bob relieved of his burden of game appeared on the gallery and beckoned mysteriously to his master through the window  james culpepper went out returned quickly and after a minutes hesitation and an uneasy glance towards his sister who had meantime pushed back her souwester from her forehead and without taking off her jacket had dropped into a chair before the fire with her back towards him took his gun noiselessly from the rack and saying carelessly that he would be back in a moment disappeared  left to herself maggie coolly pulled off her long boots and stockings and comfortably opposed to the fire two very pretty feet and ankles whose delicate purity was slightly bluebleached by confinement in the tepid seawater  the contrast of their waxen whiteness with her blue woolen skirt and with even the skin of her sunburnt hands and wrists apparently amused her and she sat for some moments with her elbows on her knees her skirts slightly raised contemplating them and curling her toes with evident satisfaction  the firelight playing upon the rich coloring of her face the fringe of jetblack curls that almost met the thick sweep of eyebrows and left her only a white strip of forehead her short upper lip and small chin rounded but resolute completed a piquant and striking figure  the rich brown shadows on the smokestained walls and ceiling the occasional starting into relief of the scutcheons of brilliant plumage and the momentary glitter of the steel barrels made a quaint background to this charming picture sitting there and following some lingering memory of her tramp on the marsh she hummed to herself a few notes of the bugle call that had impressed herat first softly and finally with the full pitch of her voice  suddenly she stopped  there was a faint and unmistakable rapping on the floor beneath her it was distinct but cautiously given as if intended to be audible to her alone  for a moment she stood upright her feet still bare and glistening on the otter skin that served as a rug there were two doors to the room one from which her brother had disappeared which led to the steps the other giving on the back gallery looking inland with a quick instinct she caught up her gun and ran to that one but not before a rapid scramble near the railing was followed by a cautious opening of the door  she was just in time to shut it on the extended arm and light blue sleeve of an army overcoat that protruded through the opening and for a moment threw her whole weight against it  a dhrop of whiskey miss for the love of god  she retained her hold cocked her weapon and stepped back a pace from the door  the blue sleeve was followed by the rest of the overcoat and a blue cap with the infantry blazoning and the letter h on its peak  they were for the moment more distinguishable than the man beneath themgrimed and blackened with the slime of the marsh  but what could be seen of his mudstained face was more grotesque than terrifying  a combination of weakness and audacity insinuation and timidity struggled through the dirt for expression  his small blue eyes were not illnatured and even the intruding arm trembled more from exhaustion than passion  ony a dhrop miss he repeated piteously and av ye pleeze quick afore im stharved with the cold entoirely  she looked at him intentlywithout lowering her gun  who are you  thin its the truth ill tell ye misswhisth then he said in a halfwhisper im a desarter  then it was you that was doggin us on the marsh  it was the sarjint i was lavin miss  she looked at him hesitatingly  stay outside there if you move a step into the room ill blow you out of it  he stepped back on the gallery  she closed the door bolted it and still holding the gun opened a cupboard poured out a glass of whiskey and returning to the door opened it and handed him the liquor  she watched him drain it eagerly saw the fiery stimulant put life into his shivering frame trembling hands and kindle his dull eyeandquietly raised her gun again  ah put it down miss put it down  fwhots the use  sure the bullets yee carry in them oiyes of yours is more deadly  its out here oill sthand glory be to god all night without movin a fut till the sarjint comes to take me av ye wont levil them oiyes at me like that ah whirra look at that now but its a gooddess she isthe livin jaynus of warr standin there like a statoo wid her alybaster fut put forward  in her pride and conscious superiority any suggestion of shame at thus appearing before a common man and a mendicant was as impossible to her nature as it would have been to a queen or the goddess of his simile his presence and his compliment alike passed her calm modesty unchallenged  the wretched scamp recognized the fact and felt its power and it was with a superstitious reverence asserting itself through his native extravagance that he raised his grimy hand to his cap in military salute and became respectfully rigid  then the sodgers were huntin you she said thoughtfully lowering her weapon  thrue for you missthey worr and its meself that was lyin flat in the ditch wid me faytures makin an illigant cast in the mudmore betoken as ye see even nowand the

kernal prestonsez couldnt hold a candle to her  brought up on the spanish frontier maggie culpepper was one of the few american girls who was not familiar with the irish race  the rare smile that momentarily lit up her petulant mouth seemed to justify the intruders praise  but it passed quickly and she returned dryly  that means you want more drink suthin to eat and clothes suppose my brother comes back and ketches you here  shure miss hes just now hunten me along wid his two haythen diggers beyond the laygoon there  it worr the yellar one that sphotted me lyin there in the ditch it worr

friends of the fort she said finally but i dont reckon for that reason my brother will cotton to you  stay out thar where ye are till i come to ye  if you hear me singin again youll know hes come back and yed better scoot with what youve already got and be thankful  she shut the door again and locked it went into the diningroom returned with some provisions wrapped in paper took a common wicker flask from the wall passed into her brothers bedroom and came out with a flannel shirt overalls and a coarse indian blanket and reopening the door placed them before the astonished and delighted vagabond  his eye glistened he began glory be to god but for once his habitual extravagance failed him  nature triumphed with a more eloquent silence over his wellworn art  he hurriedly wiped his begrimed face and eyes with the shirt she had given him and catching the sleeve of her rough peajacket in his dirty hand raised it to his lips  go she said imperiously  get away while you can  av it vas me last wordsits speechless oi am he stammered and disappeared over the railing  she remained for a moment holding the door half open and gazing into the darkness that seemed to flow in like a tide  then she shut it and going into her bedroom resumed her interrupted toilette  when she emerged again she was smartly stockinged and slippered and even the blue serge skirt was exchanged for a bright print with a white fichu tied around her throat  an attempt to subdue her rebellious curls had resulted in the construction from their ruins of a low norman arch across her forehead with pillared abutments of ringlets  when her brother returned a few moments later she did not look up but remained perhaps a little ostentatiously bending over the fire  bob allowed that the fort boat was huntin mendeserters i reckon said jim aggrievedly  wanted me to believe that he saw one on the marsh hidin  ony an injin lie i reckon to git a little extra firewater for toting me out to the bresh on a fools errand  oh thats where you went said maggie addressing the fire since when hev you tuk partnership with the guvnment and kernel preston to hunt up and take keer of their property  well i aint goin to hev such wreckage as they pick up and enlist set adrift on our marshes mag said jim decidedly  what would you hev done had you ketched him said maggie looking suddenly into her brothers face  given him a dose of snipeshot that hed remember and be thankful it wasnt slugs said jim promptly  observing a deeper seriousness in her attitude he added why if it was in wartime hed get a ball from them sodgers on sight  yes but you aint got no call to interfere said maggie  aint i  why hes no better than an outlaw  i aint sure that he hasnt been stealin or killin somebody over theer  not that man said maggie impulsively  not what man said her brother facing her quickly  why returned maggie repairing her indiscretion with feminine dexterity not any man who might have knocked you and me over on the marshes in the dusk and grabbed our guns  wish hed hev tried it said the brother with a superior smile but a quickly rising color  where dye suppose id hev been all the while  maggie saw her mistake and for the first time in her life resolved to keep a secret from her brotherovernight  suppers gettin cold she said rising  they went into the diningrooman apartment as plainly furnished as the one they had quitted but in its shelves cupboards and closely fitting boarding bearing out the general nautical suggestion of the houseand seated themselves before a small table on which their frugal meal was spread  in this teteatete position jim suddenly laid down his knife and fork and stared at his sister  hello  whats the matter said maggie starting slightly  how you do skeer one  whos been prinkin eh  my har was in kinks all along o that hat said maggie with a return of higher color and i had to straighten it  its a boys hat not a girls  but that necktie and that gownand all those frills and tuckers continued jim generalizing with a rapid twirling of his fingers over her  are you expectin judge martin or the expressman this evening  judge martin was the lawyer of logport who had proven her fathers will and had since raved about his single interview with the kingfishers beautiful daughter the expressman was a young fellow who was popularly supposed to have left his heart while delivering another valuable package on maggie in person and had never been the same man since  it was a wellworn fraternal pleasantry that had done duty many a winters evening as a happy combination of moral admonition and cheerfulness  maggie usually paid it the tribute of a quick little laugh and a sisterly pinch but that evening those marks of approbation were withheld  jim dear said she when their spartan repast was concluded and they were reestablished before the livingroom fire  what was it the redwood mill kempany offered you for that piece near dead mans slough  jim took his pipe from his lips long enough to say ten thousand dollars and put it back again  and what do ye kalkilate all our property letting alone this yer house and the driftwood front is worth all together  includin wot the govnment owes usfor thats all ours ye know said jim quickly  noleavin that outjest for greens you know suggested maggie  well nigh onter a hundred and seventyfive thousand dollars i reckon by and large  thats a heap o money jim  i reckon old kernel preston wouldnt raise that in a hundred years continued maggie warming her knees by the fire  in five million years said jim promptly sweeping away further discussion  after a pause he added you and me mag kin see anybodys pile and go em fifty thousand better  there were a few moments of complete silence in which maggie smoothed her knees and jims pipe which seemed to have become gorged and apoplectic with its owners wealth snored unctuously  jim dear what ifits ony an idea of mine you knowwhat if you sold that piece to the redwood mill and we jest tuk that money andandand jest lifted the har offer them folks at logport jest astonished em  jest tuk the best rooms in that new hotel got a hoss and buggy dressed ourselves you and me fit to kill and made them fort people take a back seat in the lords tabernacle oncet for all you see what i mean jim she said hastily as her brother seemed to be succumbing like his pipe in apoplectic astonishment jest ony to show em what we could do if we keerd  lord when we done it and spent the money wed jest snap our fingers and skip back yer ez natral ez life  ye dont think jim she said suddenly turning half fiercely upon him that id allow to live among emto stay a menet after that  jim laid down his pipe and gazed at his sister with stony deliberation andwhatdoyoukalkilateto make by all that he said with scornful distinctness  why jest to show em we have got money and could buy em all up if we wanted to returned maggie sticking boldly to her guns albeit with a vague conviction that her fire was weakened through elevation and somewhat alarmed at the deliberation of the enemy  and you mean to say they dont know it now he continued with slow derision  no said maggie  why theers that new schoolmarm over at logport you know jim the one that wanted to take your picter in your boat for a young smuggler or fancy pirate or eyetalian fisherman and allowed that your handsomed some and offered to pay you for sittindo you reckon shed believe you owned the land her schoolhouse was built on no  lots of em dont  lots of em thinks were poor and low downand them ez doesnt thinks  what asked her brother sharply  that were mean  the quick color came to jims cheek  so he said facing her quickly for the sake of a lot of riffraff and scum thats drifted here around usjest for the sake of cuttin a swell before themyoull go out among the hounds ez allowed your mother was a spanish nigger or a kanaka ez called your father a pirate and landgrabber ez much as allowed he was shot by some one or killed himself a purpose ez said you was a heathen and a looney because you didnt go to school or church along with their trash ez kept away from maws sickness ez if it was smallpox and dads funral ez if he was a hossthief and left you and me to watch his coffin on the marshes all night till the tide kem back  and now youyou that jined hands with me that night over our father lyin there cold and despisedez if he was a dead dog thrown up by the tideand swore that ez long ez that tide ebbed and flowed it couldnt bring you to them or them to you agin  you now wantwhat  what why to go and cast your lot among em and live among em and join in their godforsaken holler foolishness andandand  stop  its a lie  i didnt say that  dont you dare to say it said the girl springing to her feet and facing her brother in turn with flashing eyes  for a moment the two stared at each otherit might have been as in a mirror so perfectly were their passions reflected in each line shade and color of the others face  it was as if they had each confronted their own passionate and willful souls and were frightened  it had often occurred before always with the same invariable ending  the young mans eyes lowered first the girls filled with tears  well ef ye didnt mean that what did ye mean said jim sinking with sullen apology back into his chair  ionlymeant itforforrevenge sobbed maggie  oh said jim as if allowing his higher nature to be touched by this noble instinct  but i didnt jest see where the revenge kem in  no  but never mind now jim said maggie ostentatiously ignoring after the fashion of her sex the trouble she had provoked but to thinkthatthatyou thoughtsobbing  but i didnt magcaressingly  with this very vague and impotent conclusion maggie permitted herself to be drawn beside her brother and for a few moments they plumed each others ruffled feathers and smoothed each others lifted crests like two beautiful young specimens of that halcyon genus to which they were popularly supposed to belong  at the end of half an hour jim rose and yawning slightly said in a perfunctory way  wheres the book  the book in question was the bible  it had been the selfimposed custom of these two young people to read aloud a chapter every night as their one vague formula of literary and religious discipline  when it was produced maggie presuming on his affectionate and penitential condition suggested that tonight he should pick out suthin interestin  but this unorthodox frivolity was sternly put aside by jimalbeit by way of compromise he agreed to chance it i e open its pages at random  he did so  generally he allowed himself a moments judicious pause for a certain chaste preliminary inspection necessary before reading aloud to a girl  tonight he omitted that modest precaution and in a pleasant voice which in reading was singularly free from colloquial infelicities of pronunciation began at once  curse ye meroz said the angel of the lord curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to the help of the lord against the mighty  oh you looked first said maggie  i didnt nowhonest injin  i just opened  go on said maggie eagerly shoving him and interposing her neck over his shoulder  and jim continued deborahs wonderful song of jael and sisera to the bitter end of its strong monosyllabic climax  there he said closing the volume thats what i call revenge thats the real scripture thingno fancy frills theer  yes but jim dear dont you see that she treated him firstsorter got round him with free milk and butter and reglarly blandished him argued maggie earnestly  but jim declined to accept this feminine suggestion or to pursue the subject further and after a fraternal embrace they separated for the night  jim lingered long enough to look after the fastening of the door and windows and maggie remained for some moments at her casement looking across the gallery to the marsh beyond  the moon had risen the tide was half up  whatever sign or trace of alien footprint or occupation had been there was already smoothly obliterated even the configuration of the land had changed  a black cape had disappeared a level line of shore had been eaten into by teeth of glistening silver  the whole dark surface of the marsh was beginning to be streaked with shining veins as if a new life was coursing through it  part of the open bay before the fort encroaching upon the shore seemed in the moonlight to be reaching a white and outstretched arm towards the nest of the kingfisher   iii  the reveille at fort redwood had been supplemented full five minutes by the voice of lieutenant george calverts servant before that young officer struggled from his bed  his head was splitting his tongue and lips were dry and feverish his bloodshot eyes were shrinking from the insufferable light of the day his mind a confused medley of the past night and the present morning of cards and wild revelry and the vision of a reproachfully trim orderly standing at his door with reports and orders which he now held composedly in his hand  for lieutenant calvert had been enjoying a symposium variously known as stag feed and a wild stormy night with several of his brother officers and a sickening conviction that it was not the first or the last time he had indulged in these festivities  at that moment he loathed himself and then after the usual derelict fashion cursed the fate that had sent him after graduating to a frontier garrisonthe dull monotony of whose duties made the border horseplay of dissipation a relief  already he had reached the miserable point of envying the veteran capacities of his superiors and equals  if i could drink like kirby or crowninshield or if there was any other cursed thing a man could do in this hole he had wretchedly repeated to himself after each misspent occasion and yet already he was looking forward to them as part of a subs duty and worthy his emulation already the dream of social recreation fostered by west point had been rudely dispelled beyond the garrison circle of colonel prestons family and two officers wives there was no society the vague distrust and civil jealousy with which some frontier communities regard the federal power heightened in this instance by the uncompromising attitude the government had taken towards the settlers severe indian policy had kept the people of logport aloof from the fort  the regimental band might pipe to them on saturdays but they would not dance  howbeit lieutenant calvert dressed himself with uncertain hands but mechanical regularity and neatness and under the automatic training of discipline and duty managed to button his tunic tightly over his feelings to pull himself together with his swordbelt compressing a still cadetlike waist and to present that indescribable combination of precision and jauntiness which his brother officers too often allowed to lapse into frontier carelessness  his closely clipped light hair yet dripping from a plunge in the cold water had been brushed and parted with military exactitude and when surmounted by his cap with the peak in an artful suggestion of extra smartness tipped forward over his eyes only his pale facea shade lighter than his little blonde moustacheshowed his last nights excesses  he was mechanically reaching for his sword and staring confusedly at the papers on his table when his servant interrupted  major bromley arranged that lieutenant kirby takes your sash this morning as youre not well sir and youre to report for special to the colonel he added pointing discreetly to the envelope  touched by this consideration of his superior major bromley who had been one of the veterans of last nights engagement calvert mastered the contents of the envelope without the customary anathema of specials said thank you parks and passed out on the veranda  the glare of the quiet sunlit quadrangle clean as a wellswept floor the whitewashed walls and galleries of the barrack buildings beyond the white and green palisade of officers cottages on either side and the glitter of a sentrys bayonet were for a moment intolerable to him  yet by a kind of subtle irony never before had the genius and spirit of the vocation he had chosen seemed to be as incarnate as in the scene before him  seclusion selfrestraint cleanliness regularity sobriety the atmosphere of a wholesome life the austere reserve of a monastery without its mysterious or pensive meditation were all there  to escape which he had of his own free will successively accepted a fools distraction the inevitable result of which was the viewing of them the next morning with tremulous nerves and aching eyeballs  an hour later lieutenant george calvert had received his final instructions from colonel preston to take charge of a small detachment to recover and bring back certain deserters but notably one dennis mcaffrey of company h charged additionally with mutinous solicitation and example  as calvert stood before his superior that distinguished officer whose oratorical powers had been considerably stimulated through a long course of returning thanks for the army slightly expanded his chest and said paternally  i am aware mr calvert that duties of this kind are somewhat distasteful to young officers and are apt to be considered in the light of police detail but i must remind you that no one part of a soldiers duty can be held more important or honorable than another and that the fulfilment of any one however trifling must with honor to himself and security to his comrades receive his fullest devotion a sergeant and a file of men might perform your duty but i require in addition the discretion courtesy and consideration of a gentleman who will command an equal respect from those with whom his duty brings him in contact  the unhappy prejudices which the settlers show to the military authority here render this as you are aware a difficult service but i believe that you will without forgetting the respect due to yourself and the government you represent avoid arousing these prejudices by any harshness or inviting any conflict with the civil authority the limits of their authority you will find in your written instructions but you might gain their confidence and impress them mr calvert with the idea of your being their auxiliary in the interests of justiceyou understand  even if you are unsuccessful in bringing back the men you will do your best to ascertain if their escape has been due to the sympathy of the settlers or even with their preliminary connivance  they may not be aware that inciting enlisted men to desert is a criminal offence you will use your own discretion in informing them of the fact or not as occasion may serve you  i have only to add that while you are on the waters of this bay and the land covered by its tides you have no opposition of authority and are responsible to no one but your military superiors  goodbye mr calvert  let me hear a good account of you  considerably moved by colonel prestons manner which was as paternal and real as his rhetoric was somewhat perfunctory calvert half forgot his woes as he stepped from the commandants piazza but he had to face a group of his brother officers who were awaiting him  goodbye calvert said major bromley a day or two out on grass wont hurt youand a change from commissary whiskey will put you all right  by the way if you hear of any better stuff at westport than theyre giving us here sample it and let us know  take care of yourself  give your men a chance to talk to you now and then and you may get something from them especially donovan  keep your eye on ramon  you can trust your sergeant straight along  goodbye george said kirby  i suppose the old man told you that although no part of a soldiers duty was better than another your service was a very delicate one just fitted for you eh  he always does when hes cut out some hellish scrubwork for a chap and told you too that as long as you didnt go ashore and kept to a dispatchboat or an eightoared gig where you couldnt deploy your men or dress a line youd be invincible  he did say something like that smiled calvert with an uneasy recollection however that it was the part of his superiors speech that particularly impressed him  of course said kirby gravely that as an infantry officer is clearly your duty  and dont forget george said rollins still more gravely that whatever may befall you you belong to a section of that numerically small but powerfully diversified organizationthe american army remember that in the hour of peril you can address your men in any language and be perfectly understood  and remember that when you proudly stand before them the eyes not only of your own country but of nearly all the others are upon you goodbye georgey  i heard the major hint something about whiskey they say that old pirate kingfisher culpepper had a stock of the real thing from robertson county laid in his shebang on the marsh just before he died  pity we arent on terms with them for the cubs cannot drink it and might be induced to sell  shouldnt wonder by the way if your friend mcaffrey was hanging round somewhere there he always had a keen scent  you might confiscate it as an incitement to desertion you know  the girls pretty and ought to be growing up now  but haply at this point the sergeant stopped further raillery by reporting the detachment ready and drawing his sword calvert with a confused head a remorseful heart but an unfaltering step marched off his men on his delicate mission  it was four oclock when he entered jonesville  following a matteroffact idea of his own he had brought his men the greater distance by a circuitous route through the woods thus avoiding the ostentatious exposure of his party on the open bay in a wellmanned boat to an extended view from the three leagues of shore and marsh opposite  crossing the stream which here separated him from the dedlow marsh by the common ferry he had thus been enabled to halt unperceived below the settlement and occupy the two roads by which the fugitives could escape inland  he had deemed it not impossible that after the previous visit of the sergeant the deserters hidden in the vicinity might return to jonesville in the belief that the visit would not be repeated so soon  leaving a part of his small force to patrol the road and another to deploy over the upland meadows he entered the village  by the exercise of some boyish diplomacy and a certain prepossessing grace which he knew when and how to employ he became satisfied that the objects of his quest were not therehowever their whereabouts might have been known to the people  dividing his party again he concluded to take a corporal and a few men and explore the lower marshes himself  the preoccupation of duty exercise and perhaps above all the keen stimulus of the iodineladen salt air seemed to clear his mind and invigorate his body  he had never been in the marsh before and enjoyed its novelty with the zest of youth  it was the hour when the tide of its feathered life was at its flood  clouds of duck and teal passing from the fresh water of the river to the salt pools of the marshes perpetually swept his path with flying shadows at times it seemed as if even the uncertain ground around him itself arose and sped away on dusky wings  the vicinity of hidden pools and sloughs was betrayed by startled splashings a few paces from their marching feet arose the sunlit pinions of a swan the air was filled with multitudinous small cries and pipings  in this vocal confusion it was some minutes before he recognized the voice of one of his outflankers calling to the other  an important discovery had been made  in a long tongue of bushes that ran down to the marsh they had found a mudstained uniform complete even to the cap bearing the initial of the deserters company  is there any hut or cabin hereabouts schmidt asked calvert  dot vos schoost it lefdennun replied his corporal  dot vos de shanty from der kingvisherold gulbebber  i pet a dollar py shimminy dot der men haf der gekommt  he pointed through the brake to a long low building that now raised itself white in the sunlight above the many blackened piles  calvert saw in a single reconnoitring glance that it had but one approachthe flight of steps from the marsh  instructing his men to fall in on the outer edge of the brake and await his orders he quickly made his way across the space and ascended the steps  passing along the gallery he knocked at the front door there was no response  he repeated his knock  then the window beside it opened suddenly and he was confronted with the doublemuzzle of a long duckinggun  glancing instinctively along the barrels he saw at their other extremity the bright eyes brilliant color and small set mouth of a remarkably handsome girl  it was the fact and to the credit of his training that he paid more attention to the eyes than to the challenge of the shining tubes before him  jest stop where you arewill you said the girl determinedly  calverts face betrayed not the slightest terror or surprise immovable as on parade he carried his white gloved hand to his cap and said gently with pleasure  oh yes said the girl quickly but if you move a step ill jest blow you and your gloves offer that railin inter the marsh  i trust not returned calvert smiling  and why  because it would deprive me of the pleasure of a few moments conversation with youand ive only one pair of gloves with me  he was still watching her beautiful eyesrespectfully admiringly and strategically  for he was quite convinced that if he did move she would certainly discharge one or both barrels at him  wheres the rest of you she continued sharply  about three hundred yards away in the covert not near enough to trouble you  will they come here  i trust not  you trust not she repeated scornfully  why  because they would be disobeying orders  she lowered her gun slightly but kept her black brows levelled at him i reckon im a match for you she said with a slightly contemptuous glance at his slight figure and opened the door  for a moment they stood looking at each other  he saw besides the handsome face and eyes that had charmed him a tall slim figure made broader across the shoulders by an open peajacket that showed a mans red flannel shirt belted at the waist over a blue skirt with the collar knotted by a sailors black handkerchief and turned back over a pretty though sunburnt throat  she saw a rather undersized young fellow in a jaunty undress uniform scant of gold braid and bearing only the single gold shoulderbars of his rank but scrupulously neat and well fitting lightcolored hair cropped close the smallest of light moustaches clear and penetrating blue eyes and a few freckles completed a picture that did not prepossess her  she was therefore the more inclined to resent the perfect ease and selfpossession with which the stranger carried off these manifest defects before her  she laid aside the gun put her hands deep in the pockets of her peajacket and slightly squaring her shoulders said curtly what do you want  a very little information which i trust it will not trouble you to give me  my men have just discovered the uniform belonging to a deserter from the fort lying in the bushes yonder  can you give me the slightest idea how it came there  what right have you trapseing over our property she said turning upon him sharply with a slight paling of color  none whatever  then what did you come for  to ask that permission in case you would give me no information  why dont you ask my brother and not a woman  were you afraid  he could hardly have done me the honor of placing me in more peril than you have returned calvert smiling  then i have the pleasure of addressing miss culpepper  im jim culpeppers sister  and i believe equally able to give or refuse the permission i ask  and what if i refuse  then i have only to ask pardon for having troubled you go back and return here with the tide  you dont resist that with a shotgun do you he asked pleasantly  maggie culpepper was already familiar with the accepted theory of the supreme jurisdiction of the federal sea  she half turned her back upon him partly to show her contempt but partly to evade the domination of his clear goodhumored and selfsustained little eyes  i dont know anythin about your deserters nor what rags o theirs happen to be floated up here she said angrily and dont care to you kin do what you like  then im afraid i should remain here a little longer miss culpepper but my duty  your wot she interrupted disdainfully  i suppose i am talking shop he said smilingly  then my business  your businesspickin up halfstarved runaways  and i trust sometimes a kind friend he suggested with a grave bow  you trust  look yer young man she said with her quick fierce little laugh i reckon you trust a heap too much  she would like to have added with your freckled face red hair and little eyesbut this would have obliged her to face them again which she did not care to do  calvert stepped back lifted his hand to his cap still pleasantly and then walked gravely along the gallery down the steps and towards the cover  from her window unseen she followed his neat little figure moving undeviatingly on without looking to the left or right and still less towards the house he had just quitted then she saw the sunlight flash on crossbelt plates and steel barrels and a light blue line issued from out the dark green bushes round the point and disappeared  and then it suddenly occurred to her what she had been doing  this then was her first step towards that fancy she had so lately conceived quarrelled over with her brother and lay awake last night to place anew in spite of all opposition  this was her brilliant idea of dazzling and subduing logport and the fort  had she grown silly or what had happened  could she have dreamed of the coming of this whippersnapper with his insufferable airs after that beggarly deserter  i am afraid that for a few moments the miserable fugitive had as small a place in maggies sympathy as the redoubtable whippersnapper himself  and now the cherished dream of triumph and conquest was over  what a looney she had been instead of inviting him in and outdoing him in company manners and fooling him about the deserter and then blazing upon him afterwards at logport in the glory of her first spent wealth and finery she had driven him away  and now hell go and telltell the fort girls of his hairbreadth escape from the claws of the kingfishers daughter  the thought brought a few bitter tears to her eyes but she wiped them away  the thought brought also the terrible conviction that jim was right that there could be nothing but open antagonism between them and the traducers of their parents as she herself had instinctively shown but she presently wiped that conviction away also as she had her tears  half an hour later she was attracted by the appearance from the windows of certain straggling blue spots on the upland that seemed moving diagonally towards the marsh  she did not know that it was calverts second detail joining him but believed for a moment that he had not yet departed and was strangely relieved  still later the frequent disturbed cries of coot heron and marshhen recognizing the presence of unusual invaders of their solitude distracted her yet more and forced her at last with increasing color and an uneasy sense of shyness to steal out to the gallery for a swift furtive survey of the marsh but an utterly unexpected sight met her eyes and kept her motionless  the birds were rising everywhere and drifting away with querulous perturbation before a small but augmented blue detachment that was moving with monotonous regularity towards the point of bushes where she had seen the young officer previously disappear  in their midst between two soldiers with fixed bayonets marched the man whom even at that distance she instantly recognized as the deserter of the preceding night in the very clothes she had given him  to complete her consternation a little to the right marched the young officer also but accompanied by and apparently on the most amicable terms with jimher own brother  to forget all else and dart down the steps flying towards the point of bushes scarcely knowing why or what she was doing was to maggie the impulse and work of a moment  when she had reached it the party were not twenty paces away  but here a shyness and hesitation again seized her and she shrank back in the bushes with an instinctive cry to her brother inarticulate upon her lips  they came nearer they were opposite to her her brother jim keeping step with the invader and even conversing with him with an animation she had seldom seen upon his facethey passed  she had been unnoticed except by one  the roving eye of the deserter had detected her handsome face among the leaves slightly turned towards it and poured out his whole soul in a single swift wink of eloquent but indescribable confidence  when they had quite gone she crept back to the house a little reassured but still tremulous  when her brother returned at nightfall he found her brooding over the fire in the same attitude as on the previous night  i reckon ye might hev seen me go by with the sodgers he said seating himself beside her a little awkwardly and with an unusual assumption of carelessness  maggie without looking up was languidly surprised  he had been with the soldiersand where  about two hours ago i met this yer leftenant calvert he went on with increasing awkwardness andoh i say maghe said he saw you and hoped he hadnt troubled ye andandye saw him didnt ye  maggie with all the red of the fire concentrated in her cheek as she gazed at the flame believed carelessly that she had seen a shrimp in uniform asking questions  oh he aint a bit stuck up said jim quickly thats what i like about him  hes ez natral ez you be and tuck my arm walkin around carelesslike laffen at what he was doin ez ef it was a game and he wasnt sole commander of forty men  hes only a year or two older than meandandhe stopped and looked uneasily at maggie  so yeve bin crawfishin agin said maggie in her deepest and most scornful contralto  whos crawfishin he retorted angrily  whats this backen out o what you said yesterday  whats all this trucklin to the fort now  what  well now look yer said jim rising suddenly with reproachful indignation darned if i dont jest tell ye everythin i promised him i wouldnt  he allowed it would frighten ye  frighten me repeated maggie contemptuously nevertheless with her cheek paling again  frighten mewith what  well since yer so cantankerous look yer  weve been robbed  robbed echoed maggie facing him  yes robbed by that same deserter  robbed of a suit of my clothes and my whiskeyflask and the darned skunk had em on and if it hadnt bin for that leftenant calvert and my givin him permission to hunt him over the marsh we wouldnt have caught him  robbed repeated maggie again vaguely  yes robbed  last night afore we came home  he must hev got in yer while we was comin from the boat  did did that leftenant say so stammered maggie  say it of course he did and so do i continued jim impatiently why there were my very clothes on his back and he darent deny it and if youd hearkened to me jest now instead of flyin off in tantrums youd see that thats jest how we got him and how me and the leftenant joined hands in it  i didnt give him permission to hunt deserters but thieves  i didnt help him to ketch the man that deserted from him but the skunk that took my clothes  for when the leftenant found the mans old uniform in the bush he natrally kalkilated he must hev got some other duds near by in some underhand way  dont you see eh  why look mag darned if you aint skeered after all  whod hev thought it there nowsit down dear  why youre white ez a gull  he had his arm round her as she sank back in the chair again with a forced smile  there now he said with fraternal superiority dont mind it mag any more  why its all over now  you bet he wont trouble us agin for the leftenant sez that now hes found out to be a thief theyll jest turn him over to the police and hes sure o getten six months state prison fer stealin and burglarin in our house  buthe stopped suddenly and looked at his sisters contracted face look yer mag youre sick thats whats the matter  take suthin  im better now she said with an effort its only a kind o blind chill i must hev got on the marsh last night  whats that  she had risen and grasping her brothers arm tightly had turned quickly to the window  the casement had suddenly rattled  its only the wind gettin up  it looked like a souwester when i came in  lot o scud flyin  but you take some quinine mag dont you go now and get down sick like maw  perhaps it was this wellmeant but infelicitous reference that brought a moisture to her dark eyes and caused her lips to momentarily quiver but it gave way to a quick determined setting of her whole face as she turned it once more to the fire and said slowly  i reckon ill sleep it off if i go to bed now  what time does the tide fall  about three unless this yer wind piles it up on the marsh afore then why  i was only wonderin if the boat wus safe said maggie rising  youd better hoist yourself outside some quinine instead o talken about those things said jim who preferred to discharge his fraternal responsibility by active medication  you arent fit to read tonight  good night jim she said suddenly stopping before him  good night mag  he kissed her with protecting and amiable toleration generously referring her hot hands and feverish lips to that vague mystery of feminine complaint which man admits without indorsing  they separated  jim under the stimulus of the late supposed robbery ostentatiously fastening the doors and windows with assuring comments calculated to inspire confidence in his sisters startled heart  then he went to bed  he lay awake long enough to be pleasantly conscious that the wind had increased to a gale and to be lulled again to sleep by the cosy security of the heavily timbered and tightly sealed dwelling that seemed to ride the storm like the ship it resembled  the gale swept through the piles beneath him and along the gallery as through bared spars and over wavewashed decks  the whole structure attacked above below and on all sides by the fury of the wind seemed at times to be lifted in the air  once or twice the creaking timbers simulated the sound of opening doors and passing footsteps and again dilated as if the gale had forced a passage through  but jim slept on peacefully and was at last only aroused by the brilliant sunshine staring through his window from the clear windswept blue arch beyond  dressing himself lazily he passed into the sittingroom and proceeded to knock at his sisters door as was his custom he was amazed to find it open and the room empty  entering hurriedly he saw that her bed was undisturbed as if it had not been occupied and was the more bewildered to see a note ostentatiously pinned upon the pillow addressed in pencil in a large schoolhand to jim  opening it impatiently he was startled to read as follows   dont be angry jim dearbut it was all my faultand i didnt tell you  i knew all about the deserter and i gave him the clothes and things that they say he stole  it was while you was out that night and he came and begged of me and was mournful and hidjus to behold  i thought i was helping him and getting our revenge on the fort all at the same time  dont be mad jim dear and do not be frighted fer me im going over thar to make it all rightto free him of stealingto have you left out of it alland take it all on myself  dont you be a bit feared for me  i aint skeert of the wind or of going  ill close reef everything clear the creek stretch across to injen island hugg the point and bear up fer logport  dear jimdont get madbut i couldnt bear this fooling of you nor himand that man being took for stealing any longeryour loving sister  maggie   with a confused mingling of shame anger and sudden fear he ran out on the gallery  the tide was well up half the marsh had already vanished and the little creek where he had moored his skiff was now an empty shining river  the water was everywherefringing the tussocks of salt grass with concentric curves of spume and drift or tumultuously tossing its whitecapped waves over the spreading expanse of the lower bay  the low thunder of breakers in the farther estuary broke monotonously on the ear  but his eye was fascinated by a dull shifting streak on the horizon that even as he gazed shuddered whitened along its whole line and then grew ghastly gray again  it was the ocean bar   iv  well i must say said cicely preston emphasizing the usual feminine imperative for perfectly gratuitous statement as she pushed back her chair from the commandants breakfast table i must really say that i dont see anything particularly heroic in doing something wrong lying about it just to get other folks into trouble and then rushing off to do penance in a high wind and an open boat  but shes pretty and wears a mans shirt and coat and of course that settles anything  but why earrings and wet white stockings and slippers  and why that gothic arch of front and a boys hat  thats what i simply ask and the youngest daughter of colonel preston rose from the table shook out the skirt of her pretty morning dress and placing her little thumbs in the belt of her smart waist paused witheringly for a reply  you are most unfair my child returned colonel preston gravely her giving food and clothes to a deserter may have been only an ordinary instinct of humanity towards a fellowcreature who appeared to be suffering to say nothing of mcaffreys plausible tongue  but her periling her life to save him from an unjust accusation and her desire to shield her brothers pride from ridicule is altogether praiseworthy and extraordinary  and the moral influence of her kindness was strong enough to make that scamp refuse to tell the plain truth that might implicate her in an indiscretion though it saved him from state prison  he knew you wouldnt believe him if he had said the clothes were given to him retorted miss cicely so i dont see where the moral influence comes in  as to her periling her life those marsh people are amphibious anyway or would be in those clothes  and as to her motive why papa i heard you say in this very room and afterwards to mr calvert when you gave him instructions that you believed those culpeppers were capable of enticing away deserters and you forget the fuss you had with her savage brothers lawyer about that water front and how you said it was such people who kept up the irritation between the civil and federal power  the colonel coughed hurriedly  it is the fate of all great organizers military as well as civil to occasionally suffer defeat in the family circle  the more reason he said soothingly why we should correct harsh judgments that spring from mere rumors  you should give yourself at least the chance of overcoming your prejudices my child  remember too that she is now the guest of the fort  and she chooses to stay with mrs bromley  im sure its quite enough for you and mamma to do dutyand emily who wants to know why mr calvert raves so about herwithout my going over there to stare  colonel preston shook his head reproachfully but eventually retired leaving the field to the enemy  the enemy a little pink in the cheeks slightly tossed the delicate rings of its blonde crest settled its skirts again at the piano but after turning over the leaves of its music book rose and walked pettishly to the window  but here a spectacle presented itself that for a moment dismissed all other thoughts from the girls rebellious mind  not a dozen yards away on the windswept parade a handsome young fellow apparently halted by the sentry had impetuously turned upon him in an attitude of indignant and haughty surprise  to the quick fancy of the girl it seemed as if some disguised rustic god had been startled by the challenge of a mortal  under an oilskin hat like the petasus of hermes pushed back from his white forehead crisp black curls were knotted around a head whose beardless face was perfect as a cameo cutting  in the closefitting blue woolen jersey under his open jacket the clear outlines and youthful grace of his upper figure were revealed as clearly as in a statue  long fishingboots reaching to his thighs scarcely concealed the symmetry of his lower limbs  cricket and lawntennis knickerbockers and flannels had not at that period familiarized the female eye to unfettered masculine outline and cicely preston accustomed to the artificial smartness and regularity of uniform was perhaps the more impressed by the strangers lawless grace  the sentry had repeated his challenge an angry flush was deepening on the intruders cheek  at this critical moment cicely threw open the french windows and stepped upon the veranda  the sentry saluted the familiar little figure of his colonels daughter with an explanatory glance at the stranger  the young fellow looked upand the god became human  im looking for my sister he said half awkwardly half defiantly shes here somewhere  yesand perfectly safe mr culpepper i think said the archhypocrite with dazzling sweetness and were all so delighted and so brave and plucky and skillful in her to come all that wayand for such a purpose  thenyou knowall about itstammered jim more relieved than he had imaginedand that i  that you were quite ignorant of your sister helping the deserter oh yes of course said cicely with bewildering promptitude you see mr culpepper we girls are so foolish  i dare say i should have done the same thing in her place only i should never have had the courage to do what she did afterwards  you really must forgive her  but wont you come indo  she stepped back holding the window open with the halfcoaxing air of a spoiled child  this way is quickest  do come as he still hesitated glancing from her to the house she added with a demure little laugh oh i forgetthis is colonel prestons quarters and im his daughter  and this dainty little fairy so natural in manner so tasteful in attire was one of the artificial overdressed creatures that his sister had inveighed against so bitterly  was maggie really to be trusted  this new revelation coming so soon after the episode of the deserter staggered him  nevertheless he hesitated looking up with a certain boyish timidity into cicelys dangerous eyes  isismy sister there  im expecting her with my mother every moment responded this youthful but ingenious diplomatist sweetly she might be here now but she added with a sudden heartbroken flash of sympathy i know how anxious you both must be  ill take you to her now  only one moment please  the opportunity of leading this handsome savage as it were in chains across the parade before everybody her father her mother her sister and hiswas not to be lost she darted into the house and reappeared with the daintiest imaginable straw hat on the side of her head and demurely took her place at his side  its only over there at major bromleys she said pointing to one of the vineclad cottage quarters but you are a stranger here you know and might get lost  alas he was already that  for keeping step with those fairylike slippers brushing awkwardly against that fresh and pretty skirt and feeling the caress of the soft folds looking down upon the brim of that beribboned little hat and more often meeting the upturned blue eyes beneath it jim was suddenly struck with a terrible conviction of his own contrasting coarseness and deficiencies  how hideous those oiled canvas fishingtrousers and pilot jacket looked beside this perfectly fitted and delicately gowned girl  he loathed his collar his jersey his turnedback souwester even his height which seemed to hulk beside hereverything in short that the girl had recently admired  by the time that they had reached major bromleys door he had so far succumbed to the fair enchantress and realized her ambition of a triumphant procession that when she ushered him into the presence of half a dozen ladies and gentlemen he scarcely recognized his sister as the centre of attraction or knew that miss cicelys effusive greeting of maggie was her first one  i knew he was dying to see you after all you had both passed through and i brought him straight here said the diminutive machiavelli meeting the astonished gaze of her father and the curious eyes of her sister with perfect calmness while maggie full of gratitude and admiration of her handsome brother forgot his momentary obliviousness and returned her greeting warmly nevertheless there was a slight movement of reserve among the gentlemen at the unlookedfor irruption of this sunburnt adonis until calvert disengaging himself from maggies side came forward with his usual frank imperturbability and quiet tact and claimed jim as his friend and honored guest  it then came out with that unostentatious simplicity which characterized the brother and sister and was their secure claim to perfect equality with their entertainers that jim on discovering his sisters absence and fearing that she might be carried by the current towards the bar had actually swum the estuary to indian island and in an ordinary indian canoe had braved the same tempestuous passage she had taken a few hours before  cicely listening to this recital with rapt attention nevertheless managed to convey the impression of having fully expected it from the first  of course hed have come here if shed only waited she said sotto voce to her sister emily  hes certainly the handsomer of the two responded that young lady  of course returned cicely with a superior air dont you see she copies him  not that this private criticism prevented either from vying with the younger officers in their attentions to maggie with perhaps the addition of an open eulogy of her handsome brother more or less invidious in comparison to the officers  i suppose its an active outofdoor life gives him that perfect grace and freedom said emily with a slight sneer at the smartly belted calvert yes and he dont drink or keep late hours responded cicely significantly  his sister says they always retire before ten oclock and that although his father left him some valuable whiskey he seldom takes a drop of it therein gravely concluded captain kirby lies our salvation  if after such a confession calvert doesnt make the most of his acquaintance with young culpepper to remove that whiskey from his path and bring it here hes not the man i take him for  indeed for the moment it seemed as if he was not  during the next three or four days in which colonel preston had insisted upon detaining his guests calvert touched no liquor evaded the evening poker parties at quarters and even prevailed upon some of his brother officers to give them up for the more general entertainment of the ladies  colonel preston was politician enough to avail himself of the popularity of maggies adventure to invite some of the logport people to assist him in honoring their neighbor  not only was the old feud between the fort and the people thus bridged over but there was no doubt that the discipline of the fort had been strengthened by maggies extravagant reputation as a mediator among the disaffected rank and file  whatever characteristic license the grateful dennis mcaffreylet off with a nominal punishmentmay have taken in his praise of the quane of the marshes it is certain that the men worshiped her and that the band pathetically begged permission to serenade her the last night of her stay  at the end of that time with a dozen invitations a dozen appointments a dozen vows of eternal friendship much handshaking and accompanied by a number of the officers to their boat maggie and jim departed  they talked but little on their way home by some tacit understanding they did not discuss those projects only recalling certain scenes and incidents of their visit  by the time they had reached the little creek the silence and nervous apathy which usually follow excitement in the young seemed to have fallen upon them  it was not until after their quiet frugal supper that seated beside the fire jim looked up somewhat selfconsciously in his sisters grave and thoughtful face  say mag what was that idea o yours about selling some land and taking a house at logport  maggie looked up and said passively oh that idea  yes  why  well said jim somewhat awkwardly it could be done you know im willin  as she did not immediately reply he continued uneasily miss preston says we kin get a nice little house that is near the fort until we want to build  oh then you have talked about it  yesthat iswhy what are ye thinkin of mag  wasnt it your idea all along he said suddenly facing her with querulous embarrassment they had been sitting in their usual evening attitudes of assyrian frieze profile with even more than the usual assyrian frieze similarity of feature  yes but jim dear do you think it the best thing forfor us to do said maggie with halffrightened gravity  at this sudden and startling exhibition of female inconsistency and inconsequence jim was for a moment speechless  then he recovered himself volubly aggrievedly and on his legs  what did she mean was he to give up understanding girlsor was it their sole vocation in life to impede masculine processes and shipwreck masculine conclusions here after all she said the other night after they had nearly quolled over her set idees after shed gone over all that foolishness about jael and siseraand there wasnt any use for itafter shed let him run on to them officers all he was goin to donay after she herself for he had heard her had talked to calvert about it she wanted to know now if it was best  he looked at the floor and the ceiling as if expecting the tongued and grooved planks to cry out at this crowning enormity  the cause of it had resumed her sad gaze at the fire  presently without turning her head she reached up her long graceful arm and clasping her brothers neck brought his face down in profile with her own cheek against cheek until they looked like the double outlines of a medallion  then she saidto the fire  jim do you think shes pretty  who said jim albeit his color had already answered the question  you know who  do you like her  jim here vaguely murmured to the fire that he thought her kinder nice and that she dressed mighty purty  ye know mag he said with patronizing effusion you oughter get some gownds like hers  that wouldnt make me like her said maggie gravely  i dont know about that said jim politely but with an appalling hopelessness of tone  after a pause he added slyly pears to me somebody else thought somebody else mighty purtyeh  to his discomfiture she did not solicit further information  after a pause he continued still more archly  do you like him mag  i think hes a perfect gentleman she said calmly  he turned his eyes quickly from the glowing fire to her face  the cheek that had been resting against his own was as cool as the night wind that came through the open door and the whole face was as fixed and tranquil as the upper stars   v  for a year the tide had ebbed and flowed on the dedlow marsh unheeded before the sealed and sightless windows of the kingfishers nest since the young birds had flown to logport even the indian caretakers had abandoned the piled dwelling for their old nomadic haunts in the bresh  the high spring tide had again made its annual visit to the little cemetery of driftwood and as if recognizing another wreck in the deserted home had hung a few memorial offerings on the blackened piles softly laid a garland of grayish drift before it and then sobbed itself out in the salt grass  from time to time the faint echoes of the culpeppers life at logport reached the upland and the few neighbors who had only known them by hearsay shook their heads over the extravagance they as yet only knew by report  but it was in the dead ebb of the tide and the waning daylight that the feathered tenants of the marsh seemed to voice dismal prophecies of the ruin of their old master and mistress and to give themselves up to gloomiest lamentation and querulous foreboding whether the traditional bird of the air had entrusted his secret to a few ornithological friends or whether from a natural disposition to take gloomy views of life it was certain that at this hour the vocal expression of the marsh was hopeless and despairing  it was then that a dejected plover addressing a mocking crew of sandpipers on a floating log seemed to bewail the fortune that was being swallowed up by the riotous living and gambling debts of jim  it was then that the querulous crane rose and testily protested against the selling of his favorite haunt in the sandy peninsula which only six months of jims excesses had made imperative  it was then that a mournful curlew who with the preface that he had always been really expecting it reiterated the story that jim had been seen more than once staggering home with nervous hands and sodden features from a debauch with the younger officers it was the same desponding fowl who knew that maggies eyes had more than once filled with tears at jims failings and had already grown more hollow with many watchings  it was a flock of wrangling teal that screamingly discussed the small scandals jealous heartburnings and curious backbitings that had attended maggies advent into society  it was the highflying brent who knowing how the sensitive girl made keenly conscious at every turn of her defective training and ingenuous ignorance had often watched their evening flight with longing gaze now honked dismally at the recollection  it was at this hour and season that the usual vague lamentings of dedlow marsh seemed to find at last a preordained expression  and it was at such a time when light and water were both fading and the blackness of the marsh was once more reasserting itself that a small boat was creeping along one of the tortuous inlets at times half hiding behind the bank like a wounded bird  as it slowly penetrated inland it seemed to be impelled by its solitary occupant in a hesitating uncertain way as if to escape observation rather than as if directed to any positive bourn  stopping beside a bank of reeds at last the figure rose stoopingly and drew a gun from between its feet and the bottom of the boat  as the light fell upon its face it could be seen that it was james culpepper  james culpepper hardly recognizable in the swollen features bloodshot eyes and tremulous hands of that ruined figure  james culpepper only retaining a single trace of his former self in his look of set and passionate purpose  and that purpose was to kill himselfto be found dead as his father had been before himin an open boat adrift upon the marsh  it was not the outcome of a sudden fancy  the idea had first come to him in a taunting allusion from the drunken lips of one of his ruder companions for which he had stricken the offender to the earth  it had since haunted his waking hours of remorse and hopeless fatuity it had seemed to be the one relief and atonement he could make his devoted sister and more fatuous than all it seemed to the miserable boy the one revenge he would take upon the faithless coquette who for a year had played with his simplicity and had helped to drive him to the distraction of cards and drink only that morning colonel preston had forbidden him the house and now it seemed to him the end had come  he raised his distorted face above the reedy bank for a last tremulous and halffrightened glance at the landscape he was leaving forever  a glint in the western sky lit up the front of his deserted dwelling in the distance abreast of which the windings of the inlet had unwittingly led him  as he looked he started and involuntarily dropped into a crouching attitude  for to his superstitious terror the sealed windows of his old home were open the bright panes were glittering with the fading light and on the outer gallery the familiar figure of his sister stood as of old awaiting his return  was he really going mad or had this last vision of his former youth been purposely vouchsafed him  but even as he gazed the appearance of another figure in the landscape beyond the house proved the reality of his vision and as suddenly distracted him from all else  for it was the apparition of a man on horseback approaching the house from the upland and even at that distance he recognized its wellknown outlines  it was calvert calvert the traitor  calvert the man whom he had long suspected as being the secret lover and destined husband of cicely preston calvert who had deceived him with his calm equanimity and his affected preference for maggie to conceal his deliberate understanding with cicely  what was he doing here  was he a double traitor and now trying to deceive heras he had him and maggie here  this sudden returnthis preconcerted meeting it was infamy  for a moment he remained stupefied and then with a mechanical instinct plunged his head and face in the lazyflowing water and then once again rose cool and collected  the halfmad distraction of his previous resolve had given way to another more deliberate but not less desperate determination  he knew now why he came therewhy he had brought his gunwhy his boat had stopped when it did  lying flat in the bottom he tore away fragments of the crumbling bank to fill his frail craft until he had sunk it to the gunwale and below the low level of the marsh  then using his hands as noiseless paddles he propelled this rude imitation of a floating log slowly past the line of vision until the tongue of bushes had hidden him from view  with a rapid glance at the darkening flat he then seized his gun and springing to the spongy bank half crouching half crawling through reeds and tussocks he made his way to the brush  a foot and eye less experienced would have plunged its owner helpless in the black quagmire  at one edge of the thicket he heard hoofs trampling the dried twigs  calverts horse was already there tied to a skirting alder  he ran to the house but instead of attracting attention by ascending the creaking steps made his way to the piles below the rear gallery and climbed to it noiselessly  it was the spot where the deserter had ascended a year ago and like him he could see and hear all that passed distinctly  calvert stood near the open door as if departing maggie stood between him and the window her face in shadow her hands clasped tightly behind her  a profound sadness partly of the dying day and waning light and partly of some vague expiration of their own sorrow seemed to encompass them  without knowing why a strange trembling took the place of james culpeppers fierce determination and a film of moisture stole across his staring eyes  when i tell you that i believe all this will pass and that you will still win your brother back to you said calverts sad but clear voice i will tell you whyalthough perhaps it is only a part of that confidence you command me to withhold  when i first saw you i myself had fallen into like dissolute habits less excusable than he for i had some experience of the world and its follies  when i met you and fell under the influence of your pure simple and healthy life when i saw that isolation monotony misunderstanding even the sense of superiority to ones surroundings could be lived down and triumphed over without vulgar distractions or pitiful ambitions when i learned to love youhear me out miss culpepper i beg youyou saved mei who was nothing to you even as i honestly believe you will still save your brother whom you love  how do you know i didnt ruin him she said turning upon him bitterly  how do you know that it wasnt to get rid of our monotony our solitude that i drove him to this vulgar distraction this pitifulyes you were rightpitiful ambition  because it isnt your real nature he said quietly  my real nature she repeated with a half savage vehemence that seemed to be goaded from her by his very gentleness my real nature  what did hewhat do you know of itmy real natureill tell you what it was she went on passionately  it was to be revenged on you all for your cruelty your heartlessness your wickedness to me and mine in the past  it was to pay you off for your slanders of my dead fatherfor the selfishness that left me and jim alone with his dead body on the marsh  that was what sent me to logportto get even with youtoto fool and flaunt you there you have it now  and now that god has punished me for it by crushing my brotheryouyou expect me to let you crush me too  but he said eagerly advancing toward her you are wronging meyou are wronging yourself cruelly  stop she said stepping back with her hands still locked behind her  stay where you are  there  thats enough  she drew herself up and let her hands fall at her side  now let us speak of jim she said coldly  without seeming to hear her he regarded her for the first time with hopeless sadness  why did you let my brother believe you were his rival with cicely preston she asked impatiently  because i could not undeceive him without telling him i hopelessly loved his sister  you are proud miss culpepper he said with the first tinge of bitterness in his even voice  can you not understand that others may be proud too  no she said bluntly it is not pride but weakness  you could have told him what you knew to be true that there could be nothing in common between her folk and such savages as we that there was a gulf as wide as that marsh and as black between our natures our training and theirs and even if they came to us across it now and then to suit their pleasure light and easy as that tideit was still there to some day ground and swamp them  and if he doubted it you had only to tell him your own story  you had only to tell him what you have just told methat you yourself an officer and a gentleman thought you loved me a vulgar uneducated savage girl and that i kinder to you than you to me or him made you take it back across that tide because i couldnt let you link your life with me and drag you in the mire  you need not have said that miss culpepper returned calvert with the same gentle smile to prove that i am your inferior in all but one thing  and that she said quickly  is my love  his gentle face was as set now as her own as he moved back slowly towards the door  there he paused  you tell me to speak of jim and jim only  then hear me  i believe that miss preston cares for him as far as lies in her young and giddy nature  i could not therefore have crushed his hope without deceiving him for there are as cruel deceits prompted by what we call reason as by our love  if you think that a knowledge of this plain truth would help to save him i beg you to be kinder to him than you have been to meor even let me dare to hope to yourself  he slowly crossed the threshold still holding his cap lightly in his hand  when i tell you that i am going away tomorrow on a leave of absence and that in all probability we may not meet again you will not misunderstand why i add my prayer to the message your friends in logport charged me with  they beg that you will give up your idea of returning here and come back to them  believe me you have made yourself loved and respected there in spitei beg pardonperhaps i should say because of your pride  goodnight and goodbye  for a single instant she turned her set face to the window with a sudden convulsive movement as if she would have called him back but at the same moment the opposite door creaked and her brother slipped into the room  whether a quick memory of the deserters entrance at that door a year ago had crossed her mind whether there was some strange suggestion in his mudstained garments and weak deprecating smile or whether it was the outcome of some desperate struggle within her there was that in her face that changed his smile into a frightened cry for pardon as he ran and fell on his knees at her feet but even as he did so her stern look vanished and with her arm around him she bent over him and mingled her tears with his  i heard it all mag dearest  all  forgive me  i have been crazywildi will reformi will be better  i will never disgrace you again mag  never never  i swear it  she reached down and kissed him  after a pause a weak boyish smile struggled into his face  you heard what he said of her mag  do you think it might be true  she lifted the damp curls from his forehead with a sad halfmaternal smile but did not reply  and mag dear dont you think you were a littlejust a littlehard on him  no  dont look at me that way for gods sake there i didnt mean anything  of course you knew best  there maggie dear look up  hark there  listen mag do  they lifted their eyes to the dim distance seen through the open door borne on the fading light and seeming to fall and die with it over marsh and river came the last notes of the bugle from the fort  there  dont you remember what you used to say mag  the look that had frightened him had quite left her face now  yes she smiled laying her cold cheek beside his softly  oh yes it was something that came and went like a songlike a song     a knighterrant of the foothills  i  as father felipe slowly toiled up the dusty road towards the rancho of the blessed innocents he more than once stopped under the shadow of a sycamore to rest his somewhat lazy mule and to compose his own perplexed thoughts by a few snatches from his breviary for the good padre had some reason to be troubled  the invasion of gentile americans that followed the gold discovery of three years before had not confined itself to the plains of the sacramento but stragglers had already found their way to the santa cruz valley and the seclusion of even the mission itself was threatened  it was true that they had not brought their heathen engines to disembowel the earth in search of gold but it was rumored that they had already speculated upon the agricultural productiveness of the land and had espied the fatness thereof  as he reached the higher plateau he could see the afternoon seafogpresently to obliterate the fair prospectalready pulling through the gaps in the coast range and on a nearer slopeno less ominouslythe smoke of a recent but more permanently destructive yankee sawmill was slowly drifting towards the valley  get up beast said the father digging his heels into the comfortable flanks of his mule with some human impatience or art thou too a lazy renegade  thinkest thou besotted one that the heretic will spare thee more work than the holy church  the mule thus apostrophized in ear and flesh shook its head obstinately as if the question was by no means clear to its mind but nevertheless started into a little trot which presently brought it to the low adobe wall of the courtyard of the innocents and entered the gate  a few lounging peons in the shadow of an archway took off their broadbrimmed hats and made way for the padre and a half dozen equally listless vaqueros helped him to alight  accustomed as he was to the indolence and superfluity of his hosts retainers today it nevertheless seemed to strike some note of irritation in his breast  a stout middleaged woman of ungirt waist and beshawled head and shoulders appeared at the gateway as if awaiting him  after a formal salutation she drew him aside into an inner passage  he is away again your reverence she said  ahalways the same  yes your reverenceand this time to a meeting of the heretics at their pueblo at jonesvillewhere they will ask him of his land for a road  at a meeting echoed the priest uneasily  ah yes a meetingwhere tiburcio says they shout and spit on the ground your reverence and only one has a chair and him they call a chairman because of it and yet he sits not but shouts and spits even as the others and keeps up a tapping with a hammer like a very pico and there it is they are ever resolving that which is not and consider it even as done  then he is still the same said the priest gloomily as the woman paused for breath  only more so your reverence for he reads nought but the newspaper of the americanos that is brought in the ship the new york erraldand recites to himself the orations of their legislators  ah it was an evil day when the shipwrecked american sailor taught him his uncouth tongue which as your reverence knows is only fit for beasts and heathen incantation  pray heaven that were all he learned of him said the priest hastily for i have great fear that this sailor was little better than an atheist and an emissary from satan  but where are these newspapers and the fantasies of publicita that fill his mind  i would see them my daughter  you shall your reverence and more too she replied eagerly leading the way along the passage to a grated door which opened upon a small celllike apartment whose scant light and less air came through the deeply embayed windows in the outer wall  here is his estudio  in spite of this open invitation the padre entered with that air of furtive and minute inspection common to his order  his glance fell upon a rude surveyors plan of the adjacent embryo town of jonesville hanging on the wall which he contemplated with a cold disfavor that even included the highly colored vignette of the projected jonesville hotel in the lefthand corner  he then passed to a supervisors notice hanging near it which he examined with a suspicion heightened by that uneasiness common to mere worldly humanity when opposed to an unknown and unfamiliar language  but an exclamation broke from his lips when he confronted an election placard immediately below it  it was printed in spanish and english and father felipe had no difficulty in reading the announcement that don jose sepulvida would preside at a meeting of the board of education in jonesville as one of the trustees  this is madness said the padre  observing that dona maria was at the moment preoccupied in examining the pictorial pages of an illustrated american weekly which had hitherto escaped his eyes he took it gently from her hand  pardon your reverence she said with slightly acidulous deprecation but thanks to the blessed virgin and your reverences teaching the text is but gibberish to me and i did but glance at the pictures  much evil may come in with the eye said the priest sententiously as i will presently show thee  we have here he continued pointing to an illustration of certain college athletic sports a number of youthful cavaliers posturing and capering in a partly nude condition before a number of shameless women who emulate the saturnalia of heathen rome by waving their handkerchiefs  we have here a companion picture he said indicating an illustration of gymnastic exercises by the students of a female academy at commencement in which as thou seest even the aged of both sexes unblushingly assist as spectators with every expression of immodest satisfaction  have they no bullfights or other seemly recreation that they must indulge in such wantonness asked dona maria indignantly gazing however somewhat curiously at the baleful representations  of all that my daughter has their pampered civilization long since wearied returned the good padre for see this is what they consider a moral and even a religious ceremony  he turned to an illustration of a womans rights convention observe with what rapt attention the audience of that heathen temple watch the inspired ravings of that elderly priestess on the dais  it is even this kind of sacrilegious performance that i am told thy nephew don jose expounds and defends  may the blessed saints preserve us where will it lead to murmured the horrified dona maria  i will show thee said father felipe briskly turning the pages with the same lofty ignoring of the text until he came to a representation of a labor procession  there is one of their periodic revolutions unhappily not unknown even in mexico  thou perceivest those complacent artisans marching with implements of their craft accompanied by the military in the presence of their own stricken masters  here we see only another instance of the instability of all communities that are not founded on the principles of the holy church  and what is to be done with my nephew  the good fathers brow darkened with the gloomy religious zeal of two centuries ago  we must have a council of the family the alcalde and the archbishop at once he said ominously  to the mere heretical observer the conclusion might have seemed lame and impotent but it was as near the holy inquisition as the year of grace 1852 could offer  a few days after this colloquy the unsuspecting subject of it don jose sepulvida was sitting alone in the same apartment  the fading glow of the western sky through the deep embrasured windows lit up his rapt and meditative face  he was a young man of apparently twentyfive with a colorless satin complexion dark eyes alternating between melancholy and restless energy a narrow high forehead long straight hair and a lightly penciled moustache  he was said to resemble the wellknown portrait of the marquis of monterey in the mission church a face that was alleged to leave a deep and lasting impression upon the observers  it was undoubtedly owing to this quality during a brief visit of the famous viceroy to a remote and married ancestress of don jose at leon that the singular resemblance may be attributed  a heavy and hesitating step along the passage stopped before the grating  looking up don jose beheld to his astonishment the slightly inflamed face of roberto a vagabond american whom he had lately taken into his employment  roberto a polite translation of bob the bucker cleaned out at a montebank in santa cruz penniless and profligate had sold his mustang to don jose and recklessly thrown himself in with the bargain touched by the rascals extravagance the quality of the mare and observing that bobs habits had not yet affected his seat in the saddle but rather lent a demoniac vigor to his chase of wild cattle don jose had retained rider and horse in his service as vaquero  bucking bob observing that his employer was alone coolly opened the door without ceremony shut it softly behind him and then closed the wooden shutter of the grating  don jose surveyed him with mild surprise and dignified composure  the man appeared perfectly soberit was a peculiarity of his dissipated habits that when not actually raving with drink he was singularly shrewd and practical  look yer don kosay he began in a brusque but guarded voice you and me is pards  when ye picked me and the mare up and set us on our legs again in this yer ranch i allowed id tie to ye whenever you was in troubleand wanted me  and i reckon thats whats the matter now for from what i see and hear on every side although youre the boss of this consarn youre surrounded by a gang of spies and traitors  your comings and goings your ins and outs is dogged and followed and blown upon  the folks you trust is playing it on ye  it aint for me to say why or whereforewhats their rights and whats yournbut ive come to tell ye that if you dont get up and get outer this ranch them dd priests and your own flesh and bloodyour aunts and your uncles and your cousins will have you chucked outer your property and run into a lunatic asylum  medon jose sepulvidaa lunatico  you are yourself crazy of drink friend roberto  yes said roberto grimly but that kind aint illegal while your makin ducks and drakes of your property and going into merikin ideas and merikin speculations they reckon is  and speakin on the square it aint natral  don jose sprang to his feet and began to pace up and down his celllike study  ah i remember now he muttered i begin to comprehend father felipes homilies and discourses  my aunts too affectionate care  my cousins discreet consideration  the prompt attention of my servants  i see it all  and you he said suddenly facing roberto why come you to tell me this  well boss said the american dryly i reckoned to stand by you  ah said don jose visibly affected  good roberto come hither child you may kiss my hand  if its all the same to you don kosaythat kin slide  ah ifyes said don jose meditatively putting his hand to his forehead miserable that i ami remembered not you were americano pardon my friendembrace meconpanero y amigo  with characteristic gravity he reclined for a moment upon roberts astonished breast  then recovering himself with equal gravity he paused lifted his hand with gentle warning marched to a recess in the corner unhooked a rapier hanging from the wall and turned to his companion  we will defend ourselves friend roberto  it is the sword of the comandantemy ancestor  the blade is of toledo  an ordinary sixshooter of colts would lay over that said roberto grimlybut that aint your game just now don kosay  you must get up and get and at once  you must vamose the ranch afore they lay hold of you and have you up before the alcalde  once away from here they darent follow you where theres merikin law and when you kin fight em in the square  good said don jose with melancholy preciseness  you are wise friend roberto  we may fight them later as you sayon the square or in the open plaza  and you camarado you shall go with meyou and your mare  sincere as the american had been in his offer of service he was somewhat staggered at this imperative command  but only for a moment well he said lazily i dont care if i do  but said don jose with increased gravity you shall care friend roberto  we shall make an alliance an union  it is true my brother you drink of whiskey and at such times are even as a madman  it has been recounted to me that it was necessary to your existence that you are a lunatic three days of the week  who knows  i myself though i drink not of aguardiente am accused of fantasies for all time necessary it becomes therefore that we should go together  my fantasies and speculations cannot injure you my brother your whiskey shall not empoison me  we shall go together in the great world of your american ideas of which i am much inflamed  we shall together breathe as one the spirit of progress and liberty  we shall be even as neophytes making of ourselves apostles of truth  i absolve and renounce myself henceforth of my family  i shall take to myself the sister and the brother the aunt and the uncle as we proceed  i devote myself to humanity alone  i devote you my friend and the marethough happily she has not a christian soulto this glorious mission  the few level last rays of light lit up a faint enthusiasm in the face of don jose but without altering his imperturbable gravity the vaquero eyed him curiously and half doubtfully  we will go tomorrow resumed don jose with solemn decision for it is wednesday  it was a sunday that thou didst ride the mare up the steps of the fonda and demanded that thy liquor should be served to thee in a pail  i remember it for the landlord of the fonda claimed twenty pesos for damage and the kissing of his wife therefore by computation good roberto thou shouldst be sober until friday and we shall have two clear days to fly before thy madness again seizes thee  they kin say what they like don kosay but your head is level returned the unabashed american grasping don joses hand  all right then  hasta manana as your folks say  hasta manana repeated don jose gravely  at daybreak next morning while slumber still weighted the lazy eyelids of the blessed innocents don jose sepulvida and his trusty squire roberto otherwise known as bucking bob rode forth unnoticed from the corral   ii  three days had passed  at the close of the third don jose was seated in a cosy private apartment of the san mateo hotel where they had halted for an arranged interview with his lawyer before reaching san francisco  from his window he could see the surrounding parklike avenues of oaks and the level white high road now and then clouded with the dust of passing teams  but his eyes were persistently fixed upon a small copy of the american constitution before him  suddenly there was a quick rap on his door and before he could reply to it a man brusquely entered  don jose raised his head slowly and recognized the landlord  but the intruder apparently awed by the gentle grave and studious figure before him fell back for an instant in an attitude of surly apology  enter freely my good jenkinson said don jose with a quiet courtesy that had all the effect of irony  the apartment such as it is is at your disposition  it is even yours as is the house  well im darned if i know as it is said the landlord recovering himself roughly and thats jest whats the matter yers that man of yours smashing things right and left in the barroom and chuckin my waiters through the window  softly softly good jenkinson said don jose putting a mark in the pages of the volume before him  it is necessary first that i should correct your speech  he is not my man which i comprehend to mean a slave a hireling a thing obnoxious to the great american nation which i admire and to which he belongs  therefore good jenkinson say friend companion guide philosopher if you will  as to the rest it is of no doubt as you relate  i myself have heard the breakings of glass and small dishes as i sit here three times i have seen your waiters projected into the road with much violence and confusion  to myself i have then said even as i say to you good jenkinson patience patience the end is not far  in four hours continued don jose holding up four fingers he shall make a finish until then not  well im dd ejaculated jenkinson gasping for breath in his indignation  nay excellent jenkinson not damned but of a possibility damaged that i shall repay when he have make a finish  but darn it all broke in the landlord angrily  ah said don jose gravely you would be paid before  good for how much shall you value all you have in your bar  don joses imperturbability evidently shook the landlords faith in the soundness of his own position  he looked at his guest critically and audaciously  it cost me two hundred dollars to fit it up he said curtly  don jose rose and taking a buckskin purse from his saddlebag counted out four slugs1 and handed them to the stupefied jenkinson the next moment however his host recovered himself and casting the slugs back on the little table brought his fist down with an emphasis that made them dance  but look yersuppose i want this thing stoppedyou hear mestoppednow  that would be interfering with the liberty of the subject my good jenkinsonwhich god forbid said don jose calmly  moreover it is the custom of the americanosa habit of my friend robertoa necessity of his existenceand so recognized of his friends patience and courage senor jenkinson  stayah i comprehend you haveof a possibilitya wife  no im a widower said jenkinson sharply  then i congratulate you  my friend roberto would have kissed her it is also of his habit  truly you have escaped much  i embrace you jenkinson  he threw his arms gravely around jenkinson in whose astounded face at last an expression of dry humor faintly dawned  after a moments survey of don joses impenetrable gravity he coolly gathered up the gold coins and saying that he would assess the damages and return the difference he left the room as abruptly as he had entered it  but don jose was not destined to remain long in peaceful study of the american constitution  he had barely taken up the book again and renewed his serious contemplation of its excellences when there was another knock at his door  this time in obedience to his invitation to enter the new visitor approached with more deliberation and a certain formality  he was a young man of apparently the same age as don jose handsomely dressed and of a quiet selfpossession and gravity almost equal to his hosts  i believe i am addressing don jose sepulvida he said with a familiar yet courteous inclination of his handsome head  don jose who had risen in marked contrast to his reception of his former guest answered  you are truly making to him a great honor  well youre going it blind as far as im concerned certainly said the young man with a slight smile for you dont know me  pardon my friend said don jose gently in this book this great testament of your glorious nation i have read that you are all equal one not above one not below the other  i salute in you the nation it is enough  thank you returned the stranger with a face that saving the faintest twinkle in the corner of his dark eyes was as immovable as his hosts but for the purposes of my business i had better say i am jack hamlin a gambler and am just now dealing faro in the florida saloon round the corner  he paused carelessly as if to allow don jose the protest he did not make and then continued  the matter is this  one of your vaqueros who is however an american was round there an hour ago bucking against faro and put up and lost not only the mare he was riding but a horse which i have just learned is yours  now we reckon over there that we can make enough money playing a square game without being obliged to take property from a howling drunkard to say nothing of it not belonging to him and ive come here don jose to say that if youll send over and bring away your man and your horse you can have em both  if i have comprehended honest hamlin said don jose slowly this roberto who was my vaquero and is my brother has approached this faro game by himself unsolicited  he certainly didnt seem shy of it said mr hamlin with equal gravity  to the best of my knowledge he looked as if hed been there before  and if he had won excellent hamlin you would have given him the equal of his mare and horse  a hundred dollars for each yes certainly  then i see not why i should send for the property which is truly no longer mine nor for my brother who will amuse himself after the fashion of his country in the company of so honorable a caballero as yourself  stay oh imbecile that i am  i have not remembered you would possibly say that he has no longer of horses  play him play him admirable yet prudent hamlin  i have two thousand horses  of a surety he cannot exhaust them in four hours therefore play him trust to me for recompensa and have no fear  a quick flush covered the strangers cheek and his eyebrows momentarily contracted  he walked carelessly to the window however glanced out and then turned to don jose  may i ask then he said with almost sepulchral gravity is anybody taking care of you  truly returned don jose cautiously there is my brother and friend roberto  ah roberto certainly said mr hamlin profoundly  why do you ask considerate friend  oh i only thought with your kind of opinions you must often feel lonely in california  goodbye  he shook don joses hand heartily took up his hat inclined his head with graceful seriousness and passed out of the room  in the hall he met the landlord  well said jenkinson with a smile half anxious half insinuating you saw him  what do you think of him  mr hamlin paused and regarded jenkinson with a calmly contemplative air as if he were trying to remember first who he was and secondly why he should speak to him at all  think of whom he repeated carelessly  why himyou knowdon jose  i did not see anything the matter with him returned hamlin with frigid simplicity  what nothing queer  well noexcept that hes a guest in your house said hamlin with great cheerfulness  but then as you keep a hotel you cant help occasionally admitting agentleman  mr jenkinson smiled the uneasy smile of a man who knew that his interlocutors playfulness occasionally extended to the use of a derringer in which he was singularly prompt and proficient and mr hamlin equally conscious of that knowledge on the part of his companion descended the staircase composedly  but the day had darkened gradually into night and don jose was at last compelled to put aside his volume  the sound of a large bell rung violently along the hall and passages admonished him that the american dinner was ready and although the viands and the mode of cooking were not entirely to his fancy he had in his grave enthusiasm for the national habits attended the table dhote regularly with roberto  on reaching the lower hall he was informed that his henchman had early succumbed to the potency of his libations and had already been carried by two men to bed receiving this information with his usual stoical composure he entered the diningroom but was surprised to find that a separate table had been prepared for him by the landlord and that a rude attempt had been made to serve him with his own native dishes  senores y senoritas said don jose turning from it and with grave politeness addressing the assembled company if i seem today to partake alone and in a reserved fashion of certain viands that have been prepared for me it is truly from no lack of courtesy to your distinguished company but rather i protest to avoid the appearance of greater discourtesy to our excellent jenkinson who has taken some pains and trouble to comport his establishment to what he conceives to be my desires  wherefore my friends in gods name fall to the same as if i were not present and grace be with you  a few stared at the tall gentle melancholy figure with some astonishment a few whispered to their neighbors but when at the conclusion of his repast don jose arose and again saluted the company one or two stood up and smilingly returned the courtesy and polly jenkinson the landlords youngest daughter to the great delight of her companions blew him a kiss  after visiting the vaquero in his room and with his own hand applying some native ointment to the various contusions and scratches which recorded the late engagements of the unconscious roberto don jose placed a gold coin in the hands of the irish chambermaid and bidding her look after the sleeper he threw his serape over his shoulders and passed into the road  the loungers on the veranda gazed at him curiously yet half acknowledged his usual serious salutation and made way for him with a certain respect  avoiding the few narrow streets of the little town he pursued his way meditatively along the highroad returning to the hotel after an hours ramble as the evening stagecoach had deposited its passengers and departed  theres a lady waiting to see you upstairs said the landlord with a peculiar smile  she rather allowed it wasnt the proper thing to see you alone or she wasnt quite ekal to it i reckon for she got my polly to stand by her  your polly good jenkinson said don jose interrogatively  my darter don jose  ah truly  i am twice blessed said don jose gravely ascending the staircase  on entering the room he perceived a tall largefeatured woman with an extraordinary quantity of blond hair parted on one side of her broad forehead sitting upon the sofa  beside her sat polly jenkinson her fresh honest and rather pretty face beaming with delighted expectation and mischief  don jose saluted them with a formal courtesy which however had no trace of the fact that he really did not remember anything of them  i called said the largefeatured woman with a voice equally pronounced in reference to a request from you which though perhaps unconventional in the extreme i have been able to meet by the intervention of this young ladys company  my name on this card may not be familiar to youbut i am dorothy dewdrop  a slight movement of abstraction and surprise passed over don joses face but as quickly vanished as he advanced towards her and gracefully raised the tips of her fingers to his lips  have i then at last the privilege of beholding that most distressed and deeply injured of women  or is it but a dream  it certainly was not as far as concerned the substantial person of the woman before him who however seemed somewhat uneasy under his words as well as the demure scrutiny of miss jenkinson  i thought you might have forgotten she said with slight acerbity that you desired an interview with the authoress of  pardon interrupted don jose standing before her in an attitude of the deepest sympathizing dejection i had not forgotten  it is now three weeks since i have read in the journal golden gate the eloquent and touching poem of your sufferings and your aspirations and your miscomprehensions by those you love  i remember as yesterday that you have said that cruel fate have linked you to a soulless statethatbut i speak not well your own beautiful languageyou are in tears at evenfall because that you are not understood of others and that your soul recoiled from iron bonds until as in a dream you sought succor and release in some true knight of equal plight  i am told said the largefeatured woman with some satisfaction that the poem to which you allude has been generally admired  admired  senora said don jose with still darker sympathy it is not the word it is felt  i have felt it  when i read those words of distress i am touched of compassion  i have said this woman so disconsolate so oppressed must be relieved protected i have wrote to you at the golden gate to see me here  and i have come as you perceive said the poetess rising with a slight smile of constraint and emboldened by your appreciation i have brought a few trifles thrown off  pardon unhappy senora interrupted don jose lifting his hand deprecatingly without relaxing his melancholy precision but to a cavalier further evidence is not requiredand i have not yet make finish  i have not content myself to write to you  i have sent my trusty friend roberto to inquire at the golden gate of your condition  i have found there most unhappy and persecuted friendthat with truly angelic forbearance you have not told allthat you are married and that of a necessity it is your husband that is cold and soulless and unsympathizingand all that you describe  sir said the poetess rising in angry consternation  i have written to him continued don jose with unheeding gravity have appealed to him as a friend i have conjured him as a caballero i have threatened him even as a champion of the right i have said to him in effectthat this must not be as it is  i have informed him that i have made an appointment with you even at this house and i challenged him to meet you herein this roomeven at this instant and with gods help we should make good our charges against him  it is yet early i have allowed time for the lateness of the stage and the fact that he will come by another conveyance  therefore o dona dewdrop tremble not like thy namesake as it were on the leaf of apprehension and expectancy  i don jose am here to protect thee  i will take these chargesgently withdrawing the manuscripts from her astonished graspthough even as i related to thee before i want them not yet we will together confront him with them and make them good against him  are you mad demanded the lady in almost stentorious accents or is this an unmanly hoax  suddenly she stopped in undeniable consternation  good heavens she muttered if abner should believe this  he is such a fool  he has lately been queer and jealous  oh dear she said turning to polly jenkinson with the first indication of feminine weakness is he telling the truth is he crazy what shall i do  polly jenkinson who had witnessed the interview with the intensest enjoyment now rose equal to the occasion  you have made a mistake she said uplifting her demure blue eyes to don joses dark and melancholy gaze  this lady is a poetess the sufferings she depicts the sorrows she feels are in the imagination in her fancy only  ah said don jose gloomily then it is all false  no said polly quickly only they are not her own you know they are somebody elses  she only describes them for another dont you see  and who then is this unhappy one asked the don quickly  wellafriend stammered polly hesitatingly  a friend repeated don jose  ah i see of possibility a dear one even he continued gazing with tender melancholy into the untroubled cerulean depths of pollys eyes even but no child it could not be thou art too young  ah said polly with an extraordinary gulp and a fierce nudge of the poetess but it was me  you senorita repeated don jose falling back in an attitude of mingled admiration and pity  you the child of jenkinson  yes yes joined in the poetess hurriedly but that isnt going to stop the consequences of your wretched blunder  my husband will be furious and will be here at any moment  good gracious what is that  the violent slamming of a distant door at that instant the sounds of quick scuffling on the staircase and the uplifting of an irate voice had reached her ears and thrown her back in the arms of polly jenkinson  even the young girl herself turned an anxious gaze towards the door  don jose alone was unmoved  possess yourselves in peace senoritas he said calmly  we have here only the characteristic convalescence of my friend and brother the excellent roberto  he will ever recover himself from drink with violence even as he precipitates himself into it with fury  he has been prematurely awakened  i will discover the cause  with an elaborate bow to the frightened women he left the room scarcely had the door closed when the poetess turned quickly to polly the mans a stark staring lunatic but thank heaven abner will see it at once  and now lets get away while we can to think she said snatching up her scattered manuscripts that that was all the beast wanted  im sure hes very gentle and kind said polly recovering her dimples with a demure pout but stop hes coming back  it was indeed don jose reentering the room with the composure of a relieved and selfsatisfied mind  it is even as i said senora he began taking the poetesss handand more  you are saved  as the women only stared at each other he gravely folded his arms and continued i will explain  for the instant i have not remember that in imitation of your own delicacy i have given to your husband in my letter not the name of myself but as a mere don fulano the name of my brother robertobucking bob  your husband have this moment arrive  penetrating the bedroom of the excellent roberto he has indiscreetly seize him in his bed without explanation without introduction without fear  the excellent roberto ever ready for such distractions have respond in a word to use the language of the good jenkinsonour host our fatherwho was present he have wiped the floor with your husband and have even carried him down the staircase to the street  believe me he will not return  you are free  fool  idiot  crazy beast said the poetess dashing past him and out of the door  you shall pay for this  don jose did not change his imperturbable and melancholy calm and now little one he said dropping on one knee before the halffrightened polly child of jenkinson now that thy perhaps too excitable sponsor has in a poets caprice abandoned thee for some newer fantasy confide in me thy distress to me thy knight and tell the story of thy sorrows  but said polly rising to her feet and struggling between a laugh and a cry  i havent any sorrows  oh dear dont you see its only her fancy to make me seem so  theres nothing the matter with me  nothing the matter repeated don jose slowly  you have no distress you want no succor no relief no protector  this then is but another delusion he said rising sadly  yes nothat isoh my gracious goodness said polly hopelessly divided between a sense of the ridiculous and some strange attraction in the dark gentle eyes that were fixed upon her half reproachfully you dont understand  don jose replied only with a melancholy smile and then going to the door opened it with a bowed head and respectful courtesy  at the act polly plucked up courage again and with it a slight dash of her old audacity  im sure im very sorry that i aint got any love sorrows she said demurely  and i suppose its very dreadful in me not to have been raving and brokenhearted over somebody or other as that woman has said  only she waited till she had gained the secure vantage of the threshold i never knew a gentleman to object to it before  with this parthian arrow from her blue eyes she slipped into the passage and vanished through the door of the opposite parlor  for an instant don jose remained motionless and reflecting  then recovering himself with grave precision he deliberately picked up his narrow black gloves from the table drew them on took his hat in his hand and solemnly striding across the passage entered the door that had just closed behind her   1 hexagonal gold pieces valued at 50 each issued by a private firm as coin in the early days   iii  it must not be supposed that in the meantime the flight of don jose and his follower was unattended by any commotion at the rancho of the blessed innocents  at the end of three hours deliberation in which the retainers were severally examined the corral searched and the well in the courtyard sounded scouts were dispatched in different directions who returned with the surprising information that the fugitives were not in the vicinity  a trustworthy messenger was sent to monterey for customhouse paper on which to draw up a formal declaration of the affair  the archbishop was summoned from san luis and don victor and don vincente sepulvida with the donas carmen and inez alvarado and a former alcalde gathered at a family council the next day  in this serious conclave the good father felipe once more expounded the alienated condition and the dangerous reading of the absent man  in the midst of which the ordinary post brought a letter from don jose calmly inviting the family to dine with him and roberto at san mateo on the following wednesday  the document was passed gravely from hand to hand  was it a fresh evidence of mental aberrationan audacity of frenzyor a trick of the vaquero  the archbishop and alcalde shook their headsit was without doubt a lawless even a sacrilegious and blasphemous fete  but a certain curiosity of the ladies and of father felipe carried the day  without formally accepting the invitation it was decided that the family should examine the afflicted man with a view of taking active measures hereafter  on the day appointed the traveling carriage of the sepulvidas an equipage coeval with the beginning of the century drawn by two white mules gaudily caparisoned halted before the hotel at san mateo and disgorged father felipe the donas carmen and inez alvarado and maria sepulvida while don victor and don vincente sepulvida their attendant cavaliers on fiery mustangs like outriders drew rein at the same time  a slight thrill of excitement as of the advent of a possible circus had preceded them through the little town a faint blending of cigarette smoke and garlic announced their presence on the veranda  ushered into the parlor of the hotel apparently set apart for their reception they were embarrassed at not finding their host present but they were still more disconcerted when a tall fullbearded stranger with a shrewd amusedlooking face rose from a chair by the window and stepping forward saluted them in fluent spanish with a slight american accent  i have to ask you gentlemen and ladies he began with a certain insinuating ease and frankness that alternately aroused and lulled their suspicions to pardon the absence of our friend don jose sepulvida at this preliminary greeting  for to be perfectly frank with you although the ultimate aim and object of our gathering is a social one you are doubtless aware that certain infelicities and misunderstandingscommon to most familieshave occurred and a free dispassionate unprejudiced discussion and disposal of them at the beginning will only tend to augment the goodwill of our gathering  the senor without doubt issuggested the padre with a polite interrogative pause  pardon me  i forgot to introduce myself  colonel parkerentirely at your service and that of these charming ladies  the ladies referred to allowed their eyes to rest with evident prepossession on the insinuating stranger  ah a soldier said don vincente  formerly said the american lightly at present a lawyer the counsel of don jose  a sudden rigor of suspicion stiffened the company the ladies withdrew their eyes the priest and the sepulvidas exchanged glances  come said colonel parker with apparent unconsciousness of the effect of his disclosure let us begin frankly  you have i believe some anxiety in regard to the mental condition of don jose  we believe him to be mad said padre felipe promptly irresponsible possessed  that is your opinion good said the lawyer quietly  and ours too clamored the party without doubt  good returned the lawyer with perfect cheerfulness  as his relations you have no doubt had superior opportunities for observing his condition  i understand also that you may think it necessary to have him legally declared non compos a proceeding which you are aware might result in the incarceration of our distinguished friend in a madhouse  pardon senor interrupted dona maria proudly you do not comprehend the family  when a sepulvida is visited of god we do not ask the government to confine him like a criminal  we protect him in his own house from the consequences of his frenzy  from the machinations of the worldly and heretical broke in the priest and from the waste and dispersion of inherited possessions  very true continued colonel parker with unalterable goodhumor but i was only about to say that there might be conflicting evidence of his condition  for instance our friend has been here three days in that time he has had three interviews with three individuals under singular circumstances  colonel parker then briefly recounted the episodes of the landlord the gambler miss jenkinson and the poetess as they had been related to him  yet he continued all but one of these individuals are willing to swear that they not only believe don jose perfectly sane but endowed with a singularly sound judgment  in fact the testimony of mr hamlin and miss jenkinson is remarkably clear on that subject  the company exchanged a supercilious smile  do you not see o senor advocate said don vincente compassionately that this is but a conspiracy to avail themselves of our relatives weakness of a necessity they find him sane who benefits them  i have thought of that and am glad to hear you say so returned the lawyer still more cheerfully for your prompt opinion emboldens me to be at once perfectly frank with you  briefly then don jose has summoned me here to make a final disposition of his property  in the carrying out of certain theories of his which it is not my province to question he has resolved upon comparative poverty for himself as best fitted for his purpose and to employ his wealth solely for others  in fact of all his vast possessions he retains for himself only an income sufficient for the bare necessaries of life  and you have done this they asked in one voice  not yet said the lawyer  blessed san antonio we have come in time ejaculated dona carmen another day and it would have been too late it was an inspiration of the blessed innocents themselves said dona maria crossing herself can you longer doubt that this is the wildest madness said father felipe with flashing eyes  yet returned the lawyer caressing his heavy beard with a meditative smile the ingenious fellow actually instanced the vows of your own order reverend sir as an example in support of his theory  but to be brief  conceiving then that his holding of property was a mere accident of heritage not admitted by him unworthy his acceptance and a relic of superstitious ignorance  this is the very sacrilege of satanic prepossession broke in the priest indignantly  he therefore continued the lawyer composedly makes over and reverts the whole of his possessions with the exceptions i have stated to his family and the church  a breathless and stupefying silence fell upon the company  in the dead hush the sound of polly jenkinsons piano played in a distant room could be distinctly heard  with their vacant eyes staring at him the speaker continued  that deed of gift i have drawn up as he dictated it  i dont mind saying that in the opinion of some he might be declared non compos upon the evidence of that alone  i need not say how relieved i am to find that your opinion coincides with my own  but gasped father felipe hurriedly with a quick glance at the others it does not follow that it will be necessary to resort to these legal measures  care counsel persuasion  the general ministering of kinshipnursing a womans carethe instincts of affection piped dona maria in breathless eagerness  any light social distractiona harmless flirtationa possible attachment suggested dona carmen shyly  change of sceneactive exerciseexperienceseven as those you have related broke in don vincente  i for one have ever been opposed to legal measures said don victor a mere consultation of friendsin fact a fete like this is sufficient  good friends said father felipe who had by this time recovered himself taking out his snuffbox portentously it would seem truly from the document which this discreet caballero has spoken of that the errors of our dear don jose are rather of method than intent and that while we may freely accept the one  pardon interrupted colonel parker with bland persistence but i must point out to you that what we call in law a consideration is necessary to the legality of a conveyance even though that consideration be frivolous and calculated to impair the validity of the document  truly returned the good padre insinuatingly but if a discreet advocate were to suggest the substitution of some more pious and reasonable consideration  but that would be making it a perfectly sane and gratuitous document not only glaringly inconsistent with your charges my good friends with don joses attitude towards you and his flight from home but open to the gravest suspicion in law  in fact its apparent propriety in the face of these facts would imply improper influence  the countenances of the company fell  the lawyers face however became still more goodhumored and sympathizing  the case is simply this  if in the opinion of judge and jury don jose is declared insane the document is worthless except as a proof of that fact or a possible indication of the undue influence of his relations which might compel the court to select his guardians and trustees elsewhere than among them  friend abogado said father felipe with extraordinary deliberation the document thou hast just described so eloquently convinces me beyond all doubt that don jose is not only perfectly sane but endowed with a singular discretion  i consider it as a delicate and highspirited intimation to us his friends and kinsmen of his unalterable and logically just devotion to his family and religion whatever may seem to be his poetical and imaginative manner of declaring it  i think there is not one here continued the padre looking around him impressively who is not entirely satisfied of don joses reason and competency to arrange his own affairs  entirely truly perfectly eagerly responded the others with affecting spontaneity  nay more  to prevent any misconception we shall deem it our duty to take every opportunity of making our belief publicly known added father felipe  the padre and colonel parker gazed long and gravely into each others eyes  it may have been an innocent touch of the sunlight through the window but a faint gleam seemed to steal into the pupil of the affable lawyer at the same moment that probably from the like cause there was a slight nervous contraction of the left eyelid of the pious father but it passed and the next instant the door opened to admit don jose sepulvida  he was at once seized and effusively embraced by the entire company with every protest of affection and respect  not only mr hamlin and mr jenkinson who accompanied him as invited guests but roberto in a new suit of clothes and guiltless of stain or trace of dissipation shared in the pronounced friendliness of the kinsmen  padre felipe took snuff colonel parker blew his nose gently  nor were they less demonstrative of their new convictions later at the banquet  don jose with jenkinson and the padre on his right and left preserved his gentle and halfmelancholy dignity in the midst of the noisy fraternization  even padre felipe in a brief speech or exhortation proposing the health of their host lent himself in his own tongue to this polite congeniality  we have had also my friends and brothers he said in peroration a pleasing example of the compliment of imitation shown by our beloved don jose  no one who has known him during his friendly sojourn in this community but will be struck with the conviction that he has acquired that most marvelous faculty of your great american nation the exhibition of humor and of the practical joke  every eye was turned upon the imperturbable face of don jose as he slowly rose to reply  in bidding you to this fete my friends and kinsmen he began calmly it was with the intention of formally embracing the habits customs and spirit of american institutions by certain methods of renunciation of the past as became a caballero of honor and resolution  those methods may possibly be known to some of you  he paused for a moment as if to allow the members of his family to look unconscious  since then in the wisdom of god it has occurred to me that my purpose may be as honorably effected by a discreet blending of the past and the presentin a word by the judicious combination of the interests of my native people and the american nation  in consideration of that purpose friends and kinsmen i ask you to join me in drinking the good health of my host senor jenkinson my future fatherinlaw from whom i have today had the honor to demand the hand of the peerless polly his daughter as the future mistress of the rancho of the blessed innocents   the marriage took place shortly after  nor was the free will and independence of don jose sepulvida in the least opposed by his relations  whether they felt they had already committed themselves or had hopes in the future did not transpire  enough that the escapade of a week was tacitly forgotten  the only allusion ever made to the bridegrooms peculiarities was drawn from the demure lips of the bride herself on her installation at the blessed innocents  and what little one didst thou find in me to admire don jose had asked tenderly  oh you seemed to be so much like that dear old don quixote you know she answered demurely  don quixote repeated don jose with gentle gravity  but my child that was only a mere fictiona romance of one cervantes believe me of a truth there never was any such person     a secret of telegraph hill  i  as mr herbert bly glanced for the first time at the house which was to be his future abode in san francisco he was somewhat startled  in that early period of feverish civic improvement the street before it had been repeatedly graded and lowered until the dwellingoriginally a pioneer suburban villa perched upon a slope of telegraph hillnow stood sixty feet above the sidewalk superposed like some swiss chalet on successive galleries built in the sandhill and connected by a halfdozen distinct zigzag flights of wooden staircase  stimulated however by the thought that the view from the top would be a fine one and that existence there would have all the quaint originality of robinson crusoes treedwelling mr bly began cheerfully to mount the steps  it should be premised that although a recently appointed clerk in a large banking house mr bly was somewhat youthful and imaginative and regarded the ascent as part of that excelsior climbing pointed out by a great poet as a praiseworthy function of ambitious youth  reaching at last the level of the veranda he turned to the view the distant wooded shore of contra costa the tossing whitecaps and dancing sails of the bay between and the foreground at his feet of wharves and piers with their reedlike jungles of masts and cordage made up a bright if somewhat material picture  to his right rose the crest of the hill historic and memorable as the site of the old semaphoric telegraph the tossing of whose gaunt arms formerly thrilled the citizens with tidings from the sea turning to the house he recognized the prevailing style of light cottage architecture although incongruously confined to narrow building plots and the civic regularity of a precise street frontage  thus a dozen other villas formerly scattered over the slope had been laboriously displaced and moved to the rigorous parade line drawn by the street surveyor no matter how irregular and independent their design and structure happily the few scruboaks and low bushes which formed the scant vegetation of this vast sand dune offered no obstacle and suggested no incongruity beside the house before which mr bly now stood a prolific madeira vine quickened by the six months sunshine had alone survived the displacement of its foundations and in its untrimmed luxuriance half hid the upper veranda from his view  still glowing with his exertion the young man rang the bell and was admitted into a fairsized drawingroom whose tasteful and wellarranged furniture at once prepossessed him  an open piano a sheet of music carelessly left on the stool a novel lying face downwards on the table beside a skein of silk and the distant rustle of a vanished skirt through an inner door gave a suggestion of refined domesticity to the room that touched the fancy of the homeless and nomadic bly  he was still enjoying in half embarrassment that vague and indescribable atmosphere of a refined womans habitual presence when the door opened and the mistress of the house formally presented herself  she was a faded but still handsome woman  yet she wore that peculiar long limp formless houseshawl which in certain phases of anglosaxon spinster and widowhood assumes the functions of the recluses veil and announces the renunciation of worldly vanities and a resigned indifference to external feminine contour  the most audacious masculine arm would shrink from clasping that shapeless void in which the flatness of asceticism or the heavings of passion might alike lie buried  she had also in some mysterious way imported into the fresh and pleasant room a certain bombaziny shadow of the past and a suggestion of that appalling reminiscence known as better days though why it should be always represented by ashen memories or why better days in the past should be supposed to fix their fitting symbol in depression in the present mr bly was too young and too preoccupied at the moment to determine  he only knew that he was a little frightened of her and fixed his gaze with a hopeless fascination on a letter which she somewhat portentously carried under the shawl and which seemed already to have yellowed in its arctic shade  mr carstone has written to me that you would call said mrs brooks with languid formality  mr carstone was a valued friend of my late husband and i suppose has told you the circumstancesthe only circumstanceswhich admit of my entertaining his proposition of taking anybody even temporarily under my roof the absence of my dear son for six months at portland oregon enables me to place his room at the disposal of mr carstones young protege who mr carstone tells me and i have every reason to believe is if perhaps not so seriously inclined nor yet a church communicant still of a character and reputation not unworthy to follow my dear tappington in our little family circle as he has at his desk in the bank  the sensitive bly struggling painfully out of an abstraction as to how he was ever to offer the weekly rent of his lodgings to such a remote and respectable person and also somewhat embarrassed at being appealed to in the third person here started and bowed  the name of bly is not unfamiliar to me continued mrs brooks pointing to a chair and sinking resignedly into another where her baleful shawl at once assumed the appearance of a dustcover some of my dearest friends were intimate with the blys of philadelphia they were a branch of the maryland blys of the eastern shore of whom my uncle james married  perhaps you are distantly related  mrs brooks was perfectly aware that her visitor was of unknown western origin and a poor but clever protege of the rich banker but she was one of a certain class of american women who in the midst of a fierce democracy are more or less catlike conservators of family pride and lineage and more or less felinely inconsistent and treacherous to republican principles  bly who had just settled in his mind to send her the rent anonymouslyas a weekly valentinerecovered himself and his spirits in his usual boyish fashion  i am afraid mrs brooks he said gayly i cannot lay claim to any distinguished relationship even to that nelly bly who you remember winked her eye when she went to sleep  he stopped in consternation the terrible conviction flashed upon him that this quotation from a popular negrominstrel song could not possibly be remembered by a lady as refined as his hostess or even known to her superior son  the conviction was intensified by mrs brooks rising with a smileless face slightly shedding the possible vulgarity with a shake of her shawl and remarking that she would show him her sons room led the way upstairs to the apartment recently vacated by the perfect tappington  preceded by the same distant flutter of unseen skirts in the passage which he had first noticed on entering the drawingroom and which evidently did not proceed from his companion whose selfcomposed cerements would have repressed any such indecorous agitation mr bly stepped timidly into the room  it was a very pretty apartment suggesting the same touches of tasteful refinement in its furniture and appointments and withal so feminine in its neatness and regularity that conscious of his frontier habits and experience he felt at once repulsively incongruous  i cannot expect mr bly said mrs brooks resignedly that you can share my sons extreme sensitiveness to disorder and irregularity but i must beg you to avoid as much as possible disturbing the arrangement of the bookshelves which you observe comprise his books of serious reference the biblical commentaries and the sermons which were his habitual study  i must beg you to exercise the same care in reference to the valuable offerings from his sabbathschool scholars which are upon the mantel the embroidered bookmarker the gift of the young ladies of his bibleclass in dr stouts church is also you perceive kept for ornament and affectionate remembrance  the harmoniumeven if you are not yourself given to sacred songi trust you will not find in your way nor object to my daughter continuing her practice during your daily absence  thank you  the door you are looking at leads by a flight of steps to the side street  a very convenient arrangement said bly hopefully who saw a chance for an occasional unostentatious escape from a too protracted contemplation of tappingtons perfections  i mean he added hurriedly to avoid disturbing you at night  i believe my son had neither the necessity nor desire to use it for that purpose returned mrs brooks severely although he found it sometimes a convenient short cut to church on sabbath when he was late  bly who in his boyish sensitiveness to external impressions had by this time concluded that a life divided between the past perfections of tappington and the present renunciations of mrs brooks would be intolerable and was again abstractedly inventing some delicate excuse for withdrawing without committing himself further was here suddenly attracted by a repetition of the rustling of the unseen skirt  this time it was nearer and this time it seemed to strike even mrs brookss remote preoccupation my daughter who is deeply devoted to her brother she said slightly raising her voice will take upon herself the care of looking after tappingtons precious mementoes and spare you the trouble  cherry dear this way  this is the young gentleman spoken of by mr carstone your papas friend  my daughter cherubina mr bly  the fair owner of the rustling skirt which turned out to be a pretty french print had appeared at the doorway  she was a tall slim blonde with a shy startled manner as of a penitent nun who was suffering for some conventual transgressiona resemblance that was heightened by her shortcut hair that might have been cropped as if for punishment  a certain likeness to her mother suggested that she was qualifying for that saints ascetic shawlsubject however to rebellious intervals indicated in the occasional sidelong fires of her gray eyes  yet the vague impression that she knew more of the world than her mother and that she did not look at all as if her name was cherubina struck bly in the same momentary glance  mr bly is naturally pleased with what he has seen of our dear tappingtons appointments and as i gather from mr carstones letter that he is anxious to enter at once and make the most of the dear boys absence you will see my dear cherry that ellen has everything ready for him  before the unfortunate bly could explain or protest the young girl lifted her gray eyes to his  whether she had perceived and understood his perplexity he could not tell but the swift shy glance was at once appealing assuring and intelligent  she was certainly unlike her mother and brother  acting with his usual impulsiveness he forgot his previous resolution and before he left had engaged to begin his occupation of the room on the following day  the next afternoon found him installed  yet after he had unpacked his modest possessions and put them away after he had placed his few books on the shelves where they looked glaringly trivial and frivolous beside the late tenants severe studies after he had set out his scanty treasures in the way of photographs and some curious mementoes of his wandering life and then quickly put them back again with a sudden angry pride at exposing them to the unsympathetic incongruity of the other ornaments he nevertheless felt ill at ease  he glanced in vain around the pretty room  it was not the delicately flowered wallpaper it was not the white and blue muslin windowcurtains gracefully tied up with blue and white ribbons it was not the spotless bed with its blue and white festooned mosquitonet and flounced valances and its medallion portrait of an unknown bishop at the back it was not the few tastefully framed engravings of certain cardinal virtues the rock of ages and the guardian angel it was not the casts in relief of night and morning it was certainly not the cosy dimitycovered armchairs and sofa nor yet the cleanswept polished grate with its cheerful fire sparkling against the chill afternoon seafogs without neither was it the mere feminine suggestion for that touched a sympathetic chord in his impulsive nature nor the religious and ascetic influence for he had occupied a monastic cell in a school of the padres at an old mission and slept profoundlyit was none of those and yet a part of all  most habitations retain a cast or shell of their previous tenant that fitting tightly or loosely is still able to adjust itself to the newcomer in most occupied apartments there is still a shadowy suggestion of the owners individuality there was nothing here that fitted blynor was there either strange to say any evidence of the past proprietor in this inhospitality of sensation it did not strike him at the time that it was this very lack of individuality which made it weird and unreal that it was strange only because it was artificial and that a real tappington had never inhabited it  he walked to the windowthat neverfailing resource of the unquiet mindand looked out  he was a little surprised to find that owing to the grading of the house the scruboaks and bushes of the hill were nearly on the level of his window as also was the adjoining side street on which his second door actually gave opening this the sudden invasion of the seafog and the figure of a pedestrian casually passing along the disused and abandoned pavement not a dozen feet from where he had been comfortably seated presented such a striking contrast to the studious quiet and cosiness of his secluded apartment that he hurriedly closed the door again with a sense of indiscreet exposure  returning to the window he glanced to the left and found that he was overlooked by the side veranda of another villa in the rear evidently on its way to take position on the line of the street  although in actual and deliberate transit on rollers across the backyard and still occulting a part of the view it remained after the reckless fashion of the period inhabited  certainly with a door fronting a thoroughfare and a neighbor gradually approaching him he would not feel lonely or lack excitement  he drew his armchair to the fire and tried to realize the allpervading yet evasive tappington  there was no portrait of him in the house and although mrs brooks had said that he favored his sister bly had without knowing why instinctively resented it he had even timidly asked his employer and had received the vague reply that he was goodlooking enough and the practical but discomposing retort what do you want to know for  as he really did not know why the inquiry had dropped  he stared at the monumental crystal inkstand half full of ink yet spotless and free from stains that stood on the table and tried to picture tappington daintily dipping into it to thank the fair donorsdaughters of rebecca  who were they and what sort of man would they naturally feel grateful to  what was that  he turned to the window which had just resounded to a slight tap or blow as if something soft had struck it  with an instinctive suspicion of the propinquity of the adjoining street he rose but a single glance from the window satisfied him that no missile would have reached it from thence  he scanned the low bushes on the level before him certainly no one could be hiding there  he lifted his eyes toward the house on the left the curtains of the nearest window appeared to be drawn suddenly at the same moment could it have come from there looking down upon the windowledge there lay the mysterious missilea little misshapen ball  he opened the window and took it up  it was a small handkerchief tied into a soft knot and dampened with water to give it the necessary weight as a projectile  was it apparently the trick of a mischievous child or  but here a faint knock on the door leading into the hall checked his inquiry  he opened it sharply in his excitement and was embarrassed to find the daughter of his hostess standing there shy startled and evidently equally embarrassed by his abrupt response  mother only wanted me to ask you if ellen had put everything to rights she said making a step backwards  oh thank you  perfectly said herbert with effusion  nothing could be better done  in fact  youre quite sure she hasnt forgotten anything or that there isnt anything you would like changed she continued with her eyes leveled on the floor  nothing i assure you he said looking at her downcast lashes as she still remained motionless he continued cheerfully would youwould youcare to look round and see  no i thank you  there was an awkward pause  he still continued to hold the door open suddenly she moved forward with a schoolgirl stride entered the room and going to the harmonium sat down upon the musicstool beside it slightly bending forward with one long slim white hand on top of the other resting over her crossed knees  herbert was a little puzzled  it was the awkward and brusque act of a very young person and yet nothing now could be more gentle and selfcomposed than her figure and attitude  yes he continued smilingly i am only afraid that i may not be able to live quite up to the neatness and regularity of the example i find here everywhere  you know i am dreadfully careless and not at all orderly  i shudder to think what may happen but you and your mother miss brooks i trust will make up your minds to overlook and forgive a good deal  i shall do my best to be worthy of mr tapof my predecessorbut even then i am afraid youll find me a great bother  she raised her shy eyelids  the faintest ghost of a longburied dimple came into her pale cheek as she said softly to his utter consternation  rats  had she uttered an oath he could not have been more startled than he was by this choice gem of western saloonslang from the pure lips of this evangelinelike figure before him  he sat gazing at her with a wild hysteric desire to laugh  she lifted her eyes again swept him with a slightly terrified glance and said  tap says you all say that when any one makesbelieve politeness to you  oh your brother says that does he said herbert laughing  yes and sometimes old rats  but she continued hurriedly he doesnt say it he says you all do  my brother is very particular and very good  doctor stout loves him  he is thought very much of in all christian circles  that bookmark was given to him by one of his classes  every trace of her dimples had vanished  she looked so sweetly grave and withal so maidenly sitting there slightly smoothing the lengths of her pink fingers that herbert was somewhat embarrassed  but i assure you miss brooks i was not makingbelieve  i am really very careless and everything is so properi mean so neat and prettyhere that ihe stopped and observing the same backward wandering of her eye as of a filly about to shy quickly changed the subject  you have or are about to have neighbors he said glancing towards the windows as he recalled the incident of a moment before  yes and theyre not at all nice people  they are from pike county and very queer  they came across the plains in 50  they say stranger the men are vulgar and the girls very forward tap forbids my ever going to the window and looking at them theyre quite what you would call off color  herbert who did not dare to say that he never would have dreamed of using such an expression in any young girls presence was plunged in silent consternation  then your brother doesnt approve of them he said at last awkwardly  oh not at all  he even talked of having groundglass put in all these windows only it would make the light bad  herbert felt very embarrassed  if the mysterious missile came from these objectionable young persons it was evidently because they thought they had detected a more accessible and sympathizing individual in the stranger who now occupied the room  he concluded he had better not say anything about it  miss brookss golden eyelashes were bent towards the floor  do you play sacred music mr bly she said without raising them  i am afraid not  perhaps you know only negrominstrel songs  i am afraidyes  i know one  the dimples faintly came back again  its called the hamfat man  some day when mother isnt in ill play it for you  then the dimples fled again and she immediately looked so distressed that herbert came to her assistance  i suppose your brother taught you that too  oh dear no she returned with her frightened glance i only heard him say some people preferred that kind of thing to sacred music and one day i saw a copy of it in a musicstore window in clay street and bought it  oh no tappington didnt teach it to me  in the pleasant discovery that she was at times independent of her brothers perfections herbert smiled and sympathetically drew a step nearer to her  she rose at once somewhat primly holding back the sides of her skirt schoolgirl fashion with thumb and finger and her eyes cast down  good afternoon mr bly  must you go  good afternoon  she walked directly to the open door looking very tall and stately as she did so but without turning towards him  when she reached it she lifted her eyes there was the slightest suggestion of a return of her dimples in the relaxation of her grave little mouth then she said goodbye mr bly and departed  the skirt of her dress rustled for an instant in the passage herbert looked after her  i wonder if she skipped thenshe looks like a girl that might skip at such a time he said to himself how very odd she isand how simple  but i must pull her up in that slang when i know her better  fancy her brother telling her that  what a pair they must be  nevertheless when he turned back into the room again he forbore going to the window to indulge further curiosity in regard to his wicked neighbors  a certain new feeling of respect to his late companionand possibly to himselfheld him in check  much as he resented tappingtons perfections he resented quite as warmly the presumption that he was not quite as perfect which was implied in that mysterious overture  he glanced at the stool on which she had been sitting with a halfbrotherly smile and put it reverently on one side with a very vivid recollection of her shy maidenly figure  in some mysterious way too the room seemed to have lost its formal strangeness perhaps it was the touch of individualityhersthat had been wanting he began thoughtfully to dress himself for his regular dinner at the poodle dog restaurant and when he left the room he turned back to look once more at the stool where she had sat  even on his way to that fast and famous cafe of the period he felt for the first time in his thoughtless but lonely life the gentle security of the home he had left behind him   ii  it was three or four days before he became firmly adjusted to his new quarters  during this time he had met cherry casually on the staircase in going or coming and received her shy greetings but she had not repeated her visit nor again alluded to it  he had spent part of a formal evening in the parlor in company with a calling deacon who unappalled by the indian shawl for which the widow had exchanged her household cerements on such occasions appeared to herbert to have remote matrimonial designs as far at least as a sympathetic deprecation of the vanities of the present an echoing of her sighs like a modest encore a preternatural gentility of manner a vague allusion to the necessity of bearing one anothers burdens and an everlasting promise in store would seem to imply  to herberts vivid imagination a discussion on the doctrinal points of last sabbaths sermon was fraught with delicate suggestion and an acceptance by the widow of an appointment to attend the wednesday evening lectures had all the shy reluctant yielding of a granted rendezvous  oddly enough the more formal attitude seemed to be reserved for the young people who in the suggestive atmosphere of this spiritual flirtation alone appeared to preserve the proprieties and to some extent decorously chaperon their elders  herbert gravely turned the leaves of cherrys music while she played and sang one or two discreet but depressing songs expressive of her unalterable but proper devotion to her mothers clock her fathers armchair and her aunts bible and herbert joined somewhat boyishly in the soulsubduing refrain  only once he ventured to suggest in a whisper that he would like to add her musicstool to the adorable inventory but he was met by such a disturbed and terrified look that he desisted another night of this wild and reckless dissipation will finish me he said lugubriously to himself when he reached the solitude of his room  i wonder how many times a week id have to help the girl play the spiritual gooseberry downstairs before we could have any fun ourselves  here the sound of distant laughter interspersed with vivacious feminine shrieks came through the open window  he glanced between the curtains  his neighbors house was brilliantly lit and the shadows of a few romping figures were chasing each other across the muslin shades of the windows  the objectionable young women were evidently enjoying themselves  in some conditions of the mind there is a certain exasperation in the spectacle of unmeaning enjoyment and he shut the window sharply  at the same moment some one knocked at his door  it was miss brooks who had just come upstairs  will you please let me have my musicstool  he stared at her a moment in surprise then recovering himself said yes certainly and brought the stool  for an instant he was tempted to ask why she wanted it but his pride forbade him  thank you  goodnight  goodnight  i hope it wasnt in your way  not at all  goodnight  goodnight  she vanished  herbert was perplexed  between young ladies whose naive exuberance impelled them to throw handkerchiefs at his window and young ladies whose equally naive modesty demanded the withdrawal from his bedroom of a chair on which they had once sat his lot seemed to have fallen in a troubled locality  yet a day or two later he heard cherry practising on the harmonium as he was ascending the stairs on his return from business she had departed before he entered the room but had left the musicstool behind her  it was not again removed  one sunday the second or third of his tenancy when cherry and her mother were at church and he had finished some work that he had brought from the bank his former restlessness and sense of strangeness returned  the regular afternoon fog had thickened early and driving him back from a cheerless chilly ramble on the hill had left him still more depressed and solitary  in sheer desperation he moved some of the furniture and changed the disposition of several smaller ornaments  growing bolder he even attacked the sacred shelf devoted to tappingtons serious literature and moral studies  at first glance the book of sermons looked suspiciously fresh and new for a volume of habitual reference but its leaves were carefully cut and contained one or two bookmarks  it was only another evidence of that perfect youths care and neatness  as he was replacing it he noticed a small object folded in white paper at the back of the shelf  to put the book back into its former position it was necessary to take this out  he did so but its contents slid from his fingers and the paper to the floor  to his utter consternation looking down he saw a pack of playingcards strewn at his feet  he hurriedly picked them up  they were worn and slippery from use and exhaled a faint odor of tobacco  had they been left there by some temporary visitor unknown to tappington and his family or had they been hastily hidden by a servant  yet they were of a make and texture superior to those that a servant would possess looking at them carefully he recognized them to be of a quality used by the betterclass gamblers  restoring them carefully to their former position he was tempted to take out the other volumes and was rewarded with the further discovery of a small box of ivory counters known as pokerchips  it was really very extraordinary  it was quite the cache of some habitual gambler herbert smiled grimly at the irreverent incongruity of the hidingplace selected by its unknown and mysterious owner and amused himself by fancying the horror of his sainted predecessor had he made the discovery  he determined to replace them and to put some mark upon the volumes before them in order to detect any future disturbance of them in his absence  ought he not to take miss brooks in his confidence  or should he say nothing about it at present and trust to chance to discover the sacrilegious hider  could it possibly be cherry herself guilty of the same innocent curiosity that had impelled her to buy the hamfat man preposterous  besides the cards had been used and she could not play poker alone  he watched the rolling fog extinguish the line of russian hill the last bit of far perspective from his window  he glanced at his neighbors veranda already dripping with moisture the windows were blank he remembered to have heard the girls giggling in passing down the side street on their way to church and had noticed from behind his own curtains that one was rather pretty this led him to think of cherry again and to recall the quaint yet melancholy grace of her figure as she sat on the stool opposite why had she withdrawn it so abruptly did she consider his jesting allusion to it indecorous and presuming  had he really meant it seriously and was he beginning to think too much about her  would she ever come again  how nice it would be if she returned from church alone early and they could have a comfortable chat together here  would she sing the hamfat man for him  would the dimples come back if she did  should he ever know more of this quaint repressed side of her nature  after all what a dear graceful tantalizing lovable creature she was  ought he not at all hazards try to know her better  might it not be here that he would find a perfect realization of his boyish dreams and in her all thatwhat nonsense he was thinking  suddenly herbert was startled by the sound of a light but hurried foot upon the wooden outer step of his second door and the quick but ineffective turning of the doorhandle  he started to his feet his mind still filled with a vision of cherry  then he as suddenly remembered that he had locked the door on going out putting the key in his overcoat pocket  he had returned by the front door and his overcoat was now hanging in the lower hall  the door again rattled impetuously  then it was supplemented by a female voice in a hurried whisper open quick cant you do hurry  he was confounded  the voice was authoritative not unmusical but it was not cherrys  nevertheless he called out quickly one moment please and ill get the key dashed downstairs and up again breathlessly unlocked the door and threw it open  nobody was there  he ran out into the street  on one side it terminated abruptly on the cliff on which his dwelling was perched on the other it descended more gradually into the next thoroughfare but up and down the street on either hand no one was to be seen  a slightly superstitious feeling for an instant crept over him  then he reflected that the mysterious visitor could in the interval of his getting the key have easily slipped down the steps of the cliff or entered the shrubbery of one of the adjacent houses  but why had she not waited  and what did she want  as he reentered his door he mechanically raised his eyes to the windows of his neighbors this time he certainly was not mistaken the two amused mischievous faces that suddenly disappeared behind the curtain as he looked up showed that the incident had not been unwitnessed yet it was impossible that it could have been either of them their house was only accessible by a long detour  it might have been the trick of a confederate but the tone of half familiarity and half entreaty in the unseen visitors voice dispelled the idea of any collusion  he entered the room and closed the door angrily a grim smile stole over his face as he glanced around at the dainty saintlike appointments of the absent tappington and thought what that irreproachable young man would have said to the indecorous intrusion even though it had been a mistake  would those shameless pike county girls have dared to laugh at him  but he was again puzzled to know why he himself should have been selected for this singular experience  why was he considered fair game for these girls  and for the matter of that now that he reflected upon it why had even this gentle refined and melancholy cherry thought it necessary to talk slang to him on their first acquaintance and offer to sing him the hamfat man it was true he had been a little gay but never dissipated  of course he was not a saint like tappingtonoh that was it  he believed he understood it now  he was suffering from that extravagant conception of what worldliness consists of so common to very good people with no knowledge of the world compared to tappington he was in their eyes of course a rake and a roue  the explanation pleased him  he would not keep it to himself he would gain cherrys confidence and enlist her sympathies  her gentle nature would revolt at this injustice to their lonely lodger she would see that there were degrees of goodness besides her brothers  she would perhaps sit on that stool again and not sing the hamfat man  a day or two afterwards the opportunity seemed offered to him  as he was coming home and ascending the long hilly street his eye was taken by a tall graceful figure just preceding him  it was she he had never before seen her in the street and was now struck with her ladylike bearing and the grave superiority of her perfectly simple attire  in a thoroughfare haunted by handsome women and striking toilettes the refined grace of her mourning costume and a certain stateliness that gave her the look of a young widow was a contrast that evidently attracted others than himself  it was with an odd mingling of pride and jealousy that he watched the admiring yet respectful glances of the passersby some of whom turned to look again and one or two to retrace their steps and follow her at a decorous distance  this caused him to quicken his own pace with a new anxiety and a remorseful sense of wasted opportunity  what a booby he had been not to have made more of his contiguity to this charming girlto have been frightened at the naive decorum of her maidenly instincts  he reached her side and raised his hat with a trepidation at her newfound graceswith a boldness that was defiant of her other admirers  she blushed slightly  i thought youd overtake me before she said naively  i saw you ever so long ago  he stammered with an equal simplicity that he had not dared to  she looked a little frightened again and then said hurriedly i only thought that i would meet you on montgomery street and we would walk home together  i dont like to go out alone and mother cannot always go with me  tappington never cared to take me outi dont know why i think he didnt like the people staring and stop ping us  but they stare moredont you thinkwhen one is alone so i thought if you were coming straight home we might come togetherunless you have something else to do  herbert impulsively reiterated his joy at meeting her and averred that no other engagement either of business or pleasure could or would stand in his way  looking up however it was with some consternation that he saw they were already within a block of the house  suppose we take a turn around the hill and come back by the old street down the steps he suggested earnestly  the next moment he regretted it  the frightened look returned to her eyes her face became melancholy and formal again  no she said quickly  that would be taking a walk with you like these young girls and their young men on saturdays  thats what ellen does with the butchers boy on sundays  tappington often used to meet them  doing the come philanders as he says you call it  it struck herbert that the didactic tappingtons method of inculcating a horror of slang in his sisters breast was open to some objection but they were already on the steps of their house and he was too much mortified at the reception of his last unhappy suggestion to make the confidential disclosure he had intended even if there had still been time  theres mother waiting for me she said after an awkward pause pointing to the figure of mrs brooks dimly outlined on the veranda i suppose she was beginning to be worried about my being out alone shell be so glad i met you  it didnt appear to herbert however that mrs brooks exhibited any extravagant joy over the occurrence and she almost instantly retired with her daughter into the sittingroom linking her arm in cherrys and as it were empanoplying her with her own invulnerable shawl herbert went to his room more dissatisfied with himself than ever  two or three days elapsed without his seeing cherry even the wellknown rustle of her skirt in the passage was missing  on the third evening he resolved to bear the formal terrors of the drawingroom again and stumbled upon a decorous party consisting of mrs brooks the deacon and the pastors wifebut not cherry  it struck him on entering that the momentary awkwardness of the company and the formal beginning of a new topic indicated that he had been the subject of their previous conversation  in this idea he continued through that vague spirit of opposition which attacks impulsive people in such circumstances to generally disagree with them on all subjects and to exaggerate what he chose to believe they thought objectionable in him  he did not remain long but learned in that brief interval that cherry had gone to visit a friend in contra costa and would be absent a fortnight and he was conscious that the information was conveyed to him with a peculiar significance  the result of which was only to intensify his interest in the absent cherry and for a week to plunge him in a sea of conflicting doubts and resolutions  at one time he thought seriously of demanding an explanation from mrs brooks and of confiding to heras he had intended to do to cherryhis fears that his character had been misinterpreted and his reasons for believing so  but here he was met by the difficulty of formulating what he wished to have explained and some doubts as to whether his confidences were prudent  at another time he contemplated a serious imitation of tappingtons perfections a renunciation of the world and an entire change in his habits  he would go regularly to churchher church and take up tappingtons desolate bibleclass  but here the torturing doubt arose whether a young lady who betrayed a certain secular curiosity and who had evidently depended upon her brother for a knowledge of the world would entirely like it  at times he thought of giving up the room and abandoning for ever this doubly dangerous proximity but here again he was deterred by the difficulty of giving a satisfactory reason to his employer who had procured it as a favor  his passionfor such he began to fear it to beled him once to the extravagance of asking a days holiday from the bank which he vaguely spent in the streets of oakland in the hope of accidentally meeting the exiled cherry   iii  the fortnight slowly passed  she returned but he did not see her she was always out or engaged in her room with some female friend when herbert was at home  this was singular as she had never appeared to him as a young girl who was fond of visiting or had ever affected female friendships  in fact there was little doubt now that wittingly or unwittingly she was avoiding him  he was moodily sitting by the fire one evening having returned early from dinner  in reply to his habitual but affectedly careless inquiry ellen had told him that mrs brooks was confined to her room by a slight headache and that miss brooks was out  he was trying to read and listening to the wind that occasionally rattled the casement and caused the solitary gaslamp that was visible in the side street to flicker and leap wildly  suddenly he heard the same footfall upon his outer step and a light tap at the door  determined this time to solve the mystery he sprang to his feet and ran to the door but to his anger and astonishment it was locked and the key was gone  yet he was positive that he had not taken it out  the tap was timidly repeated  in desperation he called out please dont go away yet  the key is gone but ill find it in a moment nevertheless he was at his wits end  there was a hesitating pause and then the sound of a key cautiously thrust into the lock  it turned the door opened and a tall figure whose face and form were completely hidden in a veil and long gray shawl quickly glided into the room and closed the door behind it then it suddenly raised its arms the shawl was parted the veil fell aside and cherry stood before him  her face was quite pale  her eyes usually downcast frightened or coldly clear were bright and beautiful with excitement  the dimples were faintly there although the smile was sad and half hysterical she remained standing erect and tall her arms dropped at her side holding the veil and shawl that still depended from her shoulders  soive caught you she said with a strange little laugh  oh yes please dont go away yet  ill get the key in a moment she continued mimicking his recent utterance  he could only stammer miss brooksthen it was you  yes and you thought it was she didnt you  well and youre caught i didnt believe it i wouldnt believe it when they said it  i determined to find it out myself  and i have and its true  unable to determine whether she was serious or jesting and conscious only of his delight at seeing her again he advanced impulsively  but her expression instantly changed she became at once stiff and schoolgirlishly formal and stepped back towards the door  dont come near me or ill go she said quickly with her hand upon the lock  but not before you tell me what you mean he said half laughingly half earnestly  who is she and what wouldnt you have believed for upon my honor miss brooks i dont know what you are talking about  his evident frankness and truthful manner appeared to puzzle her you mean to say you were expecting no one she said sharply  i assure you i was not  andand no woman was ever hereat that door  he hesitated  not tonightnot for a long time not since you returned from oakland  then there was one  i believe so  you believeyou dont know  i believed it was a woman from her voice for the door was locked and the key was downstairs  when i fetched it and opened the door sheor whoever it waswas gone  and thats why you said so imploringly just now please dont go away yet  you see ive caught you  ah i dont wonder you blush  if he had his cheeks had caught fire from her brilliant eyes and the extravagantly affected sternnessas of a schoolgirl monitorin her animated face  certainly he had never seen such a transformation  yes but you see i wanted to know who the intruder was he said smiling at his own embarrassment  you didwell perhaps that will tell you  it was found under your door before i went away  she suddenly produced from her pocket a folded paper and handed it to him  it was a misspelt scrawl and ran as follows  why are you so cruel  why do you keep me dansing on the stepps before them gurls at the windows  was it that stuckup saint miss brooks that you were afraid of my deer  oh you faithless trater  wait till i ketch you  ill tear your eyes out and hern  it did not require great penetration for herbert to be instantly convinced that the writer of this vulgar epistle and the owner of the unknown voice were two very different individuals  the note was evidently a trick  a suspicion of its perpetrators flashed upon him  whoever the woman was it was not she who wrote the note he said positively  somebody must have seen her at the door  i remember now that those girlsyour neighborswere watching me from their window when i came out  depend upon it that letter comes from them  cherrys eyes opened widely with a sudden childlike perception and then shyly dropped  yes she said slowly they did watch you they know it for it was they who made it the talk of the neighborhood and thats how it came to mothers ears  she stopped and with a frightened look stepped back towards the door again  then that was why your mother  oh yes interrupted cherry quickly  that was why i went over to oakland and why mother forbade my walking with you again and why she had a talk with friends about your conduct and why she came near telling mr carstone all about it until i stopped her  she checked herselfhe could hardly believe his eyesthe pale nunlike girl was absolutely blushing  i thank you miss brooks he said gravely for your thoughtfulness although i hope i could have still proven my innocence to mr carstone even if some unknown woman tried my door by mistake and was seen doing it  but i am pained to think that you could have believed me capable of so wanton and absurd an improprietyand such a gross disrespect to your mothers house  but said cherry with childlike naivete you know you dont think anything of such things and thats what i told mother  you told your mother that  oh yesi told her tappington says its quite common with young men please dont laughfor its very dreadful  tappington didnt laugh when he told it to me as a warning  he was shocked  but my dear miss brooks  therenow youre angryand thats as bad  are you sure you didnt know that woman  positive  yet you seemed very anxious just now that she should wait till you opened the door  that was perfectly natural  i dont think it was natural at all  butaccording to tappington  because my brother is very good you need not make fun of him  i assure you i have no such intention  but what more can i say i give you my word that i dont know who that unlucky woman was no doubt she may have been some nearsighted neighbor who had mistaken the house and i dare say was as thoroughly astonished at my voice as i was at hers  can i say more  is it necessary for me to swear that since i have been here no woman has ever entered that doorbut  but who  yourself  i know what you mean she said hurriedly with her old frightened look gliding to the outer door  its shameful what ive done but i only did it becausebecause i had faith in you and didnt believe what they said was true  she had already turned the lock there were tears in her pretty eyes  stop said herbert gently  he walked slowly towards her and within reach of her frightened figure stopped with the timid respect of a mature and genuine passion  you must not be seen going out of that door he said gravely  you must let me go first and when i am gone lock the door again and go through the hall to your own room  no one must know that i was in the house when you came in at that door goodnight  without offering his hand he lifted his eyes to her face  the dimples were all thereand something else  he bowed and passed out  ten minutes later he ostentatiously returned to the house by the front door and proceeded up the stairs to his own room  as he cast a glance around he saw that the musicstool had been moved before the fire evidently with the view of attracting his attention  lying upon it carefully folded was the veil that she had worn  there could be no doubt that it was left there purposely  with a smile at this strange girls last characteristic act of timid but compromising recklessness after all his precautions he raised it tenderly to his lips and then hastened to hide it from the reach of vulgar eyes  but had cherry known that its temporary restingplace that night was under his pillow she might have doubted his superior caution  when he returned from the bank the next afternoon cherry rapped ostentatiously at his door  mother wishes me to ask you she began with a certain prim formality which nevertheless did not preclude dimples if you would give us the pleasure of your company at our church festival tonight  there will be a concert and a collation you could accompany us there if you cared  our friends and tappingtons would be so glad to see you and dr stout would be delighted to make your acquaintance  certainly said herbert delighted and yet astounded  then he added in a lower voice your mother no longer believes me so dreadfully culpable  oh no said cherry in a hurried whisper glancing up and down the passage ive been talking to her about it and she is satisfied that it is all a jealous trick and slander of these neighbors why i told her that they had even said that i was that mysterious woman that i came that way to you because she had forbidden my seeing you openly  what  you dared say that  yes dont you see  suppose they said they had seen me coming in last nightthat answers it she said triumphantly  oh it does he said vacantly  perfectly  so you see shes convinced that she ought to put you on the same footing as tappington before everybody and then there wont be any trouble  youll come wont you  it wont be so very good and then ive told mother that as there have been so many streetfights and so much talk about the vigilance committee lately i ought to have somebody for an escort when i am coming home  and if youre known you see as one of us therell be no harm in your meeting me  thank you he said extending his hand gratefully  her fingers rested a moment in his  where did you put it she said demurely  it  oh its all safe he said quickly but somewhat vaguely  but i dont call the upper drawer of your bureau safe she returned poutingly where everybody can go  so youll find it now inside the harmonium on the keyboard  oh thank you  its quite natural to have left it there accidentallyisnt it she said imploringly assisted by all her dimples  alas she had forgotten that he was still holding her hand  consequently she had not time to snatch it away and vanish with a stifled little cry before it had been pressed two or three times to his lips  a little ashamed of his own boldness herbert remained for a few moments in the doorway listening and looking uneasily down the dark passage  presently a slight sound came over the fanlight of cherrys room  could he believe his ears  the saintlike cherryno doubt tutored for examples sake by the perfect tappingtonwas softly whistling  in this simple fashion the first pages of this little idyl were quietly turned  the book might have been closed or laid aside even then  but it so chanced that cherry was an unconscious prophet and presently it actually became a prudential necessity for her to have a masculine escort when she walked out  for a growing state of lawlessness and crime culminated one day the deep tocsin of the vigilance committee and at its stroke fifty thousand peaceful men reverting to the first principles of social safety sprang to arms assembled at their quarters or patrolled the streets  in another hour the city of san francisco was in the hands of a mobthe most peaceful orderly well organized and temperate the world had ever known and yet in conception as lawless autocratic and imperious as the conditions it opposed   iv  herbert enrolled in the same section with his employer and one or two fellowclerks had participated in the meetings of the committee with the lightheartedness and irresponsibility of youth regretting only the loss of his usual walk with cherry and the hours that kept him from her house  he was returning from a protracted meeting one night when the number of arrests and searching for proscribed and suspected characters had been so large as to induce fears of organized resistance and rescue and on reaching the foot of the hill found it already so late that to avoid disturbing the family he resolved to enter his room directly by the door in the side street  on inserting his key in the lock it met with some resisting obstacle which however yielded and apparently dropped on the mat inside  opening the door and stepping into the perfectly dark apartment he trod upon this object which proved to be another key  the family must have procured it for their convenience during his absence and after locking the door had carelessly left it in the lock  it was lucky that it had yielded so readily  the fire had gone out  he closed the door and lit the gas and after taking off his overcoat moved to the door leading into the passage to listen if anybody was still stirring  to his utter astonishment he found it locked  what was more remarkablethe key was also inside an inexplicable feeling took possession of him he glanced suddenly around the room and then his eye fell upon the bed  lying there stretched at full length was the recumbent figure of a man  he was apparently in the profound sleep of utter exhaustion  the attitude of his limbs and the order of his dressof which only his collar and cravat had been loosenedshowed that sleep must have overtaken him almost instantly  in fact the bed was scarcely disturbed beyond the actual impress of his figure  he seemed to be a handsome matured man of about forty his dark straight hair was a little thinned over the temples although his long heavy moustache was still youthful and virgin  his clothes which were elegantly cut and of finer material than that in ordinary use the delicacy and neatness of his linen the whiteness of his hands and more particularly a certain dissipated pallor of complexion and lines of recklessness on the brow and cheek indicated to herbert that the man before him was one of that desperate and suspected classsome of whose proscribed members he had been huntingthe professional gambler  possibly the magnetism of herberts intent and astonished gaze affected him  he moved slightly half opened his eyes said halloo tap rubbed them again wholly opened them fixed them with a lazy stare on herbert and said  now who the devil are you  i think i have the right to ask that question considering that this is my room said herbert sharply  your room  yes  the stranger half raised himself on his elbow glanced round the room settled himself slowly back on the pillows with his hands clasped lightly behind his head dropped his eyelids smiled and said  rats  what demanded herbert with a resentful sense of sacrilege to cherrys virgin slang  well old rats then  dye think i dont know this shebang  look here johnny what are you putting on all this side for eh whats your little game  wheres tappington  if you mean mr brooks the son of this house who formerly lived in this room replied herbert with a formal precision intended to show a doubt of the strangers knowledge of tappington you ought to know that he has left town  left town echoed the stranger raising himself again  oh i see getting rather too warm for him here  humph i ought to have thought of that  well you know he did take mighty big risks anyway  he was silent a moment with his brows knit and a rather dangerous expression in his handsome face  so some dd hound gave him awayeh  i hadnt the pleasure of knowing mr brooks except by reputation as the respected son of the lady upon whose house you have just intruded said herbert frigidly yet with a creeping consciousness of some unpleasant revelation  the stranger stared at him for a moment again looked carefully round the room and then suddenly dropped his head back on the pillow and with his white hands over his eyes and mouth tried to restrain a spasm of silent laughter  after an effort he succeeded wiped his moist eyes and sat up  so you didnt know tappington eh he said lazily buttoning his collar  no  no more do i  he retied his cravat yawned rose shook himself perfectly neat again and going to herberts dressingtable quietly took up a brush and began to lightly brush himself occasionally turning to the window to glance out  presently he turned to herbert and said  well johnny whats your name  i am herbert bly of carstones bank  so and a member of this same vigilance committee i reckon he continued  yes  well mr bly i owe you an apology for coming here and some thanks for the only sleep ive had in fortyeight hours  i struck this old shebang at about ten oclock and its now two so i reckon ive put in about four hours square sleep  now look here  he beckoned herbert towards the window  do you see those three men standing under that gaslight  well theyre part of a gang of vigilantes whove hunted me to the hill and are waiting to see me come out of the bushes where they reckon im hiding  go to them and say that im here  tell them youve got gentleman georgegeorge dornton the man theyve been hunting for a weekin this room  i promise you i wont stir nor kick up a row when theyve come  do it and carstone if hes a square man will raise your salary for it and promote you  he yawned slightly and then slowly looking around him drew the easychair towards him and dropped comfortably in it gazing at the astounded and motionless herbert with a lazy smile  youre wondering what my little game is johnny aint you  well ill tell you  what with being hunted from pillar to post putting my old pards to no end of trouble and then slipping up on it whenever i think ive got a sure thing like thishe cast an almost affectionate glance at the bedive come to the conclusion that its played out and i might as well hand in my checks  its only a question of my being run out of frisco or hiding until i can slip out myself and ive reckoned i might as well give them the trouble and expense of transportation  and if i can put a good thing in your way in doing itwhy it will sort of make things square with you for the fuss ive given you  even in the stupefaction and helplessness of knowing that the man before him was the notorious duellist and gambler george dornton one of the first marked for deportation by the vigilance committee herbert recognized all he had heard of his invincible coolness courage and almost philosophic fatalism  for an instant his youthful imagination checked even his indignation  when he recovered himself he said with rising color and boyish vehemence  whoever you may be i am neither a police officer nor a spy  you have no right to insult me by supposing that i would profit by the mistake that made you my guest or that i would refuse you the sanctuary of the roof that covers your insult as well as your blunder  the stranger gazed at him with an amused expression and then rose and stretched out his hand  shake mr bly  youre the only man that ever kicked george dornton when he deserved it  goodnight  he took his hat and walked to the door  stop said herbert impulsively the night is already far gone go back and finish your sleep  you mean it  i do  the stranger turned walked back to the bed unfastening his coat and collar as he did so and laid himself down in the attitude of a moment before  i will call you in the morning continued herbert  by that timehe hesitatedby that time your pursuers may have given up their search  one word more  you will be frank with me  go on  tappington and you arefriends  wellyes  his mother and sister know nothing of this  i reckon he didnt boast of it  i didnt  is that all sleepily  yes  dont you worry about him  goodnight  goodnight  but even at that moment george dornton had dropped off in a quiet peaceful sleep  bly turned down the light and drawing his easychair to the window dropped into it in bewildering reflection  this then was the secretunknown to mother and daughterunsuspected by all this was the double life of tappington half revealed in his flirtation with the neighbors in the hidden cards behind the books in the mysterious visitorstill unaccounted forand now wholly exploded by this sleeping confederate for whom somehow herbert felt the greatest sympathy  what was to be done  what should he say to cherryto her motherto mr carstone  yet he had felt he had done right  from time to time he turned to the motionless recumbent shadow on the bed and listened to its slow and peaceful respiration  apart from that undefinable attraction which all original natures have for each other the thriceblessed mystery of protection of the helpless for the first time in his life seemed to dawn upon him through that night  nevertheless the actual dawn came slowly  twice he nodded and awoke quickly with a start  the third time it was day  the streetlamps were extinguished and with them the moving restless watchers seemed also to have vanished  suddenly a formal deliberate rapping at the door leading to the hall startled him to his feet  it must be ellen  so much the better he could quickly get rid of her he glanced at the bed dornton slept on undisturbed  he unlocked the door cautiously and instinctively fell back before the erect shawled and decorous figure of mrs brooks  but an utterly new resolution and excitement had supplanted the habitual resignation of her handsome features and given them an angry sparkle of expression  recollecting himself he instantly stepped forward into the passage drawing to the door behind him as she with equal celerity opposed it with her hand  mr bly she said deliberately ellen has just told me that your voice has been heard in conversation with some one in this room late last night  up to this moment i have foolishly allowed my daughter to persuade me that certain infamous scandals regarding your conduct here were false  i must ask you as a gentleman to let me pass now and satisfy myself  but my dear madam one moment  let me first explaini begstammered herbert with a halfhysterical laugh  i assure you a gentleman friend  but she had pushed him aside and entered precipitately  with a quick feminine glance round the room she turned to the bed and then halted in overwhelming confusion  its a friend said herbert in a hasty whisper  a friend of mine who returned with me late and whom on account of the disturbed state of the streets i induced to stay here all night he was so tired that i have not had the heart to disturb him yet  oh pray donti begsaid mrs brooks with a certain youthful vivacity but still gazing at the strangers handsome features as she slowly retreated  not for worlds  herbert was relieved she was actually blushing  you see it was quite unpremeditated i assure you  we came in together whispered herbert leading her to the door and i  dont believe a word of it madam said a lazy voice from the bed as the stranger leisurely raised himself upright putting the last finishing touch to his cravat as he shook himself neat again im an utter stranger to him and he knows it  he found me here biding from the vigilantes who were chasing me on the hill  i got in at that door which happened to be unlocked  he let me stay because he was a gentlemanandi wasnt  i beg your pardon madam for having interrupted him before you but it was a little rough to have him lie on my account when he wasnt the kind of man to lie on his own  youll forgive himwont you pleaseand as im taking myself off now perhaps youll overlook my intrusion too  it was impossible to convey the lazy frankness of this speech the charming smile with which it was accompanied or the easy yet deferential manner with which taking up his hat he bowed to mrs brooks as he advanced toward the door  but said mrs brooks hurriedly glancing from herbert to the stranger it must be the vigilantes who are now hanging about the street  ellen saw them from her window and thought they were your friends mr bly  this gentlemanyour friendshe had become a little confused in her novel excitementreally ought not to go out now  it would be madness  if you wouldnt mind his remaining a little longer it certainly would be safer said herbert with wondering gratitude  i certainly shouldnt consent to his leaving my house now said mrs brooks with dignity and if you wouldnt mind calling cherry here mr blyshes in the diningroomand then showing yourself for a moment in the street and finding out what they wanted it would be the best thing to do  herbert flew downstairs in a few hurried words he gave the same explanation to the astounded cherry that he had given to her mother with the mischievous addition that mrs brookss unjust suspicions had precipitated her into becoming an amicable accomplice and then ran out into the street  here he ascertained from one of the vigilantes whom he knew that they were really seeking dornton but that concluding that the fugitive had already escaped to the wharves they expected to withdraw their surveillance at noon  somewhat relieved he hastened back to find the stranger calmly seated on the sofa in the parlor with the same air of frank indifference lazily relating the incidents of his flight to the two women who were listening with every expression of sympathy and interest  poor fellow said cherry taking the astonished bly aside into the hall i dont believe hes half as bad as they said he isor as even he makes himself out to be  but did you notice mother  herbert a little dazed and it must be confessed a trifle uneasy at this ready acceptance of the stranger abstractedly said he had not  why its the most ridiculous thing  shes actually going round without her shawl and doesnt seem to know it   v  when herbert finally reached the bank that morning he was still in a state of doubt and perplexity  he had parted with his grateful visitor whose safety in a few hours seemed assured but without the least further revelation or actual allusion to anything antecedent to his selecting tappingtons room as refuge  more than that herbert was convinced from his manner that he had no intention of making a confidant of mrs brooks and this convinced him that dorntons previous relations with tappington were not only utterly inconsistent with that young mans decorous reputation but were unsuspected by the family  the strangers familiar knowledge of the room his mysterious allusions to the risks tappington had taken and his sudden silence on the discovery of blys ignorance of the whole affair all pointed to some secret that innocent or not was more or less perilous not only to the son but to the mother and sister  of the latters ignorance he had no doubtbut had he any right to enlighten them  admitting that tappington had deceived them with the others would they thank him for opening their eyes to it  if they had already a suspicion would they care to know that it was shared by him  halting between his frankness and his delicacy the final thought that in his budding relations with the daughter it might seem a cruel bid for her confidence or a revenge for their distrust of him inclined him to silence  but an unforeseen occurrence took the matter from his hands  at noon he was told that mr carstone wished to see him in his private room  satisfied that his complicity with dorntons escape was discovered the unfortunate herbert presented himself pale but selfpossessed before his employer  that brief man of business bade him be seated and standing himself before the fireplace looked down curiously but not unkindly upon his employee  mr bly the bank does not usually interfere with the private affairs of its employees but for certain reasons which i prefer to explain to you later i must ask you to give me a straightforward answer to one or two questions  i may say that they have nothing to do with your relations to the bank which are to us perfectly satisfactory  more than ever convinced that mr carstone was about to speak of his visitor herbert signified his willingness to reply  you have been seen a great deal with miss brooks latelyon the street and elsewhereacting as her escort and evidently on terms of intimacy  to do you both justice neither of you seemed to have made it a secret or avoided observation but i must ask you directly if it is with her mothers permission  considerably relieved but wondering what was coming herbert answered with boyish frankness that it was  are youengaged to the young lady  no sir  are youwell mr blybriefly are you what is called in love with her asked the banker with a certain brusque hurrying over of a sentiment evidently incompatible with their present business surroundings  herbert blushed  it was the first time he had heard the question voiced even by himself  i am he said resolutely  and you wish to marry her  if i dared ask her to accept a young man with no position as yet stammered herbert  people dont usually consider a young man in carstones bank of no position said the banker dryly and i wish for your sake that were the only impediment  for i am compelled to reveal to you a secret he paused and folding his arms looked fixedly down upon his clerk mr bly tappington brooks the brother of your sweetheart was a defaulter and embezzler from this bank  herbert sat dumfounded and motionless  understand two things continued mr carstone quickly  first that no purer or better women exist than miss brooks and her mother secondly that they know nothing of this and that only myself and one other man are in possession of the secret  he slightly changed his position and went on more deliberately six weeks ago tappington sat in that chair where you are sitting now a convicted hypocrite and thief  luckily for him although his guilt was plain and the whole secret of his double life revealed to me a sum of money advanced in pity by one of his gambling confederates had made his accounts good and saved him from suspicion in the eyes of his fellowclerks and my partners  at first he tried to fight me on that point then he blustered and said his mother could have refunded the money and asked me what was a paltry five thousand dollars  i told him mr bly that it might be five years of his youth in state prison that it might be five years of sorrow and shame for his mother and sister that it might be an everlasting stain on the name of his dead fathermy friend  he talked of killing himself i told him he was a cowardly fool  he asked me to give him up to the authorities i told him i intended to take the law in my own hands and give him another chance and then he broke down  i transferred him that very day without giving him time to communicate with anybody to our branch office at portland with a letter explaining his position to our agent and the injunction that for six months he should be under strict surveillance  i myself undertook to explain his sudden departure to mrs brooks and obliged him to write to her from time to time  he paused and then continued so far i believe my plan has been successful the secret has been kept he has broken with the evil associates that ruined him hereto the best of my knowledge he has had no communication with them since even a certain woman here who shared his vicious hidden life has abandoned him  are you sure asked herbert involuntarily as he recalled his mysterious visitor  i believe the vigilance committee has considered it a public duty to deport her and her confederates beyond the state returned carstone dryly  another idea flashed upon herbert  and the gambler who advanced the money to save tappington he said breathlessly  wasnt such a hound as the rest of his kind if report says true answered carstone  he was well known here as george dorntongentleman georgea man capable of better things  but he was before your time mr blyyou dont know him  herbert didnt deem it a felicitous moment to correct his employer and mr carstone continued i have now told you what i thought it was my duty to tell you  i must leave you to judge how far it affects your relations with miss brooks  herbert did not hesitate  i should be very sorry sir to seem to undervalue your consideration or disregard your warning but i am afraid that even if you had been less merciful to tappington and he were now a convicted felon i should change neither my feelings nor my intentions to his sister  and you would still marry her said carstone sternly you an employee of the bank would set the example of allying yourself with one who had robbed it  iam afraid i would sir said herbert slowly  even if it were a question of your remaining here said carstone grimly  poor herbert already saw himself dismissed and again taking up his weary quest for employment but nevertheless he answered stoutly  yes sir  and nothing will prevent you marrying miss brooks  nothingsave my inability to support her  then said mr carstone with a peculiar light in his eyes it only remains for the bank to mark its opinion of your conduct by increasing your salary to enable you to do so  shake hands mr bly he said laughing  i think youll do to tie toand i believe the young lady will be of the same opinion  but not a word to either her or her mother in regard to what you have heard  and now i may tell you something more  i am not without hope of tappingtons future nordn itwithout some excuse for his fault sir  he was artificially brought up  when my old friend died mrs brooks still a handsome woman like all her sex wouldnt rest until she had another devotion and wrapped herself and her children up in the church theology may be all right for grown people but its apt to make children artificial and tappington was pious before he was fairly good  he drew on a religious credit before he had a moral capital behind it  he was brought up with no knowledge of the world and when he went into itit captured him  i dont say there are not saints born into the world occasionally but for every one youll find a lot of promiscuous human nature  my old friend josh brooks had a heap of it and it wouldnt be strange if some was left in his children and burst through their straightlacing in a queer way  thats all goodmorning mr bly  forget what ive told you for six months and then i shouldnt wonder if tappington was on hand to give his sister away                                                     mr carstones prophecy was but half realized  at the end of six months herbert blys discretion and devotion were duly rewarded by cherrys hand  but tappington did not give her away  that saintly prodigal passed his period of probation with exemplary rectitude but either from a dread of old temptation or some unexplained reason he preferred to remain in portland and his fastidious nest on telegraph hill knew him no more  the key of the little door on the side street passed naturally into the keeping of mrs bly  whether the secret of tappingtons double life was ever revealed to the two women is not known to the chronicler  mrs bly is reported to have said that the climate of oregon was more suited to her brothers delicate constitution than the damp fogs of san francisco and that his tastes were always opposed to the mere frivolity of metropolitan society  the only possible reason for supposing that the mother may have become cognizant of her sons youthful errors was in the occasional visits to the house of the handsome george dornton who in the social revolution that followed the brief reign of the vigilance committee characteristically returned as a dashing stockbroker and the fact that mrs brooks seemed to have discarded her ascetic shawl forever  but as all this was contemporaneous with the absurd rumor that owing to the loneliness induced by the marriage of her daughter she contemplated a similar change in her own condition it is deemed unworthy the serious consideration of this veracious chronicle     captain jims friend  i  hardly one of us i think really believed in the auriferous probabilities of eureka gulch  following a little stream we had one day drifted into it very much as we imagined the river gold might have done in remoter ages with the difference that we remained there while the river gold to all appearances had not at first it was tacitly agreed to ignore this fact and we made the most of the charming locality with its rare watercourse that lost itself in tangled depths of manzanita and alder its laurelchoked pass its flowerstrewn hillside and its summit crested with rocking pines  you see said the optimistic rowley waters the main thing after all  if we happen to strike river gold thars the stream for washing it if we happen to drop into quartzand that thar rock looks mighty likelythar aint a more naturalborn site for a mill than that right bank with water enough to run fifty stamps  that hillside is an original dump for your tailings and a ready found inclined road for your trucks fresh from the hands of providence and that road were kalkilatin to build to the turnpike will run just easy along that ridge  later when we were forced to accept the fact that finding gold was really the primary object of a goldmining company we still remained there excusing our youthful laziness and incertitude by brilliant and effective sarcasms upon the unremunerative attractions of the gulch nevertheless when captain jim returning one day from the nearest settlement and postoffice twenty miles away burst upon us with well the hull thingll be settled now boys lacy bassett is coming down yer to look round we felt considerably relieved  and yet perhaps we had as little reason for it as we had for remaining there  there was no warrant for any belief in the special divining power of the unknown lacy bassett except captain jims extravagant faith in his general superiority and even that had always been a source of amused skepticism to the camp  we were already impatiently familiar with the opinions of this unseen oracle he was always impending in captain jims speech as a fragrant memory or an unquestioned authority  when captain jim began ez lacy was one day tellin me or ez lacy bassett allows or more formally when strangers were present ez a partickler friend o mine lacy bassettmaybe ez you know himsez the youthful and lighter members of the eureka mining company glanced at each other in furtive enjoyment  nevertheless no one looked more eagerly forward to the arrival of this apocryphal sage than these indolent skeptics  it was at least an excitement they were equally ready to accept his condemnation of the locality or his justification of their original selection  he came  he was received by the eureka mining company lying on their backs on the grassy site of the prospective quartz mill not far from the equally hypothetical slide to the gulch  he came by the future stage roadat present a thickset jungle of scruboaks and ferns  he was accompanied by captain jim who had gone to meet him on the trail and for a few moments all critical inspection of himself was withheld by the extraordinary effect he seemed to have upon the faculties of his introducer  anything like the absolute prepossession of captain jim by this stranger we had never imagined  he approached us running a little ahead of his guest and now and then returning assuringly to his side with the expression of a devoted newfoundland dog which in fluffiness he generally resembled  and now even after the introduction was over when he made a point of standing aside in an affectation of carelessness with his hands in his pockets the simulation was so apparent and his consciousness and absorption in his friend so obvious that it was a relief to us to recall him into the conversation  as to our own first impressions of the stranger they were probably correct  we all disliked him we thought him conceited selfopinionated selfish and untrustworthy  but later reflecting that this was possibly the result of captain jims overpraise and finding none of these qualities as yet offensively opposed to our own selfishness and conceit we were induced like many others to forget our first impressions  we could easily correct him if he attempted to impose upon us as he evidently had upon captain jim believing after the fashion of most humanity that there was something about us particularly aweinspiring and edifying to vice or weakness of any kind we goodhumoredly yielded to the cheap fascination of this showy selfsaturated overdressed and underbred stranger  even the epithet of blower as applied to him by rowley had its mitigations in that trajan community a bully was not necessarily a coward nor florid demonstration always a weakness  his condemnation of the gulch was sweeping original and striking he laughed to scorn our halfhearted theory of a gold deposit in the bed and bars of our favorite stream  we were not to look for auriferous alluvium in the bed of any present existing stream but in the cement or driedup bed of the original prehistoric rivers that formerly ran parallel with the present bed and whichhe demonstrated with the stem of pickneys pipe in the red dustcould be found by sinking shafts at right angles with the stream  the theory was to us at that time novel and attractive  it was true that the scientific explanation although full and gratuitous sounded vague and incoherent  it was true that the geological terms were not always correct and their pronunciation defective but we accepted such extraordinary discoveries as ignus fatuus rock splendiferous drift mica twist recalling a popular species of tobacco iron pirates and discomposed quartz as part of what he not inaptly called a tautological formation and were happy  nor was our contentment marred by the fact that the wellknown scientific authority with whom the stranger had been intimateto the point of sleeping together during a surveyand whom he described as a bent old man with spectacles must have aged considerably since one of our party saw him three years before as a keen young fellow of twentyfive  inaccuracies like those were only the carelessness of genius  thats my opinion gentlemen he concluded negligently rising and with pointed preoccupation whipping the dust of eureka gulch from his clothes with his handkerchief but of course it aint nothin to me  captain jim who had followed every word with deep and trustful absorption here repeated it aint nothing to him boys with a confidential implication of the gratuitous blessing we had received and then added with loyal encouragement to him it aint nothing to you lacy in course and laid his hand on his shoulder with infinite tenderness  we however endeavored to make it something to mr lacy bassett he was spontaneously offered a share in the company and a part of captain jims tent  he accepted both after a few deprecating and muttered asides to captain jim which the latter afterwards explained to us was the giving up of several other important enterprises for our sake when he finally strolled away with rowley to look over the gulch captain jim reluctantly tore himself away from him only for the pleasure of reiterating his praise to us as if in strictest confidence and as an entirely novel proceeding  you see boys i didnt like to say it afore him we bein old friends but between us that young feller ez worth thousands to the camp  mebbee he continued with grave naivete i aint said much about him afore mebbee bein old friends and accustomed to himyou know how it is boysi havent appreciated him as much ez i ought and ez you do  in fact i dont ezakly remember how i kem to ask him down yer  it came to me suddent one day only a week ago friday night thar under that buckeye i was thinkin o one of his sayins and sez ithars lacy if he was here hed set the hull thing right  it was the ghost of a chance my findin him free but i did  and there he is and yer we are settled  ye noticed how he just knocked the bottom outer our plans to work  ye noticed that quick sort o sneerin smile o his didnt yethats lacy  ive seen him knock over a heap o things without sayin anythinwith jist that smile  it occurred to us that we might have some difficulty in utilizing this smile in our present affairs and that we should have probably preferred something more assuring but captain jims faith was contagious  what is he anyway asked joe walker lazily  eh echoed captain jim in astonishment  what is lacy bassett  yes what is he repeated walker  wot ishe  yes  ive knowed him now goin as four year said captain jim with slow reflective contentment  lets see  it was in the fall o 54 i first met him and hes allus been the same ez you see him now  but what is his business or profession  what does he do  captain jim looked reproachfully at his questioner  do he repeated turning to the rest of us as if disdaining a direct reply  dowhy wot hes doin now  hes allus the same allus lacy bassett  howbeit we went to work the next day under the superintendence of the stranger with youthful and enthusiastic energy and began the sinking of a shaft at once  to do captain jims friend justice for the first few weeks he did not shirk a fair share of the actual labor replacing his objectionable and unsuitable finery with a suit of serviceable working clothes got together by general contribution of the camp and assuring us of a fact we afterwards had cause to remember that he brought nothing but himself into eureka gulch  it may be added that he certainly had not brought money there as captain jim advanced the small amounts necessary for his purchases in the distant settlement and for the still smaller sums he lost at cards which he played with characteristic selfsufficiency  meantime the work in the shaft progressed slowly but regularly even when the novelty had worn off and the excitement of anticipation grew fainter i am afraid that we clung to this new form of occupation as an apology for remaining there for the fascinations of our vagabond and unconventional life were more potent than we dreamed of  we were slowly fettered by our very freedom there was a strange spell in this very boundlessness of our license that kept us from even the desire of change in the wild and lawless arms of nature herself we found an embrace as clinging as hopeless and restraining as the civilization from which we had fled  we were quite content after a few hours work in the shaft to lie on our backs on the hillside staring at the unwinking sky or to wander with a gun through the virgin forest in search of game scarcely less vagabond than ourselves  we indulged in the most extravagant and dreamy speculations of the fortune we should eventually discover in the shaft and believed that we were practical we broke our saleratus bread with appetites unimpaired by restlessness or anxiety we went to sleep under the grave and sedate stars with a serene consciousness of having fairly earned our rest we awoke the next morning with unabated trustfulness and a sweet obliviousness of even the hypothetical fortunes we had perhaps won or lost at cards overnight  we paid no heed to the fact that our little capital was slowly sinking with the shaft and that the rainy seasonwherein not only no man could work but even such play as ours was impossiblewas momentarily impending  in the midst of this one day lacy bassett suddenly emerged from the shaft before his shift of labor was over with every sign of disgust and rage in his face and inarticulate with apparent passion  in vain we gathered round him in concern in vain captain jim regarded him with almost feminine sympathy as he flung away his pick and dashed his hat to the ground  whats up lacy old pard  whats gone o you said captain jim tenderly  look gasped lacy at last when every eye was on him holding up a small fragment of rock before us and the next moment grinding it under his heel in rage  look  to think that ive been fooled agin by this blanked fossiliferous trapblank it  to think that after me and professor parker was once caught jist in this way up on the stanislaus at the bottom of a hundredfoot shaft by this rotten trapthat yer i ambluffed agin  there was a dead silence we looked at each other blankly  but bassett said walker picking up a part of the fragment weve been finding this kind of stuff for the last two weeks  but how returned lacy turning upon him almost fiercely  did ye find it superposed on quartz or did you find it not superposed on quartz  did you find it in volcanic drift or did ye find it in old redsandstone or coarse illuvion  tell me that and then ye kin talk but this yer blank fossiliferous trap instead o being superposed on top is superposed on the bottom  and that means  what we all asked eagerly  whyblank it allthat this yer convulsion of nature this prehistoric volcanic earthquake instead of acting laterally and chuckin the stream to one side has been revolutionary and turned the old riverbed bottomside up and yer dd cement hez got half the globe atop of it  ye might strike it from china but nowhere else  we continued to look at one another the older members with darkening faces the younger with a strong inclination to laugh captain jim who had been concerned only in his friends emotion and who was hanging with undisguised satisfaction on these final convincing proofs of his superior geological knowledge murmured approvingly and confidingly hes right boys  thar aint another man livin ez could give you the law and gospil like that  ye can tie to what he says  thats lacy all over  two weeks passed  we had gathered damp and disconsolate in the only available shelter of the camp  for the long summer had ended unexpectedly to us we had one day found ourselves caught like the improvident insect of the childs fable with gauzy and unseasonable wings wet and bedraggled in the first rains homeless and hopeless the scientific lacy who lately spent most of his time as a barroom oracle in the settlement was away and from our dripping canvas we could see captain jim returning from a visit to him slowly plodding along the trail towards us  its no use boys said rowley summarizing the result of our conference we must speak out to him and if nobody else cares to do it i will  i dont know why we should be more mealymouthed than they are at the settlement  they dont hesitate to call bassett a deadbeat whatever captain jim says to the contrary  the unfortunate captain jim had halted irresolutely before the gloomy faces in the shelter  whether he felt instinctively some forewarning of what was coming i cannot say  there was a certain doglike consciousness in his eye and a halfbackward glance over his shoulder as if he were not quite certain that lacy was not following  the rain had somewhat subdued his characteristic fluffiness and he cowered with a kind of sleek stormbeaten despondency over the smoking fire of green wood before our tent  nevertheless rowley opened upon him with a directness and decision that astonished us  he pointed out briefly that lacy bassett had been known to us only through captain jims introduction  that he had been originally invited there on captain jims own account and that his later connection with the company had been wholly the result of captain jims statements  that far from being any aid or assistance to them bassett had beguiled them by apocryphal knowledge and sham scientific theories into an expensive and gigantic piece of folly  that in addition to this they had just discovered that he had also been using the credit of the company for his own individual expenses at the settlement while they were working on his dd fool shaftall of which had brought them to the verge of bankruptcy  that as a result they were forced now to demand his resignationnot only on their general account but for captain jims sakebelieving firmly as they did that he had been as grossly deceived in his friendship for lacy bassett as they were in their business relations with him  instead of being mollified by this captain jim to our greater astonishment suddenly turned upon the speaker bristling with his old canine suggestion  there  i said so  go on  id have sworn to it afore you opened your lips  i knowed it the day you sneaked around and wanted to know wot his business was  i said to myself cap look out for that sneakin hound rowley hes no friend o lacys  and the day lacy so far demeaned himself as to give ye that splendid explanation o things i watched ye ye didnt think it but i watched ye  ye cant fool me  i saw ye lookin at walker there and i said to myself wots the use lacy wots the use o your slingin them words to such as them  wot do they know  its just their pure jealousy and ignorance  ef youd come down yer and lazed around with us and fallen into our common ways youd ha been ez good a man ez the next  but no it aint your style lacy youre accustomed to hightoned men like professor parker and you cant help showing it  no wonder you took to avoidin us no wonder ive had to foller you over the burnt wood crossin time and again to get to see ye  i see it all now ye cant stand the kempany i brought ye to  ye had to wipe the slum gullion of eureka gulch off your hands lacy  he stopped gasped for breath and then lifted his voice more savagely and now whats this  wots this hogwash this yer lyin slander about his gettin things on the kempanys credit eh speak up some of ye  we were so utterly shocked and stupefied at the degradation of this sudden and unexpected outburst from a man usually so honorable gentle selfsacrificing and forgiving that we forgot the cause of it and could only stare at each other  what was this cheap stranger with his shallow swindling tricks to the ignoble change he had worked upon the man before us  rowley and walker both fearless fighters and quick to resent an insult only averted their saddened faces and turned aside without a word  ye dussent say it  well hark to me then he continued with white and feverish lips  i put him up to helpin himself  i told him to use the kempanys name for credit  ye kin put that down to me  and when ye talk of his resigning i want ye to understand that i resign outer this rotten kempany and take him with me  ef all the gold yer lookin for was piled up in that shaft from its bottom in hell to its top in the gulch it aint enough to keep me here away from him  ye kin take all my shareall my rights yer above ground and below itall i carryhe threw his buckskin purse and revolver on the groundand pay yourselves what you reckon youve lost through him but you and me is quits from today  he strode away before a restraining voice or hand could reach him his dripping figure seemed to melt into the rain beneath the thickening shadows of the pines and the next moment he was gone from that day forward eureka gulch knew him no more  and the camp itself somehow melted away during the rainy season even as he had done   ii  three years had passed  the pioneer stagecoach was sweeping down the long descent to the pastoral valley of gilead and i was looking towards the village with some pardonable interest and anxiety  for i carried in my pocket my letters of promotion from the box seat of the coachwhere i had performed the functions of treasure messenger for the excelsior express companyto the resident agency of that company in the bucolic hamlet before me the few dusty rightangled streets with their rigid and staringly new shops and dwellings the stern formality of one or two obelisklike meetinghouse spires the illimitable outlying plains of wheat and wild oats beyond with their monotony scarcely broken by skeleton stockades corrals and barracklooking farm buildings were all certainly unlike the unkempt freedom of the mountain fastnesses in which i had lately lived and moved  yuba bill the driver whose usual expression of humorous discontent deepened into scorn as he gathered up his reins as if to charge the village and recklessly sweep it from his path indicated a huge rambling obtrusively glazed and capitallettered building with a contemptuous flick of his whip as we passed  ef youre kalkilatin well get our partin drink there youre mistaken thats wot they call a temperance housewot means a place where the licker ye get underhand is only a trifle worse than the hash ye get aboveboard  i suppose its part o one o the mysteries o providence that wharever you find a dusty hole like thisthats naturally thirstyye run agin a temperance house  but never you mind  i shouldnt wonder if thar was a demijohn o whiskey in the closet of your back office kept thar by the feller youre relievinwho was a white man and knew the ropes  a few minutes later when my brief installation was over we did find the demijohn in the place indicated  as yuba bill wiped his mouth with the back of his heavy buckskin glove he turned to me not unkindly  i dont like to set ye agin gilead which is a scriptoorural place and a godfearin place and a nice dry place and a place ez ive heard tell whar they grow beans and pertatoes and garden sass but afore three weeks is over old pard youll be howlin to get back on that box seat with me whar you uster sit and be ready to take your chances agin like a little man to get drilled through with buckshot from road agents  you hear me  ill give you three weeks sonny just three weeks to get your butes full o hayseed and straws in yer har and ill find ye wadin the north fork at high water to get out o this  he shook my hand with grim tenderness removing his glovea rare favorto give me the pressure of his large soft protecting palm and strode away  the next moment he was shaking the white dust of gilead from his scornful chariotwheels  in the hope of familiarizing myself with the local interests of the community i took up a copy of the gilead guardian which lay on my desk forgetting for the moment the usual custom of the country press to displace local news for long editorials on foreign subjects and national politics  i found to my disappointment that the guardian exhibited more than the usual dearth of domestic intelligence although it was singularly oracular on the state of europe and jeffersonian democracy  a certain cheap assurance a copybook dogmatism a colloquial familiarity even in the impersonal plural and a series of inaccuracies and blunders here and there struck some old chord in my memory  i was mutely wondering where and when i had become personally familiar with rhetoric like that when the door of the office opened and a man entered  i was surprised to recognize captain jim  i had not seen him since he had indignantly left us three years before in eureka gulch  the circumstances of his defection were certainly not conducive to any voluntary renewal of friendship on either side and although even as a former member of the eureka mining company i was not conscious of retaining any sense of injury yet the whole occurrence flashed back upon me with awkward distinctness  to my relief however he greeted me with his old cordiality to my amusement he added to it a suggestion of the large forgiveness of conscious rectitude and amiable toleration  i thought however i detected as he glanced at the paper which was still in my hand and then back again at my face the same uneasy canine resemblance i remembered of old  he had changed but little in appearance perhaps he was a trifle stouter more mature and slower in his movements  if i may return to my canine illustration his grayer dustier and more wiry ensemble gave me the impression that certain pastoral and agricultural conditions had varied his type and he looked more like a shepherds dog in whose brown eyes there was an abiding consciousness of the care of straying sheep and possibly of one black one in particular  he had he told me abandoned mining and taken up farming on a rather large scale  he had prospered  he had other interests at stake a flourmill with some improvementsandandhere his eyes wandered to the guardian again and he asked me somewhat abruptly what i thought of the paper  something impelled me to restrain my previous fuller criticism and i contented myself by saying briefly that i thought it rather ambitious for the locality thats the word he said with a look of gratified relief ambitiousyouve just hit it  and whats the matter with thet ye kant expect a hightoned man to write down to the level of every karpin hound ken ye now  thats what he says to me  he stopped half confused and then added abruptly thats one o my investments  why captain jim i never suspected that you  oh i dont write it he interrupted hastily  i only furnish the money and the advertising and run it ginrally you know and im responsible for it  and i select the eddyterandhe continued with a return of the same uneasy wistful lookthars suthin in thet you know eh  i was beginning to be perplexed  the memory evoked by the style of the editorial writing and the presence of captain jim was assuming a suspicious relationship to each other  and whos your editor i asked  oh hesheserlacy bassett he replied blinking his eyes with a hopeless assumption of carelessness  lets see  oh yes you knowed lacy down there at eureka  i disremembered it till now yes sir he repeated suddenly and almost rudely as if to preclude any adverse criticism hes the eddyter  to my surprise he was quite white and tremulous with nervousness i was very sorry for him and as i really cared very little for the halfforgotten escapade of his friend except so far as it seemed to render him sensitive i shook his hand again heartily and began to talk of our old life in the gulchavoiding as far as possible any allusion to lacy bassett  his face brightened his old simple cordiality and trustfulness returned but unfortunately with it his old disposition to refer to bassett  yes they waz high old times and ez i waz sayin to lacy ony yesterday there is a kind o freedom bout that sort o life that runs civilization and noospapers mighty hard however hightoned they is  not but what lacy aint right he added quickly when he sez that the opposition the guardian gets here comes from ignorant lowdown fellers ez wos brought up in playedout camps and cant tell a gentleman and a scholar and a scientific man when they sees him no  so i sez to lacy never you mind its high time they did and theyve got to do it and to swaller the guardian if i sink double the money ive already put into the paper  i was not long in discovering from other sources that the guardian was not popular with the more intelligent readers of gilead and that captain jims extravagant estimate of his friend was by no means indorsed by the community  but criticism took a humorous turn even in that practical settlement and it appeared that lacy bassetts vanity assumption and ignorance were an unfailing and weekly joy to the critical in spite of the vague distrust they induced in the more homelywitted and the dull acquiescence of that minority who accepted the paper for its respectable exterior and advertisements  i was somewhat grieved however to find that captain jim shared equally with his friend in this general verdict of incompetency and that some of the most outrageous blunders were put down to him  but i was not prepared to believe that lacy had directly or by innuendo helped the public to this opinion  whether through accident or design on his part lacy bassett did not personally obtrude himself upon my remembrance until a month later one dazzling afternoon when the dust and heat had driven the pride of gileads manhood into the surreptitious shadows of the temperance hotels back room and had even cleared the express office of its loungers and left me alone with darkened windows in the private office the outer door opened and captain jims friend entered as part of that garish glitter i had shut out  to do the scamp strict justice however he was somewhat subdued in his dress and manner and possibly through some gentle chastening of epigram and revolver since i had seen him last was less aggressive and exaggerated  i had the impression from certain odors wafted through the apartment and a peculiar physical exaltation that was inconsistent with his evident moral hesitancy that he had prepared himself for the interview by a previous visit to the hidden fountains of the temperance hotel  we dont seem to have run agin each other since youve been here he said with an assurance that was nevertheless a trifle forced but i reckon were both busy men and theres a heap too much loafing goin on in gilead  captain jim told me he met you the day you arrived said you just cottoned to the guardian at once and thought it a deal too good for gilead eh  oh well jest ez likely he didnt say itit was only his gassin  hes a queer manis captain jim  i replied somewhat sharply that i considered him a very honest man a very simple man and a very loyal man  thats all very well said bassett twirling his cane with a patronizing smile but as his friend dont you find him considerable of a darned fool  i could not help retorting that i thought he had found that hardly an objection  you think so he said querulously apparently ignoring everything but the practical factand maybe others do but thats where youre mistaken  it dont pay  it may pay him to be runnin me as his particular friend to be quotin me here and there to be gettin credit of knowin me and my friends and ownin meby gosh but i dont see where the benefit to me comes in  eh  take your own case down there at eureka gulch didnt he send for me just to show me up to you fellers  did i want to have anything to do with the eureka company didnt he set me up to give my opinion about that shaft just to show off what i knew about science and all that and what did he get me to join the company for  was it for you no  was it for me  no  it was just to keep me there for himself and kinder pit me agin you fellers and crow over you  now that aint my style  it may be hisit may be honest and simple and loyal as you say and it may be all right for him to get me to run up accounts at the settlement and then throw off on mebut it aint my style  i suppose he let on that i did that no  he didnt  well then why did he want to run me off with him and out the whole concern in an underhand way and make me leave with nary a character behind me eh  now i never said anything about this beforedid i  it aint like me  i wouldnt have said anything about it now only you talked about my being benefited by his darned foolishness  much ive made outer him  despicable false and disloyal as this was perhaps it was the crowning meanness of such confidences that his very weakness seemed only a reflection of captain jims own and appeared in some strange way to degrade his friend as much as himself  the simplicity of his vanity and selfishness was only equalled by the simplicity of captain jims admiration of it  it was a part of my youthful inexperience of humanity that i was not above the common fallacy of believing that a man is known by the company he keeps and that he is in a manner responsible for its weakness it was a part of that humanity that i felt no surprise in being more amused than shocked by this revelation it seemed a good joke on captain jim  of course you kin laugh at his darned foolishness but by gosh it aint a laughing matter to me  but surely hes given you a good position on the guardian i urged that was disinterested certainly  was it  i call that the cheekiest thing yet  when he found he couldnt make enough of me in private life he totes me out in public as his editorthe man who runs his paper  and has his name in print as the proprietor the only chance hed ever get of being before the public  and dont know the whole town is laughing at him  that may be because they think he writes some of the articles i suggested  again the insinuation glanced harmlessly from his vanity  that couldnt be because i do all the work and it aint his style he said with naive discontent  and its always the highest style done to please him though between you and me its sorter castin pearls before swinethis frisco editingand the public would be just as satisfied with anything i could rattle off that was peart and sassysomething spicy or personal  im willing to climb down and do it for theres nothin stuckup about me you know but that darned fool captain jim has got the big head about the style of the paper and darned if i dont think hes afraid if theres a lettin down people may think its him  ez if  why you know as well as me that theres a sort of snap i could give these things that would show it was me and no slouch did them in a minute  i had my doubts about the elegance or playfulness of mr bassetts trifling but from some paragraphs that appeared in the next issue of the guardian i judged that he had won over captain jimif indeed that gentlemans alleged objections were not entirely the outcome of bassetts fancy  the social paragraphs themselves were clumsy and vulgar  a dullwitted account of a select party at parson baxters with a pointblank compliment to polly baxter his daughter might have made her pretty cheek burn but for her evident prepossession for the meretricious scamp its writer  but even this horseplay seemed more natural than the utterly artificial editorials with their pinchbeck glitter and cheap erudition and thus far it appeared harmless  i grieve to say that these appearances were deceptive  one afternoon as i was returning from a business visit to the outskirts of the village i was amazed on reentering the main street to find a crowd collected around the guardian office gazing at the broken glass of its windows and a quantity of type scattered on the ground  but my attention was at that moment more urgently attracted by a similar group around my own office who however seemed more cautious and were holding timorously aloof from the entrance  as i ran rapidly towards them a few called out look outhes in there while others made way to let me pass  with the impression of fire or robbery in my mind i entered precipitately only to find yuba bill calmly leaning back in an armchair with his feet on the back of another a glass of whiskey from my demijohn in one hand and a huge cigar in his mouth  across his lap lay a stumpy shotgun which i at once recognized as the left bower whose usual place was at his feet on the box during his journeys  he looked cool and collected although there were one or two splashes of printers ink on his shirt and trousers and from the appearance of my lavatory and towel he had evidently been removing similar stains from his hands  putting his gun aside and grasping my hand warmly without rising he began with even more than his usual lazy imperturbability  well hows gilead lookin today  it struck me as looking rather disturbed but as i was still too bewildered to reply he continued lazily  ez you didnt hunt me up i allowed you might hev got kinder petrified and dried up down yer and i reckoned to run down and rattle round a bit and make things lively for ye  ive jist cleared out a newspaper office over thar  they call it the guardian though it didnt seem to offer much pertection to them fellers ez was in it  in fact it wasnt ez much a fight ez it orter hev been  it was rather monotonous for me  but whats the row bill  what has happened i asked excitedly  nothin to speak of i tell ye replied yuba bill reflectively i jest meandered into that shop over there and i sez i want ter see the man ez runs this yer mill o literatoor an progress thar waz two infants sittin on high chairs havin some innocent little game o pickin pieces o lead outer pillboxes like and as soon ez they seed me one of em crawled under his desk and the other scooted outer the back door  bimeby the door opens again and a fluffy coyotelookin feller comes in and allows that he is responsible for that yer paper when i saw the kind of animal he was and that he hadnt any weppings i jist laid the left bower down on the floor  then i sez you allowed in your paper that i oughter hev a little sevility knocked inter me and im here to hev it done  you ken begin it now  with that i reached for him and we waltzed oncet or twicet around the room and then i put him up on the mantelpiece and on them desks and little boxes and took him down again and kinder wiped the floor with him ginrally until the first thing i knowed he was outside the winder on the sidewalk ony blamed if i didnt forget to open the winder  ef it hadnt been for that it would hev been all quiet and peacefullike and nobody hev knowed it  but the sash being in the way it sorter created a disturbance and unpleasantness outside  but what was it all about i repeated  what had he done to you  yell find it in that paper he said indicating a copy of the guardian that lay on my table with a lazy nod of his head praps you dont read it  no more do i  but joe bilson sez to me yesterday bill sez he theyre goin for ye in the guardian  wots that sez i  hark to this sez he and reads out that bit that youll find there  i had opened the paper and he pointed to a paragraph  there it is pooty aint it  i read with amazement as follows   if the pioneer stage company want to keep up with the times and not degenerate into the old style one hoss roadwagon business theyd better make some reform on the line  they might begin by shipping off some of the oldtime whiskeyguzzling drivers who are too high and mighty to do anything but handle the ribbons and are above speaking to a passenger unless hes a favorite or one of their set  overpraise for an occasional scrimmage with road agents and flattery from eastern greenhorns have given them the big head  if the foolkiller were let loose on the line with a big club and knocked a little civility into their heads it wouldnt be a bad thing and would be a particular relief to the passengers for gilead who have to take the stage from simpsons bar   thats my stage said yuba bill quietly when i had ended and thats me  but its impossible i said eagerly  that insult was never written by captain jim  captain jim repeated yuba bill reflectively  captain jimyes that was the name o the man i was playin with  shortish hairy feller suthin between a big coyote and the oldstyle hairtrunk fought pretty well for a hayfooted man from gilead  but youve whipped the wrong man bill i said  think again have you had any quarrel latelyrun against any newspaper man the recollection had flashed upon me that lacy bassett had lately returned from a visit to stockton  yuba bill regarded his boots on the other armchair for a few moments in profound meditation  there was a sort o gaudy insect he began presently suthin halfway betwixt a bossfly and a devils darninneedle ez crawled up onter the box seat with me last week and buzzed  now i think on it he talked highfaluten o the inflooence of the press and sech  i may hev said shoo to him when he was hummin the loudest  i mout hev flicked him off oncet or twicet with my whip  it must be him  gosh he said suddenly rising and lifting his heavy hand to his forehead now i think agin he was the feller ez crawled under the desk when the fight was goin on and stayed there yes sir that was him his face looked sorter familiar but i didnt know him moultin with his feathers off  he turned upon me with the first expression of trouble and anxiety i had ever seen him wear yes sir thats him  and ive kemme yuba billkem myself a matter of twenty miles totin a guna gun by goshto fight thatthatthat potatarbug  he walked to the window turned walked back again finished his whiskey with a single gulp and laid his hand almost despondingly on my shoulder  look ye oldold fell you and mes ole friends  dont give me away  dont let on a word o this to any one  say i kem down yer howlin drunk on a genral tear  say i mistook that newspaper office for a cigarshop andgot licked by the boss  say anythin you like cept that i took a gun down yer to chase a fly that had settled onter me  keep the left bower in yer back office till i send for it  ef youve got a back door somewhere handy where i can slip outer this without bein seen id be thankful  as this desponding suggestion appeared to me as the wisest thing for him to do in the then threatening state of affairs outsidewhich had he suspected it he would have stayed to facei quickly opened a door into a courtyard that communicated through an alley with a side street here we shook hands and parted his last dejected ejaculation being that potatobug  later i ascertained that captain jim had retired to his ranch some four miles distant he was not seriously hurt but looked to use the words of my informant ez ef hed been hugged by a playful bar  as the guardian made its appearance the next week without the slightest allusion to the fracas i did not deem it necessary to divulge the real facts  when i called to inquire about captain jims condition he himself however volunteered an explanation  i dont mind tellin you ez an old friend o mine and lacys that the secret of that there attack on me and the guardian was perlitikal  yes sir  there was a powerful orginization in the interest o halkins for assemblyman ez didnt like our hightoned editorials on caucus corruption and hired a bully to kem down here and suppress us  why this yer lacy spotted the idea to oncet yer know how keen be is  was lacy present i asked as carelessly as i could  captain jim glanced his eyes over his shoulder quite in his old furtive canine fashion and then blinked them at me rapidly  he war  and if it warnt for his pluck and his science and his strength i dont know whar id hev been now  howsomever its all right  ive had a fair offer to sell the guardian over at simpsons bar and its time i quit throwin away the work of a man like lacy bassett upon it  and between you and me ive got an idea and suthin better to put his talens into   iii  it was not long before it became evident that the talens of mr lacy bassett as indicated by captain jim were to grasp at a seat in the state legislature  an editorial in the simpsons bar clarion boldly advocated his pretensions  at first it was believed that the article emanated from the gifted pen of lacy himself but the style was so unmistakably that of colonel starbottle an eminent political warhorse of the district that a graver truth was at once suggested namely that the guardian had simply been transferred to simpsons bar and merged into the clarion solely on this condition  at least it was recognized that it was the hand of captain jim which guided the editorial fingers of the colonel and captain jims money that distended the pockets of that gallant political leader  howbeit lacy bassett was never elected in fact he was only for one brief moment a candidate  it was related that upon his first ascending the platform at simpsons bar a voice in the audience said lazily come down  that voice was yuba bills  a slight confusion ensued in which yuba bill whispered a few words in the colonels ear  after a moments hesitation the warhorse came forward and in his loftiest manner regretted that the candidate had withdrawn  the next issue of the clarion proclaimed with no uncertain sound that a base conspiracy gotten up by the former proprietor of the guardian to undermine the prestige of the great express company had been ruthlessly exposed and the candidate on learning it himself for the first time withdrew his name from the canvass as became a hightoned gentleman  public opinion ignoring lacy bassett completely unhesitatingly denounced captain jim  during this period i had paid but little heed to lacy bassetts social movements or the successes which would naturally attend such a character with the susceptible sex  i had heard that he was engaged to polly baxter but that they had quarrelled in consequence of his flirtations with others especially a mrs sweeny a profusely ornamented but reputationless widow  captain jim had often alluded with a certain respectful pride and delicacy to pollys ardent appreciation of his friend and had more than half hinted with the same reverential mystery to their matrimonial union later and his intention of doing the square thing for the young couple  but it was presently noticed that these allusions became less frequent during lacys amorous aberrations and an occasional depression and unusual reticence marked captain jims manner when the subject was discussed in his presence he seemed to endeavor to make up for his friends defection by a kind of personal homage to polly and not unfrequently accompanied her to church or to singingclass  i have a vivid recollection of meeting him one afternoon crossing the fields with her and looking into her face with that same wistful absorbed and uneasy canine expression that i had hitherto supposed he had reserved for lacy alone  i do not know whether polly was averse to the speechless devotion of these yearning brown eyes her manner was animated and the pretty cheek that was nearest me mantled as i passed but i was struck for the first time with the idea that captain jim loved her i was surprised to have that fancy corroborated in the remark of another wayfarer whom i met to the effect that now that bassett was out o the running it looked ez if captain jim was makin up for time  was it possible that captain jim had always loved her i did not at first know whether to be pained or pleased for his sake  but i concluded that whether the unworthy bassett had at last found a rival in captain jim or in the girl herself it was a displacement that was for captain jims welfare  but as i was about leaving gilead for a months transfer to the san francisco office i had no opportunity to learn more from the confidences of captain jim  i was ascending the principal staircase of my san francisco hotel one rainy afternoon when i was pointedly recalled to gilead by the passing glitter of mrs sweenys jewelry and the sudden vanishing behind her of a gentleman who seemed to be accompanying her  a few moments after i had entered my room i heard a tap at my door and opened it upon lacy bassett  i thought he looked a little confused and agitated nevertheless with an assumption of cordiality and ease he said it appears were neighbors  thats my room next to yours  he pointed to the next room which i then remembered was a sittingroom en suite with my own and communicating with it by a second door which was always locked  it had not been occupied since my tenancy  as i suppose my face did not show any extravagant delight at the news of his contiguity he added hastily theres a transom over the door and i thought id tell you you kin hear everything from the one room to the other  i thanked him and told him dryly that as i had no secrets to divulge and none that i cared to hear it made no difference to me as this seemed to increase his confusion and he still hesitated before the door i asked him if captain jim was with him  no he said quickly  i havent seen him for a month and dont want to  look here i want to talk to you a bit about him  he walked into the room and closed the door behind him  i want to tell you that me and captain jim is played  all this runnin o me and interferin with me is played  im tired of it  you kin tell him so from me  then you have quarrelled  yes  as much as any man can quarrel with a darned fool who cant take a hint  one moment  have you quarrelled about polly baxter  yes he answered querulously  of course i have  what does he mean by interfering  now listen to me mr bassett i interrupted  i have no desire to concern myself in your association with captain jim but since you persist in dragging me into it you must allow me to speak plainly from all that i can ascertain you have no serious intentions of marrying polly baxter  you have come here from gilead to follow mrs sweeny whom i saw you with a moment ago now why do you not frankly give up miss baxter to captain jim who will make her a good husband and go your own way with mrs sweeny if you really wish to break off your connection with captain jim thats the only way to do it  his face which had exhibited the weakest and most pitiable consciousness at the mention of mrs sweeny changed to an expression of absolute stupefaction as i concluded  wot stuff are you tryin to fool me with he said at last roughly  i mean i replied sharply that this double game of yours is disgraceful  your association with mrs sweeny demands the withdrawal of any claim you have upon miss baxter at once  if you have no respect for captain jims friendship you must at least show common decency to her  he burst into a halfrelieved halfhysteric laugh  are you crazy gasped he  why captain jims just huntin me down to make me marry polly  thats just what the rows about  thats just what hes interferin forjust to carry out his darned fool ideas o gettin a wife for me just his vanity to say hes made the match  its me that he wants to marry to that baxter girlnot himself  hes too cursed selfish for that  i suppose i was not different from ordinary humanity for in my unexpected discomfiture i despised captain jim quite as much as i did the man before me  reiterating my remark that i had no desire to mix myself further in their quarrels i got rid of him with as little ceremony as possible  but a few minutes later when the farcical side of the situation struck me my irritation was somewhat mollified without however increasing my respect for either of the actors  the whole affair had assumed a triviality that was simply amusing nothing more and i even looked forward to a meeting with captain jim and his exposition of the matterwhich i knew would followwith pleasurable anticipation  but i was mistaken  one afternoon when i was watching the slanting volleys of rain driven by a strong southwester against the windows of the hotel readingroom i was struck by the erratic movements of a dripping figure outside that seemed to be hesitating over the entrance to the hotel  at times furtively penetrating the porch as far as the vestibule and again shyly recoiling from it its manner was so strongly suggestive of some timid animal that i found myself suddenly reminded of captain jim and the memorable evening of his exodus from eureka gulch  as the figure chanced to glance up to the window where i stood i saw to my astonishment that it was captain jim himself but so changed and haggard that i scarcely knew him  i instantly ran out into the hall and vestibule but when i reached the porch he had disappeared  either he had seen me and wished to avoid me or he had encountered the object of his quest which i at once concluded must be lacy bassett  i was so much impressed and worried by his appearance and manner that in this belief i overcame my aversion to meeting bassett and even sought him through the public rooms and lobbies in the hope of finding captain jim with him  but in vain possibly he had succeeded in escaping his relentless friend  as the wind and rain increased at nightfall and grew into a tempestuous night with deserted streets and swollen waterways i did not go out again but retired early inexplicably haunted by the changed and brooding face of captain jim  even in my dreams he pursued me in his favorite likeness of a wistful anxious and uneasy hound who on my turning to caress him familiarly snapped at me viciously and appeared to have suddenly developed a snarling rabid fury  i seemed to be awakened at last by the sound of his voice  for an instant i believed the delusion a part of my dream but i was mistaken i was lying broad awake and the voice clearly had come from the next room and was distinctly audible over the transom  ive had enough of it he said and im givin ye nowthis nightyer last chance  quit this hotel and that woman and go back to gilead and marry polly  dont do it and ill kill ye ez sure ez you sit there gapin in that chair  if i cant get ye to fight me like a manand ill spit in yer face or put some insult onto you afore that woman afore everybody ez would make a bigger skunk nor you turnill hunt ye down and kill ye in your tracks  there was a querulous murmur of interruption in lacys voice but whether of defiance or appeal i could not distinguish  captain jims voice again rose dogged and distinct  ef you kill me its all the same and i dont say that i wont thank ye  this yer world is too crowded for yer and me lacy bassett  ive believed in ye trusted in ye lied for ye and fought for ye  from the time i took ye upa fellerpassenger to frescobelievin there wor the makins of a man in ye to now you fooled mefooled me afore the eureka boys fooled me afore gilead fooled me afore her fooled me afore god  its got to end here  yeve got to take the curse of that foolishness off o me youve got to do one single thing thats like the man i took ye for or youve got to die  times waz when id have wished it for your accountthats gone lacy bassett  youve got to do it for me  youve got to do it so i dont see dd fool writ in the eyes of every man ez looks at me  he had apparently risen and walked towards the door  his voice sounded from another part of the room  ill give ye till tomorrow mornin to do suthin to lift this curse off o me  ef you refoose then by the living god ill slap yer face in the dininroom or in the office afore them all you hear me  there was a pause and then a quick sharp explosion that seemed to fill and expand both rooms until the windows were almost lifted from their casements a hysterical inarticulate cry from lacy the violent opening of a door hurried voices and the tramping of many feet in the passage  i sprang out of bed partly dressed myself and ran into the hall  but by that time i found a crowd of guests and servants around the next door some grasping bassett who was white and trembling and others kneeling by captain jim who was half lying in the doorway against the wall  he heard it all bassett gasped hysterically pointing to me he knows that this man wanted to kill me  before i could reply captain jim partly raised himself with a convulsive effort  wiping away the blood that oozing from his lips already showed the desperate character of his internal wound he said in a husky and hurried voice its all right boys  its my fault it was me who done it  i went for him in a mean underhanded way jest now when he hadnt a weppin nor any show to defend himself  we gripped  he got a holt o my derringeryou see thats my pistol there i swear itand turned it agin me in selfdefense and sarved me right  i swear to god gentlemen its so  catching sight of my face he looked at me i fancied half imploringly and half triumphantly and added i might hev knowed it  i allers allowed lacy bassett was gamegame gentlemenand he was  if its my last word i say ithe was game  and with this devoted falsehood upon his lips and something of the old canine instinct in his failing heart as his head sank back he seemed to turn it towards bassett as if to stretch himself out at his feet then the light failed from his yearning upward glance and the curse of foolishness was lifted from him forever  so conclusive were the facts that the coroners jury did not deem it necessary to detain mr bassett for a single moment after the inquest but he returned to gilead married polly baxter and probably on the strength of having killed his man was unopposed on the platform next year and triumphantly elected to the legislature
