59708977	the conditions of existence as affecting the perpetuation of living beings  lecture v of vi lectures to working men at the museum of practical geology 1863 on darwins work origin of species  by thomas h huxley    in the last lecture i endeavoured to prove to you that while as a general rule organic beings tend to reproduce their kind there is in them also a constantly recurring tendency to varyto vary to a greater or to a less extent such a variety i pointed out to you might arise from causes which we do not understand we therefore called it spontaneous and it might come into existence as a definite and marked thing without any gradations between itself and the form which preceded it i further pointed out that such a variety having once arisen might be perpetuated to some extent and indeed to a very marked extent without any direct interference or without any exercise of that process which we called selection and then i stated further that by such selection when exercised artificiallyif you took care to breed only from those forms which presented the same peculiarities of any variety which had arisen in this mannerthe variation might be perpetuated as far as we can see indefinitely  the next question and it is an important one for us is this is there any limit to the amount of variation from the primitive stock which can be produced by this process of selective breeding in considering this question it will be useful to class the characteristics in respect of which organic beings vary under two heads we may consider structural characteristics and we may consider physiological characteristics  in the first place as regards structural characteristics i endeavoured to show you by the skeletons which i had upon the table and by reference to a great many wellascertained facts that the different breeds of pigeons the carriers pouters and tumblers might vary in any of their internal and important structural characters to a very great degree not only might there be changes in the proportions of the skull and the characters of the feet and beaks and so on but that there might be an absolute difference in the number of the vertebrae of the back as in the sacral vertebrae of the pouter and so great is the extent of the variation in these and similar characters that i pointed out to you by reference to the skeletons and the diagrams that these extreme varieties may absolutely differ more from one another in their structural characters than do what naturalists call distinct species of pigeons that is to say that they differ so much in structure that there is a greater difference between the pouter and the tumbler than there is between such wild and distinct forms as the rock pigeon or the ring pigeon or the ring pigeon and the stock dove and indeed the differences are of greater value than this for the structural differences between these domesticated pigeons are such as would be admitted by a naturalist supposing he knew nothing at all about their origin to entitle them to constitute even distinct genera  as i have used this term species and shall probably use it a good deal i had better perhaps devote a word or two to explaining what i mean by it  animals and plants are divided into groups which become gradually smaller beginning with a kingdom which is divided into subkingdoms then come the smaller divisions called provinces and so on from a province to a class from a class to an order from orders to families and from these to genera until we come at length to the smallest groups of animals which can be defined one from the other by constant characters which are not sexual and these are what naturalists call species in practice whatever they may do in theory  if in a state of nature you find any two groups of living beings which are separated one from the other by some constantlyrecurring characteristic i dont care how slight and trivial so long as it is defined and constant and does not depend on sexual peculiarities then all naturalists agree in calling them two species that is what is meant by the use of the word speciesthat is to say it is for the practical naturalist a mere question of structural differences 1  we have seen nowto repeat this point once more and it is very essential that we should rightly understand itwe have seen that breeds known to have been derived from a common stock by selection may be as different in their structure from the original stock as species may be distinct from each other  but is the like true of the physiological characteristics of animals do the physiological differences of varieties amount in degree to those observed between forms which naturalists call distinct species this is a most important point for us to consider  as regards the great majority of physiological characteristics there is no doubt that they are capable of being developed increased and modified by selection  there is no doubt that breeds may be made as different as species in many physiological characters i have already pointed out to you very briefly the different habits of the breeds of pigeons all of which depend upon their physiological peculiaritiesas the peculiar habit of tumbling in the tumblerthe peculiarities of flight in the homing birdsthe strange habit of spreading out the tail and walking in a peculiar fashion in the fantailand lastly the habit of blowing out the gullet so characteristic of the pouter these are all due to physiological modifications and in all these respects these birds differ as much from each other as any two ordinary species do  so with dogs in their habits and instincts it is a physiological peculiarity which leads the greyhound to chase its prey by sightthat enables the beagle to track it by the scentthat impels the terrier to its rathunting propensityand that leads the retriever to its habit of retrieving these habits and instincts are all the results of physiological differences and peculiarities which have been developed from a common stock at least there is every reason to believe so but it is a most singular circumstance that while you may run through almost the whole series of physiological processes without finding a check to your argument you come at last to a point where you do find a check and that is in the reproductive processes for there is a most singular circumstance in respect to natural speciesat least about some of themand it would be sufficient for the purposes of this argument if it were true of only one of them but there is in fact a great number of such casesand that is that similar as they may appear to be to mere races or breeds they present a marked peculiarity in the reproductive process if you breed from the male and female of the same race you of course have offspring of the like kind and if you make the offspring breed together you obtain the same result and if you breed from these again you will still have the same kind of offspring there is no check but if you take members of two distinct species however similar they may be to each other and make them breed together you will find a check with some modifications and exceptions however which i shall speak of presently if you cross two such species with each other thenalthough you may get offspring in the case of the first cross yet if you attempt to breed from the products of that crossing which are what are called hybridsthat is if you couple a male and a female hybridthen the result is that in ninetynine cases out of a hundred you will get no offspring at all there will be no result whatsoever  the reason of this is quite obvious in some cases the male hybrids although possessing all the external appearances and characteristics of perfect animals are physiologically imperfect and deficient in the structural parts of the reproductive elements necessary to generation it is said to be invariably the case with the male mule the cross between the ass and the mare and hence it is that although crossing the horse with the ass is easy enough and is constantly done as far as i am aware if you take two mules a male and a female and endeavour to breed from them you get no offspring whatever no generation will take place this is what is called the sterility of the hybrids between two distinct species  you see that this is a very extraordinary circumstance one does not see why it should be the common teleological explanation is that it is to prevent the impurity of the blood resulting from the crossing of one species with another but you see it does not in reality do anything of the kind there is nothing in this fact that hybrids cannot breed with each other to establish such a theory there is nothing to prevent the horse breeding with the ass or the ass with the horse so that this explanation breaks down as a great many explanations of this kind do that are only founded on mere assumptions  thus you see that there is a great difference between mongrels which are crosses between distinct races and hybrids which are crosses between distinct species the mongrels are so far as we know fertile with one another but between species in many cases you cannot succeed in obtaining even the first cross at any rate it is quite certain that the hybrids are often absolutely infertile one with another  here is a feature then great or small as it may be which distinguishes natural species of animals can we find any approximation to this in the different races known to be produced by selective breeding from a common stock up to the present time the answer to that question is absolutely a negative one as far as we know at present there is nothing approximating to this check in crossing the breeds between the fantail and the pouter the carrier and the tumbler or any other variety or race you may nameso far as we know at presentthere is no difficulty in breeding together the mongrels take the carrier and the fantail for instance and let them represent the horse and the ass in the case of distinct species then you have as the result of their breeding the carrierfantail mongrelwe will say the male and female mongreland as far as we know these two when crossed would not be less fertile than the original cross or than carrier with carrier here you see is a physiological contrast between the races produced by selective modification and natural species i shall inquire into the value of this fact and of some modifying circumstances by and by for the present i merely put it broadly before you  but while considering this question of the limitations of species a word must be said about what is called recurrencethe tendency of races which have been developed by selective breeding from varieties to return to their primitive type this is supposed by many to put an absolute limit to the extent of selective and all other variations people say it is all very well to talk about producing these different races but you know very well that if you turned all these birds wild these pouters and carriers and so on they would all return to their primitive stock this is very commonly assumed to be a fact and it is an argument that is commonly brought forward as conclusive but if you will take the trouble to inquire into it rather closely i think you will find that it is not worth very much the first question of course is do they thus return to the primitive stock and commonly as the thing is assumed and accepted it is extremely difficult to get anything like good evidence of it it is constantly said for example that if domesticated horses are turned wild as they have been in some parts of asia minor and south america that they return at once to the primitive stock from which they were bred but the first answer that you make to this assumption is to ask who knows what the primitive stock was and the second answer is that in that case the wild horses of asia minor ought to be exactly like the wild horses of south america if they are both like the same thing they ought manifestly to be like each other the best authorities however tell you that it is quite different the wild horse of asia is said to be of a dun colour with a largish head and a great many other peculiarities while the best authorities on the wild horses of south america tell you that there is no similarity between their wild horses and those of asia minor the cut of their heads is very different and they are commonly chestnut or baycoloured it is quite clear therefore that as by these facts there ought to have been two primitive stocks they go for nothing in support of the assumption that races recur to one primitive stock and so far as this evidence is concerned it falls to the ground  suppose for a moment that it were so and that domesticated races when turned wild did return to some common condition i cannot see that this would prove much more than that similar conditions are likely to produce similar results and that when you take back domesticated animals into what we call natural conditions you do exactly the same thing as if you carefully undid all the work you had gone through for the purpose of bringing the animal from its wild to its domesticated state i do not see anything very wonderful in the fact if it took all that trouble to get it from a wild state that it should go back into its original state as soon as you removed the conditions which produced the variation to the domesticated form there is an important fact however forcibly brought forward by mr darwin which has been noticed in connection with the breeding of domesticated pigeons and it is that however different these breeds of pigeons may be from each other and we have already noticed the great differences in these breeds that if among any of those variations you chance to have a blue pigeon turn up it will be sure to have the black bars across the wings which are characteristic of the original wild stock the rock pigeon  now this is certainly a very remarkable circumstance but i do not see myself how it tells very strongly either one way or the other i think in fact that this argument in favour of recurrence to the primitive type might prove a great deal too much for those who so constantly bring it forward for example mr darwin has very forcibly urged that nothing is commoner than if you examine a dun horseand i had an opportunity of verifying this illustration lately while in the islands of the west highlands where there are a great many dun horsesto find that horse exhibit a long black stripe down his back very often stripes on his shoulder and very often stripes on his legs i myself saw a pony of this description a short time ago in a bakers cart near rothesay in bute it had the long stripe down the back and stripes on the shoulders and legs just like those of the ass the quagga and the zebra now if we interpret the theory of recurrence as applied to this case might it not be said that here was a case of a variation exhibiting the characters and conditions of an animal occupying something like an intermediate position between the horse the ass the quagga and the zebra and from which these had been developed in the same way with regard even to man every anatomist will tell you that there is nothing commoner in dissecting the human body than to meet with what are called muscular variationsthat is if you dissect two bodies very carefully you will probably find that the modes of attachment and insertion of the muscles are not exactly the same in both there being great peculiarities in the mode in which the muscles are arranged and it is very singular that in some dissections of the human body you will come upon arrangements of the muscles very similar indeed to the same parts in the apes is the conclusion in that case to be that this is like the black bars in the case of the pigeon and that it indicates a recurrence to the primitive type from which the animals have been probably developed truly i think that the opponents of modification and variation had better leave the argument of recurrence alone or it may prove altogether too strong for them  to sum upthe evidence as far as we have gone is against the argument as to any limit to divergences so far as structure is concerned and in favour of a physiological limitation by selective breeding we can produce structural divergences as great as those of species but we cannot produce equal physiological divergences for the present i leave the question there  now the next problem that lies before usand it is an extremely important oneis this does this selective breeding occur in nature because if there is no proof of it all that i have been telling you goes for nothing in accounting for the origin of species are natural causes competent to play the part of selection in perpetuating varieties here we labour under very great difficulties in the last lecture i had occasion to point out to you the extreme difficulty of obtaining evidence even of the first origin of those varieties which we know to have occurred in domesticated animals i told you that almost always the origin of these varieties is overlooked so that i could only produce two of three cases as that of gratio kelleia and of the ancon sheep people forget or do not take notice of them until they come to have a prominence and if that is true of artificial cases under our own eyes and in animals in our own care how much more difficult it must be to have at first hand good evidence of the origin of varieties in nature indeed i do not know that it is possible by direct evidence to prove the origin of a variety in nature or to prove selective breeding but i will tell you what we can proveand this comes to the same thingthat varieties exist in nature within the limits of species and what is more that when a variety has come into existence in nature there are natural causes and conditions which are amply competent to play the part of a selective breeder and although that is not quite the evidence that one would like to havethough it is not direct testimonyyet it is exceeding good and exceedingly powerful evidence in its way  as to the first point of varieties existing among natural species i might appeal to the universal experience of every naturalist and of any person who has ever turned any attention at all to the characteristics of plants and animals in a state of nature but i may as well take a few definite cases and i will begin with man himself  i am one of those who believe that at present there is no evidence whatever for saying that mankind sprang originally from any more than a single pair i must say that i cannot see any good ground whatever or even any tenable sort of evidence for believing that there is more than one species of man nevertheless as you know just as there are numbers of varieties in animals so there are remarkable varieties of men i speak not merely of those broad and distinct variations which you see at a glance everybody of course knows the difference between a negro and a white man and can tell a chinaman from an englishman they each have peculiar characteristics of colour and physiognomy but you must recollect that the characters of these races go very far deeperthey extend to the bony structure and to the characters of that most important of all organs to usthe brain so that among men belonging to different races or even within the same race one man shall have a brain a third or half or even seventy per cent bigger than another and if you take the whole range of human brains you will find a variation in some cases of a hundred per cent apart from these variations in the size of the brain the characters of the skull vary thus if i draw the figures of a mongul and of a negro head on the blackboard in the case of the last the breadth would be about seventenths and in the other it would be ninetenths of the total length so that you see there is abundant evidence of variation among men in their natural condition and if you turn to other animals there is just the same thing the fox for example which has a very large geographical distribution all over europe and parts of asia and on the american continent varies greatly there are mostly large foxes in the north and smaller ones in the south in germany alone the foresters reckon some eight different sorts  of the tiger no one supposes that there is more than one species they extend from the hottest parts of bengal into the dry cold bitter steppes of siberia into a latitude of 50 degreesso that they may even prey upon the reindeer these tigers have exceedingly different characteristics but still they all keep their general features so that there is no doubt as to their being tigers the siberian tiger has a thick fur a small mane and a longitudinal stripe down the back while the tigers of java and sumatra differ in many important respects from the tigers of northern asia so lions vary so birds vary and so if you go further back and lower down in creation you find that fishes vary in different streams in the same country even you will find the trout to be quite different to each other and easily recognisable by those who fish in the particular streams there is the same differences in leeches leech collectors can easily point out to you the differences and the peculiarities which you yourself would probably pass by so with freshwater mussels so in fact with every animal you can mention  in plants there is the same kind of variation take such a case even as the common bramble the botanists are all at war about it some of them wanting to make out that there are many species of it and others maintaining that they are but many varieties of one species and they cannot settle to this day which is a species and which is a variety  so that there can be no doubt whatsoever that any plant and any animal may vary in nature that varieties may arise in the way i have describedas spontaneous varietiesand that those varieties may be perpetuated in the same way that i have shown you spontaneous varieties are perpetuated i say therefore that there can be no doubt as to the origin and perpetuation of varieties in nature  but the question now isdoes selection take place in nature is there anything like the operation of man in exercising selective breeding taking place in nature you will observe that at present i say nothing about species i wish to confine myself to the consideration of the production of those natural races which everybody admits to exist the question is whether in nature there are causes competent to produce races just in the same way as man is able to produce by selection such races of animals as we have already noticed  when a variety has arisen the conditions of existence are such as to exercise an influence which is exactly comparable to that of artificial selection by conditions of existence i mean two thingsthere are conditions which are furnished by the physical the inorganic world and there are conditions of existence which are furnished by the organic world there is in the first place climate under that head i include only temperature and the varied amount of moisture of particular places in the next place there is what is technically called station which meansgiven the climate the particular kind of place in which an animal or a plant lives or grows for example the station of a fish is in the water of a freshwater fish in fresh water the station of a marine fish is in the sea and a marine animal may have a station higher or deeper so again with land animals the differences in their stations are those of different soils and neighbourhoods some being best adapted to a calcareous and others to an arenaceous soil the third condition of existence is food by which i mean food in the broadest sense the supply of the materials necessary to the existence of an organic being in the case of a plant the inorganic matters such as carbonic acid water ammonia and the earthy salts or salines in the case of the animal the inorganic and organic matters which we have seen they require then these are all at least the two first what we may call the inorganic or physical conditions of existence food takes a midplace and then come the organic conditions by which i mean the conditions which depend upon the state of the rest of the organic creation upon the number and kind of living beings with which an animal is surrounded you may class these under two heads there are organic beings which operate as opponents and there are organic beings which operate as helpers to any given organic creature the opponents may be of two kinds there are the indirect opponents which are what we may call rivals and there are the direct opponents those which strive to destroy the creature and these we call enemies by rivals i mean of course in the case of plants those which require for their support the same kind of soil and station and among animals those which require the same kind of station or food or climate those are the indirect opponents the direct opponents are of course those which prey upon an animal or vegetable the helpers may also be regarded as direct and indirect in the case of a carnivorous animal for example a particular herbaceous plant may in multiplying be an indirect helper by enabling the herbivora on which the carnivore preys to get more food and thus to nourish the carnivore more abundantly the direct helper may be best illustrated by reference to some parasitic creature such as the tapeworm the tapeworm exists in the human intestines so that the fewer there are of men the fewer there will be of tapeworms other things being alike it is a humiliating reflection perhaps that we may be classed as direct helpers to the tapeworm but the fact is so we can all see that if there were no men there would be no tapeworms  it is extremely difficult to estimate in a proper way the importance and the working of the conditions of existence i do not think there were any of us who had the remotest notion of properly estimating them until the publication of mr darwins work which has placed them before us with remarkable clearness and i must endeavour as far as i can in my own fashion to give you some notion of how they work we shall find it easiest to take a simple case and one as free as possible from every kind of complication  i will suppose therefore that all the habitable part of this globethe dry land amounting to about 51000000 square milesi will suppose that the whole of that dry land has the same climate and that it is composed of the same kind of rock or soil so that there will be the same station everywhere we thus get rid of the peculiar influence of different climates and stations i will then imagine that there shall be but one organic being in the world and that shall be a plant in this we start fair its food is to be carbonic acid water and ammonia and the saline matters in the soil which are by the supposition everywhere alike we take one single plant with no opponents no helpers and no rivals it is to be a fair field and no favour now i will ask you to imagine further that it shall be a plant which shall produce every year fifty seeds which is a very moderate number for a plant to produce and that by the action of the winds and currents these seeds shall be equally and gradually distributed over the whole surface of the land i want you now to trace out what will occur and you will observe that i am not talking fallaciously any more than a mathematician does when he expounds his problem if you show that the conditions of your problem are such as may actually occur in nature and do not transgress any of the known laws of nature in working out your proposition then you are as safe in the conclusion you arrive at as is the mathematician in arriving at the solution of his problem in science the only way of getting rid of the complications with which a subject of this kind is environed is to work in this deductive method what will be the result then i will suppose that every plant requires one square foot of ground to live upon and the result will be that in the course of nine years the plant will have occupied every single available spot in the whole globe i have chalked upon the blackboard the figures by which i arrive at the result  plants   plants 1 x 50 in 1st year  50             50 x 50  2nd   2500 2500 x 50  3rd   125000 125000 x 50  4th   6250000 6250000 x 50  5th   312500000 312500000 x 50  6th   15625000000 15625000000 x 50  7th   781250000000 781250000000 x 50  8th   39062500000000 39062500000000 x 50  9th   1953125000000000  51000000 sq milesthe dry surface of the earth x 27878400the number of sq ft in 1 sq mile  sq ft 1421798400000000 being 531326600000000 square feet less than would be required at the end of the ninth year  you will see from this that at the end of the first year the single plant will have produced fifty more of its kind by the end of the second year these will have increased to 2500 and so on in succeeding years you get beyond even trillions and i am not at all sure that i could tell you what the proper arithmetical denomination of the total number really is but at any rate you will understand the meaning of all those noughts then you see that at the bottom i have taken the 51000000 of square miles constituting the surface of the dry land and as the number of square feet are placed under and subtracted from the number of seeds that would be produced in the ninth year you can see at once that there would be an immense number more of plants than there would be square feet of ground for their accommodation this is certainly quite enough to prove my point that between the eighth and ninth year after being planted the single plant would have stocked the whole available surface of the earth  this is a thing which is hardly conceivableit seems hardly imaginableyet it is so it is indeed simply the law of malthus exemplified mr malthus was a clergyman who worked out this subject most minutely and truthfully some years ago he showed quite clearlyand although he was much abused for his conclusions at the time they have never yet been disproved and never will behe showed that in consequence of the increase in the number of organic beings in a geometrical ratio while the means of existence cannot be made to increase in the same ratio that there must come a time when the number of organic beings will be in excess of the power of production of nutriment and that thus some check must arise to the further increase of those organic beings at the end of the ninth year we have seen that each plant would not be able to get its full square foot of ground and at the end of another year it would have to share that space with fifty others the produce of the seeds which it would give off  what then takes place every plant grows up flourishes occupies its square foot of ground and gives off its fifty seeds but notice this that out of this number only one can come to anything there is thus as it were fortynine chances to one against its growing up it depends upon the most fortuitous circumstances whether any one of these fifty seeds shall grow up and flourish or whether it shall die and perish this is what mr darwin has drawn attention to and called the struggle for existence and i have taken this simple case of a plant because some people imagine that the phrase seems to imply a sort of fight  i have taken this plant and shown you that this is the result of the ratio of the increase the necessary result of the arrival of a time coming for every species when exactly as many members must be destroyed as are born that is the inevitable ultimate result of the rate of production now what is the result of all this i have said that there are fortynine struggling against every one and it amounts to this that the smallest possible start given to any one seed may give it an advantage which will enable it to get ahead of all the others anything that will enable any one of these seeds to germinate six hours before any of the others will other things being alike enable it to choke them out altogether i have shown you that there is no particular in which plants will not vary from each other it is quite possible that one of our imaginary plants may vary in such a character as the thickness of the integument of its seeds it might happen that one of the plants might produce seeds having a thinner integument and that would enable the seeds of that plant to germinate a little quicker than those of any of the others and those seeds would most inevitably extinguish the fortynine times as many that were struggling with them  i have put it in this way but you see the practical result of the process is the same as if some person had nurtured the one and destroyed the other seeds it does not matter how the variation is produced so long as it is once allowed to occur the variation in the plant once fairly started tends to become hereditary and reproduce itself the seeds would spread themselves in the same way and take part in the struggle with the fortynine hundred or fortynine thousand with which they might be exposed thus by degrees this variety with some slight organic change or modification must spread itself over the whole surface of the habitable globe and extirpate or replace the other kinds that is what is meant by natural selection that is the kind of argument by which it is perfectly demonstrable that the conditions of existence may play exactly the same part for natural varieties as man does for domesticated varieties no one doubts at all that particular circumstances may be more favourable for one plant and less so for another and the moment you admit that you admit the selective power of nature now although i have been putting a hypothetical case you must not suppose that i have been reasoning hypothetically there are plenty of direct experiments which bear out what we may call the theory of natural selection there is extremely good authority for the statement that if you take the seed of mixed varieties of wheat and sow it collecting the seed next year and sowing it again at length you will find that out of all your varieties only two or three have lived or perhaps even only one there were one or two varieties which were best fitted to get on and they have killed out the other kinds in just the same way and with just the same certainty as if you had taken the trouble to remove them as i have already said the operation of nature is exactly the same as the artificial operation of man  but if this be true of that simple case which i put before you where there is nothing but the rivalry of one member of a species with others what must be the operation of selective conditions when you recollect as a matter of fact that for every species of animal or plant there are fifty or a hundred species which might all more or less be comprehended in the same climate food and stationthat every plant has multitudinous animals which prey upon it and which are its direct opponents and that these have other animals preying upon themthat every plant has its indirect helpers in the birds that scatter abroad its seed and the animals that manure it with their dungi say when these things are considered it seems impossible that any variation which may arise in a species in nature should not tend in some way or other either to be a little better or worse than the previous stock if it is a little better it will have an advantage over and tend to extirpate the latter in this crush and struggle and if it is a little worse it will itself be extirpated  i know nothing that more appropriately expresses this than the phrase the struggle for existence because it brings before your minds in a vivid sort of way some of the simplest possible circumstances connected with it when a struggle is intense there must be some who are sure to be trodden down crushed and overpowered by others and there will be some who just manage to get through only by the help of the slightest accident i recollect reading an account of the famous retreat of the french troops under napoleon from moscow worn out tired and dejected they at length came to a great river over which there was but one bridge for the passage of the vast army disorganised and demoralised as that army was the struggle must certainly have been a terrible oneevery one heeding only himself and crushing through the ranks and treading down his fellows the writer of the narrative who was himself one of those who were fortunate enough to succeed in getting over and not among the thousands who were left behind or forced into the river ascribed his escape to the fact that he saw striding onward through the mass a great strong fellowone of the french cuirassiers who had on a large blue cloakand he had enough presence of mind to catch and retain a hold of this strong mans cloak he says i caught hold of his cloak and although he swore at me and cut at and struck me by turns and at last when he found he could not shake me off fell to entreating me to leave go or i should prevent him from escaping besides not assisting myself i still kept tight hold of him and would not quit my grasp until he had at last dragged me through here you see was a case of selective savingif we may so term itdepending for its success on the strength of the cloth of the cuirassiers cloak it is the same in nature every species has its bridge of beresina it has to fight its way through and struggle with other species and when well nigh overpowered it may be that the smallest chance something in its colour perhapsthe minutest circumstancewill turn the scale one way or the other  suppose that by a variation of the black race it had produced the white man at any timeyou know that the negroes are said to believe this to have been the case and to imagine that cain was the first white man and that we are his descendantssuppose that this had ever happened and that the first residence of this human being was on the west coast of africa there is no great structural difference between the white man and the negro and yet there is something so singularly different in the constitution of the two that the malarias of that country which do not hurt the black at all cut off and destroy the white then you see there would have been a selective operation performed if the white man had risen in that way he would have been selected out and removed by means of the malaria now there really is a very curious case of selection of this sort among pigs and it is a case of selection of colour too in the woods of florida there are a great many pigs and it is a very curious thing that they are all black every one of them professor wyman was there some years ago and on noticing no pigs but these black ones he asked some of the people how it was that they had no white pigs and the reply was that in the woods of florida there was a root which they called the paint root and that if the white pigs were to eat any of it it had the effect of making their hoofs crack and they died but if the black pigs eat any of it it did not hurt them at all here was a very simple case of natural selection a skilful breeder could not more carefully develope the black breed of pigs and weed out all the white pigs than the paint root does  to show you how remarkably indirect may be such natural selective agencies as i have referred to i will conclude by noticing a case mentioned by mr darwin and which is certainly one of the most curious of its kind it is that of the humble bee it has been noticed that there are a great many more humble bees in the neighbourhood of towns than out in the open country and the explanation of the matter is this the humble bees build nests in which they store their honey and deposit the larvae and eggs the field mice are amazingly fond of the honey and larvae therefore wherever there are plenty of field mice as in the country the humble bees are kept down but in the neighbourhood of towns the number of cats which prowl about the fields eat up the field mice and of course the more mice they eat up the less there are to prey upon the larvae of the beesthe cats are therefore the indirect helpers of the bees 2 coming back a step farther we may say that the old maids are also indirect friends of the humble bees and indirect enemies of the field mice as they keep the cats which eat up the latter this is an illustration somewhat beneath the dignity of the subject perhaps but it occurs to me in passing and with it i will conclude this lecture    footnote 1 i lay stress here on the practical signification of species whether a physiological test between species exist or not it is hardly ever applicable by the practical naturalist   footnote 2 the humble bees on the other hand are direct helpers of some plants such as the heartsease and red clover which are fertilized by the visits of the bees and they are indirect helpers of the numerous insects which are more or less completely supported by the heartsease and red clover
