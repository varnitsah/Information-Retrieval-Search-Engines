68183523	twice told tales                           night sketches                         beneath an umbrella                       by nathaniel hawthorne    pleasant is a rainy winters day within doors  the best study for such a day or the best amusementcall it which you willis a book of travels describing scenes the most unlike that  sombre one which is mistily presented through the windows i have experienced that fancy is then most successful in imparting distinct shapes and vivid colors to  the objects which the author has spread upon his page  and that his words become magic spells to summon up a  thousand varied pictures  strange landscapes glimmer through the familiar walls of the room and outlandish  figures thrust themselves almost within the sacred precincts of the hearth  small as my chamber is it has space enough to contain the oceanlike circumference  of an arabian desert its parched sands tracked by  the long line of a caravan with the camels patiently  journeying through the heavy sunshine though my ceiling be not lofty yet i can pile up the mountains of  central asia beneath it till their summits shine far above the clouds of the middle atmosphere  and with  my humble means a wealth that is not taxable i can transport hither the magnificent merchandise of an oriental bazaar and call a crowd of purchasers from distant countries to pay a fair profit for the precious articles which are displayed on all sides  true it is however that amid the bustle of traffic or whatever else may seem to be going on around me the raindrops will occasionally be heard to patter against my windowpanes which look forth upon one of the quietest streets in a new england town  after a time too the visions vanish and will not appear again at my bidding  then it being nightfall a gloomy sense of unreality depresses my spirits and impels me to venture out before the clock shall strike bedtime to satisfy myself that the world is not entirely made up of such shadowy materials as have busied me throughout the day  a dreamer may dwell so long among fantasies that the things without him will seem as unreal as those within  when eve has fairly set in therefore i sally forth tightly buttoning my shaggy overcoat and hoisting my umbrella the silken dome of which immediately resounds with the heavy drumming of the invisible raindrops  pausing on the lowest doorstep i contrast the warmth and cheerfulness of my deserted fireside with the drear obscurity and chill discomfort into which i am about to plunge  now come fearful auguries innumerable as the drops of rain  did not my manhood cry shame upon me i should turn back within doors resume my elbowchair my slippers and my book pass such an evening of sluggish enjoyment as the day has been and go to bed inglorious  the same shivering reluctance no doubt has quelled for a moment the adventurous spirit of many a traveller when his feet which were destined to measure the earth around were leaving their last tracks in the homepaths  in my own case poor human nature may be allowed a few misgivings  i look upward and discern no sky not even an unfathomable void but only a black impenetrable nothingness as though heaven and all its lights were blotted from the system of the universe  it is as if nature were dead and the world had put on black and the clouds were weeping for her  with their tears upon my cheek i turn my eyes earthward but find little consolation here below  a lamp is burning dimly at the distant corner and throws just enough of light along the street to show and exaggerate by so faintly showing the perils and difficulties which beset my path  yonder dingily white remnant of a huge snowbankwhich will yet cumber the sidewalk till the latter days of marchover or through that wintry waste must i stride onward  beyond lies a certain slough of despond a concoction of mud and liquid filth ankledeep legdeep neckdeepin a word of unknown bottom on which the lamplight does not even glimmer but which i have occasionally watched in the gradual growth of its horrors from morn till nightfall should i flounder into its depths farewell to upper earth  and hark how roughly resounds the roaring of a stream the turbulent career of which is partially reddened by the gleam of the lamp but elsewhere brawls noisily through the densest gloom  o should i be swept away in fording that impetuous and unclean torrent the coroner will have a job with an unfortunate gentleman who would fain end his troubles anywhere but in a mudpuddle  pshaw  i will linger not another instant at arms length from these dim terrors which grow more obscurely formidable the longer i delay to grapple with them  now for the onset  and to with little damage save a dash of rain in the fact and breast a splash of mud high up the pantaloons and the left boot full of icecold water behold me at the corner of the street  the lamp throws down a circle of red light around me and twinkling onward from corner to corner i discern other beacons marshalling my way to a brighter scene  but this is alone some and dreary spot the tall edifices bid gloomy defiance to the storm with their blinds all closed even as a man winks when he faces a spattering gust  how loudly tinkles the collected rain down the tin spouts the puffs of wind are boisterous and seem to assail me from various quarters at once  i have often observed that this corner is a haunt and loiteringplace for those winds which have no work to do upon the deep dashing ships against our ironbound shores nor in the forest tearing up the sylvan giants with half a rood of soil at their vast roots  here they amuse themselves with lesser freaks of mischief  see at this moment how they assail yonder poor woman who is passing just within the verge of the lamplight  one blast struggles for her umbrella and turns it wrong side outward another whisks the cape of her cloak across her eyes while a third takes most unwarrantable liberties with the lower part of her attire  happily the good dame is no gossamer but a figure of rotundity and fleshly substance else would these aerial tormentors whirl her aloft like a witch upon a broomstick and set her down doubtless in the filthiest kennel hereabout  from hence i tread upon firm pavements into the centre of the town here there is almost as brilliant an illumination as when some great victory has been won either on the battlefield or at the polls  two rows of shops with windows down nearly to the ground cast a glow from side to side while the black night hangs overhead like a canopy and thus keeps the splendor from diffusing itself away  the wet sidewalks gleam with a broad sheet of red light  the raindrops glitter as if the sky were pouring down rubies  the spouts gush with fire  methinks the scene is an emblem of the deceptive glare which mortals throw around their footsteps in the moral world thus bedazzling themselves till they forget the impenetrable obscurity that hems them in and that can be dispelled only by radiance from above and after all it is a cheerless scene and cheerless are the wanderers in it  here comes one who has so long been familiar with tempestuous weather that he takes the bluster of the storm for a friendly greeting as if it should say  how fare ye brother he is a retired seacaptain wrapped in some nameless garment of the peajacket order and is now laying his course towards the marine insurance office there to spin yarns of gale and shipwreck with a crew of old seadogs like himself  the blast will put in its word among their hoarse voices and be understood by all of them  next i meet an unhappy slipshod gentleman with a cloak flung hastily over his shoulders running a race with boisterous winds and striving to glide between the drops of rain  some domestic emergency or other has blown this miserable man from his warm fireside in quest of a doctor see that little vagabondhow carelessly he has taken his stand right underneath a spout while staring at some object of curiosity in a shopwindow  surely the rain is his native element he must have fallen with it from the clouds as frogs are supposed to do  here is a picture and a pretty one  a young man and a girl both enveloped in cloaks and huddled beneath the scanty protection of a cotton umbrella  she wears rubber overshoes but he is in his dancingpumps and they are on their way no doubt to sonic cotillonparty or subscriptionball at a dollar a head refreshments included  thus they struggle against the gloomy tempest lured onward by a vision of festal splendor but ah a most lamentable disaster bewildered by the red blue and yellow meteors in an apothecarys window they have stepped upon a slippery remnant of ice and are precipitated into a confluence of swollen floods at the corner of two streets luckless lovers  were it my nature to be other than a lookeron in life i would attempt your rescue  since that may not be i vow should you be drowned to weave such a pathetic story of your fate as shall call forth tears enough to drown you both anew do ye touch bottom my young friends  yes they emerge like a waternymph and a river deity and paddle hand in hand out of the depths of the dark pool  they hurry homeward dripping disconsolate abashed but with love too warm to be chilled by the cold water  they have stood a test which proves too strong for many  faithful though over head and ears in trouble  onward i go deriving a sympathetic joy or sorrow from the varied aspect of mortal affairs even as my figure catches a gleam from the lighted windows or is blackened by an interval of darkness not that mine is altogether a chameleon spirit with no hue of its own  now i pass into a more retired street where the dwellings of wealth and poverty are intermingled presenting a range of strongly contrasted pictures  here too may be found the golden mean  through yonder casement i discern a family circlethe grandmother the parents and the childrenall flickering shadowlike in the glow of a woodfire bluster fierce blast and beat thou wintry rain against the windowpanes  ye cannot damp the enjoyment of that fireside surely my fate is hard that i should be wandering homeless here taking to my bosom night and storm and solitude instead of wife and children peace murmurer  doubt not that darker guests are sitting round the hearth though the warm blaze hides all but blissful images  well here is still a brighter scene a stately mansion illuminated for a ball with cutglass chandeliers and alabaster lamps in every room and sunny landscapes hanging round the walls  see a coach has stopped whence emerges a slender beauty who canopied by two umbrellas glides within the portal and vanishes amid lightsome thrills of music  will she ever feel the nightwind and the rain perhapsperhaps  and will death and sorrow ever enter that proud mansion  as surely as the dancers will be gay within its halls tonight  such thoughts sadden yet satisfy my heart for they teach me that the poor man in his mean weatherbeaten hovel without a fire to cheer him may call the rich his brother brethren by sorrow who must be an inmate of both their householdsbrethren by death who will lead them both to other homes  onward still onward i plunge into the night  now have i reached the utmost limits of the town where the last lamp struggles feebly with the darkness like the farthest star that stands sentinel on the borders of uncreated space  it is strange what sensations of sublimity may spring from a very humble source  such are suggested by this hollow roar of a subterranean cataract where the mighty stream of a kennel precipitates itself beneath an iron grate and is seen no more on earth  listen awhile to its voice of mystery and fancy will magnify it till you start and smile at the illusion  and now another soundthe rumbling of wheelsas the mailcoach outward bound rolls heavily off the pavements and splashes through the mud and water of the road  all night long the poor passengers will be tossed to and fro between drowsy watch and troubled sleep and will dream of their own quiet beds and awake to find themselves still jolting onward  happier my lot who will straightway hie me to my familiar room and toast myself comfortably before the fire musing and fitfully dozing and fancying a strangeness in such sights as all may see  but first let me gaze at this solitary figure who comes hitherward with a tin lantern which throws the circular pattern of its punched holes on the ground about him he passes fearlessly into the unknown gloom whither i will not follow him  this figure shall supply me with a moral wherewith for lack of a more appropriate one i may wind up my sketch  he fears not to tread the dreary path before him because his lantern which was kindled at the fireside of his home will light him back to that same fireside again  and thus we nightwanderers through a stormy and dismal world if we bear the lamp of faith enkindled at a celestial fire it will surely lead us home to that heaven whence its radiance was borrowed
