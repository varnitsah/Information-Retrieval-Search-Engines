61997766	twixt land  sea tales     contents   a smile of fortune the secret sharer freya of the seven isles     a smile of fortuneharbour story     ever since the sun rose i had been looking ahead  the ship glided gently in smooth water  after a sixty days passage i was anxious to make my landfall a fertile and beautiful island of the tropics the more enthusiastic of its inhabitants delight in describing it as the pearl of the ocean  well let us call it the pearl its a good name  a pearl distilling much sweetness upon the world  this is only a way of telling you that firstrate sugarcane is grown there  all the population of the pearl lives for it and by it  sugar is their daily bread as it were  and i was coming to them for a cargo of sugar in the hope of the crop having been good and of the freights being high  mr burns my chief mate made out the land first and very soon i became entranced by this blue pinnacled apparition almost transparent against the light of the sky a mere emanation the astral body of an island risen to greet me from afar  it is a rare phenomenon such a sight of the pearl at sixty miles off  and i wondered half seriously whether it was a good omen whether what would meet me in that island would be as luckily exceptional as this beautiful dreamlike vision so very few seamen have been privileged to behold  but horrid thoughts of business interfered with my enjoyment of an accomplished passage  i was anxious for success and i wished too to do justice to the flattering latitude of my owners instructions contained in one noble phrase  we leave it to you to do the best you can with the ship    all the world being thus given me for a stage my abilities appeared to me no bigger than a pinhead  meantime the wind dropped and mr burns began to make disagreeable remarks about my usual bad luck  i believe it was his devotion for me which made him critically outspoken on every occasion  all the same i would not have put up with his humours if it had not been my lot at one time to nurse him through a desperate illness at sea after snatching him out of the jaws of death so to speak it would have been absurd to throw away such an efficient officer  but sometimes i wished he would dismiss himself  we were late in closing in with the land and had to anchor outside the harbour till next day  an unpleasant and unrestful night followed  in this roadstead strange to us both burns and i remained on deck almost all the time  clouds swirled down the porphyry crags under which we lay  the rising wind made a great bullying noise amongst the naked spars with interludes of sad moaning  i remarked that we had been in luck to fetch the anchorage before dark  it would have been a nasty anxious night to hang off a harbour under canvas  but my chief mate was uncompromising in his attitude  luck you call it sir  ayour usual luck  the sort of luck to thank god its no worse  and so he fretted through the dark hours while i drew on my fund of philosophy  ah but it was an exasperating weary endless night to be lying at anchor close under that black coast  the agitated water made snarling sounds all round the ship  at times a wild gust of wind out of a gully high up on the cliffs struck on our rigging a harsh and plaintive note like the wail of a forsaken soul    chapter i    by halfpast seven in the morning the ship being then inside the harbour at last and moored within a long stonesthrow from the quay my stock of philosophy was nearly exhausted  i was dressing hurriedly in my cabin when the steward came tripping in with a morning suit over his arm  hungry tired and depressed with my head engaged inside a white shirt irritatingly stuck together by too much starch i desired him peevishly to heave round with that breakfast  i wanted to get ashore as soon as possible  yes sir  ready at eight sir  theres a gentleman from the shore waiting to speak to you sir  this statement was curiously slurred over  i dragged the shirt violently over my head and emerged staring  so early i cried  whos he  what does he want  on coming in from sea one has to pick up the conditions of an utterly unrelated existence  every little event at first has the peculiar emphasis of novelty  i was greatly surprised by that early caller but there was no reason for my steward to look so particularly foolish  didnt you ask for the name i inquired in a stern tone  his names jacobus i believe he mumbled shamefacedly  mr jacobus i exclaimed loudly more surprised than ever but with a total change of feeling  why couldnt you say so at once  but the fellow had scuttled out of my room  through the momentarily opened door i had a glimpse of a tall stout man standing in the cuddy by the table on which the cloth was already laid a harbour tablecloth stainless and dazzlingly white  so far good  i shouted courteously through the closed door that i was dressing and would be with him in a moment  in return the assurance that there was no hurry reached me in the visitors deep quiet undertone  his time was my own  he dared say i would give him a cup of coffee presently  i am afraid you will have a poor breakfast i cried apologetically  we have been sixtyone days at sea you know  a quiet little laugh with a thatll be all right captain was his answer  all this words intonation the glimpsed attitude of the man in the cuddy had an unexpected character a something friendly in itpropitiatory  and my surprise was not diminished thereby  what did this call mean  was it the sign of some dark design against my commercial innocence  ah  these commercial interestsspoiling the finest life under the sun  why must the sea be used for tradeand for war as well  why kill and traffic on it pursuing selfish aims of no great importance after all  it would have been so much nicer just to sail about with here and there a port and a bit of land to stretch ones legs on buy a few books and get a change of cooking for a while  but living in a world more or less homicidal and desperately mercantile it was plainly my duty to make the best of its opportunities  my owners letter had left it to me as i have said before to do my best for the ship according to my own judgment  but it contained also a postscript worded somewhat as follows  without meaning to interfere with your liberty of action we are writing by the outgoing mail to some of our business friends there who may be of assistance to you  we desire you particularly to call on mr jacobus a prominent merchant and charterer  should you hit it off with him he may be able to put you in the way of profitable employment for the ship  hit it off  here was the prominent creature absolutely on board asking for the favour of a cup of coffee  and life not being a fairytale the improbability of the event almost shocked me  had i discovered an enchanted nook of the earth where wealthy merchants rush fasting on board ships before they are fairly moored  was this white magic or merely some black trick of trade  i came in the end while making the bow of my tie to suspect that perhaps i did not get the name right  i had been thinking of the prominent mr jacobus pretty frequently during the passage and my hearing might have been deceived by some remote similarity of sound   the steward might have said antrobusor maybe jackson  but coming out of my stateroom with an interrogative mr jacobus i was met by a quiet yes uttered with a gentle smile  the yes was rather perfunctory  he did not seem to make much of the fact that he was mr jacobus  i took stock of a big pale face hair thin on the top whiskers also thin of a faded nondescript colour heavy eyelids  the thick smooth lips in repose looked as if glued together  the smile was faint  a heavy tranquil man  i named my two officers who just then came down to breakfast but why mr burnss silent demeanour should suggest suppressed indignation i could not understand  while we were taking our seats round the table some disconnected words of an altercation going on in the companionway reached my ear  a stranger apparently wanted to come down to interview me and the steward was opposing him  you cant see him  why cant i  the captain is at breakfast i tell you  hell be going on shore presently and you can speak to him on deck  thats not fair  you let  ive had nothing to do with that  oh yes you have  everybody ought to have the same chance  you let that fellow  the rest i lost  the person having been repulsed successfully the steward came down  i cant say he looked flushedhe was a mulattobut he looked flustered  after putting the dishes on the table he remained by the sideboard with that lackadaisical air of indifference he used to assume when he had done something too clever by half and was afraid of getting into a scrape over it the contemptuous expression of mr burnss face as he looked from him to me was really extraordinary  i couldnt imagine what new bee had stung the mate now  the captain being silent nobody else cared to speak as is the way in ships  and i was saying nothing simply because i had been made dumb by the splendour of the entertainment  i had expected the usual seabreakfast whereas i beheld spread before us a veritable feast of shore provisions  eggs sausages butter which plainly did not come from a danish tin cutlets and even a dish of potatoes  it was three weeks since i had seen a real live potato i contemplated them with interest and mr jacobus disclosed himself as a man of human homely sympathies and something of a thoughtreader  try them captain he encouraged me in a friendly undertone they are excellent  they look that i admitted  grown on the island i suppose  oh no imported  those grown here would be more expensive  i was grieved at the ineptitude of the conversation  were these the topics for a prominent and wealthy merchant to discuss  i thought the simplicity with which he made himself at home rather attractive but what is one to talk about to a man who comes on one suddenly after sixtyone days at sea out of a totally unknown little town in an island one has never seen before  what were besides sugar the interests of that crumb of the earth its gossip its topics of conversation  to draw him on business at once would have been almost indecentor even worse  impolitic all i could do at the moment was to keep on in the old groove  are the provisions generally dear here i asked fretting inwardly at my inanity  i wouldnt say that he answered placidly with that appearance of saving his breath his restrained manner of speaking suggested  he would not be more explicit yet he did not evade the subject eyeing the table in a spirit of complete abstemiousness he wouldnt let me help him to any eatables he went into details of supply  the beef was for the most part imported from madagascar mutton of course was rare and somewhat expensive but good goats flesh  are these goats cutlets i exclaimed hastily pointing at one of the dishes  posed sentimentally by the sideboard the steward gave a start  lor no sir  its real mutton  mr burns got through his breakfast impatiently as if exasperated by being made a party to some monstrous foolishness muttered a curt excuse and went on deck  shortly afterwards the second mate took his smooth red countenance out of the cabin  with the appetite of a schoolboy and after two months of seafare he appreciated the generous spread  but i did not  it smacked of extravagance  all the same it was a remarkable feat to have produced it so quickly and i congratulated the steward on his smartness in a somewhat ominous tone  he gave me a deprecatory smile and in a way i didnt know what to make of blinked his fine dark eyes in the direction of the guest  the latter asked under his breath for another cup of coffee and nibbled ascetically at a piece of very hard ships biscuit  i dont think he consumed a square inch in the end but meantime he gave me casually as it were a complete account of the sugar crop of the local business houses of the state of the freight market all that talk was interspersed with hints as to personalities amounting to veiled warnings but his pale fleshy face remained equable without a gleam as if ignorant of his voice  as you may imagine i opened my ears very wide  every word was precious  my ideas as to the value of business friendship were being favourably modified  he gave me the names of all the disponible ships together with their tonnage and the names of their commanders from that which was still commercial information he condescended to mere harbour gossip  the hilda had unaccountably lost her figurehead in the bay of bengal and her captain was greatly affected by this  he and the ship had been getting on in years together and the old gentleman imagined this strange event to be the forerunner of his own early dissolution  the stella had experienced awful weather off the capehad her decks swept and the chief officer washed overboard  and only a few hours before reaching port the baby died  poor captain h and his wife were terribly cut up  if they had only been able to bring it into port alive it could have been probably saved but the wind failed them for the last week or so light breezes and    the baby was going to be buried this afternoon  he supposed i would attend  do you think i ought to i asked shrinkingly  he thought so decidedly  it would be greatly appreciated  all the captains in the harbour were going to attend  poor mrs h was quite prostrated  pretty hard on h altogether  and you captainyou are not married i suppose  no i am not married i said  neither married nor even engaged  mentally i thanked my stars and while he smiled in a musing dreamy fashion i expressed my acknowledgments for his visit and for the interesting business information he had been good enough to impart to me  but i said nothing of my wonder thereat  of course i would have made a point of calling on you in a day or two i concluded  he raised his eyelids distinctly at me and somehow managed to look rather more sleepy than before  in accordance with my owners instructions i explained  you have had their letter of course  by that time he had raised his eyebrows too but without any particular emotion  on the contrary he struck me then as absolutely imperturbable  oh  you must be thinking of my brother  it was for me then to say oh  but i hope that no more than civil surprise appeared in my voice when i asked him to what then i owed the pleasure    he was reaching for an inside pocket leisurely  my brothers a very different person  but i am well known in this part of the world  youve probably heard  i took a card he extended to me  a thick business card as i lived  alfred jacobusthe other was ernestdealer in every description of ships stores  provisions salt and fresh oils paints rope canvas etc etc  ships in harbour victualled by contract on moderate terms  ive never heard of you i said brusquely  his lowpitched assurance did not abandon him  you will be very well satisfied he breathed out quietly  i was not placated  i had the sense of having been circumvented somehow  yet i had deceived myselfif there was any deception but the confounded cheek of inviting himself to breakfast was enough to deceive any one  and the thought struck me  why  the fellow had provided all these eatables himself in the way of business  i said  you must have got up mighty early this morning  he admitted with simplicity that he was on the quay before six oclock waiting for my ship to come in  he gave me the impression that it would be impossible to get rid of him now  if you think we are going to live on that scale i said looking at the table with an irritated eye you are jolly well mistaken  youll find it all right captain  i quite understand  nothing could disturb his equanimity  i felt dissatisfied but i could not very well fly out at him  he had told me many useful thingsand besides he was the brother of that wealthy merchant that seemed queer enough  i rose and told him curtly that i must now go ashore  at once he offered the use of his boat for all the time of my stay in port  i only make a nominal charge he continued equably  my man remains all day at the landingsteps  you have only to blow a whistle when you want the boat  and standing aside at every doorway to let me go through first he carried me off in his custody after all  as we crossed the quarterdeck two shabby individuals stepped forward and in mournful silence offered me business cards which i took from them without a word under his heavy eye  it was a useless and gloomy ceremony they were the touts of the other shipchandlers and he placid at my back ignored their existence  we parted on the quay after he had expressed quietly the hope of seeing me often at the store  he had a smokingroom for captains there with newspapers and a box of rather decent cigars  i left him very unceremoniously  my consignees received me with the usual business heartiness but their account of the state of the freightmarket was by no means so favourable as the talk of the wrong jacobus had led me to expect naturally i became inclined now to put my trust in his version rather  as i closed the door of the private office behind me i thought to myself  hm  a lot of lies  commercial diplomacy thats the sort of thing a man coming from sea has got to expect they would try to charter the ship under the market rate  in the big outer room full of desks the chief clerk a tall lean shaved person in immaculate white clothes and with a shiny closelycropped black head on which silvery gleams came and went rose from his place and detained me affably  anything they could do for me they would be most happy  was i likely to call again in the afternoon  what  going to a funeral  oh yes poor captain h  he pulled a long sympathetic face for a moment then dismissing from this workaday world the baby which had got ill in a tempest and had died from too much calm at sea he asked me with a dental sharklike smileif sharks had false teethwhether i had yet made my little arrangements for the ships stay in port  yes with jacobus i answered carelessly  i understand hes the brother of mr ernest jacobus to whom i have an introduction from my owners  i was not sorry to let him know i was not altogether helpless in the hands of his firm  he screwed his thin lips dubiously  why i cried isnt he the brother  oh yes    they havent spoken to each other for eighteen years he added impressively after a pause  indeed  whats the quarrel about  oh nothing  nothing that one would care to mention he protested primly  hes got quite a large business  the best shipchandler here without a doubt  business is all very well but there is such a thing as personal character too isnt there goodmorning captain  he went away mincingly to his desk  he amused me  he resembled an old maid a commercial old maid shocked by some impropriety  was it a commercial impropriety  commercial impropriety is a serious matter for it aims at ones pocket  or was he only a purist in conduct who disapproved of jacobus doing his own touting  it was certainly undignified  i wondered how the merchant brother liked it  but then different countries different customs  in a community so isolated and so exclusively trading social standards have their own scale    chapter ii    i would have gladly dispensed with the mournful opportunity of becoming acquainted by sight with all my fellowcaptains at once however i found my way to the cemetery  we made a considerable group of bareheaded men in sombre garments  i noticed that those of our company most approaching to the now obsolete seadog type were the most movedperhaps because they had less manner than the new generation  the old seadog away from his natural element was a simple and sentimental animal  i noticed onehe was facing me across the gravewho was dropping tears  they trickled down his weatherbeaten face like drops of rain on an old rugged wall  i learned afterwards that he was looked upon as the terror of sailors a hard man that he had never had wife or chick of his own and that engaged from his tenderest years in deepsea voyages he knew women and children merely by sight  perhaps he was dropping those tears over his lost opportunities from sheer envy of paternity and in strange jealousy of a sorrow which he could never know  man and even the seaman is a capricious animal the creature and the victim of lost opportunities  but he made me feel ashamed of my callousness  i had no tears  i listened with horribly critical detachment to that service i had had to read myself once or twice over childlike men who had died at sea  the words of hope and defiance the winged words so inspiring in the free immensity of water and sky seemed to fall wearily into the little grave  what was the use of asking death where her sting was before that small dark hole in the ground and then my thoughts escaped me altogetheraway into matters of lifeand no very high matters at thatships freights business in the instability of his emotions man resembles deplorably a monkey  i was disgusted with my thoughtsand i thought  shall i be able to get a charter soon  times money    will that jacobus really put good business in my way  i must go and see him in a day or two  dont imagine that i pursued these thoughts with any precision they pursued me rather  vague shadowy restless shamefaced theirs was a callous abominable almost revolting pertinacity and it was the presence of that pertinacious shipchandler which had started them  he stood mournfully amongst our little band of men from the sea and i was angry at his presence which suggesting his brother the merchant had caused me to become outrageous to myself  for indeed i had preserved some decency of feeling  it was only the mind which  it was over at last  the poor fathera man of forty with black bushy sidewhiskers and a pathetic gash on his freshlyshaved chin thanked us all swallowing his tears  but for some reason either because i lingered at the gate of the cemetery being somewhat hazy as to my way back or because i was the youngest or ascribing my moodiness caused by remorse to some more worthy and appropriate sentiment or simply because i was even more of a stranger to him than the othershe singled me out  keeping at my side he renewed his thanks which i listened to in a gloomy consciencestricken silence  suddenly he slipped one hand under my arm and waved the other after a tall stout figure walking away by itself down a street in a flutter of thin grey garments  thats a good fellowa real good fellowhe swallowed down a belated sobthis jacobus  and he told me in a low voice that jacobus was the first man to board his ship on arrival and learning of their misfortune had taken charge of everything volunteered to attend to all routine business carried off the ships papers on shore arranged for the funeral  a good fellow  i was knocked over  i had been looking at my wife for ten days  and helpless  just you think of that  the dear little chap died the very day we made the land  how i managed to take the ship in god alone knows  i couldnt see anything i couldnt speak i couldnt    youve heard perhaps that we lost our mate overboard on the passage  there was no one to do it for me  and the poor woman nearly crazy down below there all alone with the    by the lord  it isnt fair  we walked in silence together  i did not know how to part from him  on the quay he let go my arm and struck fiercely his fist into the palm of his other hand  by god it isnt fair he cried again  dont you ever marry unless you can chuck the sea first    it isnt fair  i had no intention to chuck the sea and when he left me to go aboard his ship i felt convinced that i would never marry  while i was waiting at the steps for jacobuss boatman who had gone off somewhere the captain of the hilda joined me a slender silk umbrella in his hand and the sharp points of his archaic gladstonian shirtcollar framing a small cleanshaved ruddy face it was wonderfully fresh for his age beautifully modelled and lit up by remarkably clear blue eyes  a lot of white hair glossy like spun glass curled upwards slightly under the brim of his valuable ancient panama hat with a broad black ribbon  in the aspect of that vivacious neat little old man there was something quaintly angelic and also boyish  he accosted me as though he had been in the habit of seeing me every day of his life from my earliest childhood with a whimsical remark on the appearance of a stout negro woman who was sitting upon a stool near the edge of the quay  presently he observed amiably that i had a very pretty little barque  i returned this civil speech by saying readily  not so pretty as the hilda  at once the corners of his clearcut sensitive mouth dropped dismally  oh dear  i can hardly bear to look at her now  did i know he asked anxiously that he had lost the figurehead of his ship a woman in a blue tunic edged with gold the face perhaps not so very very pretty but her bare white arms beautifully shaped and extended as if she were swimming  did i  who would have expected such a things    after twenty years too  nobody could have guessed from his tone that the woman was made of wood his trembling voice his agitated manner gave to his lamentations a ludicrously scandalous flavour    disappeared at nighta clear fine night with just a slight swellin the gulf of bengal  went off without a splash no one in the ship could tell why how at what hourafter twenty years last october    did i ever hear     i assured him sympathetically that i had never heardand he became very doleful  this meant no good he was sure  there was something in it which looked like a warning  but when i remarked that surely another figure of a woman could be procured i found myself being soundly rated for my levity  the old boy flushed pink under his clear tan as if i had proposed something improper  one could replace masts i was told or a lost rudderany working part of a ship but where was the use of sticking up a new figurehead  what satisfaction  how could one care for it  it was easy to see that i had never been shipmates with a figurehead for over twenty years  a new figurehead he scolded in unquenchable indignation  why ive been a widower now for eightandtwenty years come next may and i would just as soon think of getting a new wife  youre as bad as that fellow jacobus  i was highly amused  what has jacobus done  did he want you to marry again captain i inquired in a deferential tone  but he was launched now and only grinned fiercely  procureindeed  hes the sort of chap to procure you anything you like for a price  i hadnt been moored here for an hour when he got on board and at once offered to sell me a figurehead he happens to have in his yard somewhere  he got smith my mate to talk to me about it  mr smith says i dont you know me better than that  am i the sort that would pick up with another mans castoff figurehead  and after all these years too  the way some of you young fellows talk  i affected great compunction and as i stepped into the boat i said soberly  then i see nothing for it but to fit in a neat fiddlehead perhaps  you know carved scrollwork nicely gilt  he became very dejected after his outburst  yes  scrollwork  maybe  jacobus hinted at that too  hes never at a loss when theres any money to be extracted from a sailorman he would make me pay through the nose for that carving  a gilt fiddlehead did you sayeh  i dare say it would do for you  you young fellows dont seem to have any feeling for whats proper  he made a convulsive gesture with his right arm  never mind  nothing can make much difference  i would just as soon let the old thing go about the world with a bare cutwater he cried sadly  then as the boat got away from the steps he raised his voice on the edge of the quay with comical animosity  i would  if only to spite that figureheadprocuring bloodsucker i am an old bird here and dont you forget it  come and see me on board some day  i spent my first evening in port quietly in my ships cuddy and glad enough was i to think that the shore life which strikes one as so pettily complex discordant and so full of new faces on first coming from sea could be kept off for a few hours longer  i was however fated to hear the jacobus note once more before i slept  mr burns had gone ashore after the evening meal to have as he said a look round  as it was quite dark when he announced his intention i didnt ask him what it was he expected to see  some time about midnight while sitting with a book in the saloon i heard cautious movements in the lobby and hailed him by name  burns came in stick and hat in hand incredibly vulgarised by his smart shore togs with a jaunty air and an odious twinkle in his eye  being asked to sit down he laid his hat and stick on the table and after we had talked of ship affairs for a little while  ive been hearing pretty tales on shore about that shipchandler fellow who snatched the job from you so neatly sir  i remonstrated with my late patient for his manner of expressing himself  but he only tossed his head disdainfully  a pretty dodge indeed  boarding a strange ship with breakfast in two baskets for all hands and calmly inviting himself to the captains table never heard of anything so crafty and so impudent in his life  i found myself defending jacobuss unusual methods  hes the brother of one of the wealthiest merchants in the port the mates eyes fairly snapped green sparks  his grand brother hasnt spoken to him for eighteen or twenty years he declared triumphantly  so there  i know all about that i interrupted loftily  do you sir  hm  his mind was still running on the ethics of commercial competition  i dont like to see your good nature taken advantage of  hes bribed that steward of ours with a five rupee note to let him come downor ten for that matter  he dont care  he will shove that and more into the bill presently  is that one of the tales you have heard ashore i asked  he assured me that his own sense could tell him that much  no what he had heard on shore was that no respectable person in the whole town would come near jacobus  he lived in a large old fashioned house in one of the quiet streets with a big garden after telling me this burns put on a mysterious air  he keeps a girl shut up there who they say  i suppose youve heard all this gossip in some eminently respectable place i snapped at him in a most sarcastic tone  the shaft told because mr burns like many other disagreeable people was very sensitive himself  he remained as if thunderstruck with his mouth open for some further communication but i did not give him the chance  and anyhow what the deuce do i care i added retiring into my room  and this was a natural thing to say  yet somehow i was not indifferent  i admit it is absurd to be concerned with the morals of ones shipchandler if ever so well connected but his personality had stamped itself upon my first day in harbour in the way you know  after this initial exploit jacobus showed himself anything but intrusive  he was out in a boat early every morning going round the ships he served and occasionally remaining on board one of them for breakfast with the captain  as i discovered that this practice was generally accepted i just nodded to him familiarly when one morning on coming out of my room i found him in the cabin  glancing over the table i saw that his place was already laid  he stood awaiting my appearance very bulky and placid holding a beautiful bunch of flowers in his thick hand  he offered them to my notice with a faint sleepy smile from his own garden had a very fine old garden picked them himself that morning before going out to business thought i would like    he turned away  steward can you oblige me with some water in a large jar please  i assured him jocularly as i took my place at the table that he made me feel as if i were a pretty girl and that he mustnt be surprised if i blushed  but he was busy arranging his floral tribute at the sideboard  stand it before the captains plate steward please  he made this request in his usual undertone  the offering was so pointed that i could do no less than to raise it to my nose and as he sat down noiselessly he breathed out the opinion that a few flowers improved notably the appearance of a ships saloon  he wondered why i did not have a shelf fitted all round the skylight for flowers in pots to take with me to sea  he had a skilled workman able to fit up shelves in a day and he could procure me two or three dozen good plants  the tips of his thick round fingers rested composedly on the edge of the table on each side of his cup of coffee  his face remained immovable  mr burns was smiling maliciously to himself  i declared that i hadnt the slightest intention of turning my skylight into a conservatory only to keep the cabintable in a perpetual mess of mould and dead vegetable matter  rear most beautiful flowers he insisted with an upward glance its no trouble really  oh yes it is  lots of trouble i contradicted  and in the end some fool leaves the skylight open in a fresh breeze a flick of salt water gets at them and the whole lot is dead in a week  mr burns snorted a contemptuous approval  jacobus gave up the subject passively  after a time he unglued his thick lips to ask me if i had seen his brother yet  i was very curt in my answer  no not yet  a very different person he remarked dreamily and got up  his movements were particularly noiseless  wellthank you captain if anything is not to your liking please mention it to your steward  i suppose you will be giving a dinner to the office clerks presently  what for i cried with some warmth  if i were a steady trader to the port i could understand it  but a complete stranger    i may not turn up again here for years  i dont see why    do you mean to say it is customary  it will be expected from a man like you he breathed out placidly  eight of the principal clerks the manager thats nine you three gentlemen thats twelve  it neednt be very expensive  if you tell your steward to give me a days notice  it will be expected of me  why should it be expected of me  is it because i look particularly softor what  his immobility struck me as dignified suddenly his imperturbable quality as dangerous  theres plenty of time to think about that i concluded weakly with a gesture that tried to wave him away  but before he departed he took time to mention regretfully that he had not yet had the pleasure of seeing me at his store to sample those cigars  he had a parcel of six thousand to dispose of very cheap  i think it would be worth your while to secure some he added with a fat melancholy smile and left the cabin  mr burns struck his fist on the table excitedly  did you ever see such impudence  hes made up his mind to get something out of you one way or another sir  at once feeling inclined to defend jacobus i observed philosophically that all this was business i supposed  but my absurd mate muttering broken disjointed sentences such as  i cannot bear    mark my words    and so on flung out of the cabin  if i hadnt nursed him through that deadly fever i wouldnt have suffered such manners for a single day    chapter iii    jacobus having put me in mind of his wealthy brother i concluded i would pay that business call at once  i had by that time heard a little more of him  he was a member of the council where he made himself objectionable to the authorities  he exercised a considerable influence on public opinion  lots of people owed him money  he was an importer on a great scale of all sorts of goods for instance the whole supply of bags for sugar was practically in his hands  this last fact i did not learn till afterwards  the general impression conveyed to me was that of a local personage he was a bachelor and gave weekly cardparties in his house out of town which were attended by the best people in the colony  the greater then was my surprise to discover his office in shabby surroundings quite away from the business quarter amongst a lot of hovels  guided by a black board with white lettering i climbed a narrow wooden staircase and entered a room with a bare floor of planks littered with bits of brown paper and wisps of packing straw  a great number of what looked like winecases were piled up against one of the walls  a lanky inky lightyellow mulatto youth miserably longnecked and generally recalling a sick chicken got off a threelegged stool behind a cheap deal desk and faced me as if gone dumb with fright  i had some difficulty in persuading him to take in my name though i could not get from him the nature of his objection  he did it at last with an almost agonised reluctance which ceased to be mysterious to me when i heard him being sworn at menacingly with savage suppressed growls then audibly cuffed and finally kicked out without any concealment whatever because he came back flying head foremost through the door with a stifled shriek  to say i was startled would not express it  i remained still like a man lost in a dream  clapping both his hands to that part of his frail anatomy which had received the shock the poor wretch said to me simply  will you go in please  his lamentable selfpossession was wonderful but it did not do away with the incredibility of the experience  a preposterous notion that i had seen this boy somewhere before a thing obviously impossible was like a delicate finishing touch of weirdness added to a scene fit to raise doubts as to ones sanity  i stared anxiously about me like an awakened somnambulist  i say i cried loudly there isnt a mistake is there  this is mr jacobuss office  the boy gazed at me with a pained expressionand somehow so familiar  a voice within growled offensively  come in come in since you are there    i didnt know  i crossed the outer room as one approaches the den of some unknown wild beast with intrepidity but in some excitement  only no wild beast that ever lived would rouse ones indignation the power to do that belongs to the odiousness of the human brute  and i was very indignant which did not prevent me from being at once struck by the extraordinary resemblance of the two brothers  this one was dark instead of being fair like the other but he was as big  he was without his coat and waistcoat he had been doubtless snoozing in the rockingchair which stood in a corner furthest from the window  above the great bulk of his crumpled white shirt buttoned with three diamond studs his round face looked swarthy  it was moist his brown moustache hung limp and ragged  he pushed a common canebottomed chair towards me with his foot  sit down  i glanced at it casually then turning my indignant eyes full upon him i declared in precise and incisive tones that i had called in obedience to my owners instructions  oh  yes  hm  i didnt understand what that fool was saying    but never mind  it will teach the scoundrel to disturb me at this time of the day he added grinning at me with savage cynicism  i looked at my watch  it was past three oclockquite the full swing of afternoon office work in the port  he snarled imperiously  sit down captain  i acknowledged the gracious invitation by saying deliberately  i can listen to all you may have to say without sitting down  emitting a loud and vehement pshaw he glared for a moment very roundeyed and fierce  it was like a gigantic tomcat spitting at one suddenly  look at him    what do you fancy yourself to be  what did you come here for  if you wont sit down and talk business you had better go to the devil  i dont know him personally i said  but after this i wouldnt mind calling on him  it would be refreshing to meet a gentleman  he followed me growling behind my back  the impudence  ive a good mind to write to your owners what i think of you  i turned on him for a moment  as it happens i dont care  for my part i assure you i wont even take the trouble to mention you to them  he stopped at the door of his office while i traversed the littered anteroom  i think he was somewhat taken aback  i will break every bone in your body he roared suddenly at the miserable mulatto lad if you ever dare to disturb me before half past three for anybody  dye hear  for anybody    let alone any damned skipper he added in a lower growl  the frail youngster swaying like a reed made a low moaning sound i stopped short and addressed this sufferer with advice  it was prompted by the sight of a hammer used for opening the winecases i suppose which was lying on the floor  if i were you my boy i would have that thing up my sleeve when i went in next and at the first occasion i would  what was there so familiar in that lads yellow face  entrenched and quaking behind the flimsy desk he never looked up  his heavy lowered eyelids gave me suddenly the clue of the puzzle  he resembledyes those thick glued lipshe resembled the brothers jacobus  he resembled both the wealthy merchant and the pushing shopkeeper who resembled each other he resembled them as much as a thin lightyellow mulatto lad may resemble a big stout middle aged white man  it was the exotic complexion and the slightness of his build which had put me off so completely  now i saw in him unmistakably the jacobus strain weakened attenuated diluted as it were in a bucket of waterand i refrained from finishing my speech  i had intended to say  crack this brutes head for him i still felt the conclusion to be sound  but it is no trifling responsibility to counsel parricide to any one however deeply injured  beggarlycheekyskippers  i despised the emphatic growl at my back only being much vexed and upset i regret to say that i slammed the door behind me in a most undignified manner  it may not appear altogether absurd if i say that i brought out from that interview a kindlier view of the other jacobus  it was with a feeling resembling partisanship that a few days later i called at his store  that long cavernlike place of business very dim at the back and stuffed full of all sorts of goods was entered from the street by a lofty archway  at the far end i saw my jacobus exerting himself in his shirtsleeves among his assistants  the captains room was a small vaulted apartment with a stone floor and heavy iron bars in its windows like a dungeon converted to hospitable purposes  a couple of cheerful bottles and several gleaming glasses made a brilliant cluster round a tall cool red earthenware pitcher on the centre table which was littered with newspapers from all parts of the world  a wellgroomed stranger in a smart grey check suit sitting with one leg flung over his knee put down one of these sheets briskly and nodded to me  i guessed him to be a steamercaptain  it was impossible to get to know these men  they came and went too quickly and their ships lay moored far out at the very entrance of the harbour  theirs was another life altogether  he yawned slightly  dull hole isnt it  i understood this to allude to the town  do you find it so i murmured  dont you  but im off tomorrow thank goodness  he was a very gentlemanly person goodnatured and superior  i watched him draw the open box of cigars to his side of the table take a big cigarcase out of his pocket and begin to fill it very methodically  presently on our eyes meeting he winked like a common mortal and invited me to follow his example  they are really decent smokes  i shook my head  i am not off tomorrow  what of that  think i am abusing old jacobuss hospitality heavens  it goes into the bill of course  he spreads such little matters all over his account  he can take care of himself  why its business  i noted a shadow fall over his wellsatisfied expression a momentary hesitation in closing his cigarcase  but he ended by putting it in his pocket jauntily  a placid voice uttered in the doorway  thats quite correct captain  the large noiseless jacobus advanced into the room  his quietness in the circumstances amounted to cordiality  he had put on his jacket before joining us and he sat down in the chair vacated by the steamerman who nodded again to me and went out with a short jarring laugh  a profound silence reigned  with his drowsy stare jacobus seemed to be slumbering openeyed  yet somehow i was aware of being profoundly scrutinised by those heavy eyes  in the enormous cavern of the store somebody began to nail down a case expertly  taptap    taptaptap  two other experts one slow and nasal the other shrill and snappy started checking an invoice  a halfcoil of threeinch manilla rope  right  six assorted shackles  right  six tins assorted soups three of pate two asparagus fourteen pounds tobacco cabin  right  its for the captain who was here just now breathed out the immovable jacobus  these steamer orders are very small  they pick up what they want as they go along  that man will be in samarang in less than a fortnight  very small orders indeed  the calling over of the items went on in the shop an extraordinary jumble of varied articles paintbrushes yorkshire relish etc etc    three sacks of best potatoes read out the nasal voice  at this jacobus blinked like a sleeping man roused by a shake and displayed some animation  at his order shouted into the shop a smirking halfcaste clerk with his ringlets much oiled and with a pen stuck behind his ear brought in a sample of six potatoes which he paraded in a row on the table  being urged to look at their beauty i gave them a cold and hostile glance  calmly jacobus proposed that i should order ten or fifteen tonstons  i couldnt believe my ears  my crew could not have eaten such a lot in a year and potatoes excuse these practical remarks are a highly perishable commodity  i thought he was jokingor else trying to find out whether i was an unutterable idiot  but his purpose was not so simple  i discovered that he meant me to buy them on my own account  i am proposing you a bit of business captain  i wouldnt charge you a great price  i told him that i did not go in for trade  i even added grimly that i knew only too well how that sort of spec generally ended  he sighed and clasped his hands on his stomach with exemplary resignation  i admired the placidity of his impudence  then waking up somewhat  wont you try a cigar captain  no thanks  i dont smoke cigars  for once he exclaimed in a patient whisper  a melancholy silence ensued  you know how sometimes a person discloses a certain unsuspected depth and acuteness of thought that is in other words utters something unexpected  it was unexpected enough to hear jacobus say  the man who just went out was right enough  you might take one captain  here everything is bound to be in the way of business  i felt a little ashamed of myself  the remembrance of his horrid brother made him appear quite a decent sort of fellow  it was with some compunction that i said a few words to the effect that i could have no possible objection to his hospitality  before i was a minute older i saw where this admission was leading me  as if changing the subject jacobus mentioned that his private house was about ten minutes walk away  it had a beautiful old walled garden  something really remarkable  i ought to come round some day and have a look at it  he seemed to be a lover of gardens  i too take extreme delight in them but i did not mean my compunction to carry me as far as jacobuss flowerbeds however beautiful and old  he added with a certain homeliness of tone  theres only my girl there  it is difficult to set everything down in due order so i must revert here to what happened a week or two before  the medical officer of the port had come on board my ship to have a look at one of my crew who was ailing and naturally enough he was asked to step into the cabin  a fellowshipmaster of mine was there too and in the conversation somehow or other the name of jacobus came to be mentioned  it was pronounced with no particular reverence by the other man i believe  i dont remember now what i was going to say  the doctora pleasant cultivated fellow with an assured mannerprevented me by striking in in a sour tone  ah  youre talking about my respected papainlaw  of course that sally silenced us at the time  but i remembered the episode and at this juncture pushed for something noncommittal to say i inquired with polite surprise  you have your married daughter living with you mr jacobus  he moved his big hand from right to left quietly  no  that was another of his girls he stated ponderously and under his breath as usual  she    he seemed in a pause to be ransacking his mind for some kind of descriptive phrase  but my hopes were disappointed  he merely produced his stereotyped definition  shes a very different sort of person  indeed    and by the by jacobus i called on your brother the other day  its no great compliment if i say that i found him a very different sort of person from you  he had an air of profound reflection then remarked quaintly  hes a man of regular habits  he might have been alluding to the habit of late siesta but i mumbled something about beastly habits anyhowand left the store abruptly    chapter iv    my little passage with jacobus the merchant became known generally one or two of my acquaintances made distant allusions to it perhaps the mulatto boy had talked  i must confess that people appeared rather scandalised but not with jacobuss brutality  a man i knew remonstrated with me for my hastiness  i gave him the whole story of my visit not forgetting the tell tale resemblance of the wretched mulatto boy to his tormentor  he was not surprised  no doubt no doubt  what of that  in a jovial tone he assured me that there must be many of that sort  the elder jacobus had been a bachelor all his life  a highly respectable bachelor  but there had never been open scandal in that connection  his life had been quite regular  it could cause no offence to any one  i said that i had been offended considerably  my interlocutor opened very wide eyes  why  because a mulatto lad got a few knocks  that was not a great affair surely  i had no idea how insolent and untruthful these halfcastes were  in fact he seemed to think mr jacobus rather kind than otherwise to employ that youth at all a sort of amiable weakness which could be forgiven  this acquaintance of mine belonged to one of the old french families descendants of the old colonists all noble all impoverished and living a narrow domestic life in dull dignified decay  the men as a rule occupy inferior posts in government offices or in business houses  the girls are almost always pretty ignorant of the world kind and agreeable and generally bilingual they prattle innocently both in french and english  the emptiness of their existence passes belief  i obtained my entry into a couple of such households because some years before in bombay i had occasion to be of use to a pleasant ineffectual young man who was rather stranded there not knowing what to do with himself or even how to get home to his island again  it was a matter of two hundred rupees or so but when i turned up the family made a point of showing their gratitude by admitting me to their intimacy  my knowledge of the french language made me specially acceptable  they had meantime managed to marry the fellow to a woman nearly twice his age comparatively well off  the only profession he was really fit for  but it was not all cakes and ale  the first time i called on the couple she spied a little spot of grease on the poor devils pantaloons and made him a screaming scene of reproaches so full of sincere passion that i sat terrified as at a tragedy of racine  of course there was never question of the money i had advanced him but his sisters miss angele and miss mary and the aunts of both families who spoke quaint archaic french of prerevolution period and a host of distant relations adopted me for a friend outright in a manner which was almost embarrassing  it was with the eldest brother he was employed at a desk in my consignees office that i was having this talk about the merchant jacobus  he regretted my attitude and nodded his head sagely  an influential man  one never knew when one would need him  i expressed my immense preference for the shopkeeper of the two  at that my friend looked grave  what on earth are you pulling that long face about i cried impatiently  he asked me to see his garden and i have a good mind to go some day  dont do that he said so earnestly that i burst into a fit of laughter but he looked at me without a smile  this was another matter altogether  at one time the public conscience of the island had been mightily troubled by my jacobus the two brothers had been partners for years in great harmony when a wandering circus came to the island and my jacobus became suddenly infatuated with one of the ladyriders  what made it worse was that he was married  he had not even the grace to conceal his passion  it must have been strong indeed to carry away such a large placid creature  his behaviour was perfectly scandalous  he followed that woman to the cape and apparently travelled at the tail of that beastly circus to other parts of the world in a most degrading position  the woman soon ceased to care for him and treated him worse than a dog  most extraordinary stories of moral degradation were reaching the island at that time he had not the strength of mind to shake himself free     the grotesque image of a fat pushing shipchandler enslaved by an unholy lovespell fascinated me and i listened rather open mouthed to the tale as old as the world a tale which had been the subject of legend of moral fables of poems but which so ludicrously failed to fit the personality  what a strange victim for the gods  meantime his deserted wife had died  his daughter was taken care of by his brother who married her as advantageously as was possible in the circumstances  oh  the mrs doctor i exclaimed  you know that  yes  a very able man  he wanted a lift in the world and there was a good bit of money from her mother besides the expectations   of course they dont know him he added the doctor nods in the street i believe but he avoids speaking to him when they meet on board a ship as must happen sometimes  i remarked that this surely was an old story by now  my friend assented  but it was jacobuss own fault that it was neither forgiven nor forgotten  he came back ultimately  but how not in a spirit of contrition in a way to propitiate his scandalised fellowcitizens  he must needs drag along with him a childa girl     he spoke to me of a daughter who lives with him i observed very much interested  shes certainly the daughter of the circuswoman said my friend she may be his daughter too i am willing to admit that she is in fact i have no doubt  but he did not see why she should have been brought into a respectable community to perpetuate the memory of the scandal  and that was not the worst  presently something much more distressing happened  that abandoned woman turned up  landed from a mail boat     what  here  to claim the child perhaps i suggested  not she  my friendly informant was very scornful  imagine a painted haggard agitated desperate hag  been cast off in mozambique by somebody who paid her passage here  she had been injured internally by a kick from a horse she hadnt a cent on her when she got ashore i dont think she even asked to see the child at any rate not till the last day of her life  jacobus hired for her a bungalow to die in  he got a couple of sisters from the hospital to nurse her through these few months  if he didnt marry her in extremis as the good sisters tried to bring about its because she wouldnt even hear of it  as the nuns said  the woman died impenitent  it was reported that she ordered jacobus out of the room with her last breath  this may be the real reason why he didnt go into mourning himself he only put the child into black  while she was little she was to be seen sometimes about the streets attended by a negro woman but since she became of age to put her hair up i dont think she has set foot outside that garden once  she must be over eighteen now  thus my friend with some added details such as that he didnt think the girl had spoken to three people of any position in the island that an elderly female relative of the brothers jacobus had been induced by extreme poverty to accept the position of gouvernante to the girl  as to jacobuss business which certainly annoyed his brother it was a wise choice on his part  it brought him in contact only with strangers of passage whereas any other would have given rise to all sorts of awkwardness with his social equals  the man was not wanting in a certain tactonly he was naturally shameless  for why did he want to keep that girl with him  it was most painful for everybody  i thought suddenly and with profound disgust of the other jacobus and i could not refrain from saying slily  i suppose if he employed her say as a scullion in his household and occasionally pulled her hair or boxed her ears the position would have been more regularless shocking to the respectable class to which he belongs  he was not so stupid as to miss my intention and shrugged his shoulders impatiently  you dont understand  to begin with shes not a mulatto  and a scandal is a scandal  people should be given a chance to forget i dare say it would have been better for her if she had been turned into a scullion or something of that kind  of course hes trying to make money in every sort of petty way but in such a business therell never be enough for anybody to come forward  when my friend left me i had a conception of jacobus and his daughter existing a lonely pair of castaways on a desert island the girl sheltering in the house as if it were a cavern in a cliff and jacobus going out to pick up a living for both on the beach exactly like two shipwrecked people who always hope for some rescuer to bring them back at last into touch with the rest of mankind  but jacobuss bodily reality did not fit in with this romantic view  when he turned up on board in the usual course he sipped the cup of coffee placidly asked me if i was satisfiedand i hardly listened to the harbour gossip he dropped slowly in his low voicesaving enunciation  i had then troubles of my own  my ship chartered my thoughts dwelling on the success of a quick round voyage i had been suddenly confronted by a shortage of bags  a catastrophe  the stock of one especial kind called pockets seemed to be totally exhausted  a consignment was shortly expectedit was afloat on its way but meantime the loading of my ship dead stopped i had enough to worry about  my consignees who had received me with such heartiness on my arrival now in the character of my charterers listened to my complaints with polite helplessness  their manager the oldmaidish thin man who so prudishly didnt even like to speak about the impure jacobus gave me the correct commercial view of the position  my dear captainhe was retracting his leathery cheeks into a condescending sharklike smilewe were not morally obliged to tell you of a possible shortage before you signed the charter party  it was for you to guard against the contingency of a delay strictly speaking  but of course we shouldnt have taken any advantage  this is no ones fault really  we ourselves have been taken unawares he concluded primly with an obvious lie  this lecture i confess had made me thirsty  suppressed rage generally produces that effect and as i strolled on aimlessly i bethought myself of the tall earthenware pitcher in the captains room of the jacobus store  with no more than a nod to the men i found assembled there i poured down a deep cool draught on my indignation then another and then becoming dejected i sat plunged in cheerless reflections  the others read talked smoked bandied over my head some unsubtle chaff  but my abstraction was respected  and it was without a word to any one that i rose and went out only to be quite unexpectedly accosted in the bustle of the store by jacobus the outcast  glad to see you captain  what  going away  you havent been looking so well these last few days i notice  run down eh  he was in his shirtsleeves and his words were in the usual course of business but they had a human note  it was commercial amenity but i had been a stranger to amenity in that connection  i do verily believe from the direction of his heavy glance towards a certain shelf that he was going to suggest the purchase of clarksons nerve tonic which he kept in stock when i said impulsively  i am rather in trouble with my loading  wide awake under his sleepy broad mask with glued lips he understood at once had a movement of the head so appreciative that i relieved my exasperation by exclaiming  surely there must be eleven hundred quarterbags to be found in the colony  its only a matter of looking for them  again that slight movement of the big head and in the noise and activity of the store that tranquil murmur  to be sure  but then people likely to have a reserve of quarter bags wouldnt want to sell  theyd need that size themselves  thats exactly what my consignees are telling me  impossible to buy  bosh  they dont want to  it suits them to have the ship hung up  but if i were to discover the lot they would have to look here jacobus  you are the man to have such a thing up your sleeve  he protested with a ponderous swing of his big head  i stood before him helplessly being looked at by those heavy eyes with a veiled expression as of a man after some soulshaking crisis then suddenly  its impossible to talk quietly here he whispered  i am very busy  but if you could go and wait for me in my house  its less than ten minutes walk  oh yes you dont know the way  he called for his coat and offered to take me there himself  he would have to return to the store at once for an hour or so to finish his business and then he would be at liberty to talk over with me that matter of quarterbags  this programme was breathed out at me through slightly parted still lips his heavy motionless glance rested upon me placid as ever the glance of a tired manbut i felt that it was searching too  i could not imagine what he was looking for in me and kept silent wondering  i am asking you to wait for me in my house till i am at liberty to talk this matter over  you will  why of course i cried  but i cannot promise  i dare say not i said  i dont expect a promise  i mean i cant even promise to try the move ive in my mind  one must see first    hm  all right  ill take the chance  ill wait for you as long as you like  what else have i to do in this infernal hole of a port  before i had uttered my last words we had set off at a swinging pace  we turned a couple of corners and entered a street completely empty of traffic of semirural aspect paved with cobblestones nestling in grass tufts  the house came to the line of the roadway a single story on an elevated basement of rough stones so that our heads were below the level of the windows as we went along  all the jalousies were tightly shut like eyes and the house seemed fast asleep in the afternoon sunshine  the entrance was at the side in an alley even more grassgrown than the street  a small door simply on the latch  with a word of apology as to showing me the way jacobus preceded me up a dark passage and led me across the naked parquet floor of what i supposed to be the diningroom  it was lighted by three glass doors which stood wide open on to a verandah or rather loggia running its brick arches along the garden side of the house  it was really a magnificent garden  smooth green lawns and a gorgeous maze of flowerbeds in the foreground displayed around a basin of dark water framed in a marble rim and in the distance the massed foliage of varied trees concealing the roofs of other houses  the town might have been miles away  it was a brilliantly coloured solitude drowsing in a warm voluptuous silence  where the long still shadows fell across the beds and in shady nooks the massed colours of the flowers had an extraordinary magnificence of effect i stood entranced  jacobus grasped me delicately above the elbow impelling me to a halfturn to the left  i had not noticed the girl before  she occupied a low deep wickerwork armchair and i saw her in exact profile like a figure in a tapestry and as motionless  jacobus released my arm  this is alice he announced tranquilly and his subdued manner of speaking made it sound so much like a confidential communication that i fancied myself nodding understandingly and whispering  i see i see    of course i did nothing of the kind  neither of us did anything we stood side by side looking down at the girl for quite a time she did not stir staring straight before her as if watching the vision of some pageant passing through the garden in the deep rich glow of light and the splendour of flowers  then coming to the end of her reverie she looked round and up if i had not at first noticed her i am certain that she too had been unaware of my presence till she actually perceived me by her fathers side  the quickened upward movement of the heavy eyelids the widening of the languid glance passing into a fixed stare put that beyond doubt  under her amazement there was a hint of fear and then came a flash as of anger  jacobus after uttering my name fairly loud said make yourself at home captaini wont be gone long and went away rapidly  before i had time to make a bow i was left alone with the girlwho i remembered suddenly had not been seen by any man or woman of that town since she had found it necessary to put up her hair  it looked as though it had not been touched again since that distant time of first putting up it was a mass of black lustrous locks twisted anyhow high on her head with long untidy wisps hanging down on each side of the clear sallow face a mass so thick and strong and abundant that nothing but to look at it gave you a sensation of heavy pressure on the top of your head and an impression of magnificently cynical untidiness  she leaned forward hugging herself with crossed legs a dingy amber coloured flounced wrapper of some thin stuff revealed the young supple body drawn together tensely in the deep low seat as if crouching for a spring  i detected a slight quivering start or two which looked uncommonly like bounding away  they were followed by the most absolute immobility  the absurd impulse to run out after jacobus for i had been startled too once repressed i took a chair placed it not very far from her sat down deliberately and began to talk about the garden caring not what i said but using a gentle caressing intonation as one talks to soothe a startled wild animal  i could not even be certain that she understood me  she never raised her face nor attempted to look my way  i kept on talking only to prevent her from taking flight  she had another of those quivering repressed starts which made me catch my breath with apprehension  ultimately i formed a notion that what prevented her perhaps from going off in one great nervous leap was the scantiness of her attire  the wicker armchair was the most substantial thing about her person  what she had on under that dingy loose amber wrapper must have been of the most flimsy and airy character  one could not help being aware of it  it was obvious  i felt it actually embarrassing at first but that sort of embarrassment is got over easily by a mind not enslaved by narrow prejudices  i did not avert my gaze from alice  i went on talking with ingratiating softness the recollection that most likely she had never before been spoken to by a strange man adding to my assurance  i dont know why an emotional tenseness should have crept into the situation  but it did  and just as i was becoming aware of it a slight scream cut short my flow of urbane speech  the scream did not proceed from the girl  it was emitted behind me and caused me to turn my head sharply  i understood at once that the apparition in the doorway was the elderly relation of jacobus the companion the gouvernante  while she remained thunderstruck i got up and made her a low bow  the ladies of jacobuss household evidently spent their days in light attire  this stumpy old woman with a face like a large wrinkled lemon beady eyes and a shock of irongrey hair was dressed in a garment of some ashcoloured silky light stuff  it fell from her thick neck down to her toes with the simplicity of an unadorned nightgown  it made her appear truly cylindrical  she exclaimed  how did you get here  before i could say a word she vanished and presently i heard a confusion of shrill protestations in a distant part of the house obviously no one could tell her how i got there  in a moment with great outcries from two negro women following her she waddled back to the doorway infuriated  what do you want here  i turned to the girl  she was sitting straight up now her hands posed on the arms of the chair  i appealed to her  surely miss alice you will not let them drive me out into the street  her magnificent black eyes narrowed long in shape swept over me with an indefinable expression then in a harsh contemptuous voice she let fall in french a sort of explanation  cest papa  i made another low bow to the old woman  she turned her back on me in order to drive away her black henchwomen then surveying my person in a peculiar manner with one small eye nearly closed and her face all drawn up on that side as if with a twinge of toothache she stepped out on the verandah sat down in a rockingchair some distance away and took up her knitting from a little table  before she started at it she plunged one of the needles into the mop of her grey hair and stirred it vigorously  her elementary nightgownsort of frock clung to her ancient stumpy and floating form  she wore white cotton stockings and flat brown velvet slippers  her feet and ankles were obtrusively visible on the footrest  she began to rock herself slightly while she knitted  i had resumed my seat and kept quiet for i mistrusted that old woman  what if she ordered me to depart  she seemed capable of any outrage  she had snorted once or twice she was knitting violently  suddenly she piped at the young girl in french a question which i translate colloquially  whats your father up to now  the young creature shrugged her shoulders so comprehensively that her whole body swayed within the loose wrapper and in that unexpectedly harsh voice which yet had a seductive quality to the senses like certain kinds of natural rough wines one drinks with pleasure  its some captain  leave me alonewill you  the chair rocked quicker the old thin voice was like a whistle  you and your father make a pair  he would stick at nothing thats well known  but i didnt expect this  i thought it high time to air some of my own french  i remarked modestly but firmly that this was business  i had some matters to talk over with mr jacobus  at once she piped out a derisive poor innocent  then with a change of tone  the shops for business  why dont you go to the shop to talk with him  the furious speed of her fingers and knittingneedles made one dizzy and with squeaky indignation  sitting here staring at that girlis that what you call business  no i said suavely  i call this pleasurean unexpected pleasure  and unless miss alice objects  i half turned to her  she flung at me an angry and contemptuous dont care and leaning her elbow on her knees took her chin in her handa jacobus chin undoubtedly  and those heavy eyelids this black irritated stare reminded me of jacobus toothe wealthy merchant the respected one  the design of her eyebrows also was the same rigid and illomened  yes  i traced in her a resemblance to both of them  it came to me as a sort of surprising remote inference that both these jacobuses were rather handsome men after all  i said  oh  then i shall stare at you till you smile  she favoured me again with an even more viciously scornful dont care  the old woman broke in blunt and shrill  hear his impudence  and you too  dont care  go at least and put some more clothes on  sitting there like this before this sailor riffraff  the sun was about to leave the pearl of the ocean for other seas for other lands  the walled garden full of shadows blazed with colour as if the flowers were giving up the light absorbed during the day  the amazing old woman became very explicit  she suggested to the girl a corset and a petticoat with a cynical unreserve which humiliated me  was i of no more account than a wooden dummy  the girl snapped out  shant  it was not the naughty retort of a vulgar child it had a note of desperation  clearly my intrusion had somehow upset the balance of their established relations  the old woman knitted with furious accuracy her eyes fastened down on her work  oh you are the true child of your father  and that talks of entering a convent  letting herself be stared at by a fellow  leave off  shameless thing  old sorceress the girl uttered distinctly preserving her meditative pose chin in hand and a faraway stare over the garden  it was like the quarrel of the kettle and the pot  the old woman flew out of the chair banged down her work and with a great play of thick limb perfectly visible in that weird clinging garment of hers strode at the girlwho never stirred  i was experiencing a sort of trepidation when as if awed by that unconscious attitude the aged relative of jacobus turned short upon me  she was i perceived armed with a knittingneedle and as she raised her hand her intention seemed to be to throw it at me like a dart  but she only used it to scratch her head with examining me the while at close range one eye nearly shut and her face distorted by a whimsical onesided grimace  my dear man she asked abruptly do you expect any good to come of this   i do hope so indeed miss jacobus  i tried to speak in the easy tone of an afternoon caller  you see i am here after some bags  bags  look at that now  didnt i hear you holding forth to that graceless wretch  you would like to see me in my grave uttered the motionless girl hoarsely  grave  what about me  buried alive before i am dead for the sake of a thing blessed with such a pretty father she cried and turning to me  youre one of these men he does business with wellwhy dont you leave us in peace my good fellow  it was said in a tonethis leave us in peace  there was a sort of ruffianly familiarity a superiority a scorn in it  i was to hear it more than once for you would show an imperfect knowledge of human nature if you thought that this was my last visit to that housewhere no respectable person had put foot for ever so many years  no you would be very much mistaken if you imagined that this reception had scared me away  first of all i was not going to run before a grotesque and ruffianly old woman  and then you mustnt forget these necessary bags  that first evening jacobus made me stay to dinner after however telling me loyally that he didnt know whether he could do anything at all for me  he had been thinking it over  it was too difficult he feared    but he did not give it up in so many words  we were only three at table the girl by means of repeated wont shant and dont care having conveyed and affirmed her intention not to come to the table not to have any dinner not to move from the verandah  the old relative hopped about in her flat slippers and piped indignantly jacobus towered over her and murmured placidly in his throat i joined jocularly from a distance throwing in a few words for which under the cover of the night i received secretly a most vicious poke in the ribs from the old womans elbow or perhaps her fist  i restrained a cry  and all the time the girl didnt even condescend to raise her head to look at any of us  all this may sound childishand yet that stony petulant sullenness had an obscurely tragic flavour  and so we sat down to the food around the light of a good many candles while she remained crouching out there staring in the dark as if feeding her bad temper on the heavily scented air of the admirable garden  before leaving i said to jacobus that i would come next day to hear if the bag affair had made any progress  he shook his head slightly at that  ill haunt your house daily till you pull it off  youll be always finding me here  his faint melancholy smile did not part his thick lips  that will be all right captain  then seeing me to the door very tranquil he murmured earnestly the recommendation  make yourself at home and also the hospitable hint about there being always a plate of soup  it was only on my way to the quay down the illlighted streets that i remembered i had been engaged to dine that very evening with the s family  though vexed with my forgetfulness it would be rather awkward to explain i couldnt help thinking that it had procured me a more amusing evening  and besidesbusiness  the sacred business  in a barefooted negro who overtook me at a run and bolted down the landingsteps i recognised jacobuss boatman who must have been feeding in the kitchen  his usual goodnight sah as i went up my ships ladder had a more cordial sound than on previous occasions    chapter v    i kept my word to jacobus  i haunted his home  he was perpetually finding me there of an afternoon when he popped in for a moment from the store  the sound of my voice talking to his alice greeted him on his doorstep and when he returned for good in the evening ten to one he would hear it still going on in the verandah  i just nodded to him he would sit down heavily and gently and watch with a sort of approving anxiety my efforts to make his daughter smile  i called her often alice right before him sometimes i would address her as miss dont care and i exhausted myself in nonsensical chatter without succeeding once in taking her out of her peevish and tragic self  there were moments when i felt i must break out and start swearing at her till all was blue  and i fancied that had i done so jacobus would not have moved a muscle a sort of shady intimate understanding seemed to have been established between us  i must say the girl treated her father exactly in the same way she treated me  and how could it have been otherwise  she treated me as she treated her father  she had never seen a visitor  she did not know how men behaved  i belonged to the low lot with whom her father did business at the port  i was of no account  so was her father  the only decent people in the world were the people of the island who would have nothing to do with him because of something wicked he had done  this was apparently the explanation miss jacobus had given her of the households isolated position  for she had to be told something  and i feel convinced that this version had been assented to by jacobus  i must say the old woman was putting it forward with considerable gusto  it was on her lips the universal explanation the universal allusion the universal taunt  one day jacobus came in early and beckoning me into the dining room wiped his brow with a weary gesture and told me that he had managed to unearth a supply of quarterbags  its fourteen hundred your ship wanted did you say captain  yes yes i replied eagerly but he remained calm  he looked more tired than i had ever seen him before  well captain you may go and tell your people that they can get that lot from my brother  as i remained openmouthed at this he added his usual placid formula of assurance  youll find it correct captain  you spoke to your brother about it  i was distinctly awed  and for me  because he must have known that my ships the only one hung up for bags  how on earth  he wiped his brow again  i noticed that he was dressed with unusual care in clothes in which i had never seen him before  he avoided my eye  youve heard people talk of course    thats true enough  he    i    we certainly   for several years     his voice declined to a mere sleepy murmur  you see i had something to tell him of something which  his murmur stopped  he was not going to tell me what this something was  and i didnt care  anxious to carry the news to my charterers i ran back on the verandah to get my hat  at the bustle i made the girl turned her eyes slowly in my direction and even the old woman was checked in her knitting  i stopped a moment to exclaim excitedly  your fathers a brick miss dont care  thats what he is  she beheld my elation in scornful surprise  jacobus with unwonted familiarity seized my arm as i flew through the diningroom and breathed heavily at me a proposal about a plate of soup that evening  i answered distractedly  eh  what  oh thanks certainly  with pleasure and tore myself away  dine with him of course  the merest gratitude  but some three hours afterwards in the dusky silent street paved with cobblestones i became aware that it was not mere gratitude which was guiding my steps towards the house with the old garden where for years no guest other than myself had ever dined  mere gratitude does not gnaw at ones interior economy in that particular way  hunger might but i was not feeling particularly hungry for jacobuss food  on that occasion too the girl refused to come to the table  my exasperation grew  the old woman cast malicious glances at me i said suddenly to jacobus  here  put some chicken and salad on that plate  he obeyed without raising his eyes  i carried it with a knife and fork and a serviette out on the verandah  the garden was one mass of gloom like a cemetery of flowers buried in the darkness and she in the chair seemed to muse mournfully over the extinction of light and colour  only whiffs of heavy scent passed like wandering fragrant souls of that departed multitude of blossoms  i talked volubly jocularly persuasively tenderly i talked in a subdued tone  to a listener it would have sounded like the murmur of a pleading lover  whenever i paused expectantly there was only a deep silence  it was like offering food to a seated statue  i havent been able to swallow a single morsel thinking of you out here starving yourself in the dark  its positively cruel to be so obstinate  think of my sufferings  dont care  i felt as if i could have done her some violenceshaken her beaten her maybe  i said  your absurd behaviour will prevent me coming here any more  whats that to me  you like it  its false she snarled  my hand fell on her shoulder and if she had flinched i verily believe i would have shaken her  but there was no movement and this immobility disarmed my anger  you do  or you wouldnt be found on the verandah every day  why are you here then  there are plenty of rooms in the house  you have your own room to stay inif you did not want to see me  but you do  you know you do  i felt a slight shudder under my hand and released my grip as if frightened by that sign of animation in her body  the scented air of the garden came to us in a warm wave like a voluptuous and perfumed sigh  go back to them she whispered almost pitifully  as i reentered the diningroom i saw jacobus cast down his eyes i banged the plate on the table  at this demonstration of ill humour he murmured something in an apologetic tone and i turned on him viciously as if he were accountable to me for these abominable eccentricities i believe i called them  but i dare say miss jacobus here is responsible for most of this offensive manner i added loftily  she piped out at once in her brazen ruffianly manner  eh  why dont you leave us in peace my good fellow  i was astonished that she should dare before jacobus  yet what could he have done to repress her  he needed her too much  he raised a heavy drowsy glance for an instant then looked down again  she insisted with shrill finality  havent you done your business you two  well then  she had the true jacobus impudence that old woman  her mop of irongrey hair was parted on the side like a mans raffishly and she made as if to plunge her fork into it as she used to do with the knittingneedle but refrained  her little black eyes sparkled venomously  i turned to my host at the head of the table menacingly as it were  well and what do you say to that jacobus  am i to take it that we have done with each other  i had to wait a little  the answer when it came was rather unexpected and in quite another spirit than the question  i certainly think we might do some business yet with those potatoes of mine captain  you will find that  i cut him short  ive told you before that i dont trade  his broad chest heaved without a sound in a noiseless sigh  think it over captain he murmured tenacious and tranquil and i burst into a jarring laugh remembering how he had stuck to the circusrider womanthe depth of passion under that placid surface which even cuts with a ridingwhip so the legend had it could never raffle into the semblance of a storm something like the passion of a fish would be if one could imagine such a thing as a passionate fish  that evening i experienced more distinctly than ever the sense of moral discomfort which always attended me in that house lying under the ban of all decent people  i refused to stay on and smoke after dinner and when i put my hand into the thicklycushioned palm of jacobus i said to myself that it would be for the last time under his roof  i pressed his bulky paw heartily nevertheless  hadnt he got me out of a serious difficulty  to the few words of acknowledgment i was bound and indeed quite willing to utter he answered by stretching his closed lips in his melancholy gluedtogether smile  that will be all right i hope captain he breathed out weightily  what do you mean i asked alarmed  that your brother might yet  oh no he reassured me  he    hes a man of his word captain  my selfcommunion as i walked away from his door trying to believe that this was for the last time was not satisfactory  i was aware myself that i was not sincere in my reflections as to jacobuss motives and of course the very next day i went back again  how weak irrational and absurd we are  how easily carried away whenever our awakened imagination brings us the irritating hint of a desire  i cared for the girl in a particular way seduced by the moody expression of her face by her obstinate silences her rare scornful words by the perpetual pout of her closed lips the black depths of her fixed gaze turned slowly upon me as if in contemptuous provocation only to be averted next moment with an exasperating indifference  of course the news of my assiduity had spread all over the little town  i noticed a change in the manner of my acquaintances and even something different in the nods of the other captains when meeting them at the landingsteps or in the offices where business called me  the oldmaidish head clerk treated me with distant punctiliousness and as it were gathered his skirts round him for fear of contamination  it seemed to me that the very niggers on the quays turned to look after me as i passed and as to jacobuss boatman his goodnight sah when he put me on board was no longer merely cordialit had a familiar confidential sound as though we had been partners in some villainy  my friend s the elder passed me on the other side of the street with a wave of the hand and an ironic smile  the younger brother the one they had married to an elderly shrew he on the strength of an older friendship and as if paying a debt of gratitude took the liberty to utter a word of warning  youre doing yourself no good by your choice of friends my dear chap he said with infantile gravity  as i knew that the meeting of the brothers jacobus was the subject of excited comment in the whole of the sugary pearl of the ocean i wanted to know why i was blamed  i have been the occasion of a move which may end in a reconciliation surely desirable from the point of view of the proprietiesdont you know  of course if that girl were disposed of it would certainly facilitate he mused sagely then inconsequential creature gave me a light tap on the lower part of my waistcoat  you old sinner he cried jovially much you care for proprieties  but you had better look out for yourself you know with a personage like jacobus who has no sort of reputation to lose  he had recovered his gravity of a respectable citizen by that time and added regretfully  all the women of our family are perfectly scandalised  but by that time i had given up visiting the s family and the d family  the elder ladies pulled such faces when i showed myself and the multitude of related young ladies received me with such a variety of looks  wondering awed mocking except miss mary who spoke to me and looked at me with hushed pained compassion as though i had been ill that i had no difficulty in giving them all up  i would have given up the society of the whole town for the sake of sitting near that girl snarling and superb and barely clad in that flimsy dingy amber wrapper open low at the throat  she looked with the wild wisps of hair hanging down her tense face as though she had just jumped out of bed in the panic of a fire  she sat leaning on her elbow looking at nothing  why did she stay listening to my absurd chatter  and not only that but why did she powder her face in preparation for my arrival  it seemed to be her idea of making a toilette and in her untidy negligence a sign of great effort towards personal adornment  but i might have been mistaken  the powdering might have been her daily practice and her presence in the verandah a sign of an indifference so complete as to take no account of my existence well it was all one to me  i loved to watch her slow changes of pose to look at her long immobilities composed in the graceful lines of her body to observe the mysterious narrow stare of her splendid black eyes somewhat long in shape half closed contemplating the void  she was like a spellbound creature with the forehead of a goddess crowned by the dishevelled magnificent hair of a gipsy tramp  even her indifference was seductive  i felt myself growing attached to her by the bond of an irrealisable desire for i kept my headquite and i put up with the moral discomfort of jacobuss sleepy watchfulness tranquil and yet so expressive as if there had been a tacit pact between us two  i put up with the insolence of the old womans  arent you ever going to leave us in peace my good fellow with her taunts with her brazen and sinister scolding she was of the true jacobus stock and no mistake  directly i got away from the girl i called myself many hard names what folly was this  i would ask myself  it was like being the slave of some depraved habit  and i returned to her with my head clear my heart certainly free not even moved by pity for that castaway she was as much of a castaway as any one ever wrecked on a desert island but as if beguiled by some extraordinary promise nothing more unworthy could be imagined  the recollection of that tremulous whisper when i gripped her shoulder with one hand and held a plate of chicken with the other was enough to make me break all my good resolutions  her insulting taciturnity was enough sometimes to make one gnash ones teeth with rage  when she opened her mouth it was only to be abominably rude in harsh tones to the associate of her reprobate father and the full approval of her aged relative was conveyed to her by offensive chuckles  if not that then her remarks always uttered in the tone of scathing contempt were of the most appalling inanity  how could it have been otherwise  that plump ruffianly jacobus old maid in the tight grey frock had never taught her any manners manners i suppose are not necessary for born castaways  no educational establishment could ever be induced to accept her as a pupilon account of the proprieties i imagine  and jacobus had not been able to send her away anywhere  how could he have done it  who with  where to  he himself was not enough of an adventurer to think of settling down anywhere else  his passion had tossed him at the tail of a circus up and down strange coasts but the storm over he had drifted back shamelessly where social outcast as he was he remained still a jacobusone of the oldest families on the island older than the french even  there must have been a jacobus in at the death of the last dodo    the girl had learned nothing she had never listened to a general conversation she knew nothing she had heard of nothing  she could read certainly but all the reading matter that ever came in her way were the newspapers provided for the captains room of the store  jacobus had the habit of taking these sheets home now and then in a very stained and ragged condition  as her mind could not grasp the meaning of any matters treated there except policecourt reports and accounts of crimes she had formed for herself a notion of the civilised world as a scene of murders abductions burglaries stabbing affrays and every sort of desperate violence  england and france paris and london the only two towns of which she seemed to have heard appeared to her sinks of abomination reeking with blood in contrast to her little island where petty larceny was about the standard of current misdeeds with now and then some more pronounced crimeand that only amongst the imported coolie labourers on sugar estates or the negroes of the town  but in europe these things were being done daily by a wicked population of white men amongst whom as that ruffianly aristocratic old miss jacobus pointed out the wandering sailors the associates of her precious papa were the lowest of the low  it was impossible to give her a sense of proportion  i suppose she figured england to herself as about the size of the pearl of the ocean in which case it would certainly have been reeking with gore and a mere wreck of burgled houses from end to end  one could not make her understand that these horrors on which she fed her imagination were lost in the mass of orderly life like a few drops of blood in the ocean  she directed upon me for a moment the uncomprehending glance of her narrowed eyes and then would turn her scornful powdered face away without a word  she would not even take the trouble to shrug her shoulders  at that time the batches of papers brought by the last mail reported a series of crimes in the east end of london there was a sensational case of abduction in france and a fine display of armed robbery in australia  one afternoon crossing the diningroom i heard miss jacobus piping in the verandah with venomous animosity i dont know what your precious papa is plotting with that fellow but hes just the sort of man whos capable of carrying you off far away somewhere and then cutting your throat some day for your money  there was a good half of the length of the verandah between their chairs  i came out and sat down fiercely midway between them  yes thats what we do with girls in europe i began in a grimly matteroffact tone  i think miss jacobus was disconcerted by my sudden appearance  i turned upon her with cold ferocity  as to objectionable old women they are first strangled quietly then cut up into small pieces and thrown away a bit here and a bit there  they vanish  i cannot go so far as to say i had terrified her  but she was troubled by my truculence the more so because i had been always addressing her with a politeness she did not deserve  her plump knitting hands fell slowly on her knees  she said not a word while i fixed her with severe determination  then as i turned away from her at last she laid down her work gently and with noiseless movements retreated from the verandah  in fact she vanished  but i was not thinking of her  i was looking at the girl  it was what i was coming for daily troubled ashamed eager finding in my nearness to her a unique sensation which i indulged with dread selfcontempt and deep pleasure as if it were a secret vice bound to end in my undoing like the habit of some drug or other which ruins and degrades its slave  i looked her over from the top of her dishevelled head down the lovely line of the shoulder following the curve of the hip the draped form of the long limb right down to her fine ankle below a torn soiled flounce and as far as the point of the shabby high heeled blue slipper dangling from her wellshaped foot which she moved slightly with quick nervous jerks as if impatient of my presence  and in the scent of the massed flowers i seemed to breathe her special and inexplicable charm the heady perfume of the everlastingly irritated captive of the garden  i looked at her rounded chin the jacobus chin at the full red lips pouting in the powdered sallow face at the firm modelling of the cheek the grains of white in the hairs of the straight sombre eyebrows at the long eyes a narrowed gleam of liquid white and intense motionless black with their gaze so empty of thought and so absorbed in their fixity that she seemed to be staring at her own lonely image in some faroff mirror hidden from my sight amongst the trees  and suddenly without looking at me with the appearance of a person speaking to herself she asked in that voice slightly harsh yet mellow and always irritated  why do you keep on coming here  why do i keep on coming here i repeated taken by surprise  i could not have told her  i could not even tell myself with sincerity why i was coming there  whats the good of you asking a question like that  nothing is any good she observed scornfully to the empty air her chin propped on her hand that hand never extended to any man that no one had ever graspedfor i had only grasped her shoulder oncethat generous fine somewhat masculine hand  i knew well the peculiarly efficient shapebroad at the base tapering at the fingersof that hand for which there was nothing in the world to lay hold of  i pretended to be playful  no  but do you really care to know  she shrugged indolently her magnificent shoulders from which the dingy thin wrapper was slipping a little  ohnever mindnever mind  there was something smouldering under those airs of lassitude  she exasperated me by the provocation of her nonchalance by something elusive and defiant in her very form which i wanted to seize  i said roughly  why  dont you think i should tell you the truth  her eyes glided my way for a sidelong look and she murmured moving only her full pouting lips  i think you would not dare  do you imagine i am afraid of you  what on earth    well its possible after all that i dont know exactly why i am coming here  let us say with miss jacobus that it is for no good  you seem to believe the outrageous things she says if you do have a row with her now and then  she snapped out viciously  who else am i to believe  i dont know i had to own seeing her suddenly very helpless and condemned to moral solitude by the verdict of a respectable community  you might believe me if you chose  she made a slight movement and asked me at once with an effort as if making an experiment  what is the business between you and papa  dont you know the nature of your fathers business  come  he sells provisions to ships  she became rigid again in her crouching pose  not that  what brings you hereto this house  and suppose its you  you would not call that business  would you  and now let us drop the subject  its no use  my ship will be ready for sea the day after tomorrow  she murmured a distinctly scared so soon and getting up quickly went to the little table and poured herself a glass of water  she walked with rapid steps and with an indolent swaying of her whole young figure above the hips when she passed near me i felt with tenfold force the charm of the peculiar promising sensation i had formed the habit to seek near her  i thought with sudden dismay that this was the end of it that after one more day i would be no longer able to come into this verandah sit on this chair and taste perversely the flavour of contempt in her indolent poses drink in the provocation of her scornful looks and listen to the curt insolent remarks uttered in that harsh and seductive voice as if my innermost nature had been altered by the action of some moral poison i felt an abject dread of going to sea  i had to exercise a sudden selfcontrol as one puts on a brake to prevent myself jumping up to stride about shout gesticulate make her a scene  what for  what about  i had no idea  it was just the relief of violence that i wanted and i lolled back in my chair trying to keep my lips formed in a smile that half indulgent halfmocking smile which was my shield against the shafts of her contempt and the insulting sallies flung at me by the old woman  she drank the water at a draught with the avidity of raging thirst and let herself fall on the nearest chair as if utterly overcome  her attitude like certain tones of her voice had in it something masculine  the knees apart in the ample wrapper the clasped hands hanging between them her body leaning forward with drooping head  i stared at the heavy black coil of twisted hair it was enormous crowning the bowed head with a crushing and disdained glory  the escaped wisps hung straight down  and suddenly i perceived that the girl was trembling from head to foot as though that glass of iced water had chilled her to the bone  whats the matter now i said startled but in no very sympathetic mood  she shook her bowed overweighted head and cried in a stifled voice but with a rising inflection  go away  go away  go away  i got up then and approached her with a strange sort of anxiety i looked down at her round strong neck then stooped low enough to peep at her face  and i began to tremble a little myself  what on earth are you gone wild about miss dont care  she flung herself backwards violently her head going over the back of the chair  and now it was her smooth full palpitating throat that lay exposed to my bewildered stare  her eyes were nearly closed with only a horrible white gleam under the lids as if she were dead  what has come to you i asked in awe  what are you terrifying yourself with  she pulled herself together her eyes open frightfully wide now the tropical afternoon was lengthening the shadows on the hot weary earth the abode of obscure desires of extravagant hopes of unimaginable terrors  never mind  dont care  then after a gasp she spoke with such frightful rapidity that i could hardly make out the amazing words for if you were to shut me up in an empty place as smooth all round as the palm of my hand i could always strangle myself with my hair  for a moment doubting my ears i let this inconceivable declaration sink into me  it is ever impossible to guess at the wild thoughts that pass through the heads of our fellowcreatures what monstrous imaginings of violence could have dwelt under the low forehead of that girl who had been taught to regard her father as capable of anything more in the light of a misfortune than that of a disgrace as evidently something to be resented and feared rather than to be ashamed of  she seemed indeed as unaware of shame as of anything else in the world but in her ignorance her resentment and fear took a childish and violent shape  of course she spoke without knowing the value of words  what could she know of deathshe who knew nothing of life  it was merely as the proof of her being beside herself with some odious apprehension that this extraordinary speech had moved me not to pity but to a fascinated horrified wonder  i had no idea what notion she had of her danger  some sort of abduction  it was quite possible with the talk of that atrocious old woman  perhaps she thought she could be carried off bound hand and foot and even gagged  at that surmise i felt as if the door of a furnace had been opened in front of me  upon my honour i cried  you shall end by going crazy if you listen to that abominable old aunt of yours  i studied her haggard expression her trembling lips  her cheeks even seemed sunk a little  but how i the associate of her disreputable father the lowest of the low from the criminal europe could manage to reassure her i had no conception  she was exasperating  heavens and earth  what do you think i can do  i dont know  her chin certainly trembled  and she was looking at me with extreme attention  i made a step nearer to her chair  i shall do nothing  i promise you that  will that do  do you understand  i shall do nothing whatever of any kind and the day after tomorrow i shall be gone  what else could i have said  she seemed to drink in my words with the thirsty avidity with which she had emptied the glass of water she whispered tremulously in that touching tone i had heard once before on her lips and which thrilled me again with the same emotion  i would believe you  but what about papa  he be hanged  my emotion betrayed itself by the brutality of my tone  ive had enough of your papa  are you so stupid as to imagine that i am frightened of him  he cant make me do anything  all that sounded feeble to me in the face of her ignorance  but i must conclude that the accent of sincerity has as some people say a really irresistible power  the effect was far beyond my hopesand even beyond my conception  to watch the change in the girl was like watching a miraclethe gradual but swift relaxation of her tense glance of her stiffened muscles of every fibre of her body  that black fixed stare into which i had read a tragic meaning more than once in which i had found a sombre seduction was perfectly empty now void of all consciousness whatever and not even aware any longer of my presence it had become a little sleepy in the jacobus fashion  but man being a perverse animal instead of rejoicing at my complete success i beheld it with astounded and indignant eyes there was something cynical in that unconcealed alteration the true jacobus shamelessness  i felt as though i had been cheated in some rather complicated deal into which i had entered against my better judgment  yes cheated without any regard for at least the forms of decency  with an easy indolent and in its indolence supple feline movement she rose from the chair so provokingly ignoring me now that for very rage i held my ground within less than a foot of her leisurely and tranquil behaving right before me with the ease of a person alone in a room she extended her beautiful arms with her hands clenched her body swaying her head thrown back a little revelling contemptuously in a sense of relief easing her limbs in freedom after all these days of crouching motionless poses when she had been so furious and so afraid  all this with supreme indifference incredible offensive exasperating like ingratitude doubled with treachery  i ought to have been flattered perhaps but on the contrary my anger grew her movement to pass by me as if i were a wooden post or a piece of furniture that unconcerned movement brought it to a head  i wont say i did not know what i was doing but certainly cool reflection had nothing to do with the circumstance that next moment both my arms were round her waist  it was an impulsive action as one snatches at something falling or escaping and it had no hypocritical gentleness about it either  she had no time to make a sound and the first kiss i planted on her closed lips was vicious enough to have been a bite  she did not resist and of course i did not stop at one  she let me go on not as if she were inanimatei felt her there close against me young full of vigour of life a strong desirable creature but as if she did not care in the least in the absolute assurance of her safety what i did or left undone  our faces brought close together in this storm of haphazard caresses her big black wideopen eyes looked into mine without the girl appearing either angry or pleased or moved in any way  in that steady gaze which seemed impersonally to watch my madness i could detect a slight surprise perhapsnothing more  i showered kisses upon her face and there did not seem to be any reason why this should not go on for ever  that thought flashed through my head and i was on the point of desisting when all at once she began to struggle with a sudden violence which all but freed her instantly which revived my exasperation with her indeed a fierce desire never to let her go any more  i tightened my embrace in time gasping out  noyou dont as if she were my mortal enemy  on her part not a word was said  putting her hands against my chest she pushed with all her might without succeeding to break the circle of my arms  except that she seemed thoroughly awake now her eyes gave me no clue whatever  to meet her black stare was like looking into a deep well and i was totally unprepared for her change of tactics instead of trying to tear my hands apart she flung herself upon my breast and with a downward undulating serpentine motion a quick sliding dive she got away from me smoothly  it was all very swift i saw her pick up the tail of her wrapper and run for the door at the end of the verandah not very gracefully  she appeared to be limping a littleand then she vanished the door swung behind her so noiselessly that i could not believe it was completely closed  i had a distinct suspicion of her black eye being at the crack to watch what i would do  i could not make up my mind whether to shake my fist in that direction or blow a kiss    chapter vi    either would have been perfectly consistent with my feelings  i gazed at the door hesitating but in the end i did neither  the monition of some sixth sensethe sense of guilt maybe that sense which always acts too late alaswarned me to look round and at once i became aware that the conclusion of this tumultuous episode was likely to be a matter of lively anxiety  jacobus was standing in the doorway of the diningroom  how long he had been there it was impossible to guess and remembering my struggle with the girl i thought he must have been its mute witness from beginning to end but this supposition seemed almost incredible  perhaps that impenetrable girl had heard him come in and had got away in time  he stepped on to the verandah in his usual manner heavyeyed with glued lips  i marvelled at the girls resemblance to this man those long egyptian eyes that low forehead of a stupid goddess she had found in the sawdust of the circus but all the rest of the face the design and the modelling the rounded chin the very lipsall that was jacobus fined down more finished more expressive  his thick hand fell on and grasped with force the back of a light chair there were several standing about and i perceived the chance of a broken head at the end of all thismost likely  my mortification was extreme  the scandal would be horrible that was unavoidable  but how to act so as to satisfy myself i did not know  i stood on my guard and at any rate faced him  there was nothing else for it  of one thing i was certain that however brazen my attitude it could never equal the characteristic jacobus impudence  he gave me his melancholy glued smile and sat down  i own i was relieved  the perspective of passing from kisses to blows had nothing particularly attractive in it  perhapsperhaps he had seen nothing  he behaved as usual but he had never before found me alone on the verandah  if he had alluded to it if he had asked  wheres alice or something of the sort i would have been able to judge from the tone  he would give me no opportunity the striking peculiarity was that he had never looked up at me yet he knows i said to myself confidently  and my contempt for him relieved my disgust with myself  you are early home i remarked  things are very quiet nothing doing at the store today he explained with a castdown air  oh well you know i am off i said feeling that this perhaps was the best thing to do  yes he breathed out  day after tomorrow  this was not what i had meant but as he gazed persistently on the floor i followed the direction of his glance  in the absolute stillness of the house we stared at the highheeled slipper the girl had lost in her flight  we stared  it lay overturned  after what seemed a very long time to me jacobus hitched his chair forward stooped with extended arm and picked it up  it looked a slender thing in his big thick hands  it was not really a slipper but a low shoe of blue glazed kid rubbed and shabby  it had straps to go over the instep but the girl only thrust her feet in after her slovenly manner  jacobus raised his eyes from the shoe to look at me  sit down captain he said at last in his subdued tone  as if the sight of that shoe had renewed the spell i gave up suddenly the idea of leaving the house there and then  it had become impossible  i sat down keeping my eyes on the fascinating object  jacobus turned his daughters shoe over and over in his cushioned paws as if studying the way the thing was made  he contemplated the thin sole for a time then glancing inside with an absorbed air  i am glad i found you here captain  i answered this by some sort of grunt watching him covertly  then i added  you wont have much more of me now  he was still deep in the interior of that shoe on which my eyes too were resting  have you thought any more of this deal in potatoes i spoke to you about the other day  no i havent i answered curtly  he checked my movement to rise by an austere commanding gesture of the hand holding that fatal shoe  i remained seated and glared at him  you know i dont trade  you ought to captain  you ought to  i reflected  if i left that house now i would never see the girl again  and i felt i must see her once more if only for an instant  it was a need not to be reasoned with not to be disregarded  no i did not want to go away  i wanted to stay for one more experience of that strange provoking sensation and of indefinite desire the habit of which had made meme of all peopledread the prospect of going to sea  mr jacobus i pronounced slowly  do you really think that upon the whole and taking various matters into considerationi mean everything do you understandit would be a good thing for me to trade let us say with you  i waited for a while  he went on looking at the shoe which he held now crushed in the middle the worn point of the toe and the high heel protruding on each side of his heavy fist  that will be all right he said facing me squarely at last  are you sure  youll find it quite correct captain  he had uttered his habitual phrases in his usual placid breathsaving voice and stood my hard inquisitive stare sleepily without as much as a wink  then let us trade i said turning my shoulder to him  i see you are bent on it  i did not want an open scandal but i thought that outward decency may be bought too dearly at times  i included jacobus myself the whole population of the island in the same contemptuous disgust as though we had been partners in an ignoble transaction  and the remembered vision at sea diaphanous and blue of the pearl of the ocean at sixty miles off the unsubstantial clear marvel of it as if evoked by the art of a beautiful and pure magic turned into a thing of horrors too  was this the fortune this vaporous and rare apparition had held for me in its hard heart hidden within the shape as of fair dreams and mist  was this my luck  i thinkjacobus became suddenly audible after what seemed the silence of vile meditationthat you might conveniently take some thirty tons  that would be about the lot captain  would it  the lot  i dare say it would be convenient but i havent got enough money for that  i had never seen him so animated  no he exclaimed with what i took for the accent of grim menace thats a pity  he paused then unrelenting  how much money have you got captain he inquired with awful directness  it was my turn to face him squarely  i did so and mentioned the amount i could dispose of  and i perceived that he was disappointed  he thought it over his calculating gaze lost in mine for quite a long time before he came out in a thoughtful tone with the rapacious suggestion  you could draw some more from your charterers  that would be quite easy captain  no i couldnt i retorted brusquely  ive drawn my salary up to date and besides the ships accounts are closed  i was growing furious  i pursued  and ill tell you what  if i could do it i wouldnt  then throwing off all restraint i added you are a bit too much of a jacobus mr jacobus  the tone alone was insulting enough but he remained tranquil only a little puzzled till something seemed to dawn upon him but the unwonted light in his eyes died out instantly  as a jacobus on his native heath what a mere skipper chose to say could not touch him outcast as he was  as a shipchandler he could stand anything all i caught of his mumble was a vaguequite correct than which nothing could have been more egregiously false at bottomto my view at least  but i rememberedi had never forgottenthat i must see the girl  i did not mean to go  i meant to stay in the house till i had seen her once more  look here i said finally  ill tell you what ill do  ill take as many of your confounded potatoes as my money will buy on condition that you go off at once down to the wharf to see them loaded in the lighter and sent alongside the ship straight away take the invoice and a signed receipt with you  heres the key of my desk  give it to burns  he will pay you  he got up from his chair before i had finished speaking but he refused to take the key  burns would never do it  he wouldnt like to ask him even  well then i said eyeing him slightingly theres nothing for it mr jacobus but you must wait on board till i come off to settle with you  that will be all right captain  i will go at once  he seemed at a loss what to do with the girls shoe he was still holding in his fist  finally looking dully at me he put it down on the chair from which he had risen  and you captain  wont you come along too just to see  dont bother about me  ill take care of myself  he remained perplexed for a moment as if trying to understand and then his weighty  certainly certainly captain seemed to be the outcome of some sudden thought  his big chest heaved  was it a sigh  as he went out to hurry off those potatoes he never looked back at me  i waited till the noise of his footsteps had died out of the diningroom and i waited a little longer  then turning towards the distant door i raised my voice along the verandah  alice  nothing answered me not even a stir behind the door  jacobuss house might have been made empty for me to make myself at home in i did not call again  i had become aware of a great discouragement  i was mentally jaded morally dejected  i turned to the garden again sitting down with my elbows spread on the low balustrade and took my head in my hands  the evening closed upon me  the shadows lengthened deepened mingled together into a pool of twilight in which the flowerbeds glowed like coloured embers whiffs of heavy scent came to me as if the dusk of this hemisphere were but the dimness of a temple and the garden an enormous censer swinging before the altar of the stars  the colours of the blossoms deepened losing their glow one by one  the girl when i turned my head at a slight noise appeared to me very tall and slender advancing with a swaying limp a floating and uneven motion which ended in the sinking of her shadowy form into the deep low chair  and i dont know why or whence i received the impression that she had come too late  she ought to have appeared at my call  she ought to have    it was as if a supreme opportunity had been missed  i rose and took a seat close to her nearly opposite her armchair her ever discontented voice addressed me at once contemptuously  you are still here  i pitched mine low  you have come out at last  i came to look for my shoebefore they bring in the lights  it was her harsh enticing whisper subdued not very steady but its low tremulousness gave me no thrill now  i could only make out the oval of her face her uncovered throat the long white gleam of her eyes  she was mysterious enough  her hands were resting on the arms of the chair  but where was the mysterious and provoking sensation which was like the perfume of her flowerlike youth  i said quietly  i have got your shoe here  she made no sound and i continued you had better give me your foot and i will put it on for you  she made no movement  i bent low down and groped for her foot under the flounces of the wrapper  she did not withdraw it and i put on the shoe buttoning the instepstrap  it was an inanimate foot  i lowered it gently to the floor  if you buttoned the strap you would not be losing your shoe miss dont care i said trying to be playful without conviction  i felt more like wailing over the lost illusion of vague desire over the sudden conviction that i would never find again near her the strange halfevil halftender sensation which had given its acrid flavour to so many days which had made her appear tragic and promising pitiful and provoking  that was all over  your father picked it up i said thinking she may just as well be told of the fact  i am not afraid of papaby himself she declared scornfully  oh  its only in conjunction with his disreputable associates strangers the riffraff of europe as your charming aunt or greataunt saysmen like me for instancethat you  i am not afraid of you she snapped out  thats because you dont know that i am now doing business with your father  yes i am in fact doing exactly what he wants me to do  ive broken my promise to you  thats the sort of man i am and nowarent you afraid  if you believe what that dear kind truthful old lady says you ought to be  it was with unexpected modulated softness that the affirmed  no  i am not afraid  she hesitated    not now  quite right  you neednt be  i shall not see you again before i go to sea  i rose and stood near her chair  but i shall often think of you in this old garden passing under the trees over there walking between these gorgeous flowerbeds  you must love this garden  i love nothing  i heard in her sullen tone the faint echo of that resentfully tragic note which i had found once so provoking  but it left me unmoved except for a sudden and weary conviction of the emptiness of all things under heaven  goodbye alice i said  she did not answer she did not move  to merely take her hand shake it and go away seemed impossible almost improper  i stooped without haste and pressed my lips to her smooth forehead this was the moment when i realised clearly with a sort of terror my complete detachment from that unfortunate creature  and as i lingered in that cruel selfknowledge i felt the light touch of her arms falling languidly on my neck and received a hasty awkward haphazard kiss which missed my lips  no  she was not afraid but i was no longer moved  her arms slipped off my neck slowly she made no sound the deep wicker armchair creaked slightly only a sense of my dignity prevented me fleeing headlong from that catastrophic revelation  i traversed the diningroom slowly  i thought  shes listening to my footsteps she cant help it shell hear me open and shut that door  and i closed it as gently behind me as if i had been a thief retreating with his illgotten booty  during that stealthy act i experienced the last touch of emotion in that house at the thought of the girl i had left sitting there in the obscurity with her heavy hair and empty eyes as black as the night itself staring into the walled garden silent warm odorous with the perfume of imprisoned flowers which like herself were lost to sight in a world buried in darkness  the narrow illlighted rustic streets i knew so well on my way to the harbour were extremely quiet  i felt in my heart that the further one ventures the better one understands how everything in our life is common short and empty that it is in seeking the unknown in our sensations that we discover how mediocre are our attempts and how soon defeated  jacobuss boatman was waiting at the steps with an unusual air of readiness  he put me alongside the ship but did not give me his confidential goodevening sah and instead of shoving off at once remained holding by the ladder  i was a thousand miles from commercial affairs when on the dark quarterdeck mr burns positively rushed at me stammering with excitement  he had been pacing the deck distractedly for hours awaiting my arrival  just before sunset a lighter loaded with potatoes had come alongside with that fat shipchandler himself sitting on the pile of sacks  he was now stuck immovable in the cabin  what was the meaning of it all  surely i did not  yes mr burns i did i cut him short  he was beginning to make gestures of despair when i stopped that too by giving him the key of my desk and desiring him in a tone which admitted of no argument to go below at once pay mr jacobuss bill and send him out of the ship  i dont want to see him i confessed frankly climbing the poop ladder  i felt extremely tired  dropping on the seat of the skylight i gave myself up to idle gazing at the lights about the quay and at the black mass of the mountain on the south side of the harbour  i never heard jacobus leave the ship with every single sovereign of my ready cash in his pocket  i never heard anything till a long time afterwards mr burns unable to contain himself any longer intruded upon me with his ridiculously angry lamentations at my weakness and good nature  of course theres plenty of room in the afterhatch  but they are sure to go rotten down there  well  i never heard    seventeen tons  i suppose i must hoist in that lot first thing to morrow morning  i suppose you must  unless you drop them overboard  but im afraid you cant do that  i wouldnt mind myself but its forbidden to throw rubbish into the harbour you know  that is the truest word you have said for many a day sir rubbish  thats just what i expect they are  nearly eighty good gold sovereigns gone a perfectly clean sweep of your drawer sir bless me if i understand  as it was impossible to throw the right light on this commercial transaction i left him to his lamentations and under the impression that i was a hopeless fool  next day i did not go ashore  for one thing i had no money to go ashore withno not enough to buy a cigarette  jacobus had made a clean sweep  but that was not the only reason  the pearl of the ocean had in a few short hours grown odious to me  and i did not want to meet any one  my reputation had suffered  i knew i was the object of unkind and sarcastic comments  the following morning at sunrise just as our sternfasts had been let go and the tug plucked us out from between the buoys i saw jacobus standing up in his boat  the nigger was pulling hard several baskets of provisions for ships were stowed between the thwarts  the father of alice was going his morning round  his countenance was tranquil and friendly  he raised his arm and shouted something with great heartiness  but his voice was of the sort that doesnt carry any distance all i could catch faintly or rather guess at were the words next time and quite correct and it was only of these last that i was certain  raising my arm perfunctorily for all response i turned away  i rather resented the familiarity of the thing  hadnt i settled accounts finally with him by means of that potato bargain  this being a harbour story it is not my purpose to speak of our passage  i was glad enough to be at sea but not with the gladness of old days  formerly i had no memories to take away with me  i shared in the blessed forgetfulness of sailors that forgetfulness natural and invincible which resembles innocence in so far that it prevents selfexamination  now however i remembered the girl during the first few days i was for ever questioning myself as to the nature of facts and sensations connected with her person and with my conduct  and i must say also that mr burns intolerable fussing with those potatoes was not calculated to make me forget the part which i had played  he looked upon it as a purely commercial transaction of a particularly foolish kind and his devotionif it was devotion and not mere cussedness as i came to regard it before longinspired him with a zeal to minimise my loss as much as possible  oh yes he took care of those infamous potatoes with a vengeance as the saying goes  everlastingly there was a tackle over the afterhatch and everlastingly the watch on deck were pulling up spreading out picking over rebagging and lowering down again some part of that lot of potatoes  my bargain with all its remotest associations mental and visualthe garden of flowers and scents the girl with her provoking contempt and her tragic loneliness of a hopeless castawaywas everlastingly dangled before my eyes for thousands of miles along the open sea  and as if by a satanic refinement of irony it was accompanied by a most awful smell  whiffs from decaying potatoes pursued me on the poop they mingled with my thoughts with my food poisoned my very dreams  they made an atmosphere of corruption for the ship  i remonstrated with mr burns about this excessive care  i would have been well content to batten the hatch down and let them perish under the deck  that perhaps would have been unsafe  the horrid emanations might have flavoured the cargo of sugar  they seemed strong enough to taint the very ironwork  in addition mr burns made it a personal matter  he assured me he knew how to treat a cargo of potatoes at seahad been in the trade as a boy he said  he meant to make my loss as small as possible  what between his devotionit must have been devotionand his vanity i positively dared not give him the order to throw my commercialventure overboard  i believe he would have refused point blank to obey my lawful command  an unprecedented and comical situation would have been created with which i did not feel equal to deal  i welcomed the coming of bad weather as no sailor had ever done when at last i hove the ship to to pick up the pilot outside port philip heads the afterhatch had not been opened for more than a week and i might have believed that no such thing as a potato had ever been on board  it was an abominable day raw blustering with great squalls of wind and rain the pilot a cheery person looked after the ship and chatted to me streaming from head to foot and the heavier the lash of the downpour the more pleased with himself and everything around him he seemed to be  he rubbed his wet hands with a satisfaction which to me who had stood that kind of thing for several days and nights seemed inconceivable in any nonaquatic creature  you seem to enjoy getting wet pilot i remarked  he had a bit of land round his house in the suburbs and it was of his garden he was thinking  at the sound of the word garden unheard unspoken for so many days i had a vision of gorgeous colour of sweet scents of a girlish figure crouching in a chair yes  that was a distinct emotion breaking into the peace i had found in the sleepless anxieties of my responsibility during a week of dangerous bad weather  the colony the pilot explained had suffered from unparalleled drought  this was the first decent drop of water they had had for seven months  the root crops were lost and trying to be casual but with visible interest he asked me if i had perchance any potatoes to spare  potatoes  i had managed to forget them  in a moment i felt plunged into corruption up to my neck  mr burns was making eyes at me behind the pilots back  finally he obtained a ton and paid ten pounds for it  this was twice the price of my bargain with jacobus  the spirit of covetousness woke up in me  that night in harbour before i slept the custom house galley came alongside  while his underlings were putting seals on the storerooms the officer in charge took me aside confidentially  i say captain you dont happen to have any potatoes to sell  clearly there was a potato famine in the land  i let him have a ton for twelve pounds and he went away joyfully  that night i dreamt of a pile of gold in the form of a grave in which a girl was buried and woke up callous with greed  on calling at my ship brokers office that man after the usual business had been transacted pushed his spectacles up on his forehead  i was thinking captain that coming from the pearl of the ocean you may have some potatoes to sell  i said negligently  oh yes i could spare you a ton  fifteen pounds  he exclaimed  i say  but after studying my face for a while accepted my terms with a faint grimace  it seems that these people could not exist without potatoes  i could  i didnt want to see a potato as long as i lived but the demon of lucre had taken possession of me  how the news got about i dont know but returning on board rather late i found a small group of men of the coster type hanging about the waist while mr burns walked to and fro the quarterdeck loftily keeping a triumphant eye on them they had come to buy potatoes  these chaps have been waiting here in the sun for hours burns whispered to me excitedly  they have drank the watercask dry dont you throw away your chances sir  you are too goodnatured  i selected a man with thick legs and a man with a cast in his eye to negotiate with simply because they were easily distinguishable from the rest  you have the money on you i inquired before taking them down into the cabin  yes sir they answered in one voice slapping their pockets  i liked their air of quiet determination  long before the end of the day all the potatoes were sold at about three times the price i had paid for them  mr burns feverish and exulting congratulated himself on his skilful care of my commercial venture but hinted plainly that i ought to have made more of it  that night i did not sleep very well  i thought of jacobus by fits and starts between snatches of dreams concerned with castaways starving on a desert island covered with flowers  it was extremely unpleasant  in the morning tired and unrefreshed i sat down and wrote a long letter to my owners giving them a carefullythought out scheme for the ships employment in the east and about the china seas for the next two years  i spent the day at that task and felt somewhat more at peace when it was done  their reply came in due course  they were greatly struck with my project but considering that notwithstanding the unfortunate difficulty with the bags which they trusted i would know how to guard against in the future the voyage showed a very fair profit they thought it would be better to keep the ship in the sugar tradeat least for the present  i turned over the page and read on  we have had a letter from our good friend mr jacobus  we are pleased to see how well you have hit it off with him for not to speak of his assistance in the unfortunate matter of the bags he writes us that should you by using all possible dispatch manage to bring the ship back early in the season he would be able to give us a good rate of freight  we have no doubt that your best endeavours    etc   etc  i dropped the letter and sat motionless for a long time  then i wrote my answer it was a short one and went ashore myself to post it  but i passed one letterbox then another and in the end found myself going up collins street with the letter still in my pocketagainst my heart  collins street at four oclock in the afternoon is not exactly a desert solitude but i had never felt more isolated from the rest of mankind as when i walked that day its crowded pavement battling desperately with my thoughts and feeling already vanquished  there came a moment when the awful tenacity of jacobus the man of one passion and of one idea appeared to me almost heroic  he had not given me up  he had gone again to his odious brother  and then he appeared to me odious himself  was it for his own sake or for the sake of the poor girl  and on that last supposition the memory of the kiss which missed my lips appalled me for whatever he had seen or guessed at or risked he knew nothing of that unless the girl had told him  how could i go back to fan that fatal spark with my cold breath  no no that unexpected kiss had to be paid for at its full price  at the first letterbox i came to i stopped and reaching into my breastpocket i took out the letterit was as if i were plucking out my very heartand dropped it through the slit  then i went straight on board  i wondered what dreams i would have that night but as it turned out i did not sleep at all  at breakfast i informed mr burns that i had resigned my command  he dropped his knife and fork and looked at me with indignation  you have sir  i thought you loved the ship  so i do burns i said  but the fact is that the indian ocean and everything that is in it has lost its charm for me  i am going home as passenger by the suez canal  everything that is in it he repeated angrily  ive never heard anybody talk like this  and to tell you the truth sir all the time we have been together ive never quite made you out  whats one ocean more than another  charm indeed  he was really devoted to me i believe  but he cheered up when i told him that i had recommended him for my successor  anyhow he remarked let people say what they like this jacobus has served your turn  i must admit that this potato business has paid extremely well  of course if only you had  yes mr burns i interrupted  quite a smile of fortune  but i could not tell him that it was driving me out of the ship i had learned to love  and as i sat heavyhearted at that parting seeing all my plans destroyed my modest future endangeredfor this command was like a foot in the stirrup for a young manhe gave up completely for the first time his critical attitude  a wonderful piece of luck he said     the secret shareran episode from the coast     chapter i    on my right hand there were lines of fishingstakes resembling a mysterious system of halfsubmerged bamboo fences incomprehensible in its division of the domain of tropical fishes and crazy of aspect as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen now gone to the other end of the ocean for there was no sign of human habitation as far as the eye could reach  to the left a group of barren islets suggesting ruins of stone walls towers and blockhouses had its foundations set in a blue sea that itself looked solid so still and stable did it lie below my feet even the track of light from the westering sun shone smoothly without that animated glitter which tells of an imperceptible ripple  and when i turned my head to take a parting glance at the tug which had just left us anchored outside the bar i saw the straight line of the flat shore joined to the stable sea edge to edge with a perfect and unmarked closeness in one levelled floor half brown half blue under the enormous dome of the sky  corresponding in their insignificance to the islets of the sea two small clumps of trees one on each side of the only fault in the impeccable joint marked the mouth of the river meinam we had just left on the first preparatory stage of our homeward journey and far back on the inland level a larger and loftier mass the grove surrounding the great paknam pagoda was the only thing on which the eye could rest from the vain task of exploring the monotonous sweep of the horizon  here and there gleams as of a few scattered pieces of silver marked the windings of the great river and on the nearest of them just within the bar the tug steaming right into the land became lost to my sight hull and funnel and masts as though the impassive earth had swallowed her up without an effort without a tremor  my eye followed the light cloud of her smoke now here now there above the plain according to the devious curves of the stream but always fainter and farther away till i lost it at last behind the mitreshaped hill of the great pagoda  and then i was left alone with my ship anchored at the head of the gulf of siam  she floated at the startingpoint of a long journey very still in an immense stillness the shadows of her spars flung far to the eastward by the setting sun  at that moment i was alone on her decks  there was not a sound in herand around us nothing moved nothing lived not a canoe on the water not a bird in the air not a cloud in the sky  in this breathless pause at the threshold of a long passage we seemed to be measuring our fitness for a long and arduous enterprise the appointed task of both our existences to be carried out far from all human eyes with only sky and sea for spectators and for judges  there must have been some glare in the air to interfere with ones sight because it was only just before the sun left us that my roaming eyes made out beyond the highest ridge of the principal islet of the group something which did away with the solemnity of perfect solitude  the tide of darkness flowed on swiftly and with tropical suddenness a swarm of stars came out above the shadowy earth while i lingered yet my hand resting lightly on my ships rail as if on the shoulder of a trusted friend  but with all that multitude of celestial bodies staring down at one the comfort of quiet communion with her was gone for good  and there were also disturbing sounds by this timevoices footsteps forward the steward flitted along the maindeck a busily ministering spirit a handbell tinkled urgently under the poopdeck     i found my two officers waiting for me near the supper table in the lighted cuddy  we sat down at once and as i helped the chief mate i said  are you aware that there is a ship anchored inside the islands  i saw her mastheads above the ridge as the sun went down  he raised sharply his simple face overcharged by a terrible growth of whisker and emitted his usual ejaculations  bless my soul sir  you dont say so  my second mate was a roundcheeked silent young man grave beyond his years i thought but as our eyes happened to meet i detected a slight quiver on his lips  i looked down at once  it was not my part to encourage sneering on board my ship  it must be said too that i knew very little of my officers  in consequence of certain events of no particular significance except to myself i had been appointed to the command only a fortnight before  neither did i know much of the hands forward  all these people had been together for eighteen months or so and my position was that of the only stranger on board  i mention this because it has some bearing on what is to follow  but what i felt most was my being a stranger to the ship and if all the truth must be told i was somewhat of a stranger to myself  the youngest man on board barring the second mate and untried as yet by a position of the fullest responsibility i was willing to take the adequacy of the others for granted  they had simply to be equal to their tasks but i wondered how far i should turn out faithful to that ideal conception of ones own personality every man sets up for himself secretly   meantime the chief mate with an almost visible effect of collaboration on the part of his round eyes and frightful whiskers was trying to evolve a theory of the anchored ship  his dominant trait was to take all things into earnest consideration  he was of a painstaking turn of mind  as he used to say he liked to account to himself for practically everything that came in his way down to a miserable scorpion he had found in his cabin a week before  the why and the wherefore of that scorpionhow it got on board and came to select his room rather than the pantry which was a dark place and more what a scorpion would be partial to and how on earth it managed to drown itself in the inkwell of his writing deskhad exercised him infinitely  the ship within the islands was much more easily accounted for and just as we were about to rise from table he made his pronouncement  she was he doubted not a ship from home lately arrived  probably she drew too much water to cross the bar except at the top of spring tides therefore she went into that natural harbour to wait for a few days in preference to remaining in an open roadstead  thats so confirmed the second mate suddenly in his slightly hoarse voice  she draws over twenty feet  shes the liverpool ship sephora with a cargo of coal  hundred and twentythree days from cardiff  we looked at him in surprise  the tugboat skipper told me when he came on board for your letters sir explained the young man  he expects to take her up the river the day after tomorrow  after thus overwhelming us with the extent of his information he slipped out of the cabin  the mate observed regretfully that he could not account for that young fellows whims  what prevented him telling us all about it at once he wanted to know  i detained him as he was making a move  for the last two days the crew had had plenty of hard work and the night before they had very little sleep  i felt painfully that ia strangerwas doing something unusual when i directed him to let all hands turn in without setting an anchorwatch  i proposed to keep on deck myself till one oclock or thereabouts  i would get the second mate to relieve me at that hour  he will turn out the cook and the steward at four i concluded and then give you a call  of course at the slightest sign of any sort of wind well have the hands up and make a start at once  he concealed his astonishment  very well sir  outside the cuddy he put his head in the second mates door to inform him of my unheardof caprice to take a five hours anchorwatch on myself  i heard the other raise his voice incredulouslywhat  the captain himself  then a few more murmurs a door closed then another  a few moments later i went on deck  my strangeness which had made me sleepless had prompted that unconventional arrangement as if i had expected in those solitary hours of the night to get on terms with the ship of which i knew nothing manned by men of whom i knew very little more  fast alongside a wharf littered like any ship in port with a tangle of unrelated things invaded by unrelated shore people i had hardly seen her yet properly  now as she lay cleared for sea the stretch of her maindeck seemed to me very fine under the stars very fine very roomy for her size and very inviting  i descended the poop and paced the waist my mind picturing to myself the coming passage through the malay archipelago down the indian ocean and up the atlantic  all its phases were familiar enough to me every characteristic all the alternatives which were likely to face me on the high seaseverything    except the novel responsibility of command  but i took heart from the reasonable thought that the ship was like other ships the men like other men and that the sea was not likely to keep any special surprises expressly for my discomfiture  arrived at that comforting conclusion i bethought myself of a cigar and went below to get it  all was still down there everybody at the after end of the ship was sleeping profoundly  i came out again on the quarterdeck agreeably at ease in my sleepingsuit on that warm breathless night barefooted a glowing cigar in my teeth and going forward i was met by the profound silence of the fore end of the ship  only as i passed the door of the forecastle i heard a deep quiet trustful sigh of some sleeper inside  and suddenly i rejoiced in the great security of the sea as compared with the unrest of the land in my choice of that untempted life presenting no disquieting problems invested with an elementary moral beauty by the absolute straightforwardness of its appeal and by the singleness of its purpose  the ridinglight in the forerigging burned with a clear untroubled as if symbolic flame confident and bright in the mysterious shades of the night  passing on my way aft along the other side of the ship i observed that the rope sideladder put over no doubt for the master of the tug when he came to fetch away our letters had not been hauled in as it should have been  i became annoyed at this for exactitude in small matters is the very soul of discipline  then i reflected that i had myself peremptorily dismissed my officers from duty and by my own act had prevented the anchorwatch being formally set and things properly attended to  i asked myself whether it was wise ever to interfere with the established routine of duties even from the kindest of motives  my action might have made me appear eccentric  goodness only knew how that absurdly whiskered mate would account for my conduct and what the whole ship thought of that informality of their new captain  i was vexed with myself  not from compunction certainly but as it were mechanically i proceeded to get the ladder in myself  now a sideladder of that sort is a light affair and comes in easily yet my vigorous tug which should have brought it flying on board merely recoiled upon my body in a totally unexpected jerk  what the devil    i was so astounded by the immovableness of that ladder that i remained stockstill trying to account for it to myself like that imbecile mate of mine  in the end of course i put my head over the rail  the side of the ship made an opaque belt of shadow on the darkling glassy shimmer of the sea  but i saw at once something elongated and pale floating very close to the ladder  before i could form a guess a faint flash of phosphorescent light which seemed to issue suddenly from the naked body of a man flickered in the sleeping water with the elusive silent play of summer lightning in a night sky  with a gasp i saw revealed to my stare a pair of feet the long legs a broad livid back immersed right up to the neck in a greenish cadaverous glow  one hand awash clutched the bottom rung of the ladder  he was complete but for the head  a headless corpse  the cigar dropped out of my gaping mouth with a tiny plop and a short hiss quite audible in the absolute stillness of all things under heaven  at that i suppose he raised up his face a dimly pale oval in the shadow of the ships side  but even then i could only barely make out down there the shape of his blackhaired head  however it was enough for the horrid frostbound sensation which had gripped me about the chest to pass off  the moment of vain exclamations was past too  i only climbed on the spare spar and leaned over the rail as far as i could to bring my eyes nearer to that mystery floating alongside  as he hung by the ladder like a resting swimmer the sealightning played about his limbs at every stir and he appeared in it ghastly silvery fishlike  he remained as mute as a fish too he made no motion to get out of the water either  it was inconceivable that he should not attempt to come on board and strangely troubling to suspect that perhaps he did not want to and my first words were prompted by just that troubled incertitude  whats the matter i asked in my ordinary tone speaking down to the face upturned exactly under mine  cramp it answered no louder  then slightly anxious i say no need to call any one  i was not going to i said  are you alone on deck  yes  i had somehow the impression that he was on the point of letting go the ladder to swim away beyond my kenmysterious as he came  but for the moment this being appearing as if he had risen from the bottom of the sea it was certainly the nearest land to the ship wanted only to know the time  i told him  and he down there tentatively  i suppose your captains turned in  i am sure he isnt i said  he seemed to struggle with himself for i heard something like the low bitter murmur of doubt  whats the good  his next words came out with a hesitating effort  look here my man  could you call him out quietly  i thought the time had come to declare myself  i am the captain  i heard a by jove whispered at the level of the water  the phosphorescence flashed in the swirl of the water all about his limbs his other hand seized the ladder  my names leggatt  the voice was calm and resolute  a good voice  the self possession of that man had somehow induced a corresponding state in myself  it was very quietly that i remarked  you must be a good swimmer  yes  ive been in the water practically since nine oclock  the question for me now is whether i am to let go this ladder and go on swimming till i sink from exhaustion orto come on board here  i felt this was no mere formula of desperate speech but a real alternative in the view of a strong soul  i should have gathered from this that he was young indeed it is only the young who are ever confronted by such clear issues  but at the time it was pure intuition on my part  a mysterious communication was established already between us twoin the face of that silent darkened tropical sea  i was young too young enough to make no comment the man in the water began suddenly to climb up the ladder and i hastened away from the rail to fetch some clothes  before entering the cabin i stood still listening in the lobby at the foot of the stairs  a faint snore came through the closed door of the chief mates room  the second mates door was on the hook but the darkness in there was absolutely soundless  he too was young and could sleep like a stone  remained the steward but he was not likely to wake up before he was called  i got a sleeping suit out of my room and coming back on deck saw the naked man from the sea sitting on the mainhatch glimmering white in the darkness his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands  in a moment he had concealed his damp body in a sleepingsuit of the same greystripe pattern as the one i was wearing and followed me like my double on the poop  together we moved right aft barefooted silent  what is it i asked in a deadened voice taking the lighted lamp out of the binnacle and raising it to his face  an ugly business  he had rather regular features a good mouth light eyes under somewhat heavy dark eyebrows a smooth square forehead no growth on his cheeks a small brown moustache and a wellshaped round chin  his expression was concentrated meditative under the inspecting light of the lamp i held up to his face such as a man thinking hard in solitude might wear  my sleepingsuit was just right for his size  a wellknit young fellow of twentyfive at most  he caught his lower lip with the edge of white even teeth  yes i said replacing the lamp in the binnacle  the warm heavy tropical night closed upon his head again  theres a ship over there he murmured  yes i know  the sephora  did you know of us  hadnt the slightest idea  i am the mate of her  he paused and corrected himself  i should say i was  aha  something wrong  yes  very wrong indeed  ive killed a man  what do you mean  just now  no on the passage  weeks ago  thirtynine south  when i say a man  fit of temper i suggested confidently  the shadowy dark head like mine seemed to nod imperceptibly above the ghostly grey of my sleepingsuit  it was in the night as though i had been faced by my own reflection in the depths of a sombre and immense mirror  a pretty thing to have to own up to for a conway boy murmured my double distinctly  youre a conway boy  i am he said as if startled  then slowly    perhaps you too  it was so but being a couple of years older i had left before he joined  after a quick interchange of dates a silence fell and i thought suddenly of my absurd mate with his terrific whiskers and the bless my soulyou dont say so type of intellect  my double gave me an inkling of his thoughts by saying  my fathers a parson in norfolk  do you see me before a judge and jury on that charge  for myself i cant see the necessity  there are fellows that an angel from heavenand i am not that  he was one of those creatures that are just simmering all the time with a silly sort of wickedness  miserable devils that have no business to live at all  he wouldnt do his duty and wouldnt let anybody else do theirs  but whats the good of talking  you know well enough the sort of illconditioned snarling cur  he appealed to me as if our experiences had been as identical as our clothes  and i knew well enough the pestiferous danger of such a character where there are no means of legal repression  and i knew well enough also that my double there was no homicidal ruffian  i did not think of asking him for details and he told me the story roughly in brusque disconnected sentences  i needed no more  i saw it all going on as though i were myself inside that other sleepingsuit  it happened while we were setting a reefed foresail at dusk reefed foresail  you understand the sort of weather  the only sail we had left to keep the ship running so you may guess what it had been like for days  anxious sort of job that  he gave me some of his cursed insolence at the sheet  i tell you i was overdone with this terrific weather that seemed to have no end to it  terrific i tell youand a deep ship  i believe the fellow himself was half crazed with funk  it was no time for gentlemanly reproof so i turned round and felled him like an ox  he up and at me  we closed just as an awful sea made for the ship  all hands saw it coming and took to the rigging but i had him by the throat and went on shaking him like a rat the men above us yelling look out look out  then a crash as if the sky had fallen on my head they say that for over ten minutes hardly anything was to be seen of the shipjust the three masts and a bit of the forecastle head and of the poop all awash driving along in a smother of foam  it was a miracle that they found us jammed together behind the forebits  its clear that i meant business because i was holding him by the throat still when they picked us up  he was black in the face  it was too much for them  it seems they rushed us aft together gripped as we were screaming murder like a lot of lunatics and broke into the cuddy  and the ship running for her life touch and go all the time any minute her last in a sea fit to turn your hair grey only alooking at it  i understand that the skipper too started raving like the rest of them  the man had been deprived of sleep for more than a week and to have this sprung on him at the height of a furious gale nearly drove him out of his mind  i wonder they didnt fling me overboard after getting the carcass of their precious shipmate out of my fingers  they had rather a job to separate us ive been told  a sufficiently fierce story to make an old judge and a respectable jury sit up a bit  the first thing i heard when i came to myself was the maddening howling of that endless gale and on that the voice of the old man  he was hanging on to my bunk staring into my face out of his souwester  mr leggatt you have killed a man  you can act no longer as chief mate of this ship  his care to subdue his voice made it sound monotonous  he rested a hand on the end of the skylight to steady himself with and all that time did not stir a limb so far as i could see  nice little tale for a quiet teaparty he concluded in the same tone  one of my hands too rested on the end of the skylight neither did i stir a limb so far as i knew  we stood less than a foot from each other  it occurred to me that if old bless my soulyou dont say so were to put his head up the companion and catch sight of us he would think he was seeing double or imagine himself come upon a scene of weird witchcraft the strange captain having a quiet confabulation by the wheel with his own grey ghost  i became very much concerned to prevent anything of the sort  i heard the others soothing undertone  my fathers a parson in norfolk it said  evidently he had forgotten he had told me this important fact before  truly a nice little tale  you had better slip down into my stateroom now i said moving off stealthily  my double followed my movements our bare feet made no sound i let him in closed the door with care and after giving a call to the second mate returned on deck for my relief  not much sign of any wind yet i remarked when he approached  no sir  not much he assented sleepily in his hoarse voice with just enough deference no more and barely suppressing a yawn  well thats all you have to look out for  you have got your orders  yes sir  i paced a turn or two on the poop and saw him take up his position face forward with his elbow in the ratlines of the mizzenrigging before i went below  the mates faint snoring was still going on peacefully  the cuddy lamp was burning over the table on which stood a vase with flowers a polite attention from the ships provision merchantthe last flowers we should see for the next three months at the very least  two bunches of bananas hung from the beam symmetrically one on each side of the ruddercasing everything was as before in the shipexcept that two of her captains sleepingsuits were simultaneously in use one motionless in the cuddy the other keeping very still in the captains stateroom  it must be explained here that my cabin had the form of the capital letter l the door being within the angle and opening into the short part of the letter  a couch was to the left the bedplace to the right my writingdesk and the chronometers table faced the door but any one opening it unless he stepped right inside had no view of what i call the long or vertical part of the letter  it contained some lockers surmounted by a bookcase and a few clothes a thick jacket or two caps oilskin coat and such like hung on hooks  there was at the bottom of that part a door opening into my bathroom which could be entered also directly from the saloon but that way was never used  the mysterious arrival had discovered the advantage of this particular shape  entering my room lighted strongly by a big bulkhead lamp swung on gimbals above my writingdesk i did not see him anywhere till he stepped out quietly from behind the coats hung in the recessed part  i heard somebody moving about and went in there at once he whispered  i too spoke under my breath  nobody is likely to come in here without knocking and getting permission  he nodded  his face was thin and the sunburn faded as though he had been ill  and no wonder  he had been i heard presently kept under arrest in his cabin for nearly seven weeks  but there was nothing sickly in his eyes or in his expression  he was not a bit like me really yet as we stood leaning over my bedplace whispering side by side with our dark heads together and our backs to the door anybody bold enough to open it stealthily would have been treated to the uncanny sight of a double captain busy talking in whispers with his other self  but all this doesnt tell me how you came to hang on to our side ladder i inquired in the hardly audible murmurs we used after he had told me something more of the proceedings on board the sephora once the bad weather was over  when we sighted java head i had had time to think all those matters out several times over  i had six weeks of doing nothing else and with only an hour or so every evening for a tramp on the quarterdeck  he whispered his arms folded on the side of my bedplace staring through the open port  and i could imagine perfectly the manner of this thinking outa stubborn if not a steadfast operation something of which i should have been perfectly incapable  i reckoned it would be dark before we closed with the land he continued so low that i had to strain my hearing near as we were to each other shoulder touching shoulder almost  so i asked to speak to the old man  he always seemed very sick when he came to see meas if he could not look me in the face  you know that foresail saved the ship  she was too deep to have run long under bare poles  and it was i that managed to set it for him  anyway he came  when i had him in my cabinhe stood by the door looking at me as if i had the halter round my neck alreadyi asked him right away to leave my cabin door unlocked at night while the ship was going through sunda straits  there would be the java coast within two or three miles off angier point  i wanted nothing more  ive had a prize for swimming my second year in the conway  i can believe it i breathed out  god only knows why they locked me in every night  to see some of their faces youd have thought they were afraid id go about at night strangling people  am i a murdering brute  do i look it by jove if i had been he wouldnt have trusted himself like that into my room  youll say i might have chucked him aside and bolted out there and thenit was dark already  well no  and for the same reason i wouldnt think of trying to smash the door  there would have been a rush to stop me at the noise and i did not mean to get into a confounded scrimmage  somebody else might have got killedfor i would not have broken out only to get chucked back and i did not want any more of that work  he refused looking more sick than ever  he was afraid of the men and also of that old second mate of his who had been sailing with him for yearsa grey headed old humbug and his steward too had been with him devil knows how longseventeen years or morea dogmatic sort of loafer who hated me like poison just because i was the chief mate  no chief mate ever made more than one voyage in the sephora you know those two old chaps ran the ship  devil only knows what the skipper wasnt afraid of all his nerve went to pieces altogether in that hellish spell of bad weather we hadof what the law would do to himof his wife perhaps  oh yes shes on board  though i dont think she would have meddled  she would have been only too glad to have me out of the ship in any way  the brand of cain business dont you see  thats all right  i was ready enough to go off wandering on the face of the earthand that was price enough to pay for an abel of that sort  anyhow he wouldnt listen to me  this thing must take its course  i represent the law here  he was shaking like a leaf  so you wont  no  then i hope you will be able to sleep on that i said and turned my back on him  i wonder that you can cries he and locks the door  well after that i couldnt  not very well  that was three weeks ago  we have had a slow passage through the java sea drifted about carimata for ten days  when we anchored here they thought i suppose it was all right  the nearest land and thats five miles is the ships destination the consul would soon set about catching me and there would have been no object in bolting to these islets there  i dont suppose theres a drop of water on them  i dont know how it was but tonight that steward after bringing me my supper went out to let me eat it and left the door unlocked  and i ate itall there was too  after i had finished i strolled out on the quarterdeck  i dont know that i meant to do anything  a breath of fresh air was all i wanted i believe  then a sudden temptation came over me  i kicked off my slippers and was in the water before i had made up my mind fairly  somebody heard the splash and they raised an awful hullabaloo  hes gone  lower the boats  hes committed suicide  no hes swimming  certainly i was swimming  its not so easy for a swimmer like me to commit suicide by drowning  i landed on the nearest islet before the boat left the ships side  i heard them pulling about in the dark hailing and so on but after a bit they gave up  everything quieted down and the anchorage became as still as death  i sat down on a stone and began to think  i felt certain they would start searching for me at daylight  there was no place to hide on those stony thingsand if there had been what would have been the good  but now i was clear of that ship i was not going back  so after a while i took off all my clothes tied them up in a bundle with a stone inside and dropped them in the deep water on the outer side of that islet  that was suicide enough for me  let them think what they liked but i didnt mean to drown myself  i meant to swim till i sankbut thats not the same thing  i struck out for another of these little islands and it was from that one that i first saw your ridinglight  something to swim for  i went on easily and on the way i came upon a flat rock a foot or two above water  in the daytime i dare say you might make it out with a glass from your poop  i scrambled up on it and rested myself for a bit  then i made another start  that last spell must have been over a mile  his whisper was getting fainter and fainter and all the time he stared straight out through the porthole in which there was not even a star to be seen  i had not interrupted him  there was something that made comment impossible in his narrative or perhaps in himself a sort of feeling a quality which i cant find a name for  and when he ceased all i found was a futile whisper  so you swam for our light  yesstraight for it  it was something to swim for  i couldnt see any stars low down because the coast was in the way and i couldnt see the land either  the water was like glass  one might have been swimming in a confounded thousandfeet deep cistern with no place for scrambling out anywhere but what i didnt like was the notion of swimming round and round like a crazed bullock before i gave out and as i didnt mean to go back    no  do you see me being hauled back stark naked off one of these little islands by the scruff of the neck and fighting like a wild beast somebody would have got killed for certain and i did not want any of that  so i went on  then your ladder  why didnt you hail the ship i asked a little louder  he touched my shoulder lightly  lazy footsteps came right over our heads and stopped  the second mate had crossed from the other side of the poop and might have been hanging over the rail for all we knew  he couldnt hear us talkingcould he  my double breathed into my very ear anxiously  his anxiety was an answer a sufficient answer to the question i had put to him  an answer containing all the difficulty of that situation  i closed the porthole quietly to make sure  a louder word might have been overheard  whos that he whispered then  my second mate  but i dont know much more of the fellow than you do  and i told him a little about myself  i had been appointed to take charge while i least expected anything of the sort not quite a fortnight ago  i didnt know either the ship or the people hadnt had the time in port to look about me or size anybody up and as to the crew all they knew was that i was appointed to take the ship home  for the rest i was almost as much of a stranger on board as himself i said  and at the moment i felt it most acutely  i felt that it would take very little to make me a suspect person in the eyes of the ships company  he had turned about meantime and we the two strangers in the ship faced each other in identical attitudes  your ladder he murmured after a silence  whod have thought of finding a ladder hanging over at night in a ship anchored out here  i felt just then a very unpleasant faintness  after the life ive been leading for nine weeks anybody would have got out of condition  i wasnt capable of swimming round as far as your rudderchains  and lo and behold there was a ladder to get hold of  after i gripped it i said to myself whats the good  when i saw a mans head looking over i thought i would swim away presently and leave him shoutingin whatever language it was  i didnt mind being looked at  ii liked it  and then you speaking to me so quietlyas if you had expected memade me hold on a little longer  it had been a confounded lonely timei dont mean while swimming  i was glad to talk a little to somebody that didnt belong to the sephora  as to asking for the captain that was a mere impulse  it could have been no use with all the ship knowing about me and the other people pretty certain to be round here in the morning  i dont knowi wanted to be seen to talk with somebody before i went on  i dont know what i would have said    fine night isnt it or something of the sort  do you think they will be round here presently i asked with some incredulity  quite likely he said faintly  he looked extremely haggard all of a sudden  his head rolled on his shoulders  hm  we shall see then  meantime get into that bed i whispered  want help  there  it was a rather high bedplace with a set of drawers underneath this amazing swimmer really needed the lift i gave him by seizing his leg  he tumbled in rolled over on his back and flung one arm across his eyes  and then with his face nearly hidden he must have looked exactly as i used to look in that bed  i gazed upon my other self for a while before drawing across carefully the two green serge curtains which ran on a brass rod  i thought for a moment of pinning them together for greater safety but i sat down on the couch and once there i felt unwilling to rise and hunt for a pin  i would do it in a moment  i was extremely tired in a peculiarly intimate way by the strain of stealthiness by the effort of whispering and the general secrecy of this excitement it was three oclock by now and i had been on my feet since nine but i was not sleepy i could not have gone to sleep  i sat there fagged out looking at the curtains trying to clear my mind of the confused sensation of being in two places at once and greatly bothered by an exasperating knocking in my head  it was a relief to discover suddenly that it was not in my head at all but on the outside of the door  before i could collect myself the words come in were out of my mouth and the steward entered with a tray bringing in my morning coffee  i had slept after all and i was so frightened that i shouted this way  i am here steward as though he had been miles away  he put down the tray on the table next the couch and only then said very quietly i can see you are here sir  i felt him give me a keen look but i dared not meet his eyes just then  he must have wondered why i had drawn the curtains of my bed before going to sleep on the couch  he went out hooking the door open as usual  i heard the crew washing decks above me  i knew i would have been told at once if there had been any wind  calm i thought and i was doubly vexed  indeed i felt dual more than ever  the steward reappeared suddenly in the doorway  i jumped up from the couch so quickly that he gave a start  what do you want here  close your port sirthey are washing decks  it is closed i said reddening  very well sir  but he did not move from the doorway and returned my stare in an extraordinary equivocal manner for a time then his eyes wavered all his expression changed and in a voice unusually gentle almost coaxingly  may i come in to take the empty cup away sir  of course  i turned my back on him while he popped in and out then i unhooked and closed the door and even pushed the bolt  this sort of thing could not go on very long  the cabin was as hot as an oven too  i took a peep at my double and discovered that he had not moved his arm was still over his eyes but his chest heaved his hair was wet his chin glistened with perspiration  i reached over him and opened the port  i must show myself on deck i reflected  of course theoretically i could do what i liked with no one to say nay to me within the whole circle of the horizon but to lock my cabin door and take the key away i did not dare  directly i put my head out of the companion i saw the group of my two officers the second mate barefooted the chief mate in long indiarubber boots near the break of the poop and the steward halfway down the poopladder talking to them eagerly  he happened to catch sight of me and dived the second ran down on the maindeck shouting some order or other and the chief mate came to meet me touching his cap  there was a sort of curiosity in his eye that i did not like  i dont know whether the steward had told them that i was queer only or downright drunk but i know the man meant to have a good look at me  i watched him coming with a smile which as he got into pointblank range took effect and froze his very whiskers  i did not give him time to open his lips  square the yards by lifts and braces before the hands go to breakfast  it was the first particular order i had given on board that ship and i stayed on deck to see it executed too  i had felt the need of asserting myself without loss of time  that sneering young cub got taken down a peg or two on that occasion and i also seized the opportunity of having a good look at the face of every foremast man as they filed past me to go to the after braces  at breakfast time eating nothing myself i presided with such frigid dignity that the two mates were only too glad to escape from the cabin as soon as decency permitted and all the time the dual working of my mind distracted me almost to the point of insanity  i was constantly watching myself my secret self as dependent on my actions as my own personality sleeping in that bed behind that door which faced me as i sat at the head of the table  it was very much like being mad only it was worse because one was aware of it  i had to shake him for a solid minute but when at last he opened his eyes it was in the full possession of his senses with an inquiring look  alls well so far i whispered  now you must vanish into the bathroom  he did so as noiseless as a ghost and i then rang for the steward and facing him boldly directed him to tidy up my stateroom while i was having my bathand be quick about it  as my tone admitted of no excuses he said yes sir and ran off to fetch his dustpan and brushes  i took a bath and did most of my dressing splashing and whistling softly for the stewards edification while the secret sharer of my life stood drawn up bolt upright in that little space his face looking very sunken in daylight his eyelids lowered under the stern dark line of his eyebrows drawn together by a slight frown  when i left him there to go back to my room the steward was finishing dusting  i sent for the mate and engaged him in some insignificant conversation  it was as it were trifling with the terrific character of his whiskers but my object was to give him an opportunity for a good look at my cabin  and then i could at last shut with a clear conscience the door of my stateroom and get my double back into the recessed part  there was nothing else for it  he had to sit still on a small folding stool half smothered by the heavy coats hanging there  we listened to the steward going into the bathroom out of the saloon filling the waterbottles there scrubbing the bath setting things to rights whisk bang clatterout again into the saloonturn the key click  such was my scheme for keeping my second self invisible nothing better could be contrived under the circumstances  and there we sat i at my writingdesk ready to appear busy with some papers he behind me out of sight of the door  it would not have been prudent to talk in daytime and i could not have stood the excitement of that queer sense of whispering to myself  now and then glancing over my shoulder i saw him far back there sitting rigidly on the low stool his bare feet close together his arms folded his head hanging on his breastand perfectly still anybody would have taken him for me  i was fascinated by it myself  every moment i had to glance over my shoulder  i was looking at him when a voice outside the door said  beg pardon sir  well    i kept my eyes on him and so when the voice outside the door announced theres a ships boat coming our way sir i saw him give a startthe first movement he had made for hours but he did not raise his bowed head  all right  get the ladder over  i hesitated  should i whisper something to him  but what  his immobility seemed to have been never disturbed  what could i tell him he did not know already    finally i went on deck    chapter ii    the skipper of the sephora had a thin red whisker all round his face and the sort of complexion that goes with hair of that colour also the particular rather smeary shade of blue in the eyes  he was not exactly a showy figure his shoulders were high his stature but middlingone leg slightly more bandy than the other  he shook hands looking vaguely around  a spiritless tenacity was his main characteristic i judged  i behaved with a politeness which seemed to disconcert him  perhaps he was shy  he mumbled to me as if he were ashamed of what he was saying gave his name it was something like archboldbut at this distance of years i hardly am sure his ships name and a few other particulars of that sort in the manner of a criminal making a reluctant and doleful confession  he had had terrible weather on the passage outterribleterriblewife aboard too  by this time we were seated in the cabin and the steward brought in a tray with a bottle and glasses  thanks  no  never took liquor  would have some water though  he drank two tumblerfuls terrible thirsty work  ever since daylight had been exploring the islands round his ship  what was that forfun i asked with an appearance of polite interest  no  he sighed  painful duty  as he persisted in his mumbling and i wanted my double to hear every word i hit upon the notion of informing him that i regretted to say i was hard of hearing  such a young man too he nodded keeping his smeary blue unintelligent eyes fastened upon me  what was the cause of it some disease he inquired without the least sympathy and as if he thought that if so id got no more than i deserved  yes disease i admitted in a cheerful tone which seemed to shock him  but my point was gained because he had to raise his voice to give me his tale  it is not worth while to record that version it was just over two months since all this had happened and he had thought so much about it that he seemed completely muddled as to its bearings but still immensely impressed  what would you think of such a thing happening on board your own ship  ive had the sephora for these fifteen years  i am a well known shipmaster  he was densely distressedand perhaps i should have sympathised with him if i had been able to detach my mental vision from the unsuspected sharer of my cabin as though he were my second self there he was on the other side of the bulkhead four or five feet from us no more as we sat in the saloon  i looked politely at captain archbold if that was his name but it was the other i saw in a grey sleepingsuit seated on a low stool his bare feet close together his arms folded and every word said between us falling into the ears of his dark head bowed on his chest  i have been at sea now man and boy for sevenandthirty years and ive never heard of such a thing happening in an english ship and that it should be my ship  wife on board too  i was hardly listening to him  dont you think i said that the heavy sea which you told me came aboard just then might have killed the man  i have seen the sheer weight of a sea kill a man very neatly by simply breaking his neck  good god he uttered impressively fixing his smeary blue eyes on me  the sea  no man killed by the sea ever looked like that he seemed positively scandalised at my suggestion  and as i gazed at him certainly not prepared for anything original on his part he advanced his head close to mine and thrust his tongue out at me so suddenly that i couldnt help starting back  after scoring over my calmness in this graphic way he nodded wisely  if i had seen the sight he assured me i would never forget it as long as i lived  the weather was too bad to give the corpse a proper sea burial  so next day at dawn they took it up on the poop covering its face with a bit of bunting he read a short prayer and then just as it was in its oilskins and long boots they launched it amongst those mountainous seas that seemed ready every moment to swallow up the ship herself and the terrified lives on board of her  that reefed foresail saved you i threw in  under godit did he exclaimed fervently  it was by a special mercy i firmly believe that it stood some of those hurricane squalls  it was the setting of that sail which i began  gods own hand in it he interrupted me  nothing less could have done it  i dont mind telling you that i hardly dared give the order  it seemed impossible that we could touch anything without losing it and then our last hope would have been gone  the terror of that gale was on him yet  i let him go on for a bit then said casuallyas if returning to a minor subject  you were very anxious to give up your mate to the shore people i believe  he was  to the law  his obscure tenacity on that point had in it something incomprehensible and a little awful something as it were mystical quite apart from his anxiety that he should not be suspected of countenancing any doings of that sort  sevenand thirty virtuous years at sea of which over twenty of immaculate command and the last fifteen in the sephora seemed to have laid him under some pitiless obligation  and you know he went on groping shamefacedly amongst his feelings i did not engage that young fellow  his people had some interest with my owners  i was in a way forced to take him on  he looked very smart very gentlemanly and all that  but do you knowi never liked him somehow  i am a plain man  you see he wasnt exactly the sort for the chief mate of a ship like the sephora  i had become so connected in thoughts and impressions with the secret sharer of my cabin that i felt as if i personally were being given to understand that i too was not the sort that would have done for the chief mate of a ship like the sephora  i had no doubt of it in my mind  not at all the style of man  you understand he insisted superfluously looking hard at me  i smiled urbanely  he seemed at a loss for a while  i suppose i must report a suicide  beg pardon  suicide  thats what ill have to write to my owners directly i get in  unless you manage to recover him before tomorrow i assented dispassionately   i mean alive  he mumbled something which i really did not catch and i turned my ear to him in a puzzled manner  he fairly bawled  the landi say the mainland is at least seven miles off my anchorage  about that  my lack of excitement of curiosity of surprise of any sort of pronounced interest began to arouse his distrust  but except for the felicitous pretence of deafness i had not tried to pretend anything  i had felt utterly incapable of playing the part of ignorance properly and therefore was afraid to try  it is also certain that he had brought some readymade suspicions with him and that he viewed my politeness as a strange and unnatural phenomenon  and yet how else could i have received him  not heartily  that was impossible for psychological reasons which i need not state here  my only object was to keep off his inquiries surlily  yes but surliness might have provoked a pointblank question  from its novelty to him and from its nature punctilious courtesy was the manner best calculated to restrain the man  but there was the danger of his breaking through my defence bluntly  i could not i think have met him by a direct lie also for psychological not moral reasons  if he had only known how afraid i was of his putting my feeling of identity with the other to the test  but strangely enoughi thought of it only afterwardi believe that he was not a little disconcerted by the reverse side of that weird situation by something in me that reminded him of the man he was seekingsuggested a mysterious similitude to the young fellow he had distrusted and disliked from the first  however that might have been the silence was not very prolonged he took another oblique step  i reckon i had no more than a twomile pull to your ship  not a bit more  and quite enough too in this awful heat i said  another pause full of mistrust followed  necessity they say is mother of invention but fear too is not barren of ingenious suggestions  and i was afraid he would ask me pointblank for news of my other self  nice little saloon isnt it i remarked as if noticing for the first time the way his eyes roamed from one closed door to the other  and very well fitted out too  here for instance i continued reaching over the back of my seat negligently and flinging the door open is my bathroom  he made an eager movement but hardly gave it a glance  i got up shut the door of the bathroom and invited him to have a look round as if i were very proud of my accommodation  he had to rise and be shown round but he went through the business without any raptures whatever  and now well have a look at my stateroom i declared in a voice as loud as i dared to make it crossing the cabin to the starboard side with purposely heavy steps  he followed me in and gazed around  my intelligent double had vanished  i played my part  very convenientisnt it  very nice  very comf     he didnt finish and went out brusquely as if to escape from some unrighteous wiles of mine  but it was not to be  i had been too frightened not to feel vengeful i felt i had him on the run and i meant to keep him on the run my polite insistence must have had something menacing in it because he gave in suddenly  and i did not let him off a single item mates room pantry storerooms the very saillocker which was also under the poophe had to look into them all  when at last i showed him out on the quarterdeck he drew a long spiritless sigh and mumbled dismally that he must really be going back to his ship now  i desired my mate who had joined us to see to the captains boat  the man of whiskers gave a blast on the whistle which he used to wear hanging round his neck and yelled sephoras away  my double down there in my cabin must have heard and certainly could not feel more relieved than i  four fellows came running out from somewhere forward and went over the side while my own men appearing on deck too lined the rail  i escorted my visitor to the gangway ceremoniously and nearly overdid it  he was a tenacious beast  on the very ladder he lingered and in that unique guiltily conscientious manner of sticking to the point  i say    you    you dont think that  i covered his voice loudly  certainly not    i am delighted  goodbye  i had an idea of what he meant to say and just saved myself by the privilege of defective hearing  he was too shaken generally to insist but my mate close witness of that parting looked mystified and his face took on a thoughtful cast  as i did not want to appear as if i wished to avoid all communication with my officers he had the opportunity to address me  seems a very nice man  his boats crew told our chaps a very extraordinary story if what i am told by the steward is true  i suppose you had it from the captain sir  yes  i had a story from the captain  a very horrible affairisnt it sir  it is  beats all these tales we hear about murders in yankee ships  i dont think it beats them  i dont think it resembles them in the least  bless my soulyou dont say so  but of course ive no acquaintance whatever with american ships not i so i couldnt go against your knowledge  its horrible enough for me    but the queerest part is that those fellows seemed to have some idea the man was hidden aboard here  they had really  did you ever hear of such a thing  preposterousisnt it  we were walking to and fro athwart the quarterdeck  no one of the crew forward could be seen the day was sunday and the mate pursued  there was some little dispute about it  our chaps took offence as if we would harbour a thing like that they said  wouldnt you like to look for him in our coalhole  quite a tiff  but they made it up in the end  i suppose he did drown himself  dont you sir  i dont suppose anything  you have no doubt in the matter sir  none whatever  i left him suddenly  i felt i was producing a bad impression but with my double down there it was most trying to be on deck  and it was almost as trying to be below  altogether a nervetrying situation  but on the whole i felt less torn in two when i was with him  there was no one in the whole ship whom i dared take into my confidence  since the hands had got to know his story it would have been impossible to pass him off for any one else and an accidental discovery was to be dreaded now more than ever     the steward being engaged in laying the table for dinner we could talk only with our eyes when i first went down  later in the afternoon we had a cautious try at whispering  the sunday quietness of the ship was against us the stillness of air and water around her was against us the elements the men were against useverything was against us in our secret partnership time itselffor this could not go on forever  the very trust in providence was i suppose denied to his guilt  shall i confess that this thought cast me down very much  and as to the chapter of accidents which counts for so much in the book of success i could only hope that it was closed  for what favourable accident could be expected  did you hear everything were my first words as soon as we took up our position side by side leaning over my bedplace  he had  and the proof of it was his earnest whisper the man told you he hardly dared to give the order  i understood the reference to be to that saving foresail  yes  he was afraid of it being lost in the setting  i assure you he never gave the order  he may think he did but he never gave it  he stood there with me on the break of the poop after the maintopsail blew away and whimpered about our last hope positively whimpered about it and nothing elseand the night coming on  to hear ones skipper go on like that in such weather was enough to drive any fellow out of his mind  it worked me up into a sort of desperation  i just took it into my own hands and went away from him boiling and but whats the use telling you you know    do you think that if i had not been pretty fierce with them i should have got the men to do anything  not it  the bosn perhaps  perhaps  it wasnt a heavy seait was a sea gone mad  i suppose the end of the world will be something like that and a man may have the heart to see it coming once and be done with itbut to have to face it day after dayi dont blame anybody  i was precious little better than the rest  onlyi was an officer of that old coalwaggon anyhow  i quite understand i conveyed that sincere assurance into his ear  he was out of breath with whispering i could hear him pant slightly  it was all very simple  the same strungup force which had given twentyfour men a chance at least for their lives had in a sort of recoil crushed an unworthy mutinous existence  but i had no leisure to weigh the merits of the matterfootsteps in the saloon a heavy knock  theres enough wind to get under way with sir  here was the call of a new claim upon my thoughts and even upon my feelings  turn the hands up i cried through the door  ill be on deck directly  i was going out to make the acquaintance of my ship  before i left the cabin our eyes metthe eyes of the only two strangers on board  i pointed to the recessed part where the little campstool awaited him and laid my finger on my lips  he made a gesture somewhat vaguea little mysterious accompanied by a faint smile as if of regret  this is not the place to enlarge upon the sensations of a man who feels for the first time a ship move under his feet to his own independent word  in my case they were not unalloyed  i was not wholly alone with my command for there was that stranger in my cabin  or rather i was not completely and wholly with her  part of me was absent  that mental feeling of being in two places at once affected me physically as if the mood of secrecy had penetrated my very soul  before an hour had elapsed since the ship had begun to move having occasion to ask the mate he stood by my side to take a compass bearing of the pagoda i caught myself reaching up to his ear in whispers  i say i caught myself but enough had escaped to startle the man  i cant describe it otherwise than by saying that he shied  a grave preoccupied manner as though he were in possession of some perplexing intelligence did not leave him henceforth  a little later i moved away from the rail to look at the compass with such a stealthy gait that the helmsman noticed itand i could not help noticing the unusual roundness of his eyes  these are trifling instances though its to no commanders advantage to be suspected of ludicrous eccentricities  but i was also more seriously affected there are to a seaman certain words gestures that should in given conditions come as naturally as instinctively as the winking of a menaced eye  a certain order should spring on to his lips without thinking a certain sign should get itself made so to speak without reflection  but all unconscious alertness had abandoned me  i had to make an effort of will to recall myself back from the cabin to the conditions of the moment  i felt that i was appearing an irresolute commander to those people who were watching me more or less critically  and besides there were the scares  on the second day out for instance coming off the deck in the afternoon i had straw slippers on my bare feet i stopped at the open pantry door and spoke to the steward  he was doing something there with his back to me  at the sound of my voice he nearly jumped out of his skin as the saying is and incidentally broke a cup  what on earths the matter with you i asked astonished  he was extremely confused  beg your pardon sir  i made sure you were in your cabin  you see i wasnt  no sir  i could have sworn i had heard you moving in there not a moment ago  its most extraordinary    very sorry sir  i passed on with an inward shudder  i was so identified with my secret double that i did not even mention the fact in those scanty fearful whispers we exchanged  i suppose he had made some slight noise of some kind or other  it would have been miraculous if he hadnt at one time or another  and yet haggard as he appeared he looked always perfectly selfcontrolled more than calmalmost invulnerable  on my suggestion he remained almost entirely in the bathroom which upon the whole was the safest place  there could be really no shadow of an excuse for any one ever wanting to go in there once the steward had done with it  it was a very tiny place  sometimes he reclined on the floor his legs bent his head sustained on one elbow  at others i would find him on the camp stool sitting in his grey sleepingsuit and with his cropped dark hair like a patient unmoved convict  at night i would smuggle him into my bedplace and we would whisper together with the regular footfalls of the officer of the watch passing and repassing over our heads  it was an infinitely miserable time  it was lucky that some tins of fine preserves were stowed in a locker in my stateroom hard bread i could always get hold of and so he lived on stewed chicken pate de foie gras asparagus cooked oysters sardineson all sorts of abominable sham delicacies out of tins my early morning coffee he always drank and it was all i dared do for him in that respect  every day there was the horrible manoeuvring to go through so that my room and then the bathroom should be done in the usual way  i came to hate the sight of the steward to abhor the voice of that harmless man  i felt that it was he who would bring on the disaster of discovery  it hung like a sword over our heads  the fourth day out i think we were then working down the east side of the gulf of siam tack for tack in light winds and smooth waterthe fourth day i say of this miserable juggling with the unavoidable as we sat at our evening meal that man whose slightest movement i dreaded after putting down the dishes ran up on deck busily  this could not be dangerous  presently he came down again and then it appeared that he had remembered a coat of mine which i had thrown over a rail to dry after having been wetted in a shower which had passed over the ship in the afternoon sitting stolidly at the head of the table i became terrified at the sight of the garment on his arm  of course he made for my door there was no time to lose  steward i thundered  my nerves were so shaken that i could not govern my voice and conceal my agitation  this was the sort of thing that made my terrifically whiskered mate tap his forehead with his forefinger  i had detected him using that gesture while talking on deck with a confidential air to the carpenter  it was too far to hear a word but i had no doubt that this pantomime could only refer to the strange new captain  yes sir the palefaced steward turned resignedly to me  it was this maddening course of being shouted at checked without rhyme or reason arbitrarily chased out of my cabin suddenly called into it sent flying out of his pantry on incomprehensible errands that accounted for the growing wretchedness of his expression  where are you going with that coat  to your room sir  is there another shower coming  im sure i dont know sir  shall i go up again and see sir  no never mind  my object was attained as of course my other self in there would have heard everything that passed  during this interlude my two officers never raised their eyes off their respective plates but the lip of that confounded cub the second mate quivered visibly  i expected the steward to hook my coat on and come out at once  he was very slow about it but i dominated my nervousness sufficiently not to shout after him  suddenly i became aware it could be heard plainly enough that the fellow for some reason or other was opening the door of the bathroom  it was the end  the place was literally not big enough to swing a cat in  my voice died in my throat and i went stony all over  i expected to hear a yell of surprise and terror and made a movement but had not the strength to get on my legs  everything remained still  had my second self taken the poor wretch by the throat  i dont know what i would have done next moment if i had not seen the steward come out of my room close the door and then stand quietly by the sideboard  saved i thought  but no  lost  gone  he was gone  i laid my knife and fork down and leaned back in my chair  my head swam  after a while when sufficiently recovered to speak in a steady voice i instructed my mate to put the ship round at eight oclock himself  i wont come on deck i went on  i think ill turn in and unless the wind shifts i dont want to be disturbed before midnight  i feel a bit seedy  you did look middling bad a little while ago the chief mate remarked without showing any great concern  they both went out and i stared at the steward clearing the table there was nothing to be read on that wretched mans face  but why did he avoid my eyes i asked myself  then i thought i should like to hear the sound of his voice  steward  sir  startled as usual  where did you hang up that coat  in the bathroom sir  the usual anxious tone  its not quite dry yet sir  for some time longer i sat in the cuddy  had my double vanished as he had come  but of his coming there was an explanation whereas his disappearance would be inexplicable    i went slowly into my dark room shut the door lighted the lamp and for a time dared not turn round  when at last i did i saw him standing boltupright in the narrow recessed part  it would not be true to say i had a shock but an irresistible doubt of his bodily existence flitted through my mind  can it be i asked myself that he is not visible to other eyes than mine  it was like being haunted  motionless with a grave face he raised his hands slightly at me in a gesture which meant clearly heavens what a narrow escape  narrow indeed  i think i had come creeping quietly as near insanity as any man who has not actually gone over the border  that gesture restrained me so to speak  the mate with the terrific whiskers was now putting the ship on the other tack  in the moment of profound silence which follows upon the hands going to their stations i heard on the poop his raised voice  hard alee and the distant shout of the order repeated on the maindeck  the sails in that light breeze made but a faint fluttering noise  it ceased  the ship was coming round slowly i held my breath in the renewed stillness of expectation one wouldnt have thought that there was a single living soul on her decks  a sudden brisk shout mainsail haul broke the spell and in the noisy cries and rush overhead of the men running away with the mainbrace we two down in my cabin came together in our usual position by the bedplace  he did not wait for my question  i heard him fumbling here and just managed to squat myself down in the bath he whispered to me the fellow only opened the door and put his arm in to hang the coat up  all the same  i never thought of that i whispered back even more appalled than before at the closeness of the shave and marvelling at that something unyielding in his character which was carrying him through so finely  there was no agitation in his whisper  whoever was being driven distracted it was not he  he was sane  and the proof of his sanity was continued when he took up the whispering again  it would never do for me to come to life again  it was something that a ghost might have said  but what he was alluding to was his old captains reluctant admission of the theory of suicide  it would obviously serve his turnif i had understood at all the view which seemed to govern the unalterable purpose of his action  you must maroon me as soon as ever you can get amongst these islands off the cambodje shore he went on  maroon you  we are not living in a boys adventure tale i protested  his scornful whispering took me up  we arent indeed  theres nothing of a boys tale in this  but theres nothing else for it  i want no more  you dont suppose i am afraid of what can be done to me  prison or gallows or whatever they may please  but you dont see me coming back to explain such things to an old fellow in a wig and twelve respectable tradesmen do you  what can they know whether i am guilty or notor of what i am guilty either  thats my affair  what does the bible say driven off the face of the earth  very well  i am off the face of the earth now  as i came at night so i shall go  impossible i murmured  you cant  cant    not naked like a soul on the day of judgment  i shall freeze on to this sleepingsuit  the last day is not yet and you have understood thoroughly  didnt you  i felt suddenly ashamed of myself  i may say truly that i understoodand my hesitation in letting that man swim away from my ships side had been a mere sham sentiment a sort of cowardice  it cant be done now till next night i breathed out  the ship is on the offshore tack and the wind may fail us  as long as i know that you understand he whispered  but of course you do  its a great satisfaction to have got somebody to understand  you seem to have been there on purpose  and in the same whisper as if we two whenever we talked had to say things to each other which were not fit for the world to hear he added its very wonderful  we remained side by side talking in our secret waybut sometimes silent or just exchanging a whispered word or two at long intervals  and as usual he stared through the port  a breath of wind came now and again into our faces  the ship might have been moored in dock so gently and on an even keel she slipped through the water that did not murmur even at our passage shadowy and silent like a phantom sea  at midnight i went on deck and to my mates great surprise put the ship round on the other tack  his terrible whiskers flitted round me in silent criticism  i certainly should not have done it if it had been only a question of getting out of that sleepy gulf as quickly as possible  i believe he told the second mate who relieved him that it was a great want of judgment  the other only yawned  that intolerable cub shuffled about so sleepily and lolled against the rails in such a slack improper fashion that i came down on him sharply  arent you properly awake yet  yes sir  i am awake  well then be good enough to hold yourself as if you were  and keep a lookout  if theres any current well be closing with some islands before daylight  the east side of the gulf is fringed with islands some solitary others in groups  on the blue background of the high coast they seem to float on silvery patches of calm water arid and grey or dark green and rounded like clumps of evergreen bushes with the larger ones a mile or two long showing the outlines of ridges ribs of grey rock under the dank mantle of matted leafage  unknown to trade to travel almost to geography the manner of life they harbour is an unsolved secret  there must be villagessettlements of fishermen at leaston the largest of them and some communication with the world is probably kept up by native craft but all that forenoon as we headed for them fanned along by the faintest of breezes i saw no sign of man or canoe in the field of the telescope i kept on pointing at the scattered group  at noon i gave no orders for a change of course and the mates whiskers became much concerned and seemed to be offering themselves unduly to my notice  at last i said  i am going to stand right in  quite inas far as i can take her  the stare of extreme surprise imparted an air of ferocity also to his eyes and he looked truly terrific for a moment  were not doing well in the middle of the gulf i continued casually  i am going to look for the land breezes tonight  bless my soul  do you mean sir in the dark amongst the lot of all them islands and reefs and shoals  wellif there are any regular land breezes at all on this coast one must get close inshore to find them mustnt one  bless my soul he exclaimed again under his breath  all that afternoon he wore a dreamy contemplative appearance which in him was a mark of perplexity  after dinner i went into my stateroom as if i meant to take some rest  there we two bent our dark heads over a halfunrolled chart lying on my bed  there i said  its got to be kohring  ive been looking at it ever since sunrise  it has got two hills and a low point  it must be inhabited  and on the coast opposite there is what looks like the mouth of a biggish riverwith some town no doubt not far up  its the best chance for you that i can see  anything  kohring let it be  he looked thoughtfully at the chart as if surveying chances and distances from a lofty heightand following with his eyes his own figure wandering on the blank land of cochinchina and then passing off that piece of paper clean out of sight into uncharted regions  and it was as if the ship had two captains to plan her course for her  i had been so worried and restless running up and down that i had not had the patience to dress that day  i had remained in my sleepingsuit with straw slippers and a soft floppy hat  the closeness of the heat in the gulf had been most oppressive and the crew were used to see me wandering in that airy attire  she will clear the south point as she heads now i whispered into his ear  goodness only knows when though but certainly after dark  ill edge her in to half a mile as far as i may be able to judge in the dark  be careful he murmured warninglyand i realised suddenly that all my future the only future for which i was fit would perhaps go irretrievably to pieces in any mishap to my first command  i could not stop a moment longer in the room  i motioned him to get out of sight and made my way on the poop  that unplayful cub had the watch  i walked up and down for a while thinking things out then beckoned him over  send a couple of hands to open the two quarterdeck ports i said mildly  he actually had the impudence or else so forgot himself in his wonder at such an incomprehensible order as to repeat  open the quarterdeck ports  what for sir  the only reason you need concern yourself about is because i tell you to do so  have them open wide and fastened properly  he reddened and went off but i believe made some jeering remark to the carpenter as to the sensible practice of ventilating a ships quarterdeck  i know he popped into the mates cabin to impart the fact to him because the whiskers came on deck as it were by chance and stole glances at me from belowfor signs of lunacy or drunkenness i suppose  a little before supper feeling more restless than ever i rejoined for a moment my second self  and to find him sitting so quietly was surprising like something against nature inhuman  i developed my plan in a hurried whisper  i shall stand in as close as i dare and then put her round  i shall presently find means to smuggle you out of here into the saillocker which communicates with the lobby  but there is an opening a sort of square for hauling the sails out which gives straight on the quarterdeck and which is never closed in fine weather so as to give air to the sails   when the ships way is deadened in stays and all the hands are aft at the mainbraces you shall have a clear road to slip out and get overboard through the open quarterdeck port  ive had them both fastened up  use a ropes end to lower yourself into the water so as to avoid a splashyou know  it could be heard and cause some beastly complication  he kept silent for a while then whispered i understand  i wont be there to see you go i began with an effort  the rest    i only hope i have understood too  you have  from first to lastand for the first time there seemed to be a faltering something strained in his whisper  he caught hold of my arm but the ringing of the supper bell made me start  he didnt though he only released his grip  after supper i didnt come below again till well past eight oclock  the faint steady breeze was loaded with dew and the wet darkened sails held all there was of propelling power in it the night clear and starry sparkled darkly and the opaque lightless patches shifting slowly against the low stars were the drifting islets  on the port bow there was a big one more distant and shadowily imposing by the great space of sky it eclipsed  on opening the door i had a back view of my very own self looking at a chart  he had come out of the recess and was standing near the table  quite dark enough i whispered  he stepped back and leaned against my bed with a level quiet glance  i sat on the couch  we had nothing to say to each other over our heads the officer of the watch moved here and there  then i heard him move quickly  i knew what that meant  he was making for the companion and presently his voice was outside my door  we are drawing in pretty fast sir  land looks rather close  very well i answered  i am coming on deck directly  i waited till he was gone out of the cuddy then rose  my double moved too  the time had come to exchange our last whispers for neither of us was ever to hear each others natural voice  look here i opened a drawer and took out three sovereigns take this anyhow  ive got six and id give you the lot only i must keep a little money to buy some fruit and vegetables for the crew from native boats as we go through sunda straits  he shook his head  take it i urged him whispering desperately  no one can tell what  he smiled and slapped meaningly the only pocket of the sleeping jacket  it was not safe certainly  but i produced a large old silk handkerchief of mine and tying the three pieces of gold in a corner pressed it on him  he was touched i suppose because he took it at last and tied it quickly round his waist under the jacket on his bare skin  our eyes met several seconds elapsed till our glances still mingled i extended my hand and turned the lamp out  then i passed through the cuddy leaving the door of my room wide open     steward  he was still lingering in the pantry in the greatness of his zeal giving a rubup to a plated cruet stand the last thing before going to bed  being careful not to wake up the mate whose room was opposite i spoke in an undertone  he looked round anxiously  sir  can you get me a little hot water from the galley  i am afraid sir the galley fires been out for some time now  go and see  he fled up the stairs  now i whispered loudly into the saloontoo loudly perhaps but i was afraid i couldnt make a sound  he was by my side in an instantthe double captain slipped past the stairsthrough a tiny dark passage    a sliding door  we were in the saillocker scrambling on our knees over the sails  a sudden thought struck me  i saw myself wandering barefooted bareheaded the sun beating on my dark poll  i snatched off my floppy hat and tried hurriedly in the dark to ram it on my other self  he dodged and fended off silently  i wonder what he thought had come to me before he understood and suddenly desisted  our hands met gropingly lingered united in a steady motionless clasp for a second    no word was breathed by either of us when they separated  i was standing quietly by the pantry door when the steward returned  sorry sir  kettle barely warm  shall i light the spiritlamp  never mind  i came out on deck slowly  it was now a matter of conscience to shave the land as close as possiblefor now he must go overboard whenever the ship was put in stays  must  there could be no going back for him  after a moment i walked over to leeward and my heart flew into my mouth at the nearness of the land on the bow  under any other circumstances i would not have held on a minute longer the second mate had followed me anxiously  i looked on till i felt i could command my voice  she will weather i said then in a quiet tone  are you going to try that sir he stammered out incredulously  i took no notice of him and raised my tone just enough to be heard by the helmsman  keep her good full  good full sir  the wind fanned my cheek the sails slept the world was silent the strain of watching the dark loom of the land grow bigger and denser was too much for me  i had shut my eyesbecause the ship must go closer  she must  the stillness was intolerable  were we standing still  when i opened my eyes the second view started my heart with a thump  the black southern hill of kohring seemed to hang right over the ship like a towering fragment of the everlasting night on that enormous mass of blackness there was not a gleam to be seen not a sound to be heard  it was gliding irresistibly toward us and yet seemed already within reach of the hand  i saw the vague figures of the watch grouped in the waist gazing in awed silence  are you going on sir inquired an unsteady voice at my elbow  i ignored it  i had to go on  keep her full  dont check her way  that wont do now i said warningly  i cant see the sails very well the helmsman answered me in strange quavering tones  was she close enough  already she was i wont say in the shadow of the land but in the very blackness of it already swallowed up as it were gone too close to be recalled gone from me altogether  give the mate a call i said to the young man who stood at my elbow as still as death  and turn all hands up  my tone had a borrowed loudness reverberated from the height of the land  several voices cried out together  we are all on deck sir  then stillness again with the great shadow gliding closer towering higher without a light without a sound  such a hush had fallen on the ship that she might have been a bark of the dead floating in slowly under the very gate of erebus  my god  where are we  it was the mate moaning at my elbow  he was thunderstruck and as it were deprived of the moral support of his whiskers  he clapped his hands and absolutely cried out lost  be quiet i said sternly  he lowered his tone but i saw the shadowy gesture of his despair what are we doing here  looking for the land wind  he made as if to tear his hair and addressed me recklessly  she will never get out  you have done it sir  i knew itd end in something like this  she will never weather and you are too close now to stay  shell drift ashore before shes round  o my god  i caught his arm as he was raising it to batter his poor devoted head and shook it violently  shes ashore already he wailed trying to tear himself away  is she    keep good full there  good full sir cried the helmsman in a frightened thin child like voice  i hadnt let go the mates arm and went on shaking it  ready about do you hear  you go forwardshakeand stop there shakeand hold your noiseshakeand see these headsheets properly overhauledshake shakeshake  and all the time i dared not look toward the land lest my heart should fail me  i released my grip at last and he ran forward as if fleeing for dear life  i wondered what my double there in the saillocker thought of this commotion  he was able to hear everythingand perhaps he was able to understand why on my conscience it had to be thus closeno less  my first order hard alee reechoed ominously under the towering shadow of kohring as if i had shouted in a mountain gorge  and then i watched the land intently  in that smooth water and light wind it was impossible to feel the ship comingto  no i could not feel her  and my second self was making now ready to slip out and lower himself overboard  perhaps he was gone already     the great black mass brooding over our very mastheads began to pivot away from the ships side silently  and now i forgot the secret stranger ready to depart and remembered only that i was a total stranger to the ship  i did not know her  would she do it how was she to be handled  i swung the mainyard and waited helplessly  she was perhaps stopped and her very fate hung in the balance with the black mass of kohring like the gate of the everlasting night towering over her taffrail  what would she do now  had she way on her yet  i stepped to the side swiftly and on the shadowy water i could see nothing except a faint phosphorescent flash revealing the glassy smoothness of the sleeping surface  it was impossible to telland i had not learned yet the feel of my ship  was she moving  what i needed was something easily seen a piece of paper which i could throw overboard and watch  i had nothing on me  to run down for it i didnt dare  there was no time  all at once my strained yearning stare distinguished a white object floating within a yard of the ships side  white on the black water  a phosphorescent flash passed under it  what was that thing    i recognised my own floppy hat  it must have fallen off his head    and he didnt bother  now i had what i wantedthe saving mark for my eyes  but i hardly thought of my other self now gone from the ship to be hidden forever from all friendly faces to be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth with no brand of the curse on his sane forehead to stay a slaying hand    too proud to explain  and i watched the hatthe expression of my sudden pity for his mere flesh  it had been meant to save his homeless head from the dangers of the sun  and nowbeholdit was saving the ship by serving me for a mark to help out the ignorance of my strangeness ha  it was drifting forward warning me just in time that the ship had gathered sternway  shift the helm i said in a low voice to the seaman standing still like a statue  the mans eyes glistened wildly in the binnacle light as he jumped round to the other side and spun round the wheel  i walked to the break of the poop  on the overshadowed deck all hands stood by the forebraces waiting for my order  the stars ahead seemed to be gliding from right to left  and all was so still in the world that i heard the quiet remark shes round passed in a tone of intense relief between two seamen  let go and haul  the foreyards ran round with a great noise amidst cheery cries and now the frightful whiskers made themselves heard giving various orders  already the ship was drawing ahead  and i was alone with her  nothing no one in the world should stand now between us throwing a shadow on the way of silent knowledge and mute affection the perfect communion of a seaman with his first command  walking to the taffrail i was in time to make out on the very edge of a darkness thrown by a towering black mass like the very gateway of erebusyes i was in time to catch an evanescent glimpse of my white hat left behind to mark the spot where the secret sharer of my cabin and of my thoughts as though he were my second self had lowered himself into the water to take his punishment  a free man a proud swimmer striking out for a new destiny     freya of the seven isles     chapter i    one dayand that day was many years ago nowi received a long chatty letter from one of my old chums and fellowwanderers in eastern waters  he was still out there but settled down and middleaged i imagined himgrown portly in figure and domestic in his habits in short overtaken by the fate common to all except to those who being specially beloved by the gods get knocked on the head early  the letter was of the reminiscent do you remember kinda wistful letter of backward glances  and amongst other things surely you remember old nelson he wrote  remember old nelson  certainly  and to begin with his name was not nelson  the englishmen in the archipelago called him nelson because it was more convenient i suppose and he never protested it would have been mere pedantry  the true form of his name was nielsen  he had come out east long before the advent of telegraph cables had served english firms had married an english girl had been one of us for years trading and sailing in all directions through the eastern archipelago across and around transversely diagonally perpendicularly in semicircles and zigzags and figures of eights for years and years  there was no nook or cranny of these tropical waters that the enterprise of old nelson or nielsen had not penetrated in an eminently pacific way  his tracks if plotted out would have covered the map of the archipelago like a cobweball of it with the sole exception of the philippines  he would never approach that part from a strange dread of spaniards or to be exact of the spanish authorities  what he imagined they could do to him it is impossible to say  perhaps at some time in his life he had read some stories of the inquisition  but he was in general afraid of what he called authorities not the english authorities which he trusted and respected but the other two of that part of the world  he was not so horrified at the dutch as he was at the spaniards but he was even more mistrustful of them  very mistrustful indeed  the dutch in his view were capable of playing any ugly trick on a man who had the misfortune to displease them  there were their laws and regulations but they had no notion of fair play in applying them it was really pitiable to see the anxious circumspection of his dealings with some official or other and remember that this man had been known to stroll up to a village of cannibals in new guinea in a quiet fearless manner and note that he was always fleshy all his life and if i may say so an appetising morsel on some matter of barter that did not amount perhaps to fifty pounds in the end  remember old nelson  rather  truly none of us in my generation had known him in his active days  he was retired in our time he had bought or else leased part of a small island from the sultan of a little group called the seven isles not far north from banka  it was i suppose a legitimate transaction but i have no doubt that had he been an englishman the dutch would have discovered a reason to fire him out without ceremony  in this connection the real form of his name stood him in good stead  in the character of an unassuming dane whose conduct was most correct they let him be  with all his money engaged in cultivation he was naturally careful not to give even the shadow of offence and it was mostly for prudential reasons of that sort that he did not look with a favourable eye on jasper allen  but of that later  yes one remembered well enough old nelsons big hospitable bungalow erected on a shelving point of land his portly form costumed generally in a white shirt and trousers he had a confirmed habit of taking off his alpaca jacket on the slightest provocation his round blue eyes his straggly sandywhite moustache sticking out all ways like the quills of the fretful porcupine his propensity to sit down suddenly and fan himself with his hat  but theres no use concealing the fact that what one remembered really was his daughter who at that time came out to live with himand be a sort of lady of the isles  freya nelson or nielsen was the kind of girl one remembers  the oval of her face was perfect and within that fascinating frame the most happy disposition of line and feature with an admirable complexion gave an impression of health strength and what i might call unconscious selfconfidencea most pleasant and as it were whimsical determination  i will not compare her eyes to violets because the real shade of their colour was peculiar not so dark and more lustrous  they were of the wideopen kind and looked at one frankly in every mood  i never did see the long dark eyelashes loweredi dare say jasper allen did being a privileged personbut i have no doubt that the expression must have been charming in a complex way  she couldjasper told me once with a touchingly imbecile exultationsit on her hair  i dare say i dare say  it was not for me to behold these wonders i was content to admire the neat and becoming way she used to do it up so as not to conceal the good shape of her head  and this wealth of hair was so glossy that when the screens of the west verandah were down making a pleasant twilight there or in the shade of the grove of fruittrees near the house it seemed to give out a golden light of its own  she dressed generally in a white frock with a skirt of walking length showing her neat laced brown boots  if there was any colour about her costume it was just a bit of blue perhaps  no exertion seemed to distress her  i have seen her land from the dinghy after a long pull in the sun she rowed herself about a good deal with no quickened breath and not a single hair out of its place  in the morning when she came out on the verandah for the first look westward sumatra way over the sea she seemed as fresh and sparkling as a dewdrop  but a dewdrop is evanescent and there was nothing evanescent about freya  i remember her round solid arms with the fine wrists and her broad capable hands with tapering fingers  i dont know whether she was actually born at sea but i do know that up to twelve years of age she sailed about with her parents in various ships  after old nelson lost his wife it became a matter of serious concern for him what to do with the girl  a kind lady in singapore touched by his dumb grief and deplorable perplexity offered to take charge of freya  this arrangement lasted some six years during which old nelson or nielsen retired and established himself on his island and then it was settled the kind lady going away to europe that his daughter should join him  as the first and most important preparation for that event the old fellow ordered from his singapore agent a steyn and ebharts upright grand  i was then commanding a little steamer in the island trade and it fell to my lot to take it out to him so i know something of freyas upright grand  we landed the enormous packingcase with difficulty on a flat piece of rock amongst some bushes nearly knocking the bottom out of one of my boats in the course of that nautical operation  then all my crew assisting engineers and firemen included by the exercise of much anxious ingenuity and by means of rollers levers tackles and inclined planes of soaped planks toiling in the sun like ancient egyptians at the building of a pyramid we got it as far as the house and up on to the edge of the west verandahwhich was the actual drawing room of the bungalow  there the case being ripped off cautiously the beautiful rosewood monster stood revealed at last  in reverent excitement we coaxed it against the wall and drew the first free breath of the day  it was certainly the heaviest movable object on that islet since the creation of the world  the volume of sound it gave out in that bungalow which acted as a soundingboard was really astonishing  it thundered sweetly right over the sea jasper allen told me that early of a morning on the deck of the bonito his wonderfully fast and pretty brig he could hear freya playing her scales quite distinctly  but the fellow always anchored foolishly close to the point as i told him more than once  of course these seas are almost uniformly serene and the seven isles is a particularly calm and cloudless spot as a rule but still now and again an afternoon thunderstorm over banka or even one of these vicious thick squalls from the distant sumatra coast would make a sudden sally upon the group enveloping it for a couple of hours in whirlwinds and bluishblack murk of a particularly sinister aspect  then with the lowered rattan screens rattling desperately in the wind and the bungalow shaking all over freya would sit down to the piano and play fierce wagner music in the flicker of blinding flashes with thunderbolts falling all round enough to make your hair stand on end and jasper would remain stock still on the verandah adoring the back view of her supple swaying figure the miraculous sheen of her fair head the rapid hands on the keys the white nape of her neckwhile the brig down at the point there surged at her cables within a hundred yards of nasty shiny black rockheads  ugh  and this if you please for no reason but that when he went on board at night and laid his head on the pillow he should feel that he was as near as he could conveniently get to his freya slumbering in the bungalow  did you ever  and mind this brig was the home to betheir homethe floating paradise which he was gradually fitting out like a yacht to sail his life blissfully away in with freya  imbecile  but the fellow was always taking chances  one day i remember i watched with freya on the verandah the brig approaching the point from the northward  i suppose jasper made the girl out with his long glass  what does he do  instead of standing on for another mile and a half along the shoals and then tacking for the anchorage in a proper and seamanlike manner he spies a gap between two disgusting old jagged reefs puts the helm down suddenly and shoots the brig through with all her sails shaking and rattling so that we could hear the racket on the verandah  i drew my breath through my teeth i can tell you and freya swore  yes  she clenched her capable fists and stamped with her pretty brown boot and said damn  then looking at me with a little heightened colournot muchshe remarked i forgot you were there and laughed  to be sure to be sure  when jasper was in sight she was not likely to remember that anybody else in the world was there  in my concern at this mad trick i couldnt help appealing to her sympathetic common sense  isnt he a fool i said with feeling  perfect idiot she agreed warmly looking at me straight with her wideopen earnest eyes and the dimple of a smile on her cheek  and that i pointed out to her just to save twenty minutes or so in meeting you  we heard the anchor go down and then she became very resolute and threatening  wait a bit  ill teach him  she went into her own room and shut the door leaving me alone on the verandah with my instructions  long before the brigs sails were furled jasper came up three steps at a time forgetting to say how dye do and looking right and left eagerly  wheres freya  wasnt she here just now  when i explained to him that he was to be deprived of miss freyas presence for a whole hour just to teach him he said i had put her up to it no doubt and that he feared he would have yet to shoot me some day  she and i were getting too thick together then he flung himself into a chair and tried to talk to me about his trip  but the funny thing was that the fellow actually suffered  i could see it  his voice failed him and he sat there dumb looking at the door with the face of a man in pain  fact    and the next still funnier thing was that the girl calmly walked out of her room in less than ten minutes  and then i left i mean to say that i went away to seek old nelson or nielsen on the back verandah which was his own special nook in the distribution of that house with the kind purpose of engaging him in conversation lest he should start roaming about and intrude unwittingly where he was not wanted just then  he knew that the brig had arrived though he did not know that jasper was already with his daughter  i suppose he didnt think it was possible in the time  a father naturally wouldnt  he suspected that allen was sweet on his girl the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea most of the traders in the archipelago and all sorts and conditions of men in the town of singapore were aware of it  but he was not capable of appreciating how far the girl was gone on the fellow  he had an idea that freya was too sensible to ever be gone on anybodyi mean to an unmanageable extent  no it was not that which made him sit on the back verandah and worry himself in his unassuming manner during jaspers visits  what he worried about were the dutch authorities  for it is a fact that the dutch looked askance at the doings of jasper allen owner and master of the brig bonito  they considered him much too enterprising in his trading  i dont know that he ever did anything illegal but it seems to me that his immense activity was repulsive to their stolid character and slowgoing methods anyway in old nelsons opinion the captain of the bonito was a smart sailor and a nice young man but not a desirable acquaintance upon the whole  somewhat compromising you understand  on the other hand he did not like to tell jasper in so many words to keep away  poor old nelson himself was a nice fellow  i believe he would have shrunk from hurting the feelings even of a mopheaded cannibal unless perhaps under very strong provocation  i mean the feelings not the bodies  as against spears knives hatchets clubs or arrows old nelson had proved himself capable of taking his own part  in every other respect he had a timorous soul  so he sat on the back verandah with a concerned expression and whenever the voices of his daughter and jasper allen reached him he would blow out his cheeks and let the air escape with a dismal sound like a much tried man  naturally i derided his fears which he more or less confided to me  he had a certain regard for my judgment and a certain respect not for my moral qualities however but for the good terms i was supposed to be on with the dutch authorities  i knew for a fact that his greatest bugbear the governor of bankaa charming peppery hearty retired rearadmiralhad a distinct liking for him  this consoling assurance which i used always to put forward made old nelson or nielsen brighten up for a moment but in the end he would shake his head doubtfully as much as to say that this was all very well but that there were depths in the dutch official nature which no one but himself had ever fathomed perfectly ridiculous  on this occasion i am speaking of old nelson was even fretty for while i was trying to entertain him with a very funny and somewhat scandalous adventure which happened to a certain acquaintance of ours in saigon he exclaimed suddenly  what the devil he wants to turn up here for  clearly he had not heard a word of the anecdote  and this annoyed me because the anecdote was really good  i stared at him  come come i cried  dont you know what jasper allen is turning up here for  this was the first open allusion i had ever made to the true state of affairs between jasper and his daughter  he took it very calmly  oh freya is a sensible girl he murmured absently his minds eye obviously fixed on the authorities  no freya was no fool he was not concerned about that  he didnt mind it in the least the fellow was just company for her he amused the girl nothing more  when the perspicacious old chap left off mumbling all was still in the house  the other two were amusing themselves very quietly and no doubt very heartily  what more absorbing and less noisy amusement could they have found than to plan their future  side by side on the verandah they must have been looking at the brig the third party in that fascinating game  without her there would have been no future  she was the fortune and the home and the great free world for them  who was it that likened a ship to a prison may i be ignominiously hanged at a yardarm if thats true  the white sails of that craft were the white wingspinions i believe would be the more poetical stylewell the white pinions of their soaring love  soaring as regards jasper  freya being a woman kept a better hold of the mundane connections of this affair  but jasper was elevated in the true sense of the word ever since the day when after they had been gazing at the brig in one of those decisive silences that alone establish a perfect communion between creatures gifted with speech he proposed that she should share the ownership of that treasure with him  indeed he presented the brig to her altogether  but then his heart was in the brig since the day he bought her in manilla from a certain middleaged peruvian in a sober suit of black broadcloth enigmatic and sententious who for all i know might have stolen her on the south american coast whence he said he had come over to the philippines for family reasons  this for family reasons was distinctly good  no true caballero would care to push on inquiries after such a statement  indeed jasper was quite the caballero  the brig herself was then all black and enigmatical and very dirty a tarnished gem of the sea or rather a neglected work of art  for he must have been an artist the obscure builder who had put her body together on lovely lines out of the hardest tropical timber fastened with the purest copper  goodness only knows in what part of the world she was built  jasper himself had not been able to ascertain much of her history from his sententious saturnine peruvianif the fellow was a peruvian and not the devil himself in disguise as jasper jocularly pretended to believe  my opinion is that she was old enough to have been one of the last pirates a slaver perhaps or else an opium clipper of the early days if not an opium smuggler  however that may be she was as sound as on the day she first took the water sailed like a witch steered like a little boat and like some fair women of adventurous life famous in history seemed to have the secret of perpetual youth so that there was nothing unnatural in jasper allen treating her like a lover  and that treatment restored the lustre of her beauty  he clothed her in many coats of the very best white paint so skilfully carefully artistically put on and kept clean by his badgered crew of picked malays that no costly enamel such as jewellers use for their work could have looked better and felt smoother to the touch  a narrow gilt moulding defined her elegant sheer as she sat on the water eclipsing easily the professional good looks of any pleasure yacht that ever came to the east in those days  for myself i must say i prefer a moulding of deep crimson colour on a white hull  it gives a stronger relief besides being less expensive and i told jasper so  but no nothing less than the best goldleaf would do because no decoration could be gorgeous enough for the future abode of his freya  his feelings for the brig and for the girl were as indissolubly united in his heart as you may fuse two precious metals together in one crucible  and the flame was pretty hot i can assure you  it induced in him a fierce inward restlessness both of activity and desire  too fine in face with a lateral wave in his chestnut hair spare longlimbed with an eager glint in his steely eyes and quick brusque movements he made me think sometimes of a flashing swordblade perpetually leaping out of the scabbard  it was only when he was near the girl when he had her there to look at that this peculiarly tense attitude was replaced by a grave devout watchfulness of her slightest movements and utterances  her cool resolute capable goodhumoured selfpossession seemed to steady his heart  was it the magic of her face of her voice of her glances which calmed him so  yet these were the very things one must believe which had set his imagination ablazeif love begins in imagination  but i am no man to discuss such mysteries and it strikes me that we have neglected poor old nelson inflating his cheeks in a state of worry on the back verandah  i pointed out to him that after all jasper was not a very frequent visitor  he and his brig worked hard all over the archipelago  but all old nelson said and he said it uneasily was  i hope heemskirk wont turn up here while the brigs about  getting up a scare about heemskirk now  heemskirk    really one hadnt the patience    chapter ii    for pray who was heemskirk  you shall see at once how unreasonable this dread of heemskirk    certainly his nature was malevolent enough  that was obvious directly you heard him laugh  nothing gives away more a mans secret disposition than the unguarded ring of his laugh  but bless my soul if we were to start at every evil guffaw like a hare at every sound we shouldnt be fit for anything but the solitude of a desert or the seclusion of a hermitage  and even there we should have to put up with the unavoidable company of the devil  however the devil is a considerable personage who has known better days and has moved high up in the hierarchy of celestial host but in the hierarchy of mere earthly dutchmen heemskirk whose early days could not have been very splendid was merely a naval officer forty years of age of no particular connections or ability to boast of  he was commanding the neptun a little gunboat employed on dreary patrol duty up and down the archipelago to look after the traders  not a very exalted position truly  i tell you just a common middleaged lieutenant of some twentyfive years service and sure to be retired before longthats all  he never bothered his head very much as to what was going on in the seven isles group till he learned from some talk in mintok or palembang i suppose that there was a pretty girl living there curiosity i presume caused him to go poking around that way and then after he had once seen freya he made a practice of calling at the group whenever he found himself within half a days steaming from it  i dont mean to say that heemskirk was a typical dutch naval officer  i have seen enough of them not to fall into that absurd mistake  he had a big cleanshaven face great flat brown cheeks with a thin hooked nose and a small pursy mouth squeezed in between  there were a few silver threads in his black hair and his unpleasant eyes were nearly black too  he had a surly way of casting side glances without moving his head which was set low on a short round neck  a thick round trunk in a dark undress jacket with gold shoulderstraps was sustained by a straddly pair of thick round legs in white drill trousers  his round skull under a white cap looked as if it were immensely thick too but there were brains enough in it to discover and take advantage maliciously of poor old nelsons nervousness before everything that was invested with the merest shred of authority  heemskirk would land on the point and perambulate silently every part of the plantation as if the whole place belonged to him before her went to the house  on the verandah he would take the best chair and would stay for tiffin or dinner just simply stay on without taking the trouble to invite himself by so much as a word  he ought to have been kicked if only for his manner to miss freya had he been a naked savage armed with spears and poisoned arrows old nelson or nielsen would have gone for him with his bare fists  but these gold shoulderstrapsdutch shoulderstraps at thatwere enough to terrify the old fellow so he let the beggar treat him with heavy contempt devour his daughter with his eyes and drink the best part of his little stock of wine  i saw something of this and on one occasion i tried to pass a remark on the subject  it was pitiable to see the trouble in old nelsons round eyes  at first he cried out that the lieutenant was a good friend of his a very good fellow  i went on staring at him pretty hard so that at last he faltered and had to own that of course heemskirk was not a very genial person outwardly but all the same at bottom     i havent yet met a genial dutchman out here i interrupted geniality after all is not of much consequence but dont you see  nelson looked suddenly so frightened at what i was going to say that i hadnt the heart to go on  of course i was going to tell him that the fellow was after his girl  that just describes it exactly  what heemskirk might have expected or what he thought he could do i dont know  for all i can tell he might have imagined himself irresistible or have taken freya for what she was not on account of her lively assured unconstrained manner  but there it is  he was after that girl  nelson could see it well enough only he preferred to ignore it  he did not want to be told of it  all i want is to live in peace and quietness with the dutch authorities he mumbled shamefacedly  he was incurable  i was sorry for him and i really think miss freya was sorry for her father too  she restrained herself for his sake and as everything she did she did it simply unaffectedly and even good humouredly  no small effort that because in heemskirks attentions there was an insolent touch of scorn hard to put up with  dutchmen of that sort are overbearing to their inferiors and that officer of the king looked upon old nelson and freya as quite beneath him in every way  i cant say i felt sorry for freya  she was not the sort of girl to take anything tragically  one could feel for her and sympathise with her difficulty but she seemed equal to any situation  it was rather admiration she extorted by her competent serenity  it was only when jasper and heemskirk were together at the bungalow as it happened now and then that she felt the strain and even then it was not for everybody to see  my eyes alone could detect a faint shadow on the radiance of her personality  once i could not help saying to her appreciatively  upon my word you are wonderful  she let it pass with a faint smile  the great thing is to prevent jasper becoming unreasonable she said and i could see real concern lurking in the quiet depths of her frank eyes gazing straight at me  you will help to keep him quiet wont you  of course we must keep him quiet i declared understanding very well the nature of her anxiety  hes such a lunatic too when hes roused  he is she assented in a soft tone for it was our joke to speak of jasper abusively  but i have tamed him a bit  hes quite a good boy now  he would squash heemskirk like a blackbeetle all the same i remarked  rather she murmured  and that wouldnt do she added quickly imagine the state poor papa would get into  besides i mean to be mistress of the dear brig and sail about these seas not go off wandering ten thousand miles away from here  the sooner you are on board to look after the man and the brig the better i said seriously  they need you to steady them both a bit  i dont think jasper will ever get sobered down till he has carried you off from this island  you dont see him when he is away from you as i do  hes in a state of perpetual elation which almost frightens me  at this she smiled again and then looked serious  for it could not be unpleasant to her to be told of her power and she had some sense of her responsibility  she slipped away from me suddenly because heemskirk with old nelson in attendance at his elbow was coming up the steps of the verandah  directly his head came above the level of the floor his illnatured black eyes shot glances here and there  wheres your girl nelson he asked in a tone as if every soul in the world belonged to him  and then to me  the goddess has flown eh  nelsons coveas we used to call itwas crowded with shipping that day  there was first my steamer then the neptun gunboat further out and the bonito brig anchored as usual so close inshore that it looked as if with a little skill and judgment one could shy a hat from the verandah on to her scrupulously holystoned quarterdeck  her brasses flashed like gold her white bodypaint had a sheen like a satin robe  the rake of her varnished spars and the big yards squared to a hair gave her a sort of martial elegance  she was a beauty  no wonder that in possession of a craft like that and the promise of a girl like freya jasper lived in a state of perpetual elation fit perhaps for the seventh heaven but not exactly safe in a world like ours  i remarked politely to heemskirk that with three guests in the house miss freya had no doubt domestic matters to attend to  i knew of course that she had gone to meet jasper at a certain cleared spot on the banks of the only stream on nelsons little island  the commander of the neptun gave me a dubious black look and began to make himself at home flinging his thick cylindrical carcass into a rockingchair and unbuttoning his coat  old nelson sat down opposite him in a most unassuming manner staring anxiously with his round eyes and fanning himself with his hat  i tried to make conversation to while the time away not an easy task with a morose enamoured dutchman constantly looking from one door to another and answering ones advances either with a jeer or a grunt  however the evening passed off all right  luckily there is a degree of bliss too intense for elation  jasper was quiet and concentrated silently in watching freya  as we went on board our respective ships i offered to give his brig a tow out next morning i did it on purpose to get him away at the earliest possible moment  so in the first cold light of the dawn we passed by the gunboat lying black and still without a sound in her at the mouth of the glassy cove  but with tropical swiftness the sun had climbed twice its diameter above the horizon before we had rounded the reef and got abreast of the point  on the biggest boulder there stood freya all in white and in her helmet like a feminine and martial statue with a rosy face as i could see very well with my glasses  she fluttered an expressive handkerchief and jasper running up the main rigging of the white and warlike brig waved his hat in response  shortly afterwards we parted i to the northward and jasper heading east with a light wind on the quarter for banjermassin and two other ports i believe it was that trip  this peaceful occasion was the last on which i saw all these people assembled together the charmingly fresh and resolute freya the innocently roundeyed old nelson jasper keen long limbed lean faced admirably selfcontained in his manner because inconceivably happy under the eyes of his freya all three tall fair and blueeyed in varied shades and amongst them the swarthy arrogant blackhaired dutchman shorter nearly by a head and so much thicker than any of them that he seemed to be a creature capable of inflating itself a grotesque specimen of mankind from some other planet  the contrast struck me all at once as we stood in the lighted verandah after rising from the dinnertable  i was fascinated by it for the rest of the evening and i remember the impression of something funny and illomened at the same time in it to this day    chapter iii    a few weeks later coming early one morning into singapore from a journey to the southward i saw the brig lying at anchor in all her usual symmetry and splendour of aspect as though she had been taken out of a glass case and put delicately into the water that very moment  she was well out in the roadstead but i steamed in and took up my habitual berth close in front of the town  before we had finished breakfast a quartermaster came to tell me that captain allens boat was coming our way  his smart gig dashed alongside and in two bounds he was up our accommodationladder and shaking me by the hand with his nervous grip his eyes snapping inquisitively for he supposed i had called at the seven isles group on my way  i reached into my pocket for a nicely folded little note which he grabbed out of my hand without ceremony and carried off on the bridge to read by himself  after a decent interval i followed him up there and found him pacing to and fro for the nature of his emotions made him restless even in his most thoughtful moments  he shook his head at me triumphantly  well my dear boy he said i shall be counting the days now  i understood what he meant  i knew that those young people had settled already on a runaway match without official preliminaries this was really a logical decision  old nelson or nielsen would never have agreed to give up freya peaceably to this compromising jasper  heavens  what would the dutch authorities say to such a match  it sounds too ridiculous for words  but theres nothing in the world more selfishly hard than a timorous man in a fright about his little estate as old nelson used to call it in apologetic accents  a heart permeated by a particular sort of funk is proof against sense feeling and ridicule  its a flint  jasper would have made his request all the same and then taken his own way but it was freya who decided that nothing should be said on the ground that papa would only worry himself to distraction he was capable of making himself ill and then she wouldnt have the heart to leave him  here you have the sanity of feminine outlook and the frankness of feminine reasoning  and for the rest miss freya could read poor dear papa in the way a woman reads a manlike an open book  his daughter once gone old nelson would not worry himself  he would raise a great outcry and make no end of lamentable fuss but thats not the same thing  the real agonies of indecision the anguish of conflicting feelings would be spared to him  and as he was too unassuming to rage he would after a period of lamentation devote himself to his little estate and to keeping on good terms with the authorities  time would do the rest  and freya thought she could afford to wait while ruling over her own home in the beautiful brig and over the man who loved her  this was the life for her who had learned to walk on a ships deck  she was a shipchild a seagirl if ever there was one  and of course she loved jasper and trusted him but there was a shade of anxiety in her pride  it is very fine and romantic to possess for your very own a finely tempered and trusty swordblade but whether it is the best weapon to counter with the common cudgelplay of fatethats another question  she knew that she had the more substance of the twoyou neednt try any cheap jokes i am not talking of their weights  she was just a little anxious while he was away and she had me who being a tried confidant took the liberty to whisper frequently the sooner the better  but there was a peculiar vein of obstinacy in miss freya and her reason for delay was characteristic  not before my twentyfirst birthday so that there shall be no mistake in peoples minds as to me being old enough to know what i am doing  jaspers feelings were in such subjection that he had never even remonstrated against the decree  she was just splendid whatever she did or said and there was an end of it for him  i believe that he was subtle enough to be even flattered at bottomat times and then to console him he had the brig which seemed pervaded by the spirit of freya since whatever he did on board was always done under the supreme sanction of his love  yes  ill soon begin to count the days he repeated  eleven months more  ill have to crowd three trips into that  mind you dont come to grief trying to do too much i admonished him  but he dismissed my caution with a laugh and an elated gesture  pooh  nothing nothing could happen to the brig he cried as if the flame of his heart could light up the dark nights of uncharted seas and the image of freya serve for an unerring beacon amongst hidden shoals as if the winds had to wait on his future the stars fight for it in their courses as if the magic of his passion had the power to float a ship on a drop of dew or sail her through the eye of a needlesimply because it was her magnificent lot to be the servant of a love so full of grace as to make all the ways of the earth safe resplendent and easy  i suppose i said after he had finished laughing at my innocent enough remark i suppose you will be off today  that was what he meant to do  he had not gone at daylight only because he expected me to come in  and only fancy what has happened yesterday he went on  my mate left me suddenly  had to  and as theres nobody to be found at a short notice i am going to take schultz with me  the notorious schultz  why dont you jump out of your skin  i tell you i went and unearthed schultz late last evening after no end of trouble i am your man captain he says in that wonderful voice of his but i am sorry to confess i have practically no clothes to my back  i have had to sell all my wardrobe to get a little food from day to day  what a voice that man has got  talk about moving stones  but people seem to get used to it  i had never seen him before and upon my word i felt suddenly tears rising to my eyes luckily it was dusk  he was sitting very quiet under a tree in a native compound as thin as a lath and when i peered down at him all he had on was an old cotton singlet and a pair of ragged pyjamas  i bought him six white suits and two pairs of canvas shoes  cant clear the ship without a mate  must have somebody i am going on shore presently to sign him on and i shall take him with me as i go back on board to get under way  now i am a lunaticam i not  mad of course  come on  lay it on thick let yourself go  i like to see you get excited  he so evidently expected me to scold that i took especial pleasure in exaggerating the calmness of my attitude  the worst that can be brought up against schultz i began folding my arms and speaking dispassionately is an awkward habit of stealing the stores of every ship he has ever been in  he will do it  thats really all thats wrong  i dont credit absolutely that story captain robinson tells of schultz conspiring in chantabun with some ruffians in a chinese junk to steal the anchor off the starboard bow of the bohemian girl schooner  robinsons story is too ingenious altogether  that other tale of the engineers of the nanshan finding schultz at midnight in the engineroom busy hammering at the brass bearings to carry them off for sale on shore seems to me more authentic  apart from this little weakness let me tell you that schultz is a smarter sailor than many who never took a drop of drink in their lives and perhaps no worse morally than some men you and i know who have never stolen the value of a penny  he may not be a desirable person to have on board ones ship but since you have no choice he may be made to do i believe  the important thing is to understand his psychology  dont give him any money till you have done with him  not a cent if he begs ever so  for as sure as fate the moment you give him any money he will begin to steal  just remember that  i enjoyed jaspers incredulous surprise  the devil he will he cried  what on earth for  arent you trying to pull my leg old boy  no  im not  you must understand schultzs psychology  hes neither a loafer nor a cadger  hes not likely to wander about looking for somebody to stand him drinks  but suppose he goes on shore with five dollars or fifty for that matter in his pocket after the third or fourth glass he becomes fuddled and charitable he either drops his money all over the place or else distributes the lot around gives it to any one who will take it  then it occurs to him that the night is young yet and that he may require a good many more drinks for himself and his friends before morning so he starts off cheerfully for his ship  his legs never get affected nor his head either in the usual way  he gets aboard and simply grabs the first thing that seems to him suitablethe cabin lamp a coil of rope a bag of biscuits a drum of oiland converts it into money without thinking twice about it  this is the process and no other  you have only to look out that he doesnt get a start  thats all  confound his psychology muttered jasper  but a man with a voice like his is fit to talk to the angels  is he incurable do you think  i said that i thought so  nobody had prosecuted him yet but no one would employ him any longer  his end would be i feared to starve in some hole or other  ah well reflected jasper  the bonito isnt trading to any ports of civilisation  thatll make it easier for him to keep straight  that was true  the brigs business was on uncivilised coasts with obscure rajahs dwelling in nearly unknown bays with native settlements up mysterious rivers opening their sombre forestlined estuaries among a welter of pale green reefs and dazzling sand banks in lonely straits of calm blue water all aglitter with sunshine  alone far from the beaten tracks she glided all white round dark frowning headlands stole out silent like a ghost from behind points of land stretching out all black in the moonlight or lay hoveto like a sleeping seabird under the shadow of some nameless mountain waiting for a signal  she would be glimpsed suddenly on misty squally days dashing disdainfully aside the short aggressive waves of the java sea or be seen far far away a tiny dazzling white speck flying across the brooding purple masses of thunderclouds piled up on the horizon  sometimes on the rare mail tracks where civilisation brushes against wild mystery when the naive passengers crowding along the rail exclaimed pointing at her with interest  oh heres a yacht the dutch captain with a hostile glance would grunt contemptuously  yacht  no  thats only english jasper  a pedlar  a good seaman you say ejaculated jasper still in the matter of the hopeless schultz with the wonderfully touching voice  first rate  ask any one  quite worth havingonly impossible i declared  he shall have his chance to reform in the brig said jasper with a laugh  there will be no temptations either to drink or steal where i am going to this time  i didnt press him for anything more definite on that point  in fact intimate as we were i had a pretty clear notion of the general run of his business  but as we are going ashore in his gig he asked suddenly  by the way do you know where heemskirk is  i eyed him covertly and was reassured  he had asked the question not as a lover but as a trader  i told him that i had heard in palembang that the neptun was on duty down about flores and sumbawa  quite out of his way  he expressed his satisfaction  you know he went on that fellow when he gets on the borneo coast amuses himself by knocking down my beacons  i have had to put up a few to help me in and out of the rivers  early this year a celebes trader becalmed in a prau was watching him at it  he steamed the gunboat full tilt at two of them one after another smashing them to pieces and then lowered a boat on purpose to pull out a third which i had a lot of trouble six months ago to stick up in the middle of a mudflat for a tide mark  did you ever hear of anything more provokingeh  i wouldnt quarrel with the beggar i observed casually yet disliking that piece of news strongly  it isnt worth while  i quarrel cried jasper  i dont want to quarrel  i dont want to hurt a single hair of his ugly head  my dear fellow when i think of freyas twentyfirst birthday all the worlds my friend heemskirk included  its a nasty spiteful amusement all the same  we parted rather hurriedly on the quay each of us having his own pressing business to attend to  i would have been very much cut up had i known that this hurried grasp of the hand with so long old boy  good luck to you was the last of our partings  on his return to the straits i was away and he was gone again before i got back  he was trying to achieve three trips before freyas twentyfirst birthday  at nelsons cove i missed him again by only a couple of days  freya and i talked of that lunatic and perfect idiot with great delight and infinite appreciation  she was very radiant with a more pronounced gaiety notwithstanding that she had just parted from jasper  but this was to be their last separation  do get aboard as soon as you can miss freya i entreated  she looked me straight in the face her colour a little heightened and with a sort of solemn ardourif there was a little catch in her voice  the very next day  ah yes  the very next day after her twentyfirst birthday  i was pleased at this hint of deep feeling  it was as if she had grown impatient at last of the selfimposed delay  i supposed that jaspers recent visit had told heavily  thats right i said approvingly  i shall be much easier in my mind when i know you have taken charge of that lunatic  dont you lose a minute  he of course will be on timeunless heavens fall  yes  unless she repeated in a thoughtful whisper raising her eyes to the evening sky without a speck of cloud anywhere  silent for a time we let our eyes wander over the waters below looking mysteriously still in the twilight as if trustfully composed for a long long dream in the warm tropical night  and the peace all round us seemed without limits and without end  and then we began again to talk jasper over in our usual strain we agreed that he was too reckless in many ways  luckily the brig was equal to the situation  nothing apparently was too much for her  a perfect darling of a ship said miss freya  she and her father had spent an afternoon on board  jasper had given them some tea  papa was grumpy    i had a vision of old nelson under the brigs snowy awnings nursing his unassuming vexation and fanning himself with his hat  a comedy father    as a new instance of jaspers lunacy i was told that he was distressed at his inability to have solid silver handles fitted to all the cabin doors  as if i would have let him commented miss freya with amused indignation  incidentally i learned also that schultz the nautical kleptomaniac with the pathetic voice was still hanging on to his job with miss freyas approval  jasper had confided to the lady of his heart his purpose of straightening out the fellows psychology  yes indeed  all the world was his friend because it breathed the same air with freya  somehow or other i brought heemskirks name into conversation and to my great surprise startled miss freya  her eyes expressed something like distress while she bit her lip as if to contain an explosion of laughter  oh  yes  heemskirk was at the bungalow at the same time with jasper but he arrived the day after  he left the same day as the brig but a few hours later  what a nuisance he must have been to you two i said feelingly  her eyes flashed at me a sort of frightened merriment and suddenly she exploded into a clear burst of laughter  ha ha ha  i echoed it heartily but not with the game charming tone  ha ha ha    isnt he grotesque  ha ha ha  and the ludicrousness of old nelsons inanely fierce round eyes in association with his conciliatory manner to the lieutenant presenting itself to my mind brought on another fit  he looks i spluttered he looksha ha haamongst you three    like an unhappy blackbeetle  ha ha ha  she gave out another ringing peal ran off into her own room and slammed the door behind her leaving me profoundly astounded  i stopped laughing at once  whats the joke asked old nelsons voice half way down the steps  he came up sat down and blew out his cheeks looking inexpressibly fatuous  but i didnt want to laugh any more  and what on earth i asked myself have we been laughing at in this uncontrollable fashion  i felt suddenly depressed  oh yes  freya had started it  the girls overwrought i thought and really one couldnt wonder at it  i had no answer to old nelsons question but he was too aggrieved at jaspers visit to think of anything else  he as good as asked me whether i wouldnt undertake to hint to jasper that he was not wanted at the seven isles group  i declared that it was not necessary  from certain circumstances which had come to my knowledge lately i had reason to think that he would not be much troubled by jasper allen in the future  he emitted an earnest thank god which nearly set me laughing again but he did not brighten up proportionately  it seemed heemskirk had taken special pains to make himself disagreeable the lieutenant had frightened old nelson very much by expressing a sinister wonder at the government permitting a white man to settle down in that part at all  it is against our declared policy he had remarked  he had also charged him with being in reality no better than an englishman  he had even tried to pick a quarrel with him for not learning to speak dutch  i told him i was too old to learn now sighed out old nelson or nielsen dismally  he said i ought to have learned dutch long before  i had been making my living in dutch dependencies  it was disgraceful of me not to speak dutch he said  he was as savage with me as if i had been a chinaman  it was plain he had been viciously badgered  he did not mention how many bottles of his best claret he had offered up on the altar of conciliation  it must have been a generous libation  but old nelson or nielsen was really hospitable  he didnt mind that and i only regretted that this virtue should be lavished on the lieutenantcommander of the neptun  i longed to tell him that in all probability he would be relieved from heemskirks visitations also  i did not do so only from the fear absurd i admit of arousing some sort of suspicion in his mind  as if with this guileless comedy father such a thing were possible  strangely enough the last words on the subject of heemskirk were spoken by freya and in that very sense  the lieutenant was turning up persistently in old nelsons conversation at dinner  at last i muttered a half audible damn the lieutenant  i could see that the girl was getting exasperated too  and he wasnt well at allwas he freya old nelson went on moaning  perhaps it was that which made him so snappish hey freya  he looked very bad when he left us so suddenly  his liver must be in a bad state too  oh he will end by getting over it said freya impatiently  and do leave off worrying about him papa  very likely you wont see much of him for a long time to come  the look she gave me in exchange for my discreet smile had no hidden mirth in it  her eyes seemed hollowed her face gone wan in a couple of hours  we had been laughing too much  overwrought overwrought by the approach of the decisive moment  after all sincere courageous and selfreliant as she was she must have felt both the passion and the compunction of her resolve  the very strength of love which had carried her up to that point must have put her under a great moral strain in which there might have been a little simple remorse too  for she was honestand there across the table sat poor old nelson or nielsen staring at her roundeyed and so pathetically comic in his fierce aspect as to touch the most lightsome heart  he retired early to his room to soothe himself for a nights rest by perusing his accountbooks  we two remained on the verandah for another hour or so but we exchanged only languid phrases on things without importance as though we had been emotionally jaded by our long days talk on the only momentous subject  and yet there was something she might have told a friend  but she didnt  we parted silently  she distrusted my masculine lack of common sense perhaps    o  freya  going down the precipitous path to the landingstage i was confronted in the shadows of boulders and bushes by a draped feminine figure whose appearance startled me at first  it glided into my way suddenly from behind a piece of rock  but in a moment it occurred to me that it could be no one else but freyas maid a halfcaste malacca portuguese  one caught fleeting glimpses of her olive face and dazzling white teeth about the house  i had observed her at times from a distance as she sat within call under the shade of some fruit trees brushing and plaiting her long raven locks  it seemed to be the principal occupation of her leisure hours  we had often exchanged nods and smilesand a few words too  she was a pretty creature  and once i had watched her approvingly make funny and expressive grimaces behind heemskirks back  i understood from jasper that she was in the secret like a comedy camerista  she was to accompany freya on her irregular way to matrimony and ever after happiness  why should she be roaming by night near the coveunless on some love affair of her owni asked myself  but there was nobody suitable within the seven isles group as far as i knew  it flashed upon me that it was myself she had been lying in wait for  she hesitated muffled from head to foot shadowy and bashful  i advanced another pace and how i felt is nobodys business  what is it i asked very low  nobody knows i am here she whispered  and nobody can see us i whispered back  the murmur of words ive been so frightened reached me  just then forty feet above our head from the yet lighted verandah unexpected and startling freyas voice rang out in a clear imperious call  antonia  with a stifled exclamation the hesitating girl vanished out of the path  a bush near by rustled then silence  i waited wondering the lights on the verandah went out  i waited a while longer then continued down the path to my boat wondering more than ever  i remember the occurrences of that visit especially because this was the last time i saw the nelson bungalow  on arriving at the straits i found cable messages which made it necessary for me to throw up my employment at a moments notice and go home at once  i had a desperate scramble to catch the mailboat which was due to leave next day but i found time to write two short notes one to freya the other to jasper  later on i wrote at length this time to allen alone  i got no answer  i hunted up then his brother or rather halfbrother a solicitor in the city a sallow calm little man who looked at me over his spectacles thoughtfully  jasper was the only child of his fathers second marriage a transaction which had failed to commend itself to the first grown up family  you havent heard for ages i repeated with secret annoyance may i ask what for ages means in this connection  it means that i dont care whether i ever hear from him or not retorted the little man of law turning nasty suddenly  i could not blame jasper for not wasting his time in correspondence with such an outrageous relative  but why didnt he write to mea decent sort of friend after all enough of a friend to find for his silence the excuse of forgetfulness natural to a state of transcendental bliss  i waited indulgently but nothing ever came and the east seemed to drop out of my life without an echo like a stone falling into a well of prodigious depth    chapter iv    i suppose praiseworthy motives are a sufficient justification almost for anything  what could be more commendable in the abstract than a girls determination that poor papa should not be worried and her anxiety that the man of her choice should be kept by any means from every occasion of doing something rash something which might endanger the whole scheme of their happiness  nothing could be more tender and more prudent  we must also remember the girls selfreliant temperament and the general unwillingness of womeni mean women of senseto make a fuss over matters of that sort  as has been said already heemskirk turned up some time after jaspers arrival at nelsons cove  the sight of the brig lying right under the bungalow was very offensive to him  he did not fly ashore before his anchor touched the ground as jasper used to do on the contrary he hung about his quarterdeck mumbling to himself and when he ordered his boat to be manned it was in an angry voice  freyas existence which lifted jasper out of himself into a blissful elation was for heemskirk a cause of secret torment of hours of exasperated brooding  while passing the brig he hailed her harshly and asked if the master was on board  schultz smart and neat in a spotless white suit leaned over the taffrail finding the question somewhat amusing  he looked humorously down into heemskirks boat and answered in the most amiable modulations of his beautiful voice captain allen is up at the house sir  but his expression changed suddenly at the savage growl  what the devil are you grinning at which acknowledged that information  he watched heemskirk land and instead of going to the house stride away by another path into the grounds  the desiretormented dutchman found old nelson or nielsen at his dryingsheds very busy superintending the manipulation of his tobacco crop which though small was of excellent quality and enjoying himself thoroughly  but heemskirk soon put a stop to this simple happiness  he sat down by the old chap and by the sort of talk which he knew was best calculated for the purpose reduced him before long to a state of concealed and perspiring nervousness  it was a horrid talk of authorities and old nelson tried to defend himself  if he dealt with english traders it was because he had to dispose of his produce somehow  he was as conciliatory as he knew how to be and this very thing seemed to excite heemskirk who had worked himself up into a heavily breathing state of passion  and the worst of them all is that allen he growled  your particular friendeh  you have let in a lot of these englishmen into this part  you ought never to have been allowed to settle here  never  whats he doing here now  old nelson or nielsen becoming very agitated declared that jasper allen was no particular friend of his  no friend at allat all  he had bought three tons of rice from him to feed his workpeople on  what sort of evidence of friendship was that heemskirk burst out at last with the thought that had been gnawing at his vitals  yes  sell three tons of rice and flirt three days with that girl of yours  i am speaking to you as a friend nielsen  this wont do  you are only on sufferance here  old nelson was taken aback at first but recovered pretty quickly wont do  certainly  of course it wouldnt do  the last man in the world  but his girl didnt care for the fellow and was too sensible to fall in love with any one  he was very earnest in impressing on heemskirk his own feeling of absolute security  and the lieutenant casting doubting glances sideways was yet willing to believe him  much you know about it he grunted nevertheless  but i do know insisted old nelson with the greater desperation because he wanted to resist the doubts arising in his own mind my own daughter  in my own house and i not to know  come  it would be a good joke lieutenant  they seem to be carrying on considerably remarked heemskirk moodily  i suppose they are together now he added feeling a pang which changed what he meant for a mocking smile into a strange grimace  the harassed nelson shook his hand at him  he was at bottom shocked at this insistence and was even beginning to feel annoyed at the absurdity of it  pooh  pooh  ill tell you what lieutenant  you go to the house and have a drop of ginandbitters before dinner  ask for freya i must see the last of this tobacco put away for the night but ill be along presently  heemskirk was not insensible to this suggestion  it answered to his secret longing which was not a longing for drink however old nelson shouted solicitously after his broad back a recommendation to make himself comfortable and that there was a box of cheroots on the verandah  it was the west verandah that old nelson meant the one which was the livingroom of the house and had splitrattan screens of the very finest quality  the east verandah sacred to his own privacy puffing out of cheeks and other signs of perplexed thinking was fitted with stout blinds of sailcloth  the north verandah was not a verandah at all really  it was more like a long balcony  it did not communicate with the other two and could only be approached by a passage inside the house  thus it had a privacy which made it a convenient place for a maidens meditations without words and also for the discourses apparently without sense which passing between a young man and a maid become pregnant with a diversity of transcendental meanings  this north verandah was embowered with climbing plants  freya whose room opened out on it had furnished it as a sort of boudoir for herself with a few cane chairs and a sofa of the same kind on this sofa she and jasper sat as close together as is possible in this imperfect world where neither can a body be in two places at once nor yet two bodies can be in one place at the same time  they had been sitting together all the afternoon and i wont say that their talk had been without sense  loving him with a little judicious anxiety lest in his elation he should break his heart over some mishap freya naturally would talk to him soberly  he nervous and brusque when away from her appeared always as if overcome by her visibility by the great wonder of being palpably loved  an old mans child having lost his mother early thrown out to sea out of the way while very young he had not much experience of tenderness of any kind  in this private foliageembowered verandah and at this late hour of the afternoon he bent down a little and possessing himself of freyas hands was kissing them one after another while she smiled and looked down at his head with the eyes of approving compassion at that same moment heemskirk was approaching the house from the north  antonia was on the watch on that side  but she did not keep a very good watch  the sun was setting she knew that her young mistress and the captain of the bonito were about to separate  she was walking to and fro in the dusky grove with a flower in her hair and singing softly to herself when suddenly within a foot of her the lieutenant appeared from behind a tree  she bounded aside like a startled fawn but heemskirk with a lucid comprehension of what she was there for pounced upon her and catching her arm clapped his other thick hand over her mouth  if you try to make a noise ill twist your neck  this ferocious figure of speech terrified the girl sufficiently heemskirk had seen plainly enough on the verandah freyas golden head with another head very close to it  he dragged the unresisting maid with him by a circuitous way into the compound where he dismissed her with a vicious push in the direction of the cluster of bamboo huts for the servants  she was very much like the faithful camerista of italian comedy but in her terror she bolted away without a sound from that thick short blackeyed man with a cruel grip of fingers like a vice quaking all over at a distance extremely scared and half inclined to laugh she saw him enter the house at the back  the interior of the bungalow was divided by two passages crossing each other in the middle  at that point heemskirk by turning his head slightly to the left as he passed secured the evidence of carrying on so irreconcilable with old nelsons assurances that it made him stagger with a rush of blood to his head  two white figures distinct against the light stood in an unmistakable attitude  freyas arms were round jaspers neck  their faces were characteristically superimposed on each other and heemskirk went on his throat choked with a sudden rising of curses till on the west verandah he stumbled blindly against a chair and then dropped into another as though his legs had been swept from under him  he had indulged too long in the habit of appropriating freya to himself in his thoughts  is that how you entertain your visitors you    he thought so outraged that he could not find a sufficiently degrading epithet  freya struggled a little and threw her head back  somebody has come in she whispered  jasper holding her clasped closely to his breast and looking down into her face suggested casually  your father  freya tried to disengage herself but she had not the heart absolutely to push him away with her hands  i believe its heemskirk she breathed out at him  he plunging into her eyes in a quiet rapture was provoked to a vague smile by the sound of the name  the ass is always knocking down my beacons outside the river he murmured  he attached no other meaning to heemskirks existence but freya was asking herself whether the lieutenant had seen them  let me go kid she ordered in a peremptory whisper  jasper obeyed and stepping back at once continued his contemplation of her face under another angle  i must go and see she said to herself anxiously  she instructed him hurriedly to wait a moment after she was gone and then to slip on to the back verandah and get a quiet smoke before he showed himself  dont stay late this evening was her last recommendation before she left him  then freya came out on the west verandah with her light rapid step  while going through the doorway she managed to shake down the folds of the loopedup curtains at the end of the passage so as to cover jaspers retreat from the bower  directly she appeared heemskirk jumped up as if to fly at her  she paused and he made her an exaggerated low bow  it irritated freya  oh  its you mr heemskirk  how do you do  she spoke in her usual tone  her face was not plainly visible to him in the dusk of the deep verandah  he dared not trust himself to speak his rage at what he had seen was so great  and when she added with serenity  papa will be coming in before long he called her horrid names silently to himself before he spoke with contorted lips  i have seen your father already  we had a talk in the sheds  he told me some very interesting things  oh very  freya sat down  she thought  he has seen us for certain  she was not ashamed  what she was afraid of was some foolish or awkward complication  but she could not conceive how much her person had been appropriated by heemskirk in his thoughts  she tried to be conversational  you are coming now from palembang i suppose  eh  what  oh yes  i come from palembang  ha ha ha  you know what your father said  he said he was afraid you were having a very dull time of it here  and i suppose you are going to cruise in the moluccas continued freya who wanted to impart some useful information to jasper if possible  at the same time she was always glad to know that those two men were a few hundred miles apart when not under her eye  heemskirk growled angrily  yes  moluccas glaring in the direction of her shadowy figure your father thinks its very quiet for you here  i tell you what miss freya  there isnt such a quiet spot on earth that a woman cant find an opportunity of making a fool of somebody  freya thought  i mustnt let him provoke me  presently the tamil boy who was nelsons head servant came in with the lights she addressed him at once with voluble directions where to put the lamps told him to bring the tray with the gin and bitters and to send antonia into the house  i will have to leave you to yourself mr heemskirk for a while she said  and she went to her room to put on another frock  she made a quick change of it because she wished to be on the verandah before her father and the lieutenant met again  she relied on herself to regulate that evenings intercourse between these two  but antonia still scared and hysterical exhibited a bruise on her arm which roused freyas indignation  he jumped on me out of the bush like a tiger said the girl laughing nervously with frightened eyes  the brute thought freya  he meant to spy on us then  she was enraged but the recollection of the thick dutchman in white trousers wide at the hips and narrow at the ankles with his shoulderstraps and black bullet head glaring at her in the light of the lamps was so repulsively comical that she could not help a smiling grimace  then she became anxious  the absurdities of three men were forcing this anxiety upon her  jaspers impetuosity her fathers fears heemskirks infatuation  she was very tender to the first two and she made up her mind to display all her feminine diplomacy  all this she said to herself will be over and done with before very long now  heemskirk on the verandah lolling in a chair his legs extended and his white cap reposing on his stomach was lashing himself into a fury of an atrocious character altogether incomprehensible to a girl like freya  his chin was resting on his chest his eyes gazed stonily at his shoes  freya examined him from behind the curtain he didnt stir  he was ridiculous  but this absolute stillness was impressive  she stole back along the passage to the east verandah where jasper was sitting quietly in the dark doing what he was told like a good boy  psst she hissed  he was by her side in a moment  yes  what is it he murmured  its that beetle she whispered uneasily  under the impression of heemskirks sinister immobility she had half a mind to let jasper know that they had been seen  but she was by no means certain that heemskirk would tell her fatherand at any rate not that evening  she concluded rapidly that the safest thing would be to get jasper out of the way as soon as possible  what has he been doing asked jasper in a calm undertone  oh nothing  nothing  he sits there looking cross  but you know how hes always worrying papa  your fathers quite unreasonable pronounced jasper judicially  i dont know she said in a doubtful tone  something of old nelsons dread of the authorities had rubbed off on the girl since she had to live with it day after day  i dont know  papas afraid of being reduced to beggary as he says in his old days look here kid you had better clear out tomorrow first thing  jasper had hoped for another afternoon with freya an afternoon of quiet felicity with the girl by his side and his eyes on his brig anticipating a blissful future  his silence was eloquent with disappointment and freya understood it very well  she too was disappointed  but it was her business to be sensible  we shant have a moment to ourselves with that beetle creeping round the house she argued in a low hurried voice  so whats the good of your staying  and he wont go while the brigs here you know he wont  he ought to be reported for loitering murmured jasper with a vexed little laugh  mind you get under way at daylight recommended freya under her breath  he detained her after the manner of lovers  she expostulated without struggling because it was hard for her to repulse him  he whispered into her ear while he put his arms round her  next time we two meet next time i hold you like this it shall be on board  you and i in the brigall the world all the life and then he flashed out  i wonder i can wait  i feel as if i must carry you off now at once  i could run with you in my hands down the pathwithout stumblingwithout touching the earth  she was still  she listened to the passion in his voice  she was saying to herself that if she were to whisper the faintest yes if she were but to sigh lightly her consent he would do it  he was capable of doing itwithout touching the earth  she closed her eyes and smiled in the dark abandoning herself in a delightful giddiness for an instant to his encircling arm  but before he could be tempted to tighten his grasp she was out of it a foot away from him and in full possession of herself  that was the steady freya  she was touched by the deep sigh which floated up to her from the white figure of jasper who did not stir  you are a mad kid she said tremulously  then with a change of tone  no one could carry me off  not even you  i am not the sort of girl that gets carried off  his white form seemed to shrink a little before the force of that assertion and she relented  isnt it enough for you to know that you havethat you have carried me away she added in a tender tone  he murmured an endearing word and she continued  ive promised youive said i would comeand i shall come of my own free will  you shall wait for me on board  i shall get up the sideby myself and walk up to you on the deck and say  here i am kid  and thenand then i shall be carried off  but it will be no man who will carry me offit will be the brig your brig our brig    i love the beauty  she heard an inarticulate sound something like a moan wrung out by pain or delight and glided away  there was that other man on the other verandah that dark surly dutchman who could make trouble between jasper and her father bring about a quarrel ugly words and perhaps a physical collision  what a horrible situation  but even putting aside that awful extremity she shrank from having to live for some three months with a wretched tormented angry distracted absurd man  and when the day came the day and the hour what should she do if her father tried to detain her by main forceas was after all possible  could she actually struggle with him hand to hand  but it was of lamentations and entreaties that she was really afraid  could she withstand them  what an odious cruel ridiculous position would that be  but it wont be  hell say nothing she thought as she came out quickly on the west verandah and seeing that heemskirk did not move sat down on a chair near the doorway and kept her eyes on him  the outraged lieutenant had not changed his attitude only his cap had fallen off his stomach and was lying on the floor  his thick black eyebrows were knitted by a frown while he looked at her out of the corners of his eyes  and their sideways glance in conjunction with the hooked nose the whole bulky ungainly sprawling person struck freya as so comically moody that inwardly discomposed as she was she could not help smiling  she did her best to give that smile a conciliatory character  she did not want to provoke heemskirk needlessly  and the lieutenant perceiving that smile was mollified  it never entered his head that his outward appearance a naval officer in uniform could appear ridiculous to that girl of no positionthe daughter of old nielsen  the recollection of her arms round jaspers neck still irritated and excited him  the hussy he thought  smilingeh  thats how you are amusing yourself fooling your father finely arent you  you have a taste for that sort of funhave you  well we shall see  he did not alter his position but on his pursedup lips there also appeared a smile of surly and illomened amusement while his eyes returned to the contemplation of his boots  freya felt hot with indignation  she sat radiantly fair in the lamplight her strong wellshaped hands lying one on top of the other in her lap   odious creature she thought  her face coloured with sudden anger  you have scared my maid out of her senses she said aloud  what possessed you  he was thinking so deeply of her that the sound of her voice pronouncing these unexpected words startled him extremely  he jerked up his head and looked so bewildered that freya insisted impatiently  i mean antonia  you have bruised her arm  what did you do it for  do you want to quarrel with me he asked thickly with a sort of amazement  he blinked like an owl  he was funny  freya like all women had a keen sense of the ridiculous in outward appearance  well no i dont think i do  she could not help herself  she laughed outright a clear nervous laugh in which heemskirk joined suddenly with a harsh ha ha ha  voices and footsteps were heard in the passage and jasper with old nelson came out  old nelson looked at his daughter approvingly for he liked the lieutenant to be kept in good humour and he also joined sympathetically in the laugh  now lieutenant we shall have some dinner he said rubbing his hands cheerily jasper had gone straight to the balustrade  the sky was full of stars and in the blue velvety night the cove below had a denser blackness in which the ridinglights of the brig and of the gunboat glimmered redly like suspended sparks  next time this ridinglight glimmers down there ill be waiting for her on the quarterdeck to come and say here i am jasper thought and his heart seemed to grow bigger in his chest dilated by an oppressive happiness that nearly wrung out a cry from him  there was no wind not a leaf below him stirred and even the sea was but a still uncomplaining shadow  far away on the unclouded sky the pale lightning the heatlightning of the tropics played tremulously amongst the low stars in short faint mysteriously consecutive flashes like incomprehensible signals from some distant planet  the dinner passed off quietly  freya sat facing her father calm but pale  heemskirk affected to talk only to old nelson  jaspers behaviour was exemplary  he kept his eyes under control basking in the sense of freyas nearness as people bask in the sun without looking up to heaven  and very soon after dinner was over mindful of his instructions he declared that it was time for him to go on board his ship  heemskirk did not look up  ensconced in the rockingchair and puffing at a cheroot he had the air of meditating surlily over some odious outbreak  so at least it seemed to freya  old nelson said at once  ill stroll down with you  he had begun a professional conversation about the dangers of the new guinea coast and wanted to relate to jasper some experience of his own over there  jasper was such a good listener  freya made as if to accompany them but her father frowned shook his head and nodded significantly towards the immovable heemskirk blotting out smoke with halfclosed eyes and protruded lips  the lieutenant must not be left alone  take offence perhaps  freya obeyed these signs  perhaps it is better for me to stay she thought  women are not generally prone to review their own conduct still less to condemn it  the embarrassing masculine absurdities are in the main responsible for its ethics  but looking at heemskirk freya felt regret and even remorse  his thick bulk in repose suggested the idea of repletion but as a matter of fact he had eaten very little  he had drunk a great deal however  the fleshy lobes of his unpleasant big ears with deeply folded rims were crimson  they quite flamed in the neighbourhood of the flat sallow cheeks  for a considerable time he did not raise his heavy brown eyelids  to be at the mercy of such a creature was humiliating and freya who always ended by being frank with herself thought regretfully  if only i had been open with papa from the first  but then what an impossible life he would have led me  yes  men were absurd in many ways lovably like jasper impracticably like her father odiously like that grotesquely supine creature in the chair  was it possible to talk him over  perhaps it was not necessary  oh  i cant talk to him she thought  and when heemskirk still without looking at her began resolutely to crush his halfsmoked cheroot on the coffeetray she took alarm glided towards the piano opened it in tremendous haste and struck the keys before she sat down  in an instant the verandah the whole carpetless wooden bungalow raised on piles became filled with an uproarious confused resonance  but through it all she heard she felt on the floor the heavy prowling footsteps of the lieutenant moving to and fro at her back  he was not exactly drunk but he was sufficiently primed to make the suggestions of his excited imagination seem perfectly feasible and even clever beautifully unscrupulously clever freya aware that he had stopped just behind her went on playing without turning her head  she played with spirit brilliantly a fierce piece of music but when his voice reached her she went cold all over  it was the voice not the words  the insolent familiarity of tone dismayed her to such an extent that she could not understand at first what he was saying  his utterance was thick too  i suspected    of course i suspected something of your little goings on  i am not a child  but from suspecting to seeing seeing you understandtheres an enormous difference  that sort of thing    come  one isnt made of stone  and when a man has been worried by a girl as i have been worried by you miss freya sleeping and waking then of course    but i am a man of the world  it must be dull for you here    i say wont you leave off this confounded playing     this last was the only sentence really which she made out  she shook her head negatively and in desperation put on the loud pedal but she could not make the sound of the piano cover his raised voice  only i am surprised that you should    an english trading skipper a common fellow  low cheeky lot infesting these islands  i would make short work of such trash  while you have here a good friend a gentleman ready to worship at your feetyour pretty feetan officer a man of family  strange isnt it  but what of that  you are fit for a prince  freya did not turn her head  her face went stiff with horror and indignation  this adventure was altogether beyond her conception of what was possible  it was not in her character to jump up and run away  it seemed to her too that if she did move there was no saying what might happen  presently her father would be back and then the other would have to leave off  it was best to ignoreto ignore  she went on playing loudly and correctly as though she were alone as if heemskirk did not exist  that proceeding irritated him  come  you may deceive your father he bawled angrily but i am not to be made a fool of  stop this infernal noise    freya    hey  you scandinavian goddess of love  stop  do you hear thats what you areof love  but the heathen gods are only devils in disguise and thats what you are tooa deep little devil stop it i say or i will lift you off that stool  standing behind her he devoured her with his eyes from the golden crown of her rigidly motionless head to the heels of her shoes the line of her shapely shoulders the curves of her fine figure swaying a little before the keyboard  she had on a light dress the sleeves stopped short at the elbows in an edging of lace  a satin ribbon encircled her waist  in an access of irresistible reckless hopefulness he clapped both his hands on that waistand then the irritating music stopped at last  but quick as she was in springing away from the contact the round musicstool going over with a crash heemskirks lips aiming at her neck landed a hungry smacking kiss just under her ear  a deep silence reigned for a time  and then he laughed rather feebly  he was disconcerted somewhat by her white still face the big light violet eyes resting on him stonily  she had not uttered a sound  she faced him steadying herself on the corner of the piano with one extended hand  the other went on rubbing with mechanical persistency the place his lips had touched  whats the trouble he said offended  startled you  look here  dont let us have any of that nonsense  you dont mean to say a kiss frightens you so much as all that    i know better    i dont mean to be left out in the cold  he had been gazing into her face with such strained intentness that he could no longer see it distinctly  everything round him was rather misty  he forgot the overturned stool caught his foot against it and lurched forward slightly saying in an ingratiating tone  im not bad fun really  you try a few kisses to begin with  he said no more because his head received a terrific concussion accompanied by an explosive sound  freya had swung her round strong arm with such force that the impact of her open palm on his flat cheek turned him half round  uttering a faint hoarse yell the lieutenant clapped both his hands to the left side of his face which had taken on suddenly a dusky brickred tinge  freya very erect her violet eyes darkened her palm still tingling from the blow a sort of restrained determined smile showing a tiny gleam of her white teeth heard her fathers rapid heavy tread on the path below the verandah  her expression lost its pugnacity and became sincerely concerned  she was sorry for her father  she stooped quickly to pick up the musicstool as if anxious to obliterate the traces    but that was no good  she had resumed her attitude one hand resting lightly on the piano before old nelson got up to the top of the stairs  poor father  how furious he will behow upset  and afterwards what tremors what unhappiness  why had she not been open with him from the first  his round innocent stare of amazement cut her to the quick  but he was not looking at her  his stare was directed to heemskirk who with his back to him and with his hands still up to his face was hissing curses through his teeth and she saw him in profile glaring at her balefully with one black evil eye  whats the matter asked old nelson very much bewildered  she did not answer him  she thought of jasper on the deck of the brig gazing up at the lighted bungalow and she felt frightened it was a mercy that one of them at least was on board out of the way  she only wished he were a hundred miles off  and yet she was not certain that she did  had jasper been mysteriously moved that moment to reappear on the verandah she would have thrown her consistency her firmness her selfpossession to the winds and flown into his arms  what is it  what is it insisted the unsuspecting nelson getting quite excited  only this minute you were playing a tune and  freya unable to speak in her apprehension of what was coming she was also fascinated by that black evil glaring eye only nodded slightly at the lieutenant as much as to say  just look at him  why yes exclaimed old nelson  i see  what on earth  meantime he had cautiously approached heemskirk who bursting into incoherent imprecations was stamping with both feet where he stood  the indignity of the blow the rage of baffled purpose the ridicule of the exposure and the impossibility of revenge maddened him to a point when he simply felt he must howl with fury  oh oh oh he howled stamping across the verandah as though he meant to drive his foot through the floor at every step  why is his face hurt asked the astounded old nelson  the truth dawned suddenly upon his innocent mind  dear me he cried enlightened  get some brandy quick freya    you are subject to it lieutenant  fiendish eh  i know i know  used to go crazy all of a sudden myself in the time    and the little bottle of laudanum from the medicinechest too freya  look sharp    dont you see hes got a toothache  and indeed what other explanation could have presented itself to the guileless old nelson beholding this cheek nursed with both hands these wild glances these stampings this distracted swaying of the body  it would have demanded a preternatural acuteness to hit upon the true cause  freya had not moved  she watched heemskirks savagely inquiring black stare directed stealthily upon herself  aha you would like to be let off she said to herself  she looked at him unflinchingly thinking it out  the temptation of making an end of it all without further trouble was irresistible  she gave an almost imperceptible nod of assent and glided away  hurry up that brandy old nelson shouted as she disappeared in the passage  heemskirk relieved his deeper feelings by a sudden string of curses in dutch and english which he sent after her  he raved to his hearts content flinging to and fro the verandah and kicking chairs out of his way while nelson or nielsen whose sympathy was profoundly stirred by these evidences of agonising pain hovered round his dear and dreaded lieutenant fussing like an old hen  dear me dear me  is it so bad  i know well what it is  i used to frighten my poor wife sometimes  do you get it often like this lieutenant  heemskirk shouldered him viciously out of his way with a short insane laugh  but his staggering host took it in good part a man beside himself with excruciating toothache is not responsible  go into my room lieutenant he suggested urgently  throw yourself on my bed  we will get something to ease you in a minute  he seized the poor sufferer by the arm and forced him gently onwards to the very bed on which heemskirk in a renewed access of rage flung himself down with such force that he rebounded from the mattress to the height of quite a foot  dear me exclaimed the scared nelson and incontinently ran off to hurry up the brandy and the laudanum very angry that so little alacrity was shown in relieving the tortures of his precious guest in the end he got these things himself  half an hour later he stood in the inner passage of the house surprised by faint spasmodic sounds of a mysterious nature between laughter and sobs  he frowned then went straight towards his daughters room and knocked at the door  freya her glorious fair hair framing her white face and rippling down a darkblue dressinggown opened it partly  the light in the room was dim  antonia crouching in a corner rocked herself backwards and forwards uttering feeble moans  old nelson had not much experience in various kinds of feminine laughter but he was certain there had been laughter there  very unfeeling very unfeeling he said with weighty displeasure  what is there so amusing in a man being in pain  i should have thought a womana young girl  he was so funny murmured freya whose eyes glistened strangely in the semiobscurity of the passage  and then you know i dont like him she added in an unsteady voice  funny repeated old nelson amazed at this evidence of callousness in one so young  you dont like him  do you mean to say that because you dont like him youwhy its simply cruel dont you know its about the worst sort of pain there is  dogs have been known to go mad with it  he certainly seemed to have gone mad freya said with an effort as if she were struggling with some hidden feeling  but her father was launched  and you know how he is  he notices everything  he is a fellow to take offence for the least little thingregular dutchmanand i want to keep friendly with him  its like this my girl  if that rajah of ours were to do something sillyand you know he is a sulky rebellious beggarand the authorities took into their heads that my influence over him wasnt good you would find yourself without a roof over your head  she cried  what nonsense father in a not very assured tone and discovered that he was angry angry enough to achieve irony yes old nelson or nielsen irony  just a gleam of it  oh of course if you have means of your owna mansion a plantation that i know nothing of  but he was not capable of sustained irony  i tell you they would bundle me out of here he whispered forcibly without compensation of course  i know these dutch  and the lieutenants just the fellow to start the trouble going  he has the ear of influential officials  i wouldnt offend him for anythingfor anythingon no consideration whatever    what did you say  it was only an inarticulate exclamation  if she ever had a half formed intention of telling him everything she had given it up now it was impossible both out of regard for his dignity and for the peace of his poor mind  i dont care for him myself very much old nelsons subdued undertone confessed in a sigh  hes easier now he went on after a silence  ive given him up my bed for the night  i shall sleep on my verandah in the hammock  no i cant say i like him either but from that to laugh at a man because hes driven crazy with pain is a long way  youve surprised me freya  that side of his face is quite flushed  her shoulders shook convulsively under his hands which he laid on her paternally  his straggly wiry moustache brushed her forehead in a goodnight kiss  she closed the door and went away from it to the middle of the room before she allowed herself a tiredout sort of laugh without buoyancy  flushed  a little flushed she repeated to herself  i hope so indeed  a little  her eyelashes were wet  antonia in her corner moaned and giggled and it was impossible to tell where the moans ended and the giggles began  the mistress and the maid had been somewhat hysterical for freya on fleeing into her room had found antonia there and had told her everything  i have avenged you my girl she exclaimed  and then they had laughingly cried and cryingly laughed with admonitionsssh not so loud  be quiet on one part and interludes of i am so frightened    hes an evil man on the other  antonia was very much afraid of heemskirk  she was afraid of him because of his personal appearance  because of his eyes and his eyebrows and his mouth and his nose and his limbs  nothing could be more rational  and she thought him an evil man because to her eyes he looked evil  no ground for an opinion could be sounder in the dimness of the room with only a nightlight burning at the head of freyas bed the camerista crept out of her corner to crouch at the feet of her mistress supplicating in whispers  theres the brig  captain allen  let us run away at onceoh let us run away  i am so frightened  let us  let us  i  run away thought freya to herself without looking down at the scared girl  never  both the resolute mistress under the mosquitonet and the frightened maid lying curled up on a mat at the foot of the bed did not sleep very well that night  the person that did not sleep at all was lieutenant heemskirk  he lay on his back staring vindictively in the darkness  inflaming images and humiliating reflections succeeded each other in his mind keeping up augmenting his anger  a pretty tale this to get about  but it must not be allowed to get about  the outrage had to be swallowed in silence  a pretty affair  fooled led on and struck by the girland probably fooled by the father too  but no  nielsen was but another victim of that shameless hussy that brazen minx that sly laughing kissing lying     no he did not deceive me on purpose thought the tormented lieutenant  but i should like to pay him off all the same for being such an imbecile  well some day perhaps  one thing he was firmly resolved on  he had made up his mind to steal early out of the house  he did not think he could face the girl without going out of his mind with fury  fire and perdition  ten thousand devils  i shall choke here before the morning he muttered to himself lying rigid on his back on old nelsons bed his breast heaving for air  he arose at daylight and started cautiously to open the door faint sounds in the passage alarmed him and remaining concealed he saw freya coming out  this unexpected sight deprived him of all power to move away from the crack of the door  it was the narrowest crack possible but commanding the view of the end of the verandah  freya made for that end hastily to watch the brig passing the point  she wore her dark dressinggown her feet were bare because having fallen asleep towards the morning she ran out headlong in her fear of being too late  heemskirk had never seen her looking like this with her hair drawn back smoothly to the shape of her head and hanging in one heavy fair tress down her back and with that air of extreme youth intensity and eagerness  and at first he was amazed and then he gnashed his teeth  he could not face her at all  he muttered a curse and kept still behind the door  with a low deepbreathed ah when she first saw the brig already under way she reached for nelsons long glass reposing on brackets high up the wall  the wide sleeve of the dressinggown slipped back uncovering her white arm as far as the shoulder  heemskirk gripping the doorhandle as if to crush it felt like a man just risen to his feet from a drinking bout  and freya knew that he was watching her  she knew  she had seen the door move as she came out of the passage  she was aware of his eyes being on her with scornful bitterness with triumphant contempt  you are there she thought levelling the long glass  oh well look on then  the green islets appeared like black shadows the ashen sea was smooth as glass the clear robe of the colourless dawn in which even the brig appeared shadowy had a hem of light in the east directly freya had made out jasper on deck with his own long glass directed to the bungalow she laid hers down and raised both her beautiful white arms above her head  in that attitude of supreme cry she stood still glowing with the consciousness of jaspers adoration going out to her figure held in the field of his glass away there and warmed too by the feeling of evil passion the burning covetous eyes of the other fastened on her back  in the fervour of her love in the caprice of her mind and with that mysterious knowledge of masculine nature women seem to be born to she thought  you are looking onyou willyou must  then you shall see something  she brought both her hands to her lips then flung them out sending a kiss over the sea as if she wanted to throw her heart along with it on the deck of the brig  her face was rosy her eyes shone  her repeated passionate gesture seemed to fling kisses by the hundred again and again and again while the slowly ascending sun brought the glory of colour to the world turning the islets green the sea blue the brig below her whitedazzlingly white in the spread of her wingswith the red ensign streaming like a tiny flame from the peak  and each time she murmured with a rising inflexion  take thisand thisand this till suddenly her arms fell  she had seen the ensign dipped in response and next moment the point below hid the hull of the brig from her view  then she turned away from the balustrade and passing slowly before the door of her fathers room with her eyelids lowered and an enigmatic expression on her face she disappeared behind the curtain  but instead of going along the passage she remained concealed and very still on the other side to watch what would happen  for some time the broad furnished verandah remained empty  then the door of old nelsons room came open suddenly and heemskirk staggered out  his hair was rumpled his eyes bloodshot his unshaven face looked very dark  he gazed wildly about saw his cap on a table snatched it up and made for the stairs quietly but with a strange tottering gait like the last effort of waning strength  shortly after his head had sunk below the level of the floor freya came out from behind the curtain with compressed scheming lips and no softness at all in her luminous eyes  he could not be allowed to sneak off scot free  nevernever  she was excited she tingled all over she had tasted blood  he must be made to understand that she had been aware of having been watched he must know that he had been seen slinking off shamefully  but to run to the front rail and shout after him would have been childish crude undignified  and to shoutwhat  what word  what phrase  no it was impossible  then how    she frowned discovered it dashed at the piano which had stood open all night and made the rosewood monster growl savagery in an irritated bass  she struck chords as if firing shots after that straddling broad figure in ample white trousers and a dark uniform jacket with gold shoulder straps and then she pursued him with the same thing she had played the evening beforea modern fierce piece of love music which had been tried more than once against the thunderstorms of the group she accentuated its rhythm with triumphant malice so absorbed in her purpose that she did not notice the presence of her father who wearing an old threadbare ulster of a check pattern over his sleeping suit had run out from the back verandah to inquire the reason of this untimely performance  he stared at her  what on earth    freya  his voice was nearly drowned by the piano  whats become of the lieutenant he shouted  she looked up at him as if her soul were lost in her music with unseeing eyes  gone  whaat    where  she shook her head slightly and went on playing louder than before  old nelsons innocently anxious gaze starting from the open door of his room explored the whole place high and low as if the lieutenant were something small which might have been crawling on the floor or clinging to a wall  but a shrill whistle coming somewhere from below pierced the ample volume of sound rolling out of the piano in great vibrating waves  the lieutenant was down at the cove whistling for the boat to come and take him off to his ship  and he seemed to be in a terrific hurry too for he whistled again almost directly waited for a moment and then sent out a long interminable shrill call as distressful to hear as though he had shrieked without drawing breath  freya ceased playing suddenly  going on board said old nelson perturbed by the event  what could have made him clear out so early  queer chap  devilishly touchy too  i shouldnt wonder if it was your conduct last night that hurt his feelings  i noticed you freya  you as well as laughed in his face while he was suffering agonies from neuralgia it isnt the way to get yourself liked  hes offended with you  freyas hands now reposed passive on the keys she bowed her fair head feeling a sudden discontent a nervous lassitude as though she had passed through some exhausting crisis  old nelson or nielsen looking aggrieved was revolving matters of policy in his bald head  i think it would be right for me to go on board just to inquire some time this morning he declared fussily  why dont they bring me my morning tea  do you hear freya  you have astonished me i must say  i didnt think a young girl could be so unfeeling and the lieutenant thinks himself a friend of ours too  what no  well he calls himself a friend and thats something to a person in my position  certainly  oh yes i must go on board  must you murmured freya listlessly then added in her thought poor man    chapter v    in respect of the next seven weeks all that is necessary to say is first that old nelson or nielsen failed in paying his politic call  the neptun gunboat of hm the king of the netherlands commanded by an outraged and infuriated lieutenant left the cove at an unexpectedly early hour  when freyas father came down to the shore after seeing his precious crop of tobacco spread out properly in the sun she was already steaming round the point  old nelson regretted the circumstance for many days  now i dont know in what disposition the man went away he lamented to his hard daughter  he was amazed at her hardness  he was almost frightened by her indifference  next it must be recorded that the same day the gunboat neptun steering east passed the brig bonito becalmed in sight of carimata with her head to the eastward too  her captain jasper allen giving himself up consciously to a tender possessive reverie of his freya did not get out of his long chair on the poop to look at the neptun which passed so close that the smoke belching out suddenly from her short black funnel rolled between the masts of the bonito obscuring for a moment the sunlit whiteness of her sails consecrated to the service of love  jasper did not even turn his head for a glance  but heemskirk on the bridge had gazed long and earnestly at the brig from the distance gripping hard the brass rail in front of him till the two ships closing he lost all confidence in himself and retreating to the chartroom pulled the door to with a crash  there his brows knitted his mouth drawn on one side in sardonic meditation he sat through many still hoursa sort of prometheus in the bonds of unholy desire having his very vitals torn by the beak and claws of humiliated passion  that species of fowl is not to be shooed off as easily as a chicken  fooled cheated deceived led on outraged mocked at beak and claws  a sinister bird  the lieutenant had no mind to become the talk of the archipelago as the naval officer who had had his face slapped by a girl  was it possible that she really loved that rascally trader  he tried not to think but worse than thoughts definite impressions beset him in his retreat  he saw hera vision plain close to detailed plastic coloured lighted uphe saw her hanging round the neck of that fellow  and he shut his eyes only to discover that this was no remedy  then a piano began to play near by very plainly and he put his fingers to his ears with no better effect  it was not to be bornenot in solitude  he bolted out of the chartroom and talked of indifferent things somewhat wildly with the officer of the watch on the bridge to the mocking accompaniment of a ghostly piano  the last thing to be recorded is that lieutenant heemskirk instead of pursuing his course towards ternate where he was expected went out of his way to call at makassar where no one was looking for his arrival  once there he gave certain explanations and laid a certain proposal before the governor or some other authority and obtained permission to do what he thought fit in these matters thereupon the neptun giving up ternate altogether steamed north in view of the mountainous coast of celebes and then crossing the broad straits took up her station on the low coast of virgin forests inviolate and mute in waters phosphorescent at night deep blue in daytime with gleaming green patches over the submerged reefs  for days the neptun could be seen moving smoothly up and down the sombre face of the shore or hanging about with a watchful air near the silvery breaks of broad estuaries under the great luminous sky never softened never veiled and flooding the earth with the everlasting sunshine of the tropicsthat sunshine which in its unbroken splendour oppresses the soul with an inexpressible melancholy more intimate more penetrating more profound than the grey sadness of the northern mists   the trading brig bonito appeared gliding round a sombre forestclad point of land on the silvery estuary of a great river  the breath of air that gave her motion would not have fluttered the flame of a torch  she stole out into the open from behind a veil of unstirring leaves mysteriously silent ghostly white and solemnly stealthy in her imperceptible progress and jasper his elbow in the main rigging and his head leaning against his hand thought of freya  everything in the world reminded him of her  the beauty of the loved woman exists in the beauties of nature  the swelling outlines of the hills the curves of a coast the free sinuosities of a river are less suave than the harmonious lines of her body and when she moves gliding lightly the grace of her progress suggests the power of occult forces which rule the fascinating aspects of the visible world  dependent on things as all men are jasper loved his vesselthe house of his dreams  he lent to her something of freyas soul her deck was the foothold of their love  the possession of his brig appeased his passion in a soothing certitude of happiness already conquered  the full moon was some way up perfect and serene floating in air as calm and limpid as the glance of freyas eyes  there was not a sound in the brig  here she shall stand by my side on evenings like this he thought with rapture  and it was at that moment in this peace in this serenity under the full benign gaze of the moon propitious to lovers on a sea without a wrinkle under a sky without a cloud as if all nature had assumed its most clement mood in a spirit of mockery that the gunboat neptun detaching herself from the dark coast under which she had been lying invisible steamed out to intercept the trading brig bonito standing out to sea  directly the gunboat had been made out emerging from her ambush schultz of the fascinating voice had given signs of strange agitation  all that day ever since leaving the malay town up the river he had shown a haggard face going about his duties like a man with something weighing on his mind  jasper had noticed it but the mate turning away as though he had not liked being looked at had muttered shamefacedly of a headache and a touch of fever he must have had it very badly when dodging behind his captain he wondered aloud  what can that fellow want with us    a naked man standing in a freezing blast and trying not to shiver could not have spoken with a more harshly uncertain intonation  but it might have been fevera cold fit  he wants to make himself disagreeable simply said jasper with perfect good humour  he has tried it on me before  however we shall soon see  and indeed before long the two vessels lay abreast within easy hail  the brig with her fine lines and her white sails looked vaporous and sylphlike in the moonlight  the gunboat short squat with her stumpy dark spars naked like dead trees raised against the luminous sky of that resplendent night threw a heavy shadow on the lane of water between the two ships  freya haunted them both like an ubiquitous spirit and as if she were the only woman in the world  jasper remembered her earnest recommendation to be guarded and cautious in all his acts and words while he was away from her  in this quite unforeseen encounter he felt on his ear the very breath of these hurried admonitions customary to the last moment of their partings heard the half jesting final whisper of the mind kid id never forgive you with a quick pressure on his arm which he answered by a quiet confident smile  heemskirk was haunted in another fashion  there were no whispers in it it was more like visions  he saw that girl hanging round the neck of a low vagabondthat vagabond the vagabond who had just answered his hail  he saw her stealing bare footed across a verandah with great clear wideopen eager eyes to look at a brigthat brig  if she had shrieked scolded called names    but she had simply triumphed over him  that was all led on he firmly believed it fooled deceived outraged struck mocked at    beak and claws  the two men so differently haunted by freya of the seven isles were not equally matched  in the intense stillness as of sleep which had fallen upon the two vessels in a world that itself seemed but a delicate dream a boat pulled by javanese sailors crossing the dark lane of water came alongside the brig  the white warrant officer in her perhaps the gunner climbed aboard  he was a short man with a rotund stomach and a wheezy voice  his immovable fat face looked lifeless in the moonlight and he walked with his thick arms hanging away from his body as though he had been stuffed  his cunning little eyes glittered like bits of mica  he conveyed to jasper in broken english a request to come on board the neptun  jasper had not expected anything so unusual  but after a short reflection he decided to show neither annoyance nor even surprise the river from which he had come had been politically disturbed for a couple of years and he was aware that his visits there were looked upon with some suspicion  but he did not mind much the displeasure of the authorities so terrifying to old nelson  he prepared to leave the brig and schultz followed him to the rail as if to say something but in the end stood by in silence  jasper getting over the side noticed his ghastly face  the eyes of the man who had found salvation in the brig from the effects of his peculiar psychology looked at him with a dumb beseeching expression  whats the matter jasper asked  i wonder how this will end said he of the beautiful voice which had even fascinated the steady freya herself  but where was its charming timbre now  these words had sounded like a ravens croak  you are ill said jasper positively  i wish i were dead was the startling statement uttered by schultz talking to himself in the extremity of some mysterious trouble  jasper gave him a keen glance but this was not the time to investigate the morbid outbreak of a feverish man  he did not look as though he were actually delirious and that for the moment must suffice  schultz made a dart forward  that fellow means harm he said desperately  he means harm to you captain allen  i feel it and i  he choked with inexplicable emotion  all right schultz  i wont give him an opening  jasper cut him short and swung himself into the boat  on board the neptun heemskirk standing straddlelegs in the flood of moonlight his inky shadow falling right across the quarter deck made no sign at his approach but secretly he felt something like the heave of the sea in his chest at the sight of that man jasper waited before him in silence  brought face to face in direct personal contact they fell at once into the manner of their casual meetings in old nelsons bungalow they ignored each others existenceheemskirk moodily jasper with a perfectly colourless quietness  whats going on in that river youve just come out of asked the lieutenant straight away  i know nothing of the troubles if you mean that jasper answered  ive landed there half a cargo of rice for which i got nothing in exchange and went away  theres no trade there now but they would have been starving in another weekif i hadnt turned up  meddling  english meddling  and suppose the rascals dont deserve anything better than to starve eh  there are women and children there you know observed jasper in his even tone  oh yes  when an englishman talks of women and children you may be sure theres something fishy about the business  your doings will have to be investigated  they spoke in turn as though they had been disembodied spirits mere voices in empty air for they looked at each other as if there had been nothing there or at most with as much recognition as one gives to an inanimate object and no more  but now a silence fell  heemskirk had thought all at once  she will tell him all about it  she will tell him while she hangs round his neck laughing  and the sudden desire to annihilate jasper on the spot almost deprived him of his senses by its vehemence  he lost the power of speech of vision  for a moment he absolutely couldnt see jasper  but he heard him inquiring as of the world at large  am i then to conclude that the brig is detained  heemskirk made a recovery in a flush of malignant satisfaction  she is  i am going to take her to makassar in tow  the courts will have to decide on the legality of this said jasper aware that the matter was becoming serious but with assumed indifference  oh yes the courts  certainly  and as to you i shall keep you on board here  jaspers dismay at being parted from his ship was betrayed by a stony immobility  it lasted but an instant  then he turned away and hailed the brig  mr schultz answered  yes sir  get ready to receive a towrope from the gunboat  we are going to be taken to makassar  good god  whats that for sir came an anxious cry faintly  kindness i suppose jasper ironical shouted with great deliberation  we might have beenbecalmed in herefor days and hospitality  i am invited to stayon board here  the answer to this information was a loud ejaculation of distress jasper thought anxiously  why the fellows nerves gone to pieces and with an awkward uneasiness of a new sort looked intently at the brig  the thought that he was parted from herfor the first time since they came togethershook the apparently careless fortitude of his character to its very foundations which were deep  all that time neither heemskirk nor even his inky shadow had stirred in the least  i am going to send a boats crew and an officer on board your vessel he announced to no one in particular  jasper tearing himself away from the absorbed contemplation of the brig turned round and without passion almost without expression in his voice entered his protest against the whole of the proceedings what he was thinking of was the delay  he counted the days makassar was actually on his way and to be towed there really saved time  on the other hand there would be some vexing formalities to go through  but the thing was too absurd  the beetles gone mad he thought  ill be released at once  and if not mesman must enter into a bond for me  mesman was a dutch merchant with whom jasper had had many dealings a considerable person in makassar  you protest  hm heemskirk muttered and for a little longer remained motionless his legs planted well apart and his head lowered as though he were studying his own comical deeplysplit shadow  then he made a sign to the rotund gunner who had kept at hand motionless like a vilelystuffed specimen of a fat man with a lifeless face and glittering little eyes  the fellow approached and stood at attention  you will board the brig with a boats crew  ya mynherr  you will have one of your men to steer her all the time went on heemskirk giving his orders in english apparently for jaspers edification  you hear  ya mynherr  you will remain on deck and in charge all the time  ya mynherr  jasper felt as if together with the command of the brig his very heart were being taken out of his breast  heemskirk asked with a change of tone  what weapons have you on board  at one time all the ships trading in the china seas had a licence to carry a certain quantity of firearms for purposes of defence jasper answered  eighteen rifles with their bayonets which were on board when i bought her four years ago  they have been declared  where are they kept  forecabin  mate has the key  you will take possession of them said heemskirk to the gunner  ya mynherr  what is this for  what do you mean to imply cried out jasper then bit his lip  its monstrous he muttered  heemskirk raised for a moment a heavy as if suffering glance  you may go he said to his gunner  the fat man saluted and departed  during the next thirty hours the steady towing was interrupted once  at a signal from the brig made by waving a flag on the forecastle the gunboat was stopped  the badlystuffed specimen of a warrantofficer getting into his boat arrived on board the neptun and hurried straight into his commanders cabin his excitement at something he had to communicate being betrayed by the blinking of his small eyes  these two were closeted together for some time while jasper at the taffrail tried to make out if anything out of the common had occurred on board the brig  but nothing seemed to be amiss on board  however he kept a look out for the gunner and though he had avoided speaking to anybody since he had finished with heemskirk he stopped that man when he came out on deck again to ask how his mate was  he was feeling not very well when i left he explained  the fat warrantofficer holding himself as though the effort of carrying his big stomach in front of him demanded a rigid carriage understood with difficulty  not a single one of his features showed the slightest animation but his little eyes blinked rapidly at last  oh ya  the mate  ya ya  he is very well  but mein gott he is one very funny man  jasper could get no explanation of that remark because the dutchman got into the boat hurriedly and went back on board the brig  but he consoled himself with the thought that very soon all this unpleasant and rather absurd experience would be over  the roadstead of makassar was in sight already  heemskirk passed by him going on the bridge  for the first time the lieutenant looked at jasper with marked intention and the strange roll of his eyes was so funnyit had been long agreed by jasper and freya that the lieutenant was funnyso ecstatically gratified as though he were rolling a tasty morsel on his tongue that jasper could not help a broad smile  and then he turned to his brig again  to see her his cherished possession animated by something of his freyas soul the only foothold of two lives on the wide earth the security of his passion the companion of adventure the power to snatch the calm adorable freya to his breast and carry her off to the end of the world to see this beautiful thing embodying worthily his pride and his love to see her captive at the end of a towrope was not indeed a pleasant experience  it had something nightmarish in it as for instance the dream of a wild seabird loaded with chains  yet what else could he want to look at  her beauty would sometimes come to his heart with the force of a spell so that he would forget where he was  and besides that sense of superiority which the certitude of being loved gives to a young man that illusion of being set above the fates by a tender look in a womans eyes helped him the first shock over to go through these experiences with an amused selfconfidence  for what evil could touch the elect of freya  it was now afternoon the sun being behind the two vessels as they headed for the harbour  the beetles little joke shall soon be over thought jasper without any great animosity  as a seaman well acquainted with that part of the world a casual glance was enough to tell him what was being done  hallo he thought he is going through spermonde passage  we shall be rounding tamissa reef presently  and again he returned to the contemplation of his brig that mainstay of his material and emotional existence which would be soon in his hands again  on a sea calm like a millpond a heavy smooth ripple undulated and streamed away from her bows for the powerful neptun was towing at great speed as if for a wager  the dutch gunner appeared on the forecastle of the bonito and with him a couple of men  they stood looking at the coast and jasper lost himself in a loverlike trance  the deeptoned blast of the gunboats steamwhistle made him shudder by its unexpectedness  slowly he looked about  swift as lightning he leaped from where he stood bounding forward along the deck  you will be on tamissa reef he yelled  high up on the bridge heemskirk looked back over his shoulder heavily two seamen were spinning the wheel round and the neptun was already swinging rapidly away from the edge of the pale water over the danger  ha just in time  jasper turned about instantly to watch his brig and even before he realised thatin obedience it appears to heemskirks orders given beforehand to the gunner the towrope had been let go at the blast of the whistle before he had time to cry out or to move a limb he saw her cast adrift and shooting across the gunboats stern with the impetus of her speed he followed her fine gliding form with eyes growing big with incredulity wild with horror  the cries on board of her came to him only as a dreadful and confused murmur through the loud thumping of blood in his ears while she held on  she ran upright in a terrible display of her gift of speed with an incomparable air of life and grace  she ran on till the smooth level of water in front of her bows seemed to sink down suddenly as if sucked away and with a strange violent tremor of her mastheads she stopped inclined her lofty spars a little and lay still  she lay still on the reef while the neptun fetching a wide circle continued at full speed up spermonde passage heading for the town she lay still perfectly still with something illomened and unnatural in her attitude  in an instant the subtle melancholy of things touched by decay had fallen on her in the sunshine she was but a speck in the brilliant emptiness of space already lonely already desolate  hold him yelled a voice from the bridge  jasper had started to run to his brig with a headlong impulse as a man dashes forward to pull away with his hands a living breathing loved creature from the brink of destruction  hold him  stick to him vociferated the lieutenant at the top of the bridgeladder while jasper struggled madly without a word only his head emerging from the heaving crowd of the neptuns seamen who had flung themselves upon him obediently  holdi would not have that fellow drown himself for anything now  jasper ceased struggling  one by one they let go of him they fell back gradually farther and farther in attentive silence leaving him standing unsupported in a widened clear space as if to give him plenty of room to fall after the struggle  he did not even sway perceptibly  half an hour later when the neptun anchored in front of the town he had not stirred yet had moved neither head nor limb as much as a hairs breadth  directly the rumble of the gunboats cable had ceased heemskirk came down heavily from the bridge  call a sampan he said in a gloomy tone as he passed the sentry at the gangway and then moved on slowly towards the spot where jasper the object of many awed glances stood looking at the deck as if lost in a brown study  heemskirk came up close and stared at him thoughtfully with his fingers over his lips  here he was the favoured vagabond the only man to whom that infernal girl was likely to tell the story  but he would not find it funny  the story how lieutenant heemskirkno he would not laugh at it  he looked as though he would never laugh at anything in his life  suddenly jasper looked up  his eyes without any other expression but bewilderment met those of heemskirk observant and sombre  gone on the reef he said in a low astounded tone  onthe reef he repeated still lower and as if attending inwardly to the birth of some awful and amazing sensation  on the very top of highwater spring tides heemskirk struck in with a vindictive exulting violence which flashed and expired  he paused as if weary fixing upon jasper his arrogant eyes over which secret disenchantment the unavoidable shadow of all passion seemed to pass like a saddening cloud  on the very top he repeated rousing himself in fierce reaction to snatch his laced cap off his head with a horizontal derisive flourish towards the gangway  and now you may go ashore to the courts you damned englishman he said    chapter vi    the affair of the brig bonito was bound to cause a sensation in makassar the prettiest and perhaps the cleanestlooking of all the towns in the islands which however knows few occasions for excitement  the front with its special population was soon aware that something had happened  a steamer towing a sailing vessel had been observed far out to sea for some time and when the steamer came in alone leaving the other outside attention was aroused  why was that  her masts only could be seenwith furled sailsremaining in the same place to the southward  and soon the rumour ran all along the crowded seashore street that there was a ship on tamissa reef  that crowd interpreted the appearance correctly  its cause was beyond their penetration for who could associate a girl nine hundred miles away with the stranding of a ship on tamissa reef or look for the remote filiation of that event in the psychology of at least three people even if one of them lieutenant heemskirk was at that very moment passing amongst them on his way to make his verbal report  no the minds on the front were not competent for that sort of investigation but many hands therebrown hands yellow hands white handswere raised to shade the eyes gazing out to sea  the rumour spread quickly  chinese shopkeepers came to their doors more than one white merchant even rose from his desk to go to the window  after all a ship on tamissa was not an everyday occurrence  and presently the rumour took a more definite shape an english traderdetained on suspicion at sea by the neptun heemskirk was towing him in to test a case and by some strange accident  later on the name came out  the bonitowhat  impossible  yes yes the bonito  look  you can see from here only two masts its a brig  didnt think that man would ever let himself be caught  heemskirks pretty smart too  they say shes fitted out in her cabin like a gentlemans yacht  that allen is a sort of gentleman too  an extravagant beggar  a young man entered smartly messrs mesman brothers office on the front bubbling with some further information  oh yes thats the bonito for certain  but you dont know the story ive heard just now  the fellow must have been feeding that river with firearms for the last year or two  well it seems he has grown so reckless from long impunity that he has actually dared to sell the very ships rifles this time  its a fact  the rifles are not on board  what impudence  only he didnt know that there was one of our warships on the coast  but those englishmen are so impudent that perhaps he thought that nothing would be done to him for it  our courts do let off these fellows too often on some miserable excuse or other  but at any rate theres an end of the famous bonito  i have just heard in the harbouroffice that she must have gone on at the very top of highwater and she is in ballast too  no human power they think can move her from where she is  i only hope it is so  it would be fine to have the notorious bonito stuck up there as a warning to others  mr j mesman a colonialborn dutchman a kind paternal old fellow with a cleanshaven quiet handsome fade and a head of fine irongrey hair curling a little on his collar did not say a word in defence of jasper and the bonito  he rose from his arm chair suddenly  his face was visibly troubled  it had so happened that once from a business talk of ways and means island trade money matters and so on jasper had been led to open himself to him on the subject of freya and the excellent man who had known old nelson years before and even remembered something of freya was much astonished and amused by the unfolding of the tale  well well well  nelson  yes of course  a very honest sort of man  and a little child with very fair hair  oh yes  i have a distinct recollection  and so she has grown into such a fine girl so very determined so very  and he laughed almost boisterously mind when you have happily eloped with your future wife captain allen you must come along this way and we shall welcome her here a little fairheaded child  i remember  i remember  it was that knowledge which had brought trouble to his face at the first news of the wreck  he took up his hat  where are you going mr mesman  i am going to look for allen  i think he must be ashore  does anybody know  no one of those present knew  and mr mesman went out on the front to make inquiries  the other part of the town the part near the church and the fort got its information in another way  the first thing disclosed to it was jasper himself walking rapidly as though he were pursued and as a matter of fact a chinaman obviously a sampan man was following him at the same headlong pace  suddenly while passing orange house jasper swerved and went in or rather rushed in startling gomez the hotel clerk very much  but a chinaman beginning to make an unseemly noise at the door claimed the immediate attention of gomez  his grievance was that the white man whom he had brought on shore from the gunboat had not paid him his boatfare  he had pursued him so far asking for it all the way but the white man had taken no notice whatever of his just claim gomez satisfied the coolie with a few coppers and then went to look for jasper whom he knew very well  he found him standing stiffly by a little round table  at the other end of the verandah a few men sitting there had stopped talking and were looking at him in silence  two billiardplayers with cues in their hands had come to the door of the billiardroom and stared too  on gomez coming up to him jasper raised one hand to point at his own throat  gomez noted the somewhat soiled state of his white clothes then took one look at his face and fled away to order the drink for which jasper seemed to be asking  where he wanted to goor what purposewhere he perhaps only imagined himself to be going when a sudden impulse or the sight of a familiar place had made him turn into orange houseit is impossible to say  he was steadying himself lightly with the tips of his fingers on the little table  there were on that verandah two men whom he knew well personally but his gaze roaming incessantly as though he were looking for a way of escape passed and repassed over them without a sign of recognition  they on their side looking at him doubted the evidence of their own eyes it was not that his face was distorted  on the contrary it was still it was set  but its expression somehow was unrecognisable  can that be him they wondered with awe  in his head there was a wild chaos of clear thoughts  perfectly clear  it was this clearness which was so terrible in conjunction with the utter inability to lay hold of any single one of them all he was saying to himself or to them  steady steady  a china boy appeared before him with a glass on a tray  he poured the drink down his throat and rushed out  his disappearance removed the spell of wonder from the beholders  one of the men jumped up and moved quickly to that side of the verandah from which almost the whole of the roadstead could be seen  at the very moment when jasper issuing from the door of the orange house was passing under him in the street below he cried to the others excitedly  that was allen right enough  but where is his brig  jasper heard these words with extraordinary loudness  the heavens rang with them as if calling him to account for those were the very words freya would have to use  it was an annihilating question it struck his consciousness like a thunderbolt and brought a sudden night upon the chaos of his thoughts even as he walked  he did not check his pace  he went on in the darkness for another three strides and then fell  the good mesman had to push on as far as the hospital before he found him  the doctor there talked of a slight heatstroke nothing very much  out in three days    it must be admitted that the doctor was right  in three days jasper allen came out of the hospital and became visible to the townvery visible indeed and remained so for quite a long time long enough to become almost one of the sights of the place long enough to become disregarded at last long enough for the tale of his haunting visibility to be remembered in the islands to this day  the talk on the front and jaspers appearance in the orange house stand at the beginning of the famous bonito case and give a view of its two aspectsthe practical and the psychological  the case for the courts and the case for compassion that last terribly evident and yet obscure  it has you must understand remained obscure even for that friend of mine who wrote me the letter mentioned in the very first lines of this narrative  he was one of those in mr mesmans office and accompanied that gentleman in his search for jasper  his letter described to me the two aspects and some of the episodes of the case  heemskirks attitude was that of deep thankfulness for not having lost his own ship and that was all  haze over the land was his explanation of having got so close to tamissa reef  he saved his ship and for the rest he did not care  as to the fat gunner he deposed simply that he thought at the time that he was acting for the best by letting go the towrope but admitted that he was greatly confused by the suddenness of the emergency  as a matter of fact he had acted on very precise instructions from heemskirk to whom through several years service together in the east he had become a sort of devoted henchman  what was most amazing in the detention of the bonito was his story how proceeding to take possession of the firearms as ordered he discovered that there were no firearms on board  all he found in the forecabin was an empty rack for the proper number of eighteen rifles but of the rifles themselves never a single one anywhere in the ship  the mate of the brig who looked rather ill and behaved excitedly as though he were perhaps a lunatic wanted him to believe that captain allen knew nothing of this that it was he the mate who had recently sold these rifles in the dead of night to a certain person up the river  in proof of this story he produced a bag of silver dollars and pressed it on his the gunners acceptance  then suddenly flinging it down on the deck he beat his own head with both his fists and started heaping shocking curses upon his own soul for an ungrateful wretch not fit to live  all this the gunner reported at once to his commanding officer  what heemskirk intended by taking upon himself to detain the bonito it is difficult to say except that he meant to bring some trouble into the life of the man favoured by freya  he had been looking at jasper with a desire to strike that man of kisses and embraces to the earth  the question was  how could he do it without giving himself away  but the report of the gunner created a serious case enough  yet allen had friendsand who could tell whether he wouldnt somehow succeed in wriggling out of it  the idea of simply towing the brig so much compromised on to the reef came to him while he was listening to the fat gunner in his cabin  there was but little risk of being disapproved now  and it should be made to appear an accident  going out on deck he had gloated upon his unconscious victim with such a sinister roll of his eyes such a queerly pursed mouth that jasper could not help smiling  and the lieutenant had gone on the bridge saying to himself  you wait  i shall spoil the taste of those sweet kisses for you when you hear of lieutenant heemskirk in the future that name wont bring a smile on your lips i swear  you are delivered into my hands  and this possibility had come about without any planning one could almost say naturally as if events had mysteriously shaped themselves to fit the purposes of a dark passion  the most astute scheming could not have served heemskirk better  it was given to him to taste a transcendental an incredible perfection of vengeance to strike a deadly blow into that hated persons heart and to watch him afterwards walking about with the dagger in his breast  for that is what the state of jasper amounted to  he moved acted wearyeyed keenfaced lank and restless with brusque movements and fierce gestures he talked incessantly in a frenzied and fatigued voice but within himself he knew that nothing would ever give him back the brig just as nothing can heal a pierced heart his soul kept quiet in the stress of love by the unflinching freyas influence was like a still but overwound string  the shock had started it vibrating and the string had snapped  he had waited for two years in a perfectly intoxicated confidence for a day that now would never come to a man disarmed for life by the loss of the brig and it seemed to him made unfit for love to which he had no foothold to offer  day after day he would traverse the length of the town follow the coast and reaching the point of land opposite that part of the reef on which his brig lay stranded look steadily across the water at her beloved form once the home of an exulting hope and now in her inclined desolated immobility towering above the lonely sea horizon a symbol of despair  the crew had left her in due course in her own boats which directly they reached the town were sequestrated by the harbour authorities the vessel too was sequestrated pending proceedings but these same authorities did not take the trouble to set a guard on board for indeed what could move her from there  nothing unless a miracle nothing unless jaspers eyes fastened on her tensely for hours together as though he hoped by the mere power of vision to draw her to his breast  all this story read in my friends very chatty letter dismayed me not a little  but it was really appalling to read his relation of how schultz the mate went about everywhere affirming with desperate pertinacity that it was he alone who had sold the rifles i stole them he protested  of course no one would believe him my friend himself did not believe him though he of course admired this selfsacrifice  but a good many people thought it was going too far to make oneself out a thief for the sake of a friend only it was such an obvious lie too that it did not matter perhaps  i who in view of schultzs psychology knew how true that must be admit that i was appalled  so this was how a perfidious destiny took advantage of a generous impulse  and i felt as though i were an accomplice in this perfidy since i did to a certain extent encourage jasper  yet i had warned him as well  the man seemed to have gone crazy on this point wrote my friend he went to mesman with his story  he says that some rascally white man living amongst the natives up that river made him drunk with some gin one evening and then jeered at him for never having any money  then he protesting to us that he was an honest man and must be believed described himself as being a thief whenever he took a drop too much and told us that he went on board and passed the rifles one by one without the slightest compunction to a canoe which came alongside that night receiving ten dollars apiece for them  next day he was ill with shame and grief but had not the courage to confess his lapse to his benefactor  when the gunboat stopped the brig he felt ready to die with the apprehension of the consequences and would have died happily if he could have been able to bring the rifles back by the sacrifice of his life  he said nothing to jasper hoping that the brig would be released presently  when it turned out otherwise and his captain was detained on board the gunboat he was ready to commit suicide from despair only he thought it his duty to live in order to let the truth be known  i am an honest man  i am an honest man he repeated in a voice that brought tears to our eyes  you must believe me when i tell you that i am a thiefa vile low cunning sneaking thief as soon as ive had a glass or two  take me somewhere where i may tell the truth on oath  when we had at last convinced him that his story could be of no use to jasperfor what dutch court having once got hold of an english trader would accept such an explanation and indeed how when where could one hope to find proofs of such a talehe made as if to tear his hair in handfuls but calming down said goodbye then gentlemen and went out of the room so crushed that he seemed hardly able to put one foot before the other  that very night he committed suicide by cutting his throat in the house of a halfcaste with whom he had been lodging since he came ashore from the wreck  that throat i thought with a shudder which could produce the tender persuasive manly but fascinating voice which had aroused jaspers ready compassion and had secured freyas sympathy  who could ever have supposed such an end in store for the impossible gentle schultz with his idiosyncrasy of naive pilfering so absurdly straightforward that even in the people who had suffered from it it aroused nothing more than a sort of amused exasperation  he was really impossible  his lot evidently should have been a halfstarved mysterious but by no means tragic existence as a mildeyed inoffensive beachcomber on the fringe of native life  there are occasions when the irony of fate which some people profess to discover in the working out of our lives wears the aspect of crude and savage jesting  i shook my head over the manes of schultz and went on with my friends letter  it told me how the brig on the reef looted by the natives from the coast villages acquired gradually the lamentable aspect the grey ghastliness of a wreck while jasper fading daily into a mere shadow of a man strode brusquely all along the front with horribly lively eyes and a faint fixed smile on his lips to spend the day on a lonely spit of sand looking eagerly at her as though he had expected some shape on board to rise up and make some sort of sign to him over the decaying bulwarks  the mesmans were taking care of him as far as it was possible  the bonito case had been referred to batavia where no doubt it would fade away in a fog of official papers    it was heartrending to read all this  that active and zealous officer lieutenant heemskirk his air of sullen darklypained selfimportance not lightened by the approval of his action conveyed to him unofficially had gone on to take up his station in the moluccas     then at the end of the bulky kindlymeant epistle dealing with the island news of half a year at least my friend wrote  a couple of months ago old nelson turned up here arriving by the mailboat from java  came to see mesman it seems  a rather mysterious visit and extraordinarily short after coming all that way  he stayed just four days at the orange house with apparently nothing in particular to do and then caught the southgoing steamer for the straits  i remember people saying at one time that allen was rather sweet on old nelsons daughter the girl that was brought up by mrs harley and then went to live with him at the seven isles group  surely you remember old nelson  remember old nelson  rather  the letter went on to inform me further that old nelson at least remembered me since some time after his flying visit to makassar he had written to the mesmans asking for my address in london  that old nelson or nielsen the note of whose personality was a profound echoless irresponsiveness to everything around him should wish to write or find anything to write about to anybody was in itself a cause for no small wonder  and to me of all people  i waited with uneasy impatience for whatever disclosure could come from that naturally benighted intelligence but my impatience had time to wear out before my eyes beheld old nelsons trembling painfullyformed handwriting senile and childish at the same time on an envelope bearing a penny stamp and the postal mark of the notting hill office  i delayed opening it in order to pay the tribute of astonishment due to the event by flinging my hands above my head  so he had come home to england to be definitely nelson or else was on his way home to denmark where he would revert for ever to his original nielsen  but old nelson or nielsen out of the tropics seemed unthinkable  and yet he was there asking me to call  his address was at a boardinghouse in one of those bayswater squares once of leisure which nowadays are reduced to earning their living  somebody had recommended him there  i started to call on him on one of those january days in london one of those wintry days composed of the four devilish elements cold wet mud and grime combined with a particular stickiness of atmosphere that clings like an unclean garment to ones very soul  yet on approaching his abode i saw like a flicker far behind the soiled veil of the four elements the wearisome and splendid glitter of a blue sea with the seven islets like minute specks swimming in my eye the high red roof of the bungalow crowning the very smallest of them all  this visual reminiscence was profoundly disturbing i knocked at the door with a faltering hand  old nelson or nielsen got up from the table at which he was sitting with a shabby pocketbook full of papers before him  he took off his spectacles before shaking hands  for a moment neither of us said a word then noticing me looking round somewhat expectantly he murmured some words of which i caught only daughter and hong kong cast his eyes down and sighed  his moustache sticking all ways out as of yore was quite white now  his old cheeks were softly rounded with some colour in them strangely enough that something childlike always noticeable in the general contour of his physiognomy had become much more marked like his handwriting he looked childish and senile  he showed his age most in his unintelligently furrowed anxious forehead and in his round innocent eyes which appeared to me weak and blinking and watery or was it that they were full of tears     to discover old nelson fully informed upon any matter whatever was a new experience  and after the first awkwardness had worn off he talked freely with now and then a question to start him going whenever he lapsed into silence which he would do suddenly clasping his hands on his waistcoat in an attitude which would recall to me the east verandah where he used to sit talking quietly and puffing out his cheeks in what seemed now old very old days  he talked in a reasonable somewhat anxious tone  no no  we did not know anything for weeks  out of the way like that we couldnt of course  no mail service to the seven isles but one day i ran over to banka in my big sailingboat to see whether there were any letters and saw a dutch paper  but it looked only like a bit of marine news  english brig bonito gone ashore outside makassar roads  that was all  i took the paper home with me and showed it to her  i will never forgive him she cries with her old spirit  my dear i said you are a sensible girl  the best man may lose a ship  but what about your health i was beginning to be frightened at her looks  she would not let me talk even of going to singapore before  but really such a sensible girl couldnt keep on objecting for ever  do what you like papa she says  rather a job that  had to catch a steamer at sea but i got her over all right  there doctors of course fever  anaemia  put her to bed  two or three women very kind to her  naturally in our papers the whole story came out before long she reads it to the end lying on the couch then hands the newspaper back to me whispers heemskirk and goes off into a faint  he blinked at me for quite a long time his eyes running full of tears again  next day he began without any emotion in his voice she felt stronger and we had a long talk  she told me everything  here old nelson with his eyes cast down gave me the whole story of the heemskirk episode in freyas words then went on in his rather jerky utterance and looking up innocently  my dear i said you have behaved in the main like a sensible girl  i have been horrid she cries and he is breaking his heart over there  well she was too sensible not to see she wasnt in a state to travel  but i went  she told me to go  she was being looked after very well  anaemia  getting better they said  he paused  you did see him i murmured  oh yes i did see him he started again talking in that reasonable voice as though he were arguing a point  i did see him  i came upon him  eyes sunk an inch into his head nothing but skin on the bones of his face a skeleton in dirty white clothes  thats what he looked like  how freya    but she never didnot really  he was sitting there the only live thing for miles along that coast on a driftlog washed up on the shore they had clipped his hair in the hospital and it had not grown again  he stared holding his chin in his hand and with nothing on the sea between him and the sky but that wreck  when i came up to him he just moved his head a bit  is that you old man says helike that  if you had seen him you would have understood at once how impossible it was for freya to have ever loved that man  well well  i dont say  she might havesomething  she was lonely you know  but really to go away with him  never  madness  she was too sensible    i began to reproach him gently  and by and by he turns on me  write to you  what about  come to her  what with  if i had been a man i would have carried her off but she made a child a happy child of me  tell her that the day the only thing i had belonging to me in the world perished on this reef i discovered that i had no power over her   has she come here with you he shouts blazing at me suddenly with his hollow eyes  i shook my head  come with me indeed  anaemia  aha  you see go away then old man and leave me alone here with that ghost he says jerking his head at the wreck of his brig  mad  it was getting dusk  i did not care to stop any longer all by myself with that man in that lonely place  i was not going to tell him of freyas illness  anaemia  what was the good  mad and what sort of husband would he have made anyhow for a sensible girl like freya  why even my little property i could not have left them  the dutch authorities would never have allowed an englishman to settle there  it was not sold then  my man mahmat you know was looking after it for me  later on i let it go for a tenth of its value to a dutch halfcaste  but never mind  it was nothing to me then  yes i went away from him  i caught the return mailboat  i told everything to freya  hes mad i said and my dear the only thing he loved was his brig  perhaps she says to herself looking straight awayher eyes were nearly as hollow as hisperhaps it is true  yes  i would never allow him any power over me  old nelson paused  i sat fascinated and feeling a little cold in that room with a blazing fire  so you see he continued she never really cared for him  much too sensible  i took her away to hong kong  change of climate they said  oh these doctors  my god  winter time  there came ten days of cold mists and wind and rain  pneumonia  but look here  we talked a lot together  days and evenings  who else had she    she talked a lot to me my own girl  sometimes she would laugh a little  look at me and laugh a little  i shuddered  he looked up vaguely with a childish puzzled moodiness  she would say  i did not really mean to be a bad daughter to you papa  and i would say  of course my dear  you could not have meant it  she would lie quiet and then say  i wonder and sometimes ive been really a coward she would tell me  you know sick people they say things  and so she would say too ive been conceited headstrong capricious  i sought my own gratification  i was selfish or afraid    but sick people you know they say anything  and once after lying silent almost all day she said  yes perhaps when the day came i would not have gone  perhaps  i dont know she cried  draw the curtain papa  shut the sea out  it reproaches me with my folly  he gasped and paused  so you see he went on in a murmur  very ill very ill indeed pneumonia  very sudden  he pointed his finger at the carpet while the thought of the poor girl vanquished in her struggle with three mens absurdities and coming at last to doubt her own self held me in a very anguish of pity  you see yourself he began again in a downcast manner  she could not have really    she mentioned you several times  good friend  sensible man  so i wanted to tell you myselflet you know the truth  a fellow like that  how could it be  she was lonely  and perhaps for a while    mere nothing  there could never have been a question of love for my freyasuch a sensible girl  man i cried rising upon him wrathfully dont you see that she died of it  he got up too  no no he stammered as if angry  the doctors pneumonia  low state  the inflammation of the    they told me pneu  he did not finish the word  it ended in a sob  he flung his arms out in a gesture of despair giving up his ghastly pretence with a low heartrending cry  and i thought that she was so sensible
