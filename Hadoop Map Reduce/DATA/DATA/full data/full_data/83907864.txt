indeed     introduction   once upon a time dan and una brother and sister living in the english country had the good fortune to meet with puck alias robin goodfellow alias nick o lincoln alias lobliebythefire the last survivor in england of those whom mortals call fairies their proper name of course is the people of the hills this puck by means of the magic of oak ash and thorn gave the children power       to see what they should see and hear what they should hear      though it should have happened three thousand year  the result was that from time to time and in different places on the farm and in the fields and in the country about they saw and talked to some rather interesting people one of these for instance was a knight of the norman conquest another a young centurion of a roman legion stationed in england another a builder and decorator of king henry viis time and so on and so forth as i have tried to explain in a book called puck of pooks hill  a year or so later the children met puck once more and though they were then older and wiser and wore boots regularly instead of going barefooted when they got the chance puck was as kind to them as ever and introduced them to more people of the old days  he was careful of course to take away their memory of their walks and conversations afterwards but otherwise he did not interfere and dan and una would find the strangest sort of persons in their gardens or woods  in the stories that follow i am trying to tell something about those people     cold iron   when dan and una had arranged to go out before breakfast they did not remember that it was midsummer morning they only wanted to see the otter which old hobden said had been fishing their brook for weeks and early morning was the time to surprise him as they tiptoed out of the house into the wonderful stillness the church clock struck five dan took a few steps across the dewblobbed lawn and looked at his black footprints  i think we ought to be kind to our poor boots he said theyll get horrid wet  it was their first summer in boots and they hated them so they took them off and slung them round their necks and paddled joyfully over the dripping turf where the shadows lay the wrong way like evening in the east the sun was well up and warm but by the brook the last of the night mist still fumed off the water they picked up the chain of otters footprints on the mud and followed it from the bank between the weeds and the drenched mowing while the birds shouted with surprise then the track left the brook and became a smear as though a log had been dragged along  they traced it into three cows meadow over the millsluice to the forge round hobdens garden and then up the slope till it ran out on the short turf and fern of pooks hill and they heard the cockpheasants crowing in the woods behind them  no use said dan questing like a puzzled hound the dews drying off and old hobden says ottersll travel for miles  im sure weve travelled miles una fanned herself with her hat how still it is its going to be a regular roaster she looked down the valley where no chimney yet smoked  hobdens up dan pointed to the open door of the forge cottage what dyou suppose he has for breakfast one of them he says they eat good all times of the year una jerked her head at some stately pheasants going down to the brook for a drink  a few steps farther on a fox broke almost under their bare feet yapped and trotted off  ah mus reynoldsmus reynoldsdan was quoting from old hobdenif i knowed all you knowed id know something see the winged hats in puck of pooks hill  i sayuna lowered her voiceyou know that funny feeling of things having happened before i felt it when you said mus reynolds  so did i dan began what is it  they faced each other stammering with excitement  wait a shake ill remember in a minute wasnt it something about a foxlast year oh i nearly had it then dan cried  be quiet said una prancing excitedly there was something happened before we met the fox last year hills broken hillsthe play at the theatresee what you see  i remember now dan shouted its as plain as the nose on your facepooks hillpucks hillpuck  i remember too said una and its midsummer day again the young fern on a knoll rustled and puck walked out chewing a greentopped rush  good midsummer morning to you heres a happy meeting said he they shook hands all round and asked questions  youve wintered well he said after a while and looked them up and down nothing much wrong with you seemingly  theyve put us into boots said una look at my feettheyre all pale white and my toes are squidged together awfully  yesboots make a difference puck wriggled his brown square hairy foot and cropped a dandelion flower between the big toe and the next  i could do thatlast year dan said dismally as he tried and failed and boots simply ruin ones climbing  there must be some advantage to them i supposesaid puck or folk wouldnt wear them shall we come this way they sauntered along side by side till they reached the gate at the far end of the hillside here they halted just like cattle and let the sun warm their backs while they listened to the flies in the wood  little lindens is awake said una as she hung with her chin on the top rail see the chimney smoke  todays thursday isnt it puck turned to look at the old pink farmhouse across the little valley mrs vinceys baking day bread should rise well this weather he yawned and that set them both yawning  the bracken about rustled and ticked and shook in every direction they felt that little crowds were stealing past  doesnt that sound likeerthe people of the hillssaid una  its the birds and wild things drawing up to the woods before people get about said puck as though he were ridley the keeper  oh we know that i only said it sounded like  as i remember em the people of the hills used to make more noise theyd settle down for the day rather like small birds settling down for the night but that was in the days when they carried the high hand oh me the deeds that ive had act and part in youd scarcely believe  i like that said dan after all you told us last year too  only the minute you went away you made us forget everything said una  puck laughed and shook his head i shall this year too ive given you seizin of old england and ive taken away your doubt and fear but your memory and remembrance between whiles ill keep where old billy trott kept his nightlinesand thats where he could draw em up and hide em at need does that suit he twinkled mischievously  its got to suitsaid una and laughed we cant magic back at you she folded her arms and leaned against the gate suppose now you wanted to magic me into somethingan otter could you  not with those boots round your neck ill take them off she threw them on the turf dans followed immediately now she said  less than ever now youve trusted me where theres true faith theres no call for magic pucks slow smile broadened all over his face  but what have boots to do with it said una perching on the gate  theres cold iron in them said puck and settled beside her nails in the soles i mean it makes a difference  how cant you feel it does you wouldnt like to go back to bare feet again same as last year would you not really  noo i suppose i shouldntnot for always im growing up you know said una  but you told us last year in the long slipat the theatrethat you didnt mind cold ironsaid dan  i dont but folks in housen as the people of the hills call them must be ruled by cold iron folk in housen are born on the near side of cold irontheres iron in every mans house isnt there they handle cold iron every day of their lives and their fortunes made or spoilt by cold iron in some shape or other thats how it goes with flesh and blood and one cant prevent it  i dont quite see how do you meansaid dan  it would take me some time to tell you  oh its ever so long to breakfast said dan we looked in the larder before we came out he unpocketed one big hunk of bread and una another which they shared with puck  thats little lindens baking he said as his white teeth sunk in it i know mrs vinceys hand he ate with a slow sideways thrust and grind just like old hobden and like hobden hardly dropped a crumb the sun flashed on little lindens windows and the cloudless sky grew stiller and hotter in the valley  ahcold iron he said at last to the impatient children folk in housen as the people of the hills say grow careless about cold iron theyll nail the horseshoe over the front door and forget to put it over the back then some time or other the people of the hills slip in find the cradlebabe in the corner and  oh i know steal it and leave a changelinguna cried  no said puck firmly all that talk of changelings is peoples excuse for their own neglect never believe em id whip em at the carttail through three parishes if i had my way  but they dont do it now said una  whip or neglect children umm some folks and some fields never alter but the people of the hills didnt work any changeling tricks theyd tiptoe in and whisper and weave round the cradlebabe in the chimneycornera fagend of a charm here or half a spell therelike kettles singing but when the babes mind came to bud out afterwards it would act differently from other people in its station thats no advantage to man or maid so i wouldnt allow it with my folks babies here i told sir huon so once  who was sir huon dan asked and puck turned on him in quiet astonishment  sir huon of bordeauxhe succeeded king oberon he had been a bold knight once but he was lost on the road to babylon a long while back have you ever heard how many miles to babylon  of course said dan flushing  well sir huon was young when that song was new but about tricks on mortal babies i said to sir huon in the fern here on just such a morning as this if you crave to act and influence on folk in housen which i know is your desire why dont you take some human cradlebabe by fair dealing and bring him up among yourselves on the far side of cold ironas oberon did in time past then you could make him a splendid fortune and send him out into the world  time past is past time says sir huon i doubt if we could do it for one thing the babe would have to be taken without wronging man woman or child for another hed have to be born on the far side of cold ironin some house where no cold iron ever stood and for yet the third hed have to be kept from cold iron all his days till we let him find his fortune no its not easy he said and he rode off thinking you see sir huon had been a man once i happened to attend lewes market next wodens day even and watched the slaves being sold theresame as pigs are sold at robertsbridge market nowadays only the pigs have rings on their noses and the slaves had rings round their necks  what sort of rings said dan  a ring of cold iron four fingers wide and a thumb thick just like a quoit but with a snap to it for to snap round the slaves neck they used to do a big trade in slaverings at the forge here and ship them to all parts of old england packed in oak sawdust but as i was saying there was a farmer out of the weald who had bought a woman with a babe in her arms and he didnt want any encumbrances to her driving his beasts home for him  beast himself said una and kicked her bare heel on the gate  so he blamed the auctioneer its none o my baby the wench puts in i took it off a woman in our gang who died on terrible down yesterday ill take it off to the church then says the farmer mother churchll make a monk of it and well step along home  it was dusk then he slipped down to st pancras church and laid the babe at the cold chapel door i breathed on the back of his stooping neckandive heard he never could be warm at any fire afterwards i should have been surprised if he could then i whipped up the babe and came flying home here like a bat to his belfry  on the dewy break of morning of thors own dayjust such a day as thisi laid the babe outside the hill here and the people flocked up and wondered at the sight  youve brought him then sir huon said staring like any mortal man  yes and hes brought his mouth with him too i said the babe was crying loud for his breakfast  what is he says sir huon when the womenfolk had drawn him under to feed him  full moon and morning star may know i says i dont by what i could make out of him in the moonlight hes without brand or blemish ill answer for it that hes born on the far side of cold iron for he was born under a shaw on terrible down and ive wronged neither man woman nor child in taking him for he is the son of a dead slavewoman  all to the good robin sir huon said hell be the less anxious to leave us oh well give him a splendid fortune and we shall act and influence on folk in housen as we have always craved his lady came up then and drew him under to watch the babes wonderful doings who was his ladysaid dan the lady esclairmonde she had been a woman once till she followed sir huon across the fern as we say babies are no special treat to meive watched too many of themso i stayed on the hill presently i heard hammering down at the forge therepuck pointed towards hobdens cottage it was too early for any workmen but it passed through my mind that the breaking day was thors own day a slow northeast wind blew up and set the oaks sawing and fretting in a way i remembered so i slipped over to see what i could see  and what did you see a smith forging something or other out of cold iron when it was finished he weighed it in his hand his back was towards me and tossed it from him a longish quoitthrow down the valley i saw cold iron flash in the sun but i couldnt quite make out where it fell that didnt trouble me i knew it would be found sooner or later by someone  how did you knowdan went on  because i knew the smith that made it said puck quietly  wayland smith una suggested see welands sword in puck of pooks hill  no i should have passed the time o day with wayland smith of course this other was different sopuck made a queer crescent in the air with his fingeri counted the blades of grass under my nose till the wind dropped and he had gonehe and his hammer  was it thor then una murmured under her breath  who else it was thors own day puck repeated the sign i didnt tell sir huon or his lady what id seen borrow trouble for yourself if thats your nature but dont lend it to your neighbours moreover i might have been mistaken about the smiths work he might have been making things for mere amusement though it wasnt like him or he might have thrown away an old piece of made iron one can never be sure so i held my tongue and enjoyed the babe he was a wonderful childand the people of the hills were so set on him they wouldnt have believed me he took to me wonderfully as soon as he could walk hed putter forth with me all about my hill here fern makes soft falling he knew when day broke on earth above for hed thump thump thump like an old buckrabbit in a bury and id hear him say opy till some one who knew the charm let him out and then it would be robin robin all round robin hoods barn as we say till hed found me  the dear said una id like to have seen him yes he was a boy and when it came to learning his wordsspells and suchlikehed sit on the hill in the long shadows worrying out bits of charms to try on passersby and when the bird flew to him or the tree bowed to him for pure loves sake like everything else on my hill hed shout robin looksee look see robin and sputter out some spell or other that they had taught him all wrong end first till i hadnt the heart to tell him it was his own dear self and not the words that worked the wonder when he got more abreast of his words and could cast spells for sure as we say he took more and more notice of things and people in the world people of course always drew him for he was mortal all through  seeing that he was free to move among folk in housen under or over cold iron i used to take him along with me nightwalking where he could watch folk and i could keep him from touching cold iron that wasnt so difficult as it sounds because there are plenty of things besides cold iron in housen to catch a boys fancy he was a handful though i shant forget when i took him to little lindenshis first night under a roof the smell of the rushlights and the bacon on the beamsthey were stuffing a featherbed too and it was a drizzling warm nightgot into his head before i could stop himwe were hiding in the bakehousehed whipped up a storm of wildfire with flashlights and voices which sent the folk shrieking into the garden and a girl overset a hive there andof course he didnt know till then such things could touch himhe got badly stung and came home with his face looking like kidney potatoes you can imagine how angry sir huon and lady esclairmonde were with poor robin they said the boy was never to be trusted with me nightwalking any moreand he took about as much notice of their order as he did of the beestings night after night as soon as it was dark id pick up his whistle in the wet fern and off wed flit together among folk in housen till break of dayhe asking questions and i answering according to my knowledge then we fell into mischief againpuck shook till the gate rattled  we came across a man up at brightling who was beating his wife with a bat in the garden i was just going to toss the man over his own woodlump when the boy jumped the hedge and ran at him of course the woman took her husbands part and while the man beat him the woman scratted his face it wasnt till i danced among the cabbages like brightling beacon all ablaze that they gave up and ran indoors the boys fine greenandgold clothes were torn all to pieces and he had been welted in twenty places with the mans bat and scratted by the womans nails to pieces he looked like a robertsbridge hopper on a monday morning  robin said he while i was trying to clean him down with a bunch of hay i dont quite understand folk in housen i went to help that old woman and she hit me robin  what else did you expect i said that was the one time when you might have worked one of your charms instead of running into three times your weight  i didnt think he says but i caught the man one on the head that was as good as any charm did you see it work robin  mind your nose i said bleed it on a dockleafnot your sleeve for pitys sake i knew what the lady esclairmonde would say  he didnt care he was as happy as a gipsy with a stolen pony and the front part of his gold coat all blood and grass stains looked like ancient sacrifices  of course the people of the hills laid the blame on me the boy could do nothing wrong in their eyes  you are bringing him up to act and influence on folk in housen when youre ready to let him go i said now hes begun to do it why do you cry shame on me thats no shame its his nature drawing him to his kind  but we dont want him to begin that way the lady esclairmonde said we intend a splendid fortune for himnot your flitterbynight hedgejumping gipsywork  i dont blame you robin says sir huon but i do think you might look after the boy more closely  ive kept him away from cold iron these sixteen years i said you know as well as i do the first time he touches cold iron hell find his own fortune in spite of everything you intend for him you owe me something for that  sir huon having been a man was going to allow me the right of it but the lady esclairmonde being the mother of all mothers overpersuaded him  were very grateful sir huon said but we think that just for the present you are about too much with him on the hill  though you have said it i said i will give you a second chance i did not like being called to account for my doings on my own hill i wouldnt have stood it even that far except i loved the boy  no no says the lady esclairmonde hes never any trouble when hes left to me and himself its your fault  you have said it i answered hear me from now on till the boy has found his fortune whatever that may be i vow to you all on my hill by oak and ash and thorn and by the hammer of asa thoragain puck made that curious doublecut in the airthat you may leave me out of all your counts and reckonings then i went outhe snapped his fingerslike the puff of a candle and though they called and cried they made nothing by it i didnt promise not to keep an eye on the boy though i watched him closecloseclose  when he found what his people had forced me to do he gave them a piece of his mind but they all kissed and cried round him and being only a boy he came over to their way of thinking i dont blame him and called himself unkind and ungrateful and it all ended in fresh shows and plays and magics to distract him from folk in housen dear heart alive how he used to call and call on me and i couldnt answer or even let him know that i was near  not even once said una if he was very lonely no he couldnt said dan who had been thinking didnt you swear by the hammer of thor that you wouldnt puck  by that hammer was the deep rumbled reply then he came back to his soft speaking voice and the boy was lonely when he couldnt see me any more he began to try to learn all learning he had good teachers but i saw him lift his eyes from the big black books towards folk in housen all the time he studied songmaking good teachers he had too but he sang those songs with his back toward the hill and his face toward folk i know i have sat and grieved over him grieving within a rabbits jump of him then he studied the high low and middle magic he had promised the lady esclairmonde he would never go near folk in housen so he had to make shows and shadows for his mind to chew on what sort of shows said dan  just boys magic as we say ill show you some some time it pleased him for the while and it didnt hurt any one in particular except a few men coming home late from the taverns but i knew what it was a sign of and i followed him like a weasel follows a rabbit as good a boy as ever lived ive seen him with sir huon and the lady esclairmonde stepping just as they stepped to avoid the track of cold iron in a furrow or walking wide of some old ashtot because a man had left his swophook or spade there and all his heart aching to go straightforward among folk in housen all the time oh a good boy they always intended a fine fortune for himbut they could never find it in their heart to let him begin ive heard that many warned them but they wouldnt be warned so it happened as it happened  one hot night i saw the boy roving about here wrapped in his flaming discontents there was flash on flash against the clouds and rush on rush of shadows down the valley till the shaws were full of his hounds giving tongue and the woodways were packed with his knights in armour riding down into the watermistsall his own magic of course behind them you could see great castles lifting slow and splendid on arches of moonshine with maidens waving their hands at the windows which all turned into roaring rivers and then would come the darkness of his own young heart wiping out the whole slateful but boys magic doesnt trouble meor merlins either for that matter i followed the boy by the flashes and the whirling wildfire of his discontent and oh but i grieved for him oh but i grieved for him he pounded back and forth like a bullock in a strange pasturesometimes alonesometimes waistdeep among his shadowhoundssometimes leading his shadowknights on a hawkwinged horse to rescue his shadowgirls i never guessed he had such magic at his command but its often that way with boys  just when the owl comes home for the second time i saw sir huon and the lady ride down my hill where theres not much magic allowed except mine they were very pleased at the boys magicthe valley flared with itand i heard them settling his splendid fortune when they should find it in their hearts to let him go to act and influence among folk in housen sir huon was for making him a great king somewhere or other and the lady was for making him a marvellous wise man whom all should praise for his skill and kindness she was very kindhearted  of a sudden we saw the flashes of his discontents turned back on the clouds and his shadowhounds stopped baying  theres magic fighting magic over yonder the lady esclairmonde cried reigning up who is against him  i could have told her but i did not count it any of my business to speak of asa thors comings and goings  how did you knowsaid una  a slow northeast wind blew up sawing and fretting through the oaks in a way i remembered the wildfire roared up one last time in one sheet and snuffed out like a rushlight and a bucketful of stinging hail fell we heard the boy walking in the long slipwhere i first met you  here oh come here said the lady esclairmonde and stretched out her arms in the dark  he was coming slowly but he stumbled in the footpath being of course mortal man  why whats this he said to himself we three heard him  hold lad hold ware cold iron said sir huon and they two swept down like nightjars crying as they rode  i ran at their stirrups but it was too late we felt that the boy had touched cold iron somewhere in the dark for the horses of the hill shied off and whipped round snorting  then i judged it was time for me to show myself in my own shape so i did  whatever it is i said he has taken hold of it now we must find out whatever it is that he has taken hold of for that will be his fortune  come here robin the boy shouted as soon as he heard my voice i dont know what ive hold of  it is in your hands i called back tell us if it is hard and cold with jewels atop for that will be a kings sceptre  not by a furrowlong he said and stooped and tugged in the dark we heard him has it a handle and two cutting edges i called for thatll be a knights sword  no it hasnt he says its neither ploughshare whittle hook nor crook nor aught ive yet seen men handle by this time he was scratting in the dirt to prise it up  whatever it is you know who put it there robin said sir huon to me or you would not ask those questions you should have told me as soon as you knew  what could you or i have done against the smith that made it and laid it for him to find i said and i whispered sir huon what i had seen at the forge on thors day when the babe was first brought to the hill  oh goodbye our dreams said sir huon its neither sceptre sword nor plough maybe yet its a bookful of learning bound with iron clasps theres a chance for a splendid fortune in that sometimes  but we knew we were only speaking to comfort ourselves and the lady esclairmonde having been a woman said so  thur aie thor help us the boy called it is round without end cold iron four fingers wide and a thumb thick and there is writing on the breadth of it  read the writing if you have the learning i called the darkness had lifted by then and the owl was out over the fern again  he called back reading the runes on the iron    few can see   further forth   than when the child   meets the cold iron  and there he stood in clear starlight with a new heavy shining slavering round his proud neck  is this how it goes he asked while the lady esclairmonde cried  that is how it goes i said he hadnt snapped the catch home yet though  what fortune does it mean for him said sir huon while the boy fingered the ring you who walk under cold iron you must tell us and teach us  tell i can but teach i cannot i said the virtue of the ring is only that he must go among folk in housen henceforward doing what they want done or what he knows they need all old england over never will he be his own master nor yet ever any mans he will get half he gives and give twice what he gets till his lifes last breath and if he lays aside his load before he draws that last breath all his work will go for naught  oh cruel wicked thor cried the lady esclairmonde ah look see all of you the catch is still open he hasnt locked it he can still take it off he can still come back come back she went as near as she dared but she could not lay hands on cold iron the boy could have taken it off yes we waited to see if he would but he put up his hand and the snap locked home  what else could i have done said he  surely then you will do i said mornings coming and if you three have any farewells to make make them now for after sunrise cold iron must be your master so the three sat down cheek by wet cheek telling over their farewells till morning light as good a boy as ever lived he was  and what happened to him asked dan  when morning came cold iron was master of him and his fortune and he went to work among folk in housen presently he came across a maid likeminded with himself and they were wedded and had bushels of children as the saying is perhaps youll meet some of his breed this year  thank you said una but what did the poor lady esclairmonde do  what can you do when asa thor lays the cold iron in a lads path she and sir huon were comforted to think they had given the boy good store of learning to act and influence on folk in housen for he was a good boy isnt it getting on for breakfasttime ill walk with you a piece  when they were well in the centre of the bonedry fern dan nudged una who stopped and put on a boot as quickly as she could now she said you cant get any oak ash and thorn leaves from here andshe balanced wildly on one legim standing on cold iron whatll you do if we dont go away  eeh of all mortal impudencesaid puck as dan also in one boot grabbed his sisters hand to steady himself he walked round them shaking with delight you think i can only work with a handful of dead leaves this comes of taking away your doubt and fear ill show you   a minute later they charged into old hobden at his simple breakfast of cold roast pheasant shouting that there was a wasps nest in the fern which they had nearly stepped on and asking him to come and smoke it out its too early for wopsnests an i dont go diggin in the hill not for shillins said the old man placidly youve a thorn in your foot miss una sit down and put on your tother boot youre too old to be caperin barefoot on an empty stomach stay it with this chicken o mine     cold iron        gold is for the mistresssilver for the maid      copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade      good said the baron sitting in his hall      but ironcold ironis master of them all       so he made rebellion gainst the king his liege      camped before his citadel and summoned it to siege      nay said the cannoneer on the castle wall      but ironcold ironshall be master of you all       woe for the baron and his knights so strong      when the cruel cannonballs laid em all along      he was taken prisoner he was cast in thrall      and ironcold ironwas master of it all       yet his king spake kindly oh how kind a lord      what if i release thee now and give thee back thy sword      nay said the baron mock not at my fall      for ironcold ironis master of men all       tears are for the craven prayers are for the clown      halters for the silly neck that cannot keep a crown      as my loss is grievous so my hope is small      for ironcold ironmust be master of men all       yet his

hence      to certain death by certain shame attended      envyah  even to tears      the fortune of their years      which though so few yet so divinely ended       scarce had they lifted up      lifes full and fiery cup      than they had set it down untouched before them      before their day arose      they beckoned it to close      close in destruction and confusion oer them       they did not stay to ask      what prize should crown their task      well sure that prize was such as no man strives for      but passed into eclipse      her kiss upon their lips      even belphoebes whom they gave their lives for     gloriana   willow shaw the little fenced wood where the hoppoles are stacked like indian wigwams had been given to dan and una for their very own kingdom when they were quite small as they grew older they contrived to keep it most particularly private even phillips the gardener told them every time that he came in to take a hoppole for his beans and old hobden would no more have thought of setting his rabbitwires there without leave given fresh each spring than he would have torn down the calico and marking ink notice on the big willow which said grownups not allowed in the kingdom unless brought  now you can understand their indignation when one blowy july afternoon as they were going up for a potatoroast they saw somebody moving among the trees they hurled themselves over the gate dropping half the potatoes and while they were picking them up puck came out of a wigwam  oh its you is it said una we thought it was people i saw you were angryfrom your legs he answered with a grin  well its our own kingdomnot counting you of course  thats rather why i came a lady here wants to see you  what about said dan cautiously oh just kingdoms and things she knows about kingdoms  there was a lady near the fence dressed in a long dark cloak that hid everything except her high redheeled shoes her face was half covered by a black silk fringed mask without goggles and yet she did not look in the least as if she motored  puck led them up to her and bowed solemnly una made the best dancinglesson curtsy she could remember the lady answered with a long deep slow billowy one  since it seems that you are a queen of this kingdomshe said i can do no less than acknowledge your sovereignty she turned sharply on staring dan whats in your head lad manners  i was thinking how wonderfully you did that curtsy he answered  she laughed a rather shrill laugh youre a courtier already do you know anything of dances wenchor queen must i say  ive had some lessons but i cant really dance a bit said una  you should learn then the lady moved forward as though she would teach her at once it gives a woman alone among men or her enemies time to think how she shall win orlose a woman can only work in mans playtime heighoshe sat down on the bank  old middenboro the lawnmower pony stumped across the paddock and hung his sorrowful head over the fence  a pleasant kingdom said the lady looking round well enclosed and how does your majesty govern it who is your minister  una did not quite understand we dont play that she said  play the lady threw up her hands and laughed  we have it for our own together dan explained  and dyou never quarrel young burleigh  sometimes but then we dont tell  the lady nodded ive no brats of my own but i understand keeping a secret between queens and their ministers ay de mi  but with no disrespect to present majesty methinks your realm small and therefore likely to be coveted by man and beast for is exampleshe pointed to middenboroyonder old horse with the face of a spanish friardoes he never break in  he cant old hobden stops all our gaps for us said una and we let hobden catch rabbits in the shaw  the lady laughed like a man i see hobden catches coniesrabbitsfor himself and guards your defences for you does he make a profit out of his coneycatching  we never ask said una hobdens a particular friend of ours hoitytoity the lady began angrily then she laughed but i forget it is your kingdom i knew a maid once that had a larger one than this to defend and so long as her men kept the fences stopped she asked em no questions either  was she trying to grow flowerssaid una  no treesperdurable trees her flowers all withered the lady leaned her head on her hand  they do if you dont look after them weve got a few would you like to see ill fetch you some una ran off to the rank grass in the shade behind the wigwam and came back with a handful of red flowers arent they pretty she said theyre virginia stock  virginia said the lady and lifted them to the fringe of her mask  yes they come from virginia did your maid ever plant any  not herselfbut her men adventured all over the earth to pluck or to plant flowers for her crown they judged her worthy of them  and was she said dan cheerfully  quien sabe who knows but at least while her men toiled abroad she toiled in england that they might find a safe home to come back to  and what was she called  glorianabelphoebeelizabeth of england her voice changed at each word  you mean queen bess  the lady bowed her head a little towards dan you name her lightly enough young burleigh what might you know of her said she  well iive seen the little green shoes she left at brickwall housedown the road you know theyre in a glass caseawfully tiny things  oh burleigh burleigh she laughed you are a courtier too soon  but they are dan insisted as little as dolls shoes did you really know her well  well she was awoman ive been at her court all my life yes i remember when she danced after the banquet at brickwall they say she danced philip of spain out of a brandnew kingdom that day worth the price of a pair of old shoeshey  she thrust out one foot and stooped forward to look at its broad flashing buckle  youve heard of philip of spainlongsuffering philip she said her eyes still on the shining stones faith what some men will endure at some womens hands passes belief if i had been a man and a woman had played with me as elizabeth played with philip i would have she nipped off one of the virginia stocks and held it up between finger and thumb but for all thatshe began to strip the leaves one by onethey sayand i am persuadedthat philip loved her she tossed her head sideways  i dont quite understand said una  the high heavens forbid that you should wench she swept the flowers from her lap and stood up in the rush of shadows that the wind chased through the wood  i should like to know about the shoes said dan  so ye shall burleigh so ye shall if ye watch me twill be as good as a play  weve never been to a play said una  the lady looked at her and laughed ill make one for you watch you are to imagine that shegloriana belphoebe elizabethhas gone on a progress to rye to comfort her sad heart maids are often melancholic and while she halts at brickwall house the villagewhat was its name she pushed puck with her foot  norgem he croaked and squatted by the wigwam  norgem village loyally entertains her with a masque or play and a latin oration spoken by the parson for whose false quantities if id made em in my girlhood i should have been whipped  you whipped said dan  soundly sirrah soundly she stomachs the affront to her scholarship makes her grateful gracious thanks from the teeth outwards thusthe lady yawnedoh a queen may love her subjects in her heart and yet be dogwearied of em in body and mindand so sits downher skirts foamed about her as she satto a banquet beneath brickwall oak here for her sins she is waited upon bywhat were the young cockerels names that served gloriana at table  frewens courthopes fullers husseys puck began  she held up her long jewelled hand spare the rest they were the best blood of sussex and by so much the more clumsy in handling the dishes and plates whereforeshe looked funnily over her shoulderyou are to think of gloriana in a green and goldlaced habit dreadfully expecting that the jostling youths behind her would of pure jealousy or devotion spatter it with sauces and wines the gown was philips gift too at this happy juncture a queens messenger mounted and mired spurs up the rye road and delivers her a lettershe giggleda letter from a good simple frantic spanish gentleman calleddon philip  that wasnt philip king of spaindan asked  truly it was twixt you and me and the bedpost young burleigh these kings and queens are very like men and women and ive heard they write each other fond foolish letters that none of their ministers should open  did her ministers ever open queen elizabeths letters said una  faith yes but shed have done as much for theirs any day you are to think of gloriana then they say she had a pretty hand excusing herself thus to the companyfor the queens time is never her ownand while the music strikes up reading philips letter as i do she drew a real letter from her pocket and held it out almost at arms length like the old postmistress in the village when she reads telegrams  hm hm hm philip writes as ever most lovingly he says his gloriana is cold for which reason he burns for her through a fair written page she turned it with a snap whats here philip complains that certain of her gentlemen have fought against his generals in the low countries he prays her to hang em when they reenter her realms hm thats as may be heres a list of burnt shipping slipped between two vows of burning adoration oh poor philip his admirals at seano less than three of emhave been boarded sacked and scuttled on their lawful voyages by certain english mariners gentlemen he will not call them who are now at large and working more piracies in his american ocean which the pope gave him he and the pope should guard it then philip hears but his devout ears will not credit it that gloriana in some fashion countenances these villains misdeeds shares in their booty andoh shamehas even lent them ships royal for their sinful thefts therefore he requires which is a word gloriana loves not requires that she shall hang em when they return to england and afterwards shall account to him for all the goods and gold they have plundered a most loving request if gloriana will not be philips bride she shall be his broker and his butcher should she still be stiffnecked he writessee where the pen digged the innocent paperthat he hath both the means and the intention to be revenged on her aha now we come to the spaniard in his shirt she waved the letter merrily listen here philip will prepare for gloriana a destruction from the westa destruction from the westfar exceeding that which pedro de avila wrought upon the huguenots and he rests and remains kissing her feet and her hands her slave her enemy or her conqueror as he shall find that she uses him  she thrust back the letter under her cloak and went on acting but in a softer voice all this whilehark to itthe wind blows through brickwall oak the music plays and with the companys eyes upon her the queen of england must think what this means she cannot remember the name of pedro de avila nor what he did to the huguenots nor when nor where she can only see darkly some dark motion moving in philips dark mind for he hath never written before in this fashion she must smile above the letter as though it were good news from her ministersthe smile that tires the mouth and the poor heart what shall she do again her voice changed  you are to fancy that the music of a sudden wavers away chris hatton captain of her bodyguard quits the table all red and ruffled and glorianas virgin ear catches the clash of swords at work behind a wall the mothers of sussex look round to count their chicksi mean those young gamecocks that waited on her two dainty youths have stepped aside into brickwall garden with rapier and dagger on a private point of honour they are haled out through the gate disarmed and glaringthe lively image of a brace of young cupids transformed into pale panting cains ahem gloriana beckons awfullythus they come up for judgement their lives and estates lie at her mercy whom they have doubly offended both as queen and woman but la what will not foolish young men do for a beautiful maid  why what did she do what had they done said una  hsh you mar the play gloriana had guessed the cause of the trouble they were handsome lads so she frowns a while and tells em not to be bigger fools than their mothers had made em and warns em if they do not kiss and be friends on the instant shell have chris hatton horse and birch em in the style of the new school at harrow chris looks sour at that lastly because she needed time to think on philips letter burning in her pocket she signifies her pleasure to dance with em and teach em better manners whereat the revived company call down heavens blessing on her gracious head chris and the others prepare brickwall house for a dance and she walks in the clipped garden between those two lovely young sinners who are both ready to sink for shame they confess their fault it appears that midway in the banquet the elderthey were cousinsconceived that the queen looked upon him with special favour the younger taking the look to himself after some words gives the elder the lie hence as she guessed the duel  and which had she really looked at dan asked  neitherexcept to wish them farther off she was afraid all the while theyd spill dishes on her gown she tells em this poor chicksand it completes their abasement when they had grilled long enough she says and so you would have fleshed your maiden swords for mefor me faith they would have been at it again if shed egged em on but their swordsoh prettily they said ithad been drawn for her once or twice already  and where says she on your hobbyhorses before you were breeched  on my own ship says the elder my cousin was viceadmiral of our venture in his pinnace we would not have you think of us as brawling children  no no says the younger and flames like a very tudor rose at least the spaniards know us better  admiral boyviceadmiral babe says gloriana i cry your pardon the heat of these present times ripens childhood to age more quickly than i can follow but we are at peace with spain where did you break your queens peace on the sea called the spanish main though tis no more spanish than my doublet says the elder guess how that warmed glorianas already melting heart she would never suffer any sea to be called spanish in her private hearing  and why was i not told what booty got you and where have you hid it disclose says she you stand in some danger of the gallows for pirates  the axe most gracious lady says the elder for we are gentle born he spoke truth but no woman can brook contradiction hoitytoity says she and but that she remembered that she was queen shed have cuffed the pair of em it shall be gallows hurdle and dungcart if i choose  had our queen known of our going beforehand philip might have held her to blame for some small things we did on the seas the younger lisps  as for treasure says the elder we brought back but our bare lives we were wrecked on the gascons graveyard where our sole company for three months was the bleached bones of de avilas men  glorianas mind jumped back to philips last letter  de avila that destroyed the huguenots what dyou know of him she says the music called from the house here and they three turned back between the yews  simply that de avila broke in upon a plantation of frenchmen on that coast and very spaniardly hung them all for hereticseight hundred or so the next year dominique de gorgues a gascon broke in upon de avilas men and very justly hung em all for murderersfive hundred or so no christians inhabit there now says the elder lad though tis a goodly land north of florida  how far is it from england asks prudent gloriana  with a fair wind six weeks they say that philip will plant it again soon this was the younger and he looked at her out of the corner of his innocent eye  chris hatton fuming meets and leads her into brickwall hall where she dancesthus a woman can think while she dancescan think ill show you watch  she took off her cloak slowly and stood forth in dovecoloured satin worked over with pearls that trembled like running water in the running shadows of the trees still talkingmore to herself than to the childrenshe swam into a majestical dance of the stateliest balancings the naughtiest wheelings and turnings aside the most dignified sinkings the gravest risings all joined together by the elaboratest interlacing steps and circles they leaned forward breathlessly to watch the splendid acting  would a spaniard she began looking on the ground speak of his revenge till his revenge were ripe no yet a man who loved a woman might threaten her in the hope that his threats would make her love him such things have been she moved slowly across a bar of sunlight a destruction from the west may signify that philip means to descend on ireland but then my irish spies would have had some warning the irish keep no secrets noit is not ireland now whywhywhythe red shoes clicked and pauseddoes philip name pedro melendez de avila a general in his americas unlessshe turned more quicklyunless he intends to work his destruction from the americas did he say de avila only to put her off her guard or for this once has his black pen betrayed his black heart weshe raised herself to her full heightengland must forestall master philip but not openlyshe sank againwe cannot fight spain openlynot yetnot yet she stepped three paces as though she were pegging down some snare with her twinkling shoebuckles the queens mad gentlemen may fight philips poor admirals where they find em but england gloriana harrys daughter must keep the peace perhaps after all philip loves heras many men and boys do that may help england oh what shall help england  she raised her headthe masked head that seemed to have nothing to do with the busy feetand stared straight at the children  i think this is rather creepy said una with a shiver i wish shed stop  the lady held out her jewelled hand as though she were taking some one elses hand in the grand chain  can a ship go down into the gascons graveyard and wait there she asked into the air and passed on rustling  shes pretending to ask one of the cousins isnt she said dan and puck nodded  back she came in the silent swaying ghostly dance they saw she was smiling beneath the mask and they could hear her breathing hard  i cannot lend you any of my ships for the venture philip would hear of it she whispered over her shoulder but as much guns and powder as you ask if you do not ask tooher voice shot up and she stamped her foot thrice louder louder the music in the gallery oh me but i have burst out of my shoe  she gathered her skirts in each hand and began a curtsy you will go at your own charges she whispered straight before her oh enviable and adorable age of youth her eyes shone through the maskholes but i warn you youll repent it put not your trust in princesor queens philips shipsll blow you out of water youll not be frightened well well talk on it again when i return from rye dear lads  the wonderful curtsy ended she stood up nothing stirred on her except the rush of the shadows  and so it was finished she said to the children why dyou not applaud  what was finished said una  the dance the lady replied offendedly and a pair of green shoes  i dont understand a bit said una  eh what did you make of it young burleigh  im not quite sure dan began but  you never can bewith a woman but  but i thought gloriana meant the cousins to go back to the gascons graveyard wherever that was  twas virginia afterwards her plantation of virginia  virginia afterwards and stop philip from taking it didnt she say shed lend em guns  right so but not shipsthen  and i thought you meant they must have told her theyd do it off their own bat without getting her into a row with philip was i right  near enough for a minister of the queen but remember she gave the lads full time to change their minds she was three long days at rye royalknighting of fat mayors when she came back to brickwall they met her a mile down the road and she could feel their eyes burn through her ridingmask chris hatton poor fool was vexed at it  you would not birch them when i gave you the chance says she to chris now you must get me half an hours private speech with em in brickwall garden eve tempted adam in a garden quick man or i may repent  she was a queen why did she not send for them herself said una  the lady shook her head that was never her way ive seen her walk to her own mirror by byeends and the woman that cannot walk straight there is past praying for yet i would have you pray for her what elsewhat else in englands name could she have done she lifted her hand to her throat for a moment faith she cried id forgotten the little green shoes she left em at brickwallso she did and i remember she gave the norgem parsonjohn withers was hea text for his sermonover edom have i cast out my shoe neat if hed understood  i dont understand said una what about the two cousins  you are as cruel as a woman the lady answered i was not to blame i told you i gave em time to change their minds on my honour ay de mi she asked no more of em at first than to wait a while off that coastthe gascons graveyardto hover a little if their ships chanced to pass that waythey had only one tall ship and a pinnaceonly to watch and bring me word of philips doings one must watch philip always what a murrain right had he to make any plantation there a hundred leagues north of his spanish main and only six weeks from england by my dread fathers soul i tell you he had nonenone she stamped her red foot again and the two children shrunk back for a second  nay nay you must not turn from me too she laid it all fairly before the lads in brickwall garden between the yews i told em that if philip sent a fleet and to make a plantation he could not well send less their poor little cockboats could not sink it they answered that with submission the fight would be their own concern she showed em again that there could be only one end to itquick death on the sea or slow death in philips prisons they asked no more than to embrace death for my sake many men have prayed to me for life ive refused em and slept none the worse after but when my men my tall fantastical young men beseech me on their knees for leave to die for me it shakes meah it shakes me to the marrow of my old bones her chest sounded like a board as she hit it she showed em all i told em that this was no time for open war with spain if by miracle inconceivable they prevailed against philips fleet philip would hold me accountable for englands sake to save war i should een be forced i told em so to give him up their young lives if they failed and again by some miracle escaped philips hand and crept back to england with their bare lives they must lieoh i told em allunder my sovereign displeasure she could not know them see them nor hear their names nor stretch out a finger to save them from the gallows if philip chose to ask it  be it the gallows then says the elder i could have wept but that my face was made for the day  either wayany waythis venture is death which i know you fear not but it is death with assured dishonour i cried  yet our queen will know in her heart what we have done says the younger sweetheart i said a queen has no heart  but she is a woman and a woman would not forget says the elder we will go they knelt at my feet  nay dear ladsbut here i said and i opened my arms to them and i kissed them  be ruled by me i said well hire some illfeatured old tarrybreeks of an admiral to watch the graveyard and you shall come to court  hire whom you please says the elder we are ruled by you body and soul and the younger who shook most when i kissed em says between his white lips i think you have power to make a god of a man  come to court and be sure oft i said  they shook their heads and i knewi knew that go they would if i had not kissed themperhaps i might have prevailed  then why did you do it said una i dont think you knew really what you wanted done  may it please your majestythe lady bowed her head lowthis gloriana whom i have represented for your pleasure was a woman and a queen remember her when you come to your kingdom  butdid the cousins go to the gascons graveyard said dan as una frowned  they went said the lady  did they ever come back una began butdid they stop king philips fleet dan interrupted  the lady turned to him eagerly  dyou think they did right to go she asked  i dont see what else they could have done dan replied after thinking it over  dyou think she did right to send em the ladys voice rose a little  well said dan i dont see what else she could have done eitherdo you how did they stop king philip from getting virginia  theres the sad part of it they sailed out that autumn from rye royal and there never came back so much as a single ropeyarn to show what had befallen them the winds blew and they were not does that make you alter your mind young burleigh i expect they were drowned then anyhow philip didnt score did he  gloriana wiped out her score with philip later but if philip had won would you have blamed gloriana for wasting those lads lives  of course not she was bound to try to stop him  the lady coughed you have the root of the matter in you were i queen id make you minister  we dont play that game said una who felt that she disliked the lady as much as she disliked the noise the high wind made tearing through willow shaw  play said the lady with a laugh and threw up her hands affectedly the sunshine caught the jewels on her many rings and made them flash till unas eyes dazzled and she had to rub them then she saw dan on his knees picking up the potatoes they had spilled at the gate  there wasnt anybody in the shaw after all he said didnt you think you saw someone  im most awfully glad there isnt said una then they went on with the potatoroast     the lookingglass  queen bess was harrys daughter       the queen was in her chamber and she was middling old      her petticoat was satin and her stomacher was gold      backwards and forwards and sideways did she pass      making up her mind to face the cruel lookingglass      the cruel lookingglass that will never show a lass      as comely or as kindly or as young as once she was       the queen was in her chamber acombing of her hair      there came queen marys spirit and it stood behind her chair      singing backwards and forwards and sideways you may pass      but i will stand behind you till you face the lookingglass      the cruel lookingglass that will never show a lass      as lovely or unlucky or as lonely as i was       the queen was in her chamber aweeping very sore      there came lord leicesters spirit and it scratched upon the door      singing backwards and forwards and sideways may you pass      but i will walk beside you till you face the lookingglass      the cruel lookingglass that will never show a lass      as hard and unforgiving or as wicked as you was       the queen was in her chamber her sins were on her head      she looked the spirits up and down and statelily she said      backwards and forwards and sideways though ive been      yet i am harrys daughter and i am englands queen      and she faced the lookingglass and whatever else there was      and she saw her day was over and she saw her beauty pass      in the cruel lookingglass that can always hurt a lass      more hard than any ghost there is or any man there was     the wrong thing     a truthful song          the bricklayer       i tell this tale which is strictly true      just by way of convincing you      how very little since things were made      things have altered in the building trade       a year ago come the middle o march      we was building flats near the marble arch      when a thin young man with coalblack hair      came up to watch us working there       now there wasnt a trick in brick or stone      that this young man hadnt seen or known      nor there wasnt a tool from trowel to maul      but this young man could use em all      then up and spoke the plumbyers bold      which was laying the pipes for the hot and cold      since you with us have made so free      will you kindly say what your name might be       the young man kindly answered them      it might be lot or methusalem      or it might be moses a man i hate      whereas it is pharaoh surnamed the great       your glazing is new and your plumbings strange      but otherwise i perceive no change      and in less than a month if you do as i bid      id learn you to build me a pyramid         the sailor       i tell this tale which is stricter true      just by way of convincing you      how very little since things was made      things have altered in the shipwrights trade       in blackwall basin yesterday      a china barque refitting lay      when a fat old man with snowwhite hair      came up to watch us working there       now there wasnt a knot which the riggers knew      but the old man made itand better too      nor there wasnt a sheet or a lift or a brace      but the old man knew its lead and place       then up and spake the caulkyers bold      which was packing the pump in the afterhold      since you with us have made so free      will you kindly tell what your name might be       the old man kindly answered them      it might be japhet it might be shem      or it might be ham though his skin was dark      whereas it is noah commanding the ark       your wheel is new and your pumps are strange      but otherwise i perceive no change      and in less than a week if she did not ground      id sail this hooker the wide world round         both we tell these tales which are strictest true etc     the wrong thing   dan had gone in for building model boats but after he had filled the schoolroom with chips which he expected una to clear away they turned him out of doors and he took all his tools up the hill to mr springetts yard where he knew he could make as much mess as he chose old mr springett was a builder contractor and sanitary engineer and his yard which opened off the village street was always full of interesting things at one end of it was a long loft reached by a ladder where he kept his ironbound scaffoldplanks tins of paints pulleys and odds and ends he had found in old houses he would sit here by the hour watching his carts as they loaded or unloaded in the yard below while dan gouged and grunted at the carpenters bench near the loft window mr springett and dan had always been particular friends for mr springett was so old he could remember when railways were being made in the southern counties of england and people were allowed to drive dogs in carts  one hot still afternoonthe tarpaper on the roof smelt like shipsdan in his shirtsleeves was smoothing down a new schooners bow and mr springett was talking of barns and houses he had built he said he never forgot any stick or stone he had ever handled or any man woman or child he had ever met just then he was very proud of the village hall at the entrance of the village which he had finished a few weeks before  an i dont mind tellin you mus dan he said that the hall will be my last job top of this mortal earth i didnt make ten poundsno nor yet fiveout o the whole contrac but my names lettered on the foundation stoneralph springett builderand the stone shes bedded on four foot good concrete if she shifts any time these five hundred years ill surely turn in my grave i told the lunnon architec so when he come down to oversee my work  what did he say dan was sandpapering the schooners port bow  nothing the hall aint more than one of his small jobs for him but taint small to me an my name is cut and lettered frontin the village street i do hope an pray for time everlastin youll want the little round file for that holler in her bow whos there mr springett turned stiffly in his chair  a long pile of scaffoldplanks ran down the centre of the loft dan looked and saw hal o the drafts touzled head beyond them see hal o the draft in puck of pooks hill  be you the builder of the village hall he asked of mr springett  i be was the answer but if you want a job  hal laughed no faithhe said only the hall is as good and honest a piece of work as ive ever run a rule over so being born hereabouts and being reckoned a master among masons and accepted as a master mason i made bold to pay my brotherly respects to the builder  aaum mr springett looked important i be a bit rusty but ill try ye  he asked hal several curious questions and the answers must have pleased him for he invited hal to sit down hal moved up always keeping behind the pile of planks so that only his head showed and sat down on a trestle in the dark corner at the back of mr springetts desk he took no notice of dan but talked at once to mr springett about bricks and cement and lead and glass and after a while dan went on with his work he knew mr springett was pleased because he tugged his white sandy beard and smoked his pipe in short puffs the two men seemed to agree about everything but when grownups agree they interrupt each other almost as much as if they were quarrelling hal said something about workmen  why thats what i always say mr springett cried a man who can only do one thing hes but nextabovefool to the man that cant do nothin thats where the unions make their mistake  my thought to the very dot dan heard hal slap his tighthosed leg ive suffered in my time from these same guildsunions dyou call em all their precious talk of the mysteries of their tradeswhy what does it come to  nothin youve justabout hit it said mr springett and rammed his hot tobacco with his thumb  take the art of woodcarvinghal went on he reached across the planks grabbed a wooden mallet and moved his other hand as though he wanted something mr springett without a word passed him one of dans broad chisels ah woodcarving for example if you can cut wood and have a fair draft of what ye mean to do a heavens name take chisel and maul and let drive at it say i youll soon find all the mystery forsooth of woodcarving under your proper hand whack came the mallet on the chisel and a sliver of wood curled up in front of it mr springett watched like an old raven  all art is one manone said hal between whacks and to wait on another man to finish out  to finish out your work aint no sense mr springett cut in thats what im always sayin to the boy here he nodded towards dan thats what i said when i put the new wheel into brewsters mill in eighteen hundred seventytwo i reckoned i was millwright enough for the job thout bringin a man from lunnon an besides dividin work eats up profits no bounds  hal laughed his beautiful deep laugh and mr springett joined in till dan laughed too  you handle your tools i can see said mr springett i reckon if youre any way like me youve found yourself hindered by thoseguilds did you call emunions we say  you may say so hal pointed to a white scar on his cheekbone this is a remembrance from the master watchingforeman of masons on magdalen tower because please you i dared to carve stone without their leave they said a stone had slipped from the cornice by accident  i know them accidents theres no way to disprove em an stones aint the only things that slip mr springett grunted hal went on  ive seen a scaffoldplank keckle and shoot a tooclever workman thirty foot on to the cold chancel floor below and a rope can break yes natural as nature an limell fly up in a mans eyes without any breath o wind sometimes said mr springett but whos to show twasnt a accident  who do these things dan asked and straightened his back at the bench as he turned the schooner endforend in the vice to get at her counter  them which dont wish other men to work no better nor quicker than they do growled mr springett dont pinch her so hard in the vice mus dan put a piece o rag in the jaws or youll bruise her more than thathe turned towards halif a man has his private spite laid up against you the unions give him his excuse for workin it off  well i know itsaid hal  they never let you go them spiteful ones i knowed a plasterer in eighteen hundred sixtyonedown to the wells he was a frenchya bad enemy he was i had mine too he was an italian called benedetto i met him first at oxford on magdalen tower when i was learning my tradeor trades i should say a bad enemy he was as you say but he came to be my singular good friend said hal as he put down the mallet and settled himself comfortably  what might his trade have beenplastering mr springett asked  plastering of a sort he worked in stuccofresco we call it made pictures on plaster not but what he had a fine sweep of the hand in drawing hed take the long sides of a cloister trowel on his stuff and roll out his great allabroad pictures of saints and croppytopped trees quick as a webster unrolling cloth almost oh benedetto could draw but a was a littleminded man professing to be full of secrets of colour or plastercommon tricks all of emand his one single talk was how tom dick or harry had stole this or tother secret art from him  i know that sort said mr springett theres no keeping peace or making peace with such an theyre mostly born an bone idle  true even his fellowcountrymen laughed at his jealousy we two came to loggerheads early on magdalen tower i was a youngster then maybe i spoke my mind about his work  you shouldnt never do that mr springett shook his head that sort lay it up against you  true enough this benedetto did most specially body o me the man lived to hate me but i always kept my eyes open on a plank or a scaffold i was mighty glad to be shut of him when he quarrelled with his guild foreman and went off nose in air and paints under his arm buthal leaned forwardif you hate a man or a man hates you  i know youre everlastin running acrost him mr springett interrupted excuse me sir he leaned out of the window and shouted to a carter who was loading a cart with bricks  aint you no more sense than to heap em up that way he said take an throw a hundred of em off its more than the team can compass throw em off i tell you and make another trip for whats left over excuse me sir you was sayin  i was saying that before the end of the year i went to bury to strengthen the leadwork in the great abbey east window there  now thats just one of the things ive never done but i mind there was a cheap excursion to chichester in eighteen hundred seventynine an i went an watched em leadin a wonerful fine window in chichester cathedral i stayed watchin till twas time for us to go back dunno as i had two drinks praps all that day  hal smiled at bury then sure enough i met my enemy benedetto he had painted a picture in plaster on the south wall of the refectorya noble place for a noble thinga picture of jonah  ah jonah an his whale ive never been as far as bury youve worked about a lot said mr springett with his eyes on the carter below  no not the whale this was a picture of jonah and the pompion that withered but all that benedetto had shown was a peevish greybeard huggled up in angleedged drapery beneath a pompion on a wooden trellis this last being a dead thing hed drawn it as twere to the life but fierce old jonah bared in the sun angry even to death that his cold prophecy was disprovenjonah ashamed and already hearing the children of nineveh running to mock himah that was what benedetto had not drawn  he better ha stuck to his whale then said mr springett  hed ha done no better with that he draws the damp cloth off the picture an shows it to me i was a craftsman too dye see  tis good i said but it goes no deeper than the plaster  what he said in a whisper  be thy own judge benedetto i answered does it go deeper than the plaster  he reeled against a piece of dry wall no he says and i know it i could not hate thee more than i have done these five years but if i live i will try hal i will try then he goes away i pitied him but i had spoken truth his picture went no deeper than the plaster  ah said mr springett who had turned quite red you was talkin so fast i didnt understand what you was drivin at ive seen mengood workmen they wastry to do more than they could do andand they couldnt compass it they knowed it and it nigh broke their hearts like you was in your right o course sir to say what you thought o his work but if youll excuse me was you in your duty  i was wrong to say it hal replied god forgive mei was young he was workman enough himself to know where he failed but it all came evens in the long run by the same token did ye ever hear o one torrigianotorrisany we called him  i cant say i ever did was he a frenchy like  no a hectoring hardmouthed longsworded italian builder as vain as a peacock and as strong as a bull but mark you a master workman more than thathe could get his best work out of the worst men  which its a gift i had a foremanbricklayer like him once said mr springett he used to prod em in the back like with a pointingtrowel and they did wonders  ive seen our torrisany lay a prentice down with one buffet and raise him with anotherto make a mason of him i worked under him at building a chapel in londona chapel and a tomb for the king  i never knew kings went to chapel much said mr springett but i always hold with a mandont care who he beseein about his own grave before he dies tidnt the sort of thing to leave to your family after the wills read i reckon twas a fine vault  none finer in england this torrigiano had the contract for it as youd say he picked master craftsmen from all partsengland france italy the low countriesno odds to him so long as they knew their work and he drove them likelike pigs at brightling fair he called us english all pigs we suffered it because he was a master in his craft if he misliked any work that a man had done with his own great hands hed rive it out and tear it down before us all ah you pigyou english pig hed scream in the dumb wretchs face you answer me you look at me you think at me come out with me into the cloisters i will teach you carving myself i will gild you all over but when his passion had blown out hed slip his arm round the mans neck and impart knowledge worth gold twould have done your heart good mus springett to see the two hundred of us masons jewellers carvers gilders ironworkers and the restall toiling like cockangels and this mad italian hornet fleeing one to next up and down the chapel done your heart good it would  i believe you said mr springett in eighteen hundred fiftyfour i mind the railway was bein made into hastins there was two thousand navvies on itall youngall strongan i was one of em oh dearie me excuse me sir but was your enemy workin with you  benedetto be sure he was he followed me like a lover he painted pictures on the chapel ceilingslung from a chair torrigiano made us promise not to fight till the work should be finished we were both master craftsmen do ye see and he needed us none the less i never went aloft to carve thout testing all my ropes and knots each morning we were never far from each other benedetto ud sharpen his knife on his sole while he waited for his plaster to drywheet wheet wheet id hear it where i hung chipping round a pillarhead and wed nod to each other friendlylike oh he was a craftsman was benedetto but his hate spoiled his eye and his hand i mind the night i had finished the models for the bronze saints round the tomb torrigiano embraced me before all the chapel and bade me to supper i met benedetto when i came out he was slavering in the porch like a mad dog  workin himself up to it said mr springett did he have it in at ye that night  no no that time he kept his oath to torrigiano but i pitied him eh well now i come to my own follies i had never thought too little of myself but after torrisany had put his arm round my neck iihal broke into a laughi lay there was not much odds twixt me and a cocksparrow in his pride  i was pretty middlin young once on a time said mr springett  then ye know that a man cant drink and dice and dress fine and keep company above his station but his work suffers for it mus springett  i never held much with dressin up butyoure right the worst mistakes i ever made they was made of a monday morning mr springett answered weve all been one sort of fool or tother mus dan mus dan take the smallest gouge or youll be spluttin her stem works clean out cant ye see the grain of the wood dont favour a chisel  ill spare you some of my follies but there was a man called brygandynebob brygandyneclerk of the kings ships a little smooth bustling atomy as clever as a woman to get work done for nothina wonerful smoothtongued pleader he made much o me and asked me to draft him out a drawing a piece of carved and gilt scrollwork for the bows of one of the kings shipsthe sovereign was her name  was she a manofwarasked dan  she was a warship and a woman called catherine of castile desired the king to give her the ship for a pleasureship of her own i did not know at the time but shed been at bob to get this scrollwork done and fitted that the king might see it i made him the picture in an hour all of a heat after supperone great heaving play of dolphins and a neptune or so reining in webbyfooted seahorses and arion with his harp high atop of them it was twentythree foot long and maybe nine foot deeppainted and gilt  it must ha justabout looked fine said mr springett  thats the curiosity of it twas badrank bad in my conceit i must needs show it to torrigiano in the chapel he straddles his legs hunches his knife behind him and whistles like a stormcock through a sleetshower benedetto was behind him we were never far apart ive told you  that is pigs work says our master swines work you make any more such things even after your fine court suppers and you shall be sent away  benedetto licks his lips like a cat it is so bad then master he says what a pity  yes says torrigiano scarcely you could do things so bad i will condescend to show  he talks to me then and there no shouting no swearing it was too bad for that but good memorable counsel bitten in slowly then he sets me to draft out a pair of iron gates to take as he said the taste of my naughty dolphins out of my mouth irons sweet stuff if you dont torture her and hammered work is all pure truthful line with a reason and a support for every curve and bar of it a week at that settled my stomach handsomely and the master let me put the work through the smithy where i sweated out more of my foolish pride  good stuff is good iron said mr springett i done a pair of lodge gates once in eighteen hundred sixtythree  oh i forgot to say that bob brygandyne whipped away my draft of the ships scrollwork and would not give it back to me to redraw he said twould do well enough howsoever my lawful work kept me too busied to remember him body o me but i worked that winter upon the gates and the bronzes for the tomb as id never worked before i was leaner than a lath but i livedi lived then hal looked at mr springett with his wise crinkledup eyes and the old man smiled back  ouch dan cried he had been hollowing out the schooners afterdeck the little gouge had slipped and gashed the ball of his left thumban ugly triangular tear  that came of not steadying your wrist said hal calmly dont bleed over the wood do your work with your hearts blood but no need to let it show he rose and peered into a corner of the loft  mr springett had risen too and swept down a ball of cobwebs from a rafter  clap that on was all he said and put your handkerchief atop twill cake over in a minute it dont hurt now do it  no said dan indignantly you know it has happened lots of times ill tie it up myself go on sir  and itll happen hundreds of times more said hal with a friendly nod as he sat down again but he did not go on till dans hand was tied up properly then he said  one dark december daytoo dark to judge colourwe was all sitting and talking round the fires in the chapel you heard good talk there when bob brygandyne bustles in andhal youre sent for he squeals i was at torrigianos feet on a pile of putlocks as i might be here toasting a herring on my knifes point twas the one english thing our master likedsalt herring  im busy about my art i calls   art says bob whats art compared to your scrollwork for the sovereign come  be sure your sins will find you out says torrigiano go with him and see as i followed bob out i was aware of benedetto like a black spot when the eyes are tired sliddering up behind me  bob hurries through the streets in the raw fog slips into a doorway up stairs along passages and at last thrusts me into a little cold room vilely hung with flemish tapestries and no furnishing except a table and my draft of the sovereigns scrollwork here he leaves me presently comes in a dark longnosed man in a fur cap  master harry dawe said he  the same i says where a plague has bob brygandyne gone  his thin eyebrows surged up in a piece and come down again in a stiff bar he went to the king he says  all one wheres your pleasure with me i says shivering for it was mortal cold  he lays his hand flat on my draft master dawe he says do you know the present price of gold leaf for all this wicked gilding of yours  by that i guessed he was some cheeseparing clerk or other of the kings ships so i gave him the price i forget it now but it worked out to thirty poundscarved gilt and fitted in place  thirty pounds he said as though i had pulled a tooth of him you talk as though thirty pounds was to be had for the asking none the less he says your drafts a fine piece of work  id been looking at it ever since i came in and twas viler even than i judged it at first my eye and hand had been purified the past months dye see by my iron work  i could do it better now i said the more i studied my squabby neptunes the less i liked em and arion was a pure flaming shame atop of the unbalanced dolphins  i doubt it will be fresh expense to draft it again he says  bob never paid me for the first draft i lay hell never pay me for the second twill cost the king nothing if i redraw it i says  theres a woman wishes it to be done quickly he says well stick to your first drawing master dawe but thirty pounds is thirty pounds you must make it less  and all the while the faults in my draft fair leaped out and hit me between the eyes at any cost i thinks to myself i must get it back and redraft it he grunts at me impatiently and a splendid thought comes to me which shall save me by the same token it was quite honest  they aint always says mr springett how did you get out of it  by the truth i says to master fur cap as i might to you here i says ill tell you something since you seem a knowledgeable man is the sovereign to lie in thames river all her days or will she take the high seas  oh he says quickly the king keeps no cats that dont catch mice she must sail the seas master dawe shell be hired to merchants for the trade shell be out in all shapes o weathers does that make any odds  why then says i the first heavy sea she sticks her nose intoll claw off half that scrollwork and the next will finish it if shes meant for a pleasureship give me my draft again and ill porture you a pretty light piece of scrollwork good cheap if shes meant for the opensea pitch the draft into the fire she can never carry that weight on her bows  he looks at me squintlings and plucks his underlip  is this your honest unswayed opinion he says  body o me ask about i says any seaman could tell you tis true im advising you against my own profit but why i do so is my own concern  not altogether  he says its some of mine youve saved me thirty pounds master dawe and youve given me good arguments to use against a willful woman that wants my fine new ship for her own toy well not have any scrollwork his face shined with pure joy  then see that the thirty pounds youve saved on it are honestly paid the king i says and keep clear o womenfolk i gathered up my draft and crumpled it under my arm if thats all you need of me ill be gone i says im pressed  he turns him round and fumbles in a corner too pressed to be made a knight sir harry he says and comes at me smiling with threequarters of a rusty sword  i pledge you my mark i never guessed it was the king till that moment i kneeled and he tapped me on the shoulder  rise up sir harry dawe he says and in the same breath im pressed too and slips through the tapestries leaving me like a stuck calf  it come over me in a bitter wave like that here was i a master craftsman who had worked no bounds soul or body to make the kings tomb and chapel a triumph and a glory for all time and here dye see i was made knight not for anything id slaved over or given my heart and guts to but expressedly because id saved him thirty pounds and a tonguelashing from catherine of castilleshe that had asked for the ship that thought shrivelled me with insides while i was folding away my draft on the heels of itmaybe youll see whyi began to grin to myself i thought of the earnest simplicity of the manthe king i should saybecause id saved him the money his smile as though hed won half france i thought of my own silly pride and foolish expectations that some day hed honour me as a master craftsman i thought of the brokentipped sword hed found behind the hangings the dirt of the cold room and his cold eye wrapped up in his own concerns scarcely resting on me then i remembered the solemn chapel roof and the bronzes about the stately tomb hed lie in anddye seethe unreason of it allthe mad high humour of it alltook hold on me till i sat me down on a dark stairhead in a passage and laughed till i could laugh no more what else could i have done  i never heard his feet behind mehe always walked like a catbut his arm slid round my neck pulling me back where i sat till my head lay on his chest and his left hand held the knife plumb over my heartbenedetto even so i laughedthe fit was beyond my holdinglaughed while he ground his teeth in my ear he was stark crazed for the time  laugh he said finish the laughter ill not cut ye short tell me nowhe wrenched at my headwhy the king chose to honour youyouyouyou lickspittle englishman i am full of patience now i have waited so long then he was off at score about his jonah in bury refectory and what id said of it and his pictures in the chapel which all men praised and none looked at twice as if that was my fault and a whole parcel of words and looks treasured up against me through years  ease off your arm a little i said i cannot die by choking for i am just dubbed knight benedetto  tell me and ill confess ye sir harry dawe knight theres a long night before ye tell says he  so i told himhis chin on my crowntold him all told it as well and with as many words as i have ever told a tale at a supper with torrigiano i knew benedetto would understand for mad or sad he was a craftsman i believed it to be the last tale id ever tell top of mortal earth and i would not put out bad work before i left the lodge all arts one art as i said i bore benedetto no malice my spirits dye see were catched up in a high solemn exaltation and i saw all earths vanities foreshortened and little laid out below me like a town from a cathedral scaffolding i told him what befell and what i thought of it i gave him the kings very voice at master dawe youve saved me thirty pounds his peevish grunt while he looked for the sword and how the badgereyed figures of glory and victory leered at me from the flemish hangings body o me twas a fine noble tale and as i thought my last work on earth  that is how i was honoured by the king i said theyll hang ye for killing me benedetto and since youve killed in the kings palace theyll draw and quarter you but youre too mad to care grant me though ye never heard a better tale he said nothing but i felt him shake my head on his chest shook his right arm fell away his left dropped the knife and he leaned with both hands on my shouldershakingshaking i turned me round no need to put my foot on his knife the man was speechless with laughterhonest craftsmans mirth the first time id ever seen him laugh you know the mirth that cuts off the very breath while ye stamp and snatch at the short ribs that was benedettos case  when he began to roar and bay and whoop in the passage i haled him out into the street and there we leaned against the wall and had it all over againwaving our hands and wagging our headstill the watch came to know if we were drunk  benedetto says to em solemn as an owl you have saved me thirty pounds mus dawe and off he pealed in some sort we were maddrunki because dear life had been given back to me and he because as he said afterwards because the old crust of hatred round his heart was broke up and carried away by laughter his very face had changed too  hal he cries i forgive thee forgive me too hal oh you english you english did it gall thee hal to see the rust on the dirty sword tell me again hal how the king grunted with joy oh let us tell the master  so we reeled back to the chapel arms round each others necks and when we could speakhe thought wed been fightingwe told the master yes we told torrigiano and he laughed till he rolled on the new cold pavement then he knocked our heads together  ah you english he cried you are more than pigs you are english now you are well punished for your dirty fishes put the draft in the fire and never do so any more you are a fool hal and you are a fool benedetto but i need your works to please this beautiful english king  and i meant to kill hal says benedetto master i meant to kill him because the english king had made him a knight  ah says the master shaking his finger benedetto if you had killed my hal i should have killed youin the cloister but you are a craftsman too so i should have killed you like a craftsman very very slowlyin an hour if i could spare the time that was torrigianothe master  mr springett sat quite still for some time after hal had finished then he turned dark red then he rocked to and fro then he coughed and wheezed till the tears ran down his face dan knew by this that he was laughing but it surprised hal at first  excuse me sir said mr springett but i was thinkin of some stables i built for a gentleman in eighteen hundred seventyfour they was stables in blue brickvery particular work dunno as they werent the best job which ever id done but the gentlemans ladyshed come from lunnon new marriedshe was all for buildin what was called a hawhawwhat you an me ud call a dikright acrost his park a middlin big job which id have had the contract of for she spoke to me in the library about it but i told her there was a line o springs just where she wanted to dig her ditch an shed flood the park if she went on  were there any springs at all said hal  bound to be springs everywhere if you dig deep enough aint there but what i said about the springs put her out o conceit o diggin hawhaws an she took an built a white tile dairy instead but when i sent in my last bill for the stables the gentleman he paid it thout even lookin at it and i hadnt forgotten nothin i do assure you more than that he slips two fivepound notes into my hand in the

pounds for savin him a hem of a deal o trouble at home i reckon things are pretty much alike all times in all places  hal and he laughed together dan couldnt quite understand what they thought so funny and went on with his work for some time without speaking  when he looked up mr springett alone was wiping his eyes with his greenandyellow pockethandkerchief  bless me mus dan ive been asleep he said an ive dreamed a dream which has made me laughlaugh as i aint laughed in a long day i cant remember what twas all about but they do say that when old men take to laughin in their sleep theyre middlin ripe for the next world have you been workin honest mus dan  raather said dan unclamping the schooner from the vice and look how ive cut myself with the small gouge  yees you want a lump o cobwebs to that said mr springett oh i see youve put it on already thats right mus dan     king henry vii and the shipwrights    harry our king in england from london town is gone   and comen to hamull on the hoke in the countie of suthampton   for there lay the mary of the tower his ship of war so strong   and he would discover certaynely if his shipwrights did him wrong    he told not none of his setting forth nor yet where he would go   but only my lord of arundel and meanly did he show   in an old jerkin and patched hose that no man might him mark   with his frieze hood and cloak about he looked like any clerk   he was at hamull on the hoke about the hour of the tide   and saw the mary haled into dock the winter to abide   with all her tackle and habiliments which are the king his own   but then ran on his false shipwrights and stripped her to the bone    they heaved the mainmast overboard that was of a trusty tree   and they wrote down it was spent and lost by force of weather at sea   but they sawen it into planks and strakes as far as it might go   to maken beds for their own wives and little children also    there was a knave called slingawai he crope beneath the deck   crying good felawes come and see  the ship is nigh a wreck   for the storm that took our tall mainmast it blew so fierce and fell   alack  it hath taken the kettles and pans and this brass pott as well    with that he set the pott on his head and hied him up the hatch   while all the shipwrights ran below to find what they might snatch   all except bob brygandyne and he was a yeoman good   he caught slingawai round the waist and threw him on to the mud    i have taken plank and rope and nail without the king his leave   after the custom of portesmouth but i will not suffer a thief   nay never lift up thy hand at me  theres no clean hands in the trade   steal in measure quo brygandyne  theres measure in all things made    gramercy yeoman said our king  thy counsel liketh me   and he pulled a whistle out of his neck and whistled whistles three   then came my lord of arundel pricking across the down   and behind him the mayor and burgesses of merry suthampton town    they drew the naughty shipwrights up with the kettles in their hands   and bound them round the forecastle to wait the kings commands   but since ye have made your beds said the king ye needs must lie   thereon   for the sake of your wives and little onesfelawes get you gone    when they had beaten slingawai out of his own lips   our king appointed brygandyne to be clerk of all his ships   nay never lift up thy hands to metheres no clean hands in the trade   but steal in measuresaid harry our king  theres measure in all things   made    god speed the mary of the tower the sovereign and grace dieu   the sweepstakes and the mary fortune and the henry of bristol too   all tall ships that sail on the sea or in our harbours stand   that they may keep measure with harry our king and peace in engeland     marklake witches     the way through the woods        they shut the road through the woods      seventy years ago      weather and rain have undone it again      and now you would never know      there was once a road through the woods      before they planted the trees      it is underneath the coppice and heath      and the thin anemones      only the keeper sees      that where the ringdove broods      and the badgers roll at ease      there was once a road through the woods       yet if you enter the woods      of a summer evening late      when the nightair cools on the troutringed pools      where the otter whistles his mate      they fear not men in the woods      because they see so few      you will hear the beat of a horses feet      and the swish of a skirt in the dew      steadily cantering through      the misty solitudes      as though they perfectly knew      the old lost road through the woods      but there is no road through the woods     marklake witches   when dan took up boatbuilding una coaxed mrs vincey the farmers wife at little lindens to teach her to milk mrs vincey milks in the pasture in summer which is different from milking in the shed because the cows are not tied up and until they know you they will not stand still after three weeks una could milk red cow or kitty shorthorn quite dry without her wrists aching and then she allowed dan to look but milking did not amuse him and it was pleasanter for una to be alone in the quiet pastures with quietspoken mrs vincey so evening after evening she slipped across to little lindens took her stool from the fernclump beside the fallen oak and went to work her pail between her knees and her head pressed hard into the cows flank as often as not mrs vincey would be milking cross pansy at the other end of the pasture and would not come near till it was time to strain and pour off  once in the middle of a milking kitty shorthorn boxed unas ear with her tail  you old pig said una nearly crying for a cows tail can hurt  why didnt you tie it down child said a voice behind her  i meant to but the flies are so bad i let her offand this is what shes done una looked round expecting puck and saw a curlyhaired girl not much taller than herself but older dressed in a curious highwaisted lavendercoloured ridinghabit with a high hunched collar and a deep cape and a belt fastened with a steel clasp she wore a yellow velvet cap and tan gauntlets and carried a real huntingcrop her cheeks were pale except for two pretty pink patches in the middle and she talked with little gasps at the end of her sentences as though she had been running  you dont milk so badly child she said and when she smiled her teeth showed small and even and pearly  can you milk una asked and then flushed for she heard pucks chuckle  he stepped out of the fern and sat down holding kitty shorthorns tail there isnt much he said that miss philadelphia doesnt know about milkor for that matter butter and eggs shes a great housewife  oh said una im sorry i cant shake hands mine are all milky but mrs vincey is going to teach me buttermaking this summer ah im going to london this summer the girl said to my aunt in bloomsbury she coughed as she began to hum oh what a town what a wonderful metropolis  youve got a cold said una  no only my stupid cough but its vastly better than it was last winter it will disappear in london air every one says so dyou like doctors child  i dont know any una replied but im sure i shouldnt  think yourself lucky child i beg your pardon the girl laughed for una frowned  im not a child and my names unashe said  mines philadelphia but everybody except rene calls me phil im squire bucksteeds daughterover at marklake yonder she jerked her little round chin towards the south behind dallington surely you know marklake  we went a picnic to marklake green once said una its awfully pretty i like all those funny little roads that dont lead anywhere  they lead over our land

french of course but i dont mind mamselle shes rather decent is rene your french governess  philadelphia laughed till she caught her breath again  oh no renes a french prisoneron parole that means hes promised not to escape till he has been properly exchanged for an englishman hes only a doctor so i hope they wont think him worth exchanging my uncle captured him last year in the ferdinand privateer off belle isle and he cured my uncle of a rrraging toothache of course after that we couldnt let him lie among the common french prisoners at rye and so he stays with us hes of very old familya breton which is nearly next door to being a true briton my father saysand he wears his hair clubbednot powdered much more becoming dont you think  i dont know what youre una began but puck the other side of the pail winked and she went on with her milking hes going to be a great french physician when the war is over he makes me bobbins for my lacepillow nowhes very clever with his hands but hed doctor our people on the green if they would let him only our doctordoctor breaksays hes an empor imp somethingworse than imposter but my nurse says  nurse youre ever so old what have you got a nurse for una finished milking and turned round on her stool as kitty shorthorn grazed off  because i cant get rid of her old cissie nursed my mother and she says shell nurse me till she dies the idea she never lets me alone she thinks im delicate she has grown infirm in her understanding you know madquite mad poor cissie   really mad said una or just silly  crazy i should sayfrom the things she does her devotion to me is terribly embarrassing you know i have all the keys of the hall except the brewery and the tenants kitchen i give out all stores and the linen and plate  how jolly i love storerooms and giving out things  ah its a great responsibility youll find when you come to my age last year dad said i was fatiguing myself with my duties and he actually wanted me to give up the keys to old amoore our housekeeper i wouldnt i hate her i said no sir i am mistress of marklake hall just as long as i live because im never going to be married and i shall give out stores and linen till i die  and what did your father say  oh i threatened to pin a dishclout to his coattail he ran away every ones afraid of dad except me philadelphia stamped her foot the idea if i cant make my own father happy in his own house id like to meet the woman that can andandid have the living hide off her  she cut with her longthonged whip it cracked like a pistolshot across the still pasture kitty shorthorn threw up her head and trotted away  i beg your pardon philadelphia said but it makes me furious dont you hate those ridiculous old quizzes with their feathers and fronts who come to dinner and call you child in your own chair at your own table  i dont always come to dinner said una but i hate being called child please tell me about storerooms and giving out things  ah its a great responsibilityparticularly with that old cat amoore looking at the lists over your shoulder and such a shocking thing happened last summer poor crazy cissie my nurse that i was telling you of she took three solid silver tablespoons  took but isnt that stealing una cried  hsh said philadelphia looking round at puck all i say is she took them without my leave i made it right afterwards so as dad saysand hes a magistrate it wasnt a legal offence it was only compounding a felony  it sounds awful said una  it was my dear i was furious i had had the keys for ten months and id never lost anything before i said nothing at first because a big house offers so many chances of things being mislaid and coming to hand later fetching up in the leescuppers my uncle calls it but next week i spoke to old cissie about it when she was doing my hair at night and she said i wasnt to worry my heart for trifles  isnt it like em una burst out they see youre worried over something that really matters and they say dont worry as if that did any good  i quite agree with you my dear quite agree with you i told ciss the spoons were solid silver and worth forty shillings so if the thief were found hed be tried for his life hanged do you meanuna said  they ought to be but dad says no jury will hang a man nowadays for a fortyshilling theft they transport em into penal servitude at the uttermost ends of the earth beyond the seas for the term of their natural life i told cissie that and i saw her tremble in my mirror then she cried and caught hold of my knees and i couldnt for my life understand what it was all aboutshe cried so can you guess my dear what that poor crazy thing had done it was midnight before i pieced it together she had given the spoons to jerry gamm the witchmaster on the green so that he might put a charm on me me  put a charm on you why  thats what i asked and then i saw how mad poor cissie was you know this stupid little cough of mine it will disappear as soon as i go to london she was troubled about that and about my being so thin and she told me jerry had promised her if she would bring him three silver spoons that hed charm my cough away and make me plumpflesh up she said i couldnt help laughing but it was a terrible night i had to put cissie into my own bed and stroke her hand till she cried herself to sleep what else could i have done when she woke and i coughedi suppose i can cough in my own room if i pleaseshe said that shed killed me and asked me to have her hanged at lewes sooner than send her to the uttermost ends of the earth away from me  how awful what did you do phil  do i rode off at five in the morning to talk to master jerry with a new lash on my whip oh i was furious witchmaster or no witchmaster i meant to  ah whats a witchmaster  a master of witches of course i dont believe there are witches but people say every village has a few and jerry was the master of all ours at marklake he has been a smuggler and a manofwars man and now he pretends to be a carpenter and joinerhe can make almost anythingbut he really is a white wizard he cures people by herbs and charms he can cure them after doctor break has given them up and thats why doctor break hates him so he used to make me toy carts and charm off my warts when i was a child philadelphia spread out her hands with the delicate shiny little nails it isnt counted lucky to cross him he has his ways of getting even with you they say but i wasnt afraid of jerry i saw him working in his garden and i leaned out of my saddle and doublethonged him between the shoulders over the hedge well my dear for the first time since dad gave him to me my troubadour i wish you could see the sweet creature shied across the road and i spilled out into the hedgetop most undignified jerry pulled me through to his side and brushed the leaves off me i was horribly pricked but i didnt care now jerry i said im going to take the hide off you first and send you to lewes afterwards you well know why  oh he said and he sat down among his beehives then i reckon youve come about old cissies business my dear i reckon i justabout have i said stand away from these hives i cant get at you there thats why i be where i be he said if youll excuse me miss phil i dont hold with bein flogged before breakfast at my time o life hes a huge big man but he looked so comical squatting among the hives thati know i oughtnt toi laughed and he laughed i always laugh at the wrong time but i soon recovered my dignity and i said then give me back what you made poor cissie steal  your pore cissie he said shes a hatful o trouble but you shall have em miss phil theyre all ready put by for you and would you believe it the old sinner pulled my three silver spoons out of his dirty pocket and polished them on his cuff here they be he says and he gave them to me just as cool as though id come to have my warts charmed thats the worst of people having known you when you were young but i preserved my composure jerry i said what in the world are we to do if youd been caught with these things on you youd have been hanged  i know it he said but theyre yours now  but you made my cissie steal them i said  that i didnt he said your cissie she was pickin at me an tarrifyin me all the long day an every day for weeks to put a charm on you miss phil an take away your little spitty cough  yes i knew that jerry and to make me fleshup i said im much obliged to you but im not one of your pigs  ah i reckon sheve been talking to you then he said yes she give me no peace and bein tarrifiedfor i dont hold with old womeni laid a task on her which i thought ud silence her i never reckoned the old scrattle ud risk her neckbone at lewes assizes for your sake miss phil but she did she up an stole i tell ye as cheerful as a tinker you might ha knocked me down with any one of them liddle spoons when she brung em in her apron  do you mean to say then that you did it to try my poor cissie i screamed at him  what else for dearie he said i dont stand in need of hedgestealings im a freeholder with money in the bank and now i wont trust women no more silly old besom i do beleft shed ha stole the squires big fobwatch if id required her  then youre a wicked wicked old man i said and i was so angry that i couldnt help crying and of course that made me cough  jerry was in a fearful taking he picked me up and carried me into his cottageits full of foreign curiositiesand he got me something to eat and drink and he said hed be hanged by the neck any day if it pleased me he said hed even tell old cissie he was sorry thats a great comedown for a witchmaster you know  i was ashamed of myself for being so silly and i dabbed my eyes and said the least you can do now is to give poor ciss some sort of a charm for me  yes thats only fair dealings he said you know the names of the twelve apostles dearie you say them names one by one before your open window rain or storm wet or shine five times a day fasting but mind you twixt every name you draw in your breath through your nose right down to your pretty liddle toes as long and as deep as you can and let it out slow through your pretty liddle mouth theres virtue for your cough in those names spoke that way and ill give you something you can see moreover heres a stick of maple which is the warmest tree in the wood thats true una interrupted you can feel it almost as warm as yourself when you touch it  its cut one inch long for your every year jerry said thats sixteen inches you set it in your window so that it holds up the sash and thus you keep it rain or shine or wet or fine day and night ive said words over it which will have virtue on your complaints  i havent any complaints jerry i said its only to please cissie  i know that as well as you do dearie he said andand that was all that came of my going to give him a flogging i wonder whether he made poor troubadour shy when i lashed at him jerry has his ways of getting even with people  i wonder said una well did you try the charm did it work  what nonsense i told rene about it of course because hes a doctor hes going to be a most famous doctor thats why our doctor hates him rene said oho your master gamm he is worth knowing and he put up his eyebrowslike this he made joke of it all he can see my window from the carpenters shed where he works and if ever the maple stick fell down he pretended to be in a fearful taking till i propped the window up again he used to ask me whether i had said my apostles properly and how i took my deep breaths oh yes and the next day though he had been there ever so many times before he put on his new hat and paid jerry gamm a visit of stateas a fellowphysician jerry never guessed rene was making fun of him and so he told rene about the sick people in the village and how he cured them with herbs after doctor break had given them up jerry could talk smugglers french of course and i had taught rene plenty of english if only he wasnt so shy they called each other monsieur gamm and mosheur lanark just like gentlemen i suppose it amused poor rene he hasnt much to do except to fiddle about in the carpenters shop hes like all the french prisonersalways making knickknacks and jerry had a little lathe at his cottage and soand sorene took to being with jerry much more than i approved of the hall is so big and empty when dads away and i will not sit with old amooreshe talks so horridly about every onespecially about rene  i was rude to rene im afraid but i was properly served out for it one always is you see dad went down to hastings to pay his respects to the general who commanded the brigade there and to bring him to the hall afterwards dad told me he was a very brave soldier from indiahe was colonel of dads regiment the thirtythird foot after dad left the army and then he changed his name from wesley to wellesley or else the other way about and dad said i was to get out all the silver for him and i knew that meant a big dinner so i sent down to the sea for early mackerel and had such a morning in the kitchen and the storerooms old amoore nearly cried  however my dear i made all my preparations in ample time but the fish didnt arriveit never doesand i wanted rene to ride to pevensey and bring it himself he had gone over to jerry of course as he always used unless i requested his presence beforehand i cant send for rene every time i want him he should be there now dont you ever do what i did child because its in the highest degree unladylike butbut one of our woods runs up to jerrys garden and if you climbits ungenteel but i can climb like a kittentheres an old hollow oak just above the pigsty where you can hear and see everything below truthfully i only went to tell rene about the mackerel but i saw him and jerry sitting on the seat playing with wooden toy trumpets so i slipped into the hollow and choked down my cough and listened rene had never shown me any of these trumpets  trumpets arent you too old for trumpets said una  they werent real trumpets because jerry opened his shortcollar and rene put one end of his trumpet against jerrys chest and put his ear to the other then jerry put his trumpet against renes chest and listened while rene breathed and coughed i was afraid i would cough too  this hollywood one is the best said jerry tis wonerful like hearin a mans soul whisperin in his innards but unless ive a buzzin in my ears mosheur lanark you make much about the same kind o noises as old gaffer macklinbut not quite so loud as young copper it sounds like breakers on a reefa long way off comprenny  perfectly said rene i drive on the breakers but before i strike i shall save hundreds thousands millions perhaps by my little trumpets now tell me what sounds the old gaffer macklin have made in his chest and what the young copper also  jerry talked for nearly a quarter of an hour about sick people in the village while rene asked questions then he sighed and said you explain very well monsieur gamm but if only i had your opportunities to listen for myself do you think these poor people would let me listen to them through my trumpetfor a little money norenes as poor as a church mouse  theyd kill you mosheur its all i can do to coax em to abide it and im jerry gamm said jerry hes very proud of his attainments  then these poor people are alarmedno said rene  theyve had it in at me for some time back because o my tryin your trumpets on their sick and i reckon by the talk at the alehouse they wont stand much more tom dunch an some of his kidney was drinkin themselves riotripe when i passed along after noon charms an mutterins an bits o red wool an black hens is in the way o nature to these fools mosheur but anything likely to do em real service is devils work by their estimation if i was you id go home before they come jerry spoke quite quietly and rene shrugged his shoulders  i am prisoner on parole monsieur gamm he said i have no home  now that was unkind of rene hes often told me that he looked on england as his home i suppose its french politeness  then well talk o something that matters said jerry not to name no names mosheur lanark what might be your own opinion o some one who aint old gaffer macklin nor young copper is that person better or worse  betterfor time that is said rene he meant for the time being but i never could teach him some phrases  i thought so too said jerry but how about time to come  rene shook his head and then he blew his nose you dont know how odd a man looks blowing his nose when you are sitting directly above him  ive thought that too said jerry he rumbled so deep i could scarcely catch it dont make much odds to me because im old but youre young mosheuryoure young and he put his hand on renes knee and rene covered it with his hand i didnt know they were such friends  thank you mon ami said rene i am much oblige let us return to our trumpetmaking but i forgethe stood upit appears that you receive this afternoon  you cant see into gamms lane from the oak but the gate opened and fat little doctor break stumped in mopping his head and halfadozen of our people following him very drunk  you ought to have seen rene bow he does it beautifully  a word with you laennec said doctor break jerry has been practising some devilry or other on these poor wretches and theyve asked me to be arbiter  whatever that means i reckon its safer than asking you to be doctor said jerry and tom dunch one of our carters laughed  that aint right feeling of you tom jerry said seeing how clever doctor break put away your thorn in the flesh last winter toms wife had died at christmas though doctor break bled her twice a week doctor break danced with rage  this is all beside the mark he said these good people are willing to testify that youve been impudently prying into gods secrets by means of some papistical contrivance which this personhe pointed to poor renehas furnished you with why here are the things themselves rene was holding a trumpet in his hand  then all the men talked at once they said old gaffer macklin was dying from stitches in his side where jerry had put the trumpetthey called it the devils earpiece and they said it left round red witchmarks on peoples skins and dried up their lights and made em spit blood and threw em into sweats terrible things they said you never heard such a noise i took advantage of it to cough  rene and jerry were standing with their backs to the pigsty jerry fumbled in his big flap pockets and fished up a pair of pistols you ought to have seen the men give back when he cocked his he passed one to rene  wait wait said rene i will explain to the doctor if he permits he waved a trumpet at him and the men at the gate shouted dont touch it doctor dont lay a hand to the thing  come come said rene you are not so big fool as you pretend no  doctor break backed toward the gate watching jerrys pistol and rene followed him with his trumpet like a nurse trying to amuse a child and put the ridiculous thing to his ear to show how it was used and talked of la gloire and lhumanite and la science while doctor break watched jerrys pistol and swore i nearly laughed aloud  now listen now listen said rene this will be moneys in your pockets my dear confrere you will become rich  then doctor break said something about adventurers who could not earn an honest living in their own country creeping into decent houses and taking advantage of gentlemens confidence to enrich themselves by base intrigues  rene dropped his absurd trumpet and made one of his best bows i knew he was angry from the way he rolled his rs  verrry good said he for that i shall have much pleasure to kill you now and here monsieur gammanother bow to jerryyou will please lend him your pistol or he shall have mine i give you my word i know not which is best and if he will choose a second from his friends over thereanother bow to our drunken yokels at the gatewe will commence  thats fair enough said jerry tom dunch you owe it to the doctor to be his second place your man no said tom no mixin in gentrys quarrels for me and he shook his head and went out and the others followed him  hold on said jerry youve forgot what you set out to do up at the alehouse just now you was goin to search me for witchmarks you was goin to duck me in the pond you was goin to drag all my bits o sticks out o my little cottage here whats the matter with you wouldnt you like to be with your old woman tonight tom  but they didnt even look back much less come they ran to the village alehouse like hares  no matter for these canaille said rene buttoning up his coat so as not to show any linen all gentlemen do that before a duel dad saysand hes been out five times you shall be his second monsieur gamm give him the pistol  doctor break took it as if it was redhot but he said that if rene resigned his pretensions in certain quarters he would pass over the matter rene bowed deeper than ever  as for that he said if you were not the ignorant which you are you would have known long ago that the subject of your remarks is not for any living man  i dont know what the subject of his remarks might have been but he spoke in a simply dreadful voice my dear and doctor break turned quite white and said rene was a liar and then rene caught him by the throat and choked him black  well my dear as if this wasnt deliciously exciting enough just exactly at that minute i heard a strange voice on the other side of the hedge say whats this whats this bucksteed and there was my father and sir arthur wesley on horseback in the lane and there was rene kneeling on doctor break and there was i up in the oak listening with all my ears  i must have leaned forward too much and the voice gave me such a start that i slipped i had only time to make one jump on to the pigsty roofanother before the tiles broke on to the pigsty walland then i bounced down into the garden just behind jerry with my hair full of bark imagine the situation  oh i can una laughed till she nearly fell off the stool  dad said philadelphia and sir arthur wesley said good ged and jerry put his foot on the pistol rene had dropped but rene was splendid he never even looked at me he began to untwist doctor breaks neckcloth as fast as hed twisted it and asked him if he felt better  whats happened whats happened said dad  a fit said rene i fear my confrere has had a fit do not be alarmed he recovers himself shall i bleed you a little my dear doctor doctor break was very good too he said i am vastly obliged monsieur laennec but i am restored now and as he went out of the gate he told dad it was a syncopei think then sir arthur said quite right bucksteed not another word they are both gentlemen and he took off his cocked hat to doctor break and rene  but poor dad wouldnt let well alone he kept saying philadelphia what does all this mean  well sir i said ive only just come down as far as i could see it looked as though doctor break had had a sudden seizure that was quite trueif youd seen rene seize him sir arthur laughed not much change there bucksteed he said shes a ladya thorough lady  heaven knows she doesnt look like one said poor dad go home philadelphia  so i went home my deardont laugh soright under sir arthurs nosea most enormous nosefeeling as though i were twelve years old going to be whipped oh i beg your pardon child  its all right said una im getting on for thirteen ive never been whipped but i know how you felt all the same it must have been funny  funny if youd heard sir arthur jerking out good ged bucksteed every minute as they rode behind me and poor dad saying pon my honour arthur i cant account for it oh how my cheeks tingled when i reached my room but cissie had laid out my very best evening dress the white satin one vandyked at the bottom with spots of morone foil and the pearl knots you know catching up the drapery from the left shoulder i had poor mothers lace tucker and her coronet comb  oh you lucky una murmured and gloves  french kid my dearphiladelphia patted her shoulderand morone satin shoes and a morone and gold crape fan that restored my calm nice things always do i wore my hair banded on my forehead with a little curl over the left ear and when i descended the stairs en grande tenue old amoore curtsied to me without my having to stop and look at her which alas is too often the case sir arthur highly approved of the dinner my dear the mackerel did come in time we had all the marklake silver out and he toasted my health and he asked me where my little birdsnesting sister was i know he did it to quiz me so i looked him straight in the face my dear and i said i always send her to the nursery sir arthur when i receive guests at marklake hall  oh how cheeclever of you what did he say una cried he said not much change there bucksteed ged i deserved it and he toasted me again they talked about the french and what a shame it was that sir arthur only commanded a brigade at hastings and he told dad of a battle in india at a place called assaye dad said it was a terrible fight but sir arthur described it as though it had been a whistpartyi suppose because a lady was present  of course you were the lady i wish id seen yousaid una  i wish you had child i had such a triumph after dinner rene and doctor break came in they had quite made up their quarrel and they told me they had the highest esteem for each other and i laughed and said i heard every word of it up in the tree you never saw two men so frightened in your life and when i said what was the subject of your remarks rene neither of them knew where to look oh i quizzed them unmercifully theyd seen me jump off the pigsty roof remember  but what was the subject of their remarks said una  oh doctor break said it was a professional matter so the laugh was turned on me i was horribly afraid it might have been something unladylike and indelicate but that wasnt my triumph dad asked me to play on the harp between just you and me child i had been practising a new song from londoni dont always live in treesfor weeks and i gave it them for a surprise  what was itsaid una sing it  i have given my heart to a flower not very difficult fingering but rrravishing sentiment  philadelphia coughed and cleared her throat  ive a deep voice for my age and size she explained contralto you know but it ought to be stronger and she began her face all dark against the last of the soft pink sunset       i have given my heart to a flower      though i know it is fading away      though i know it will live but an hour      and leave me to mourn its decay  isnt that touchingly sweet then the last versei wish i had my harp deargoes as low as my register will reachshe drew in her chin and took a deep breath       ye desolate whirlwinds that rave      i charge you be good to my dear      she is allshe is all that i have      and the time of our parting is near  beautiful said una and did they like it like it they were overwhelmedaccables as rene says my dear if i hadnt seen it i shouldnt have believed that i could have drawn tears genuine tears to the eyes of four grown men but i did rene simply couldnt endure it hes all french sensibility he hid his face and said assez mademoiselle cest plus fort que moi assez and sir arthur blew his nose and said good ged this is worse than assaye while dad sat with the tears simply running down his cheeks  and what did doctor break do  he got up and pretended to look out of the window but i saw his little fat shoulders jerk as if he had the hiccoughs that was a triumph i never suspected him of sensibility  oh i wish id seen i wish id been yousaid una clasping her hands puck rustled and rose from the fern just as a big blundering cockchafer flew smack against unas cheek  when she had finished rubbing the place mrs vincey called to her that pansy had been fractious or she would have come long before to help her strain and pour off it didnt matter said una i just waited is that old pansy barging about the lower pasture now  no said mrs vincey listening it sounds more like a horse being galloped middlin quick through the woods but theres no road there i reckon its one of gleasons colts loose shall i see you up to the house miss una  gracious no thank you whats going to hurt me said una and she put her stool away behind the oak and strolled home through the gaps that old hobden kept open for her     brookland road        i was very well pleased with what i knowed      i reckoned myself no fool      till i met with a maid on the brookland road      that turned me back to school            low downlow down           where the liddle green lanterns shine           oh  maids ive done with ee all but one           and she can never be mine      twas right in the middest of a hot june night      with thunder duntin round      and i seed her face by the fairy light      that beats from off the ground       she only smiled and she never spoke      she smiled and went away      but when shed gone my heart was broke      and my wits was clean astray       oh  stop your ringing and let me be      let be o brookland bells      youll ring old goodman  out of the sea      before i wed one else       old goodmans farm is rank sea sand      and was this

the knife and the naked chalk     the run of the downs        the weald is good the downs are best      ill give you the run of em east to west      beachy head and winddoor hill      they were once and they are still      firle mount caburn and mount harry      go back as far as sumsll carry      ditchling beacon and chanctonbury ring      they have looked on many a thing      and what those two have missed between em      i reckon truleigh hill has seen em      highden bignor and duncton down      knew old england before the crown      linch down treyford and sunwood      knew old england before the flood      and when you end on the hampshire side      butsers old as time and tide      the downs are sheep the weald is corn      you be glad you are sussex born     the knife and the naked chalk   the children went to the seaside for a month and lived in a flint village on the bare windy chalk downs quite thirty miles away from home they made friends with an old shepherd called mr dudeney who had known their father when their father was little he did not talk like their own people in the weald of sussex and he used different names for farm things but he understood how they felt and let them go with him he had a tiny cottage about half a mile from the village where his wife made mead from thyme honey and nursed sick lambs in front of a coal fire while old jim who was mr dudeneys sheepdogs father lay at the door they brought up beef bones for old jim you must never give a sheepdog mutton bones and if mr dudeney happened to be far in the downs mrs dudeney would tell the dog to take them to him and he did  one august afternoon when the village watercart had made the street smell specially townified they went to look for their shepherd as usual and as usual old jim crawled over the doorstep and took them in charge the sun was hot the dry grass was very slippery and the distances were very distant  its just like the sea said una when old jim halted in the shade of a lonely flint barn on a bare rise you see where youre going andyou go there and theres nothing between  dan slipped off his shoes when we get home i shall sit in the woods all day he said  whuff said old jim to show he was ready and struck across a long rolling stretch of turf presently he asked for his beefbone  not yet said dan wheres mr dudeney wheres master old jim looked as if he thought they were mad and asked again  dont you give it him una cried im not going to be left howling in a desert  show boy show said dan for the downs seemed as bare as the palm of your hand  old jim sighed and trotted forward soon they spied the blob of mr dudeneys hat against the sky a long way off  right all right said dan old jim wheeled round took his bone carefully between his blunted teeth and returned to the shadow of the old barn looking just like a wolf the children went on two kestrels hung bivvering and squealing above them a gull flapped lazily along the white edge of the cliffs the curves of the downs shook a little in the heat and so did mr dudeneys distant head  they walked toward it very slowly and found themselves staring into a horseshoeshaped hollow a hundred feet deep whose steep sides were laced with tangled sheeptracks the flock grazed on the flat at the bottom under charge of young jim mr dudeney sat comfortably knitting on the edge of the slope his crook between his knees they told him what old jim had done  ah he thought you could see my head as soon as he did the closeter you be to the turf the more you see things you look warmlikesaid mr dudeney  we be said una flopping down and tired  set beside o me here the shadowll begin to stretch out in a little while and a heatshake o wind will come up with it thatll overlay your eyes like so much wool  we dont want to sleep said una indignantly but she settled herself as she spoke in the first strip of early afternoon shade  o course not you come to talk with me same as your father used he didnt need no dog to guide him to norton pit  well he belonged here said dan and laid himself down at length on the turf  he did and what beats me is why he went off to live among them messy trees in the weald when he might ha stayed here and looked all about him theres no profit to trees they draw the lightning and sheep shelter under em and so like as not youll lose a halfscore ewes struck dead in one storm tck your father knew that  trees arent messy una rose on her elbow and what about firewood i dont like coal  eh you lie a piece more uphill and youll lie more natural said mr dudeney with his provoking deaf smile now press your face down and smell to the turf thats southdown thyme which makes our southdown mutton beyond compare and my mother told me twill cure anything except broken necks or hearts i forget which  they sniffed and somehow forgot to lift their cheeks from the soft thymy cushions  you dont get nothing like that in the weald watercress maybe said mr dudeney  but weve waterbrooks full of itwhere you paddle in hot weather una replied watching a yellowandvioletbanded snailshell close to her eye  brooks flood then you must shift your sheeplet alone footrot afterward i put more dependence on a dewpond any day  hows a dewpond made said dan and tilted his hat over his eyes mr dudeney explained  the air trembled a little as though it could not make up its mind whether to slide into the pit or move across the open but it seemed easiest to go downhill and the children felt one soft puff after another slip and sidle down the slope in fragrant breaths that baffed on their eyelids the little whisper of the sea by the cliffs joined with the whisper of the wind over the grass the hum of insects in the thyme the ruffle and rustle of the flock below and a thickish mutter deep in the very chalk beneath them mr dudeney stopped explaining and went on with his knitting they were roused by voices the shadow had crept halfway down the steep side of norton pit and on the edge of it his back to them puck sat beside a halfnaked man who seemed busy at some work the wind had dropped and in that funnel of ground every least noise and movement reached them like whispers up a waterpipe  that is clever said puck leaning over how truly you shape it  yes but what does the beast care for a brittle flint tip bah the man flicked something contemptuously over his shoulder it fell between dan and unaa beautiful darkblue flint arrowhead still hot from the makers hand  the man reached for another stone and worked away like a thrush with a snailshell  flint work is fools work he said at last one does it because one always did it but when it comes to dealing with the beastno good he shook his shaggy head the beast was dealt with long ago he has gone said puck  hell be back at lambing time i know him he chipped very carefully and the flints squeaked  not he children can lie out on the chalk now all day through and go home safe  can they well call the beast by his true name and ill believe it the man replied surely puck leaped to his feet curved his hands round his mouth and shouted wolf wolf  norton pit threw back the echo from its dry sideswuff wuff like young jims bark  you see you hear said puck nobody answers grey shepherd is gone feetinthenight has run off there are no more wolves  wonderful the man wiped his forehead as though he were hot who drove him away you  many men through many years each working in his own country were you one of them puck answered  the man slid his sheepskin cloak to his waist and without a word pointed to his side which was all seamed and blotched with scars his arms too were dimpled from shoulder to elbow with horrible white dimples  i see said puck it is the beasts mark what did you use against him hand hammer and spear as our fathers did before us  so then howpuck twitched aside the mans darkbrown cloakhow did a flintworker come by that show man show he held out his little hand  the man slipped a long dark iron knife almost a short sword from his belt and after breathing on it handed it hiltfirst to puck who took it with his head on one side as you should when you look at the works of a watch squinted down the dark blade and very delicately rubbed his forefinger from the point to the hilt  good said he in a surprised tone  it should be the children of the night made it the man answered  so i see by the iron what might it have cost you  this the man raised his hand to his cheek puck whistled like a weald starling  by the great rings of the chalk he cried was that your price turn sunward that i may see better and shut your eye he slipped his hand beneath the mans chin and swung him till he faced the children up the slope they saw that his right eye was gone and the eyelid lay shrunk quickly puck turned him round again and the two sat down  it was for the sheep the sheep are the people said the man in an ashamed voice what else could i have done you know old one  puck sighed a little fluttering sigh take the knife i listen the man bowed his head drove the knife into the turf and while it still quivered said this is witness between us that i speak the thing that has been before my knife and the naked chalk i speak touch  puck laid a hand on the hilt it stopped shaking the children wriggled a little nearer  i am of the people of the worked flint i am the one son of the priestess who sells the winds to the men of the sea i am the buyer of the knifethe keeper of the people the man began in a sort of singing shout these are my names in this country of the naked chalk between the trees and the sea  yours was a great country your names are great too said puck  one cannot feed some things on names and songs the man hit himself on the chest it is betteralways betterto count ones children safe round the fire their mother among them  ahai said puck i think this will be a very old tale i warm myself and eat at any fire that i choose but there is no one to light me a fire or cook my meat i sold all that when i bought the magic knife for my people it was not right that the beast should master man what else could i have done  i hear i know i listen said puck  when i was old enough to take my place in the sheepguard the beast gnawed all our country like a bone between his teeth he came in behind the flocks at wateringtime and watched them round the dewponds he leaped into the folds between our knees at the shearing he walked out alongside the grazing flocks and chose his meat on the hoof while our boys threw flints at him he crept by night into the huts and licked the babe from between the mothers hands he called his companions and pulled down men in broad daylight on the naked chalk nonot always did he do so this was his cunning he would go away for a while to let us forget him a yeartwo years perhapswe neither smelt nor heard nor saw him when our flocks had increased when our men did not always look behind them when children strayed from the fenced places when our women walked alone to draw waterback back back came the curse of the chalk grey shepherd feetinthenightthe beast the beast the beast  he laughed at our little brittle arrows and our poor blunt spears he learned to run in under the stroke of the hammer i think he knew when there was a flaw in the flint often it does not show till you bring it down on his snout thenpoufthe false flint falls all to flinders and you are left with the hammerhandle in your fist and his teeth in your flank i have felt them at evening too in the dew or when it has misted and rained your spearhead lashings slack off though you have kept them beneath your cloak all day you are alonebut so close to the home ponds that you stop to tighten the sinews with hands teeth and a piece of driftwood you bend over and pullso that is the minute for which he has followed you since the stars went out aarh he wurraarh he says norton pit gave back the growl like a pack of real wolves then he is on your right shoulder feeling for the vein in your neck andperhaps your sheep run on without you to fight the beast is nothing but to be despised by the beast when he fights youthat is like his teeth in the heart old one why is it that men desire so greatly and can do so little  i do not know did you desire so much said puck  i desired to master the beast it is not right that the beast should master man but my people were afraid even my mother the priestess was afraid when i told her what i desired we were accustomed to be afraid of the beast when i was made a man and a maidenshe was a priestesswaited for me at the dewponds the beast flitted from off the chalk perhaps it was a sickness perhaps he had gone to his gods to learn how to do us new harm but he went and we breathed more freely the women sang again the children were not so much guarded our flocks grazed far out i took mine yonderhe pointed inland to the hazy line of the wealdwhere the new grass was best they grazed north i followed till we were close to the treeshe lowered his voiceclose there where the children of the night live he pointed north again  ah now i remember a thing said puck tell me why did your people fear the trees so extremely  because the gods hate the trees and strike them with lightning we can see them burning for days all along the chalks edge besides all the chalk knows that the children of the night though they worship our gods are magicians when a man goes into their country they change his spirit they put words into his mouth they make him like talking water but a voice in my heart told me to go toward the north while i watched my sheep there i saw three beasts chasing a man who ran toward the trees by this i knew he was a child of the night we flintworkers fear the trees more than we fear the beast he had no hammer he carried a knife like this one a beast leaped at him he stretched out his knife the beast fell dead the other beasts ran away howling which they would never have done from a flintworker the man went in among the trees i looked for the dead beast he had been killed in a new wayby a single deep clean cut without bruise or tear which had split his bad heart wonderful so i saw that the mans knife was magic and i thought how to get itthought strongly how to get it  when i brought the flocks to the shearing my mother the priestess asked me what is the new thing which you have seen and i see in your face i said it is a sorrow to me and she answered all new things are sorrow sit in my place and eat sorrow i sat down in her place by the fire where she talks to the ghosts in winter and two voices spoke in my heart one voice said ask the children of the night for the magic knife it is not fit that the beast should master man i listened to that voice  one voice said if you go among the trees the children of the night will change your spirit eat and sleep here the other voice said ask for the knife i listened to that voice  i said to my mother in the morning i go away to find a thing for the people but i do not know whether i shall return in my own shape she answered whether you live or die or are made different i am your mother  true said puck the old ones themselves cannot change mens mothers even if they would  let us thank the old ones i spoke to my maiden the priestess who waited for me at the dewponds she promised fine things too the man laughed i went away to that place where i had seen the magician with the knife i lay out two days on the short grass before i ventured among the trees i felt my way before me with a stick i was afraid of the terrible talking trees i was afraid of the ghosts in the branches of the soft ground underfoot of the red and black waters i was afraid above all of the change it came  they saw him wipe his forehead once again and his strong backmuscles quivered till he laid his hand on the knifehilt  a fire without a flame burned in my head an evil taste grew in my mouth my eyelids shut hot over my eyes my breath was hot between my teeth and my hands were like the hands of a stranger i was made to sing songs and to mock the trees though i was afraid of them at the same time i saw myself laughing and i was very sad for this fine young man who was myself ah the children of the night know magic  i think that is done by the spirits of the mist they change a man if he sleeps among them said puck had you slept in any mists  yesbut i know it was the children of the night after three days i saw a red light behind the trees and i heard a heavy noise i saw the children of the night dig red stones from a hole and lay them in fires the stones melted like tallow and the men beat the soft stuff with hammers i wished to speak to these men but the words were changed in my mouth and all i could say was do not make that noise it hurts my head by this i knew that i was bewitched and i clung to the trees and prayed the children of the night to take off their spells they were cruel they asked me many questions which they would never allow me to answer they changed my words between my teeth till i wept then they led me into a hut and covered the floor with hot stones and dashed water on the stones and sang charms till the sweat poured off me like water i slept when i waked my own spiritnot the strange shouting thingwas back in my body and i was like a cool bright stone on the shingle between the sea and the sunshine the magicians came to hear mewomen and meneach wearing a magic knife their priestess was their ears and their mouth  i spoke i spoke many words that went smoothly along like sheep in order when their shepherd standing on a mound can count those coming and those far off getting ready to come i asked for magic knives for my people i said that my people would bring meat and milk and wool and lay them in the short grass outside the trees if the children of the night would leave magic knives for our people to take away they were pleased their priestess said for whose sake have you come i answered the sheep are the people if the beast kills our sheep our people die so i come for a magic knife to kill the beast  she said we do not know if our god will let us trade with the people of the naked chalk wait till we have asked  when they came back from the questionplace their gods are our gods their priestess said the god needs a proof that your words are true i said what is the proof she said the god says that if you have come for the sake of your people you will give him your right eye to be put out but if you have come for any other reason you will not give it this proof is between you and the god we ourselves are sorry  i said this is a hard proof is there no other road  she said yes you can go back to your people with your two eyes in your head if you choose but then you will not get any magic knives for your people  i said it would be easier if i knew that i were to be killed  she said perhaps the god knew this too see i have made my knife hot  i said be quick then with her knife heated in the flame she put out my right eye she herself did it i am the son of a priestess she was a priestess it was not work for any common man  true most true said puck no common mans work that and afterwards  afterwards i did not see out of that eye any more i found also that a one eye does not tell you truly where things are try it  at this dan put his hand over one eye and reached for the flint arrowhead on the grass he missed it by inches its true he whispered to una you cant judge distances a bit with only one eye  puck was evidently making the same experiment for the man laughed at him  i know it is so said he even now i am not always sure of my blow i stayed with the children of the night till my eye healed they said i was the son of tyr the god who put his right hand in a beasts mouth they showed me how they melted their red stone and made the magic knives of it they told me the charms they sang over the fires and at the beatings i can sing many charms then he began to laugh like a boy  i was thinking of my journey home he said and of the surprised beast he had come back to the chalk i saw himi smelt his lairs as soon as ever i left the trees he did not know i had the magic knifei hid it under my cloakthe knife that the priestess gave me ho ho that happy day was too short see a beast would wind me wow he would say here is my flintworker he would come leaping tail in air he would roll he would lay his head between his paws out of merriness of heart at his warm waiting meal he would leapand oh his eye in midleap when he sawwhen he saw the knife held ready for him it pierced his hide as a rush pierces curdled milk often he had no time to howl i did not trouble to flay any beasts i killed sometimes i missed my blow then i took my little flint hammer and beat out his brains as he cowered he made no fight he knew the knife but the beast is very cunning before evening all the beasts had smelt the blood on my knife and were running from me like hares they knew then i walked as a man shouldthe master of the beast  so came i back to my mothers house there was a lamb to be killed i cut it in two halves with my knife and i told her all my tale she said this is the work of a god i kissed her and laughed i went to my maiden who waited for me at the dewponds there was a lamb to be killed i cut it in two halves with my knife and told her all my tale she said it is the work of a god i laughed but she pushed me away and being on my blind side ran off before i could kiss her i went to the men of the sheepguard at wateringtime there was a sheep to be killed for their meat i cut it in two halves with my knife and told them all my tale they said it is the work of a god i said we talk too much about gods let us eat and be happy and tomorrow i will take you to the children of the night and each man will find a magic knife   i was glad to smell our sheep again to see the broad sky from edge to edge and to hear the sea i slept beneath the stars in my cloak the men talked among themselves  i led them the next day to the trees taking with me meat wool and curdled milk as i had promised we found the magic knives laid out on the grass as the children of the night had promised they watched us from among the trees their priestess called to me and said how is it with your people i said their hearts are changed i cannot see their hearts as i used to she said that is because you have only one eye come to me and i will be both your eyes but i said i must show my people how to use their knives against the beast as you showed me how to use my knife i said this because the magic knife does not balance like the flint she said what you have done you have done for the sake of a woman and not for the sake of your people i asked of her then why did the god accept my right eye and why are you so angry she answered because any man can lie to a god but no man can lie to a woman and i am not angry with you i am only very sorrowful for you wait a little and you will see out of your one eye why i am sorry so she hid herself  i went back with my people each one carrying his knife and making it sing in the airtsseesssse the flint never sings it muttersumpump the beast heard the beast saw he knew everywhere he ran away from us we all laughed as we walked over the grass my mothers brotherthe chief on the mens sidehe took off his chiefs necklace of yellow seastones  how eh oh i remember amber said puck  and would have put them on my neck i said no i am content what does my one eye matter if my other eye sees fat sheep and fat children running about safely my mothers brother said to them i told you he would never take such things then they began to sing a song in the old tonguethe song of tyr i sang with them but my mothers brother said this is your song o buyer of the knife let us sing it tyr  even then i did not understand till i saw thatthat no man stepped on my shadow and i knew that they thought me to be a god like the god tyr who gave his right hand to conquer a great beast  by the fire in the belly of the flint was that so puck rapped out  by my knife and the naked chalk so it was they made way for my shadow as though it had been a priestess walking to the barrows of the dead i was afraid i said to myself my mother and my maiden will know i am not tyr but still i was afraid with the fear of a man who falls into a steep flintpit while he runs and feels that it will be hard to climb out  when we came to the dewponds all our people were there the men showed their knives and told their tale the sheep guards also had seen the beast flying from us the beast went west across the river in packshowling he knew the knife had come to the naked chalk at lastat last he knew so my work was done i looked for my maiden among the priestesses she looked at me but she did not smile she made the sign to me that our priestesses must make when they sacrifice to the old dead in the barrows i would have spoken but my mothers brother made himself my mouth as though i had been one of the old dead in the barrows for whom our priests speak to the people on midsummer mornings  i remember well i remember those midsummer mornings said puck  then i went away angrily to my mothers house she would have knelt before me then i was more angry but she said only a god would have spoken to me thus a priestess a man would have feared the punishment of the gods i looked at her and i laughed i could not stop my unhappy laughing they called me from the door by the name of tyr himself a young man with whom i had watched my first flocks and chipped my first arrow and fought my first beast called me by that name in the old tongue he asked my leave to take my maiden his eyes were lowered his hands were on his forehead he was full of the fear of a god but of me a man he had no fear when he asked i did not kill him i said call the maiden she came also without fearthis very one that had waited for me that had talked with me by our dewponds being a priestess she lifted her eyes to me as i look on a hill or a cloud so she looked at me she spoke in the old tongue which priestesses use when they make prayers to the old dead in the barrows she asked leave that she might light the fire in my companions houseand that i should bless their children i did not kill her i heard my own voice little and cold say let it be as you desire and they went away hand in hand my heart grew little and cold a wind shouted in my ears my eye darkened i said to my mother can a god die i heard her say what is it what is it my son and i fell into darkness full of hammernoises i was not  oh poorpoor god said puck and your wise mother  she knew as soon as i dropped she knew when my spirit came back i heard her whisper in my ear whether you live or die or are made different i am your mother that was goodbetter even than the water she gave me and the going away of the sickness though i was ashamed to have fallen down yet i was very glad she was glad too neither of us wished to lose the other there is only the one mother for the one son i heaped the fire for her and barred the doors and sat at her feet as before i went away and she combed my hair and sang  i said at last what is to be done to the people who say that i am tyr  she said he who has done a godlike thing must bear himself like a god i see no way out of it the people are now your sheep till you die you cannot drive them off   i said this is a heavier sheep than i can lift she said in time it will grow easy in time perhaps you will not lay it down for any maiden anywhere be wisebe very wise my son for nothing is left you except the words and the songs and the worship of a god  oh poor god said puck but those are not altogether bad things  i know they are not but i would sell them allallall for one small child of my own smearing himself with the ashes of our own housefire  he wrenched his knife from the turf thrust it into his belt and stood up  and yet what else could i have done he said the sheep are the people  it is a very old tale puck answered i have heard the like of it not only on the naked chalk but also among the treesunder oak and ash and thorn  the afternoon shadows filled all the quiet emptiness of norton pit the children heard the sheepbells and young jims busy bark above them and they scrambled up the slope to the level  we let you have your sleep out said mr dudeney as the flock scattered before them its making for teatime now  look what ive found said dan and held up a little blue flint arrowhead as fresh as though it had been chipped that very day  oh said mr dudeney the closeter you be to the turf the more youre apt to see things ive found em often some says the fairies made em but i says they was made by folks like ourselvesonly a goodish time back theyre lucky to keep now you couldnt ever have sleptnot to any profitamong your fathers trees same as youve laid out on naked chalkcould you  one doesnt want to sleep in the woods said una  then whats the good of em said mr dudeney might as well set in the barn all day fetch em long jim boy  the downs that looked so bare and hot when they came were full of delicious little shadowdimples the smell of the thyme and the salt mixed together on the southwest drift from the still sea their eyes dazzled with the low sun and the long grass under it looked golden the sheep knew where their fold was so young jim came back to his master and they all four strolled home the scabiousheads swishing about their ankles and their shadows streaking behind them like the shadows of giants     song of the mens side        once we feared the beastwhen he followed us we ran      ran very fast though we knew      it was not right that the beast should master man      but what could we flintworkers do      the beast only grinned at our spears round his ears      grinned at the hammers that we made      but now we will hunt him for the life with the knife      and this is the buyer of the blade            room for his shadow on the grasslet it pass           to left and rightstand clear           this is the buyer of the bladebe afraid           this is the great god tyr       tyr thought hard till he hammered out a plan      for he knew it was not right      and it is not right that the beast should master man      so he went to the children of the night      he begged a magic knife of their make for our sake      when he begged for the knife they said      the price of the knife you would buy is an eye      and that was the price he paid            tell it to the barrows of the deadrun ahead           shout it so the womens side can hear           this is

in pennsylvania this morning     brother squaretoes   it was almost the end of their visit to the seaside they had turned themselves out of doors while their trunks were being packed and strolled over the downs towards the dull evening sea the tide was dead low under the chalk cliffs and the little wrinkled waves grieved along the sands up the coast to newhaven and down the coast to long grey brighton whose smoke trailed out across the channel  they walked to the gap where the cliff is only a few feet high a windlass for hoisting shingle from the beach below stands at the edge of it the coastguard cottages are a little farther on and an old ships figurehead of a turk in a turban stared at them over the wall this time tomorrow we shall be at home thank goodness said una i hate the sea  i believe its all right in the middle said dan the edges are the sorrowful parts  cordery the coastguard came out of the cottage levelled his telescope at some fishingboats shut it with a click and walked away he grew smaller and smaller along the edge of the cliff where neat piles of white chalk every few yards show the path even on the darkest night wheres cordery goingsaid una  halfway to newhavensaid dan then hell meet the newhaven coastguard and turn back he says if coastguards were done away with smuggling would start up at once  a voice on the beach under the cliff began to sing       the moon she shined on telscombe tye      on telscombe tye at night it was      she saw the smugglers riding by      a very pretty sight it was  feet scrabbled on the flinty path a dark thinfaced man in very neat brown clothes and broadtoed shoes came up followed by puck       three dunkirk boats was standin in  the man went on hssh said puck youll shock these nice young people  oh shall i mille pardons he shrugged his shoulders almost up to his earsspread his hands abroad and jabbered in french no comprenny he said ill give it you in low german and he went off in another language changing his voice and manner so completely that they hardly knew him for the same person but his dark beadybrown eyes still twinkled merrily in his lean face and the children felt that they did not suit the straight plain snuffybrown coat brown kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat his hair was tied in a short pigtail which danced wickedly when he turned his head  ha done said puck laughing be one thing or tother pharaohfrench or english or germanno great odds which  oh but it is though said una quickly we havent begun german yet andand were going back to our french next week  arent you english

wore pretty thin for ive made and kept a worldly fortune  by smuggling dan asked no in the tobacco trade  you dont mean to say you gave up smuggling just to go and be a tobacconist dan looked so disappointed they all had to laugh  im sorry but theres all sorts of tobacconists pharaoh replied how far out now would you call that smack with the patch on her foresail he pointed to the fishingboats  a scant mile said puck after a quick look  just about its seven fathom under herclean sand that was where uncle aurette used to sink his brandy kegs from boulogne and we fished em up and rowed em into the gap here for the ponies to run inland one thickish night in january of ninetythree dad and uncle lot and me came over from shoreham in the smack and we found uncle aurette and the lestranges my cousins waiting for us in their lugger with new years presents from mothers folk in boulogne i remember aunt cecile shed sent me a fine new red knitted cap which i put on then and there for the french was having their revolution in those days and red caps was all the fashion uncle aurette tells us that they had cut off their king louis head and moreover the brest forts had fired on an english manowar the news wasnt a week old  that means war again when we was only just getting used to the peace says dad why cant king georges men and king louis men do on their uniforms and fight it out over our heads  me too i wish that says uncle aurette but theyll be pressing better men than themselves to fight for em the pressgangs are out already on our side you look out for yours  ill have to bide ashore and grow cabbages for a while after ive run this cargo but i do wishdad says going over the luggers side with our new year presents under his arm and young lestrange holding the lanterni just do wish that those folk which make war so easy had to run one cargo a month all this winter it ud show em what honest work means  well ive warned ye says uncle aurette ill be slipping off now before your revenue cutter comes give my love to sister and take care o the kegs its thicking to southward i remember him waving to us and young stephen lestrange blowing out the lantern by the time wed fished up the kegs the fog came down so thick dad judged it risky for me to row em ashore even though we could hear the ponies stamping on the beach so he and uncle lot took the dinghy and left me in the smack playing on my fiddle to guide em back  presently i heard guns two of em sounded mighty like uncle aurettes threepounders he didnt go naked about the seas after dark then come more which i reckoned was captain giddens in the revenue cutter he was openhanded with his compliments but he would lay his guns himself i stopped fiddling to listen and i heard a whole skyful o french up in the fogand a high bow come down on top o the smack i hadnt time to call or think i remember the smack heeling over and me standing on the gunwale pushing against the ships side as if i hoped to bear her off then the square of an open port with a lantern in it slid by in front of my nose i kicked back on our gunwale as it went under and slipped through that port into the french shipme and my fiddle  gracious said una what an adventure  didnt anybody see you come in said dan  there wasnt any one there id made use of an orlopdeck portthats the next deck below the gundeck which by rights should not have been open at all the crew was standing by their guns up above i rolled on to a pile of dunnage in the dark and i went to sleep when i woke men was talking all round me telling each other their names and sorrows just like dad told me pressed men used to talk in the last war pretty soon i made out theyd all been hove aboard together by the pressgangs and left to sort emselves the ship she was the embuscade a thirtysixgun republican frigate captain jean baptiste bompard two days out of le havre going to the united states with a republican french ambassador of the name of genet they had been up all night clearing for action on account of hearing guns in the fog uncle aurette and captain giddens must have been passing the time o day with each other off newhaven and the frigate had drifted past em she never knew shed run down our smack seeing so many aboard was total strangers to each other i thought one more mightnt be noticed so i put aunt ceciles red cap on the back of my head and my hands in my pockets like the rest and as we french say i circulated till i found the galley  what heres one of em that isnt sick says a cook take his breakfast to citizen bompard  i carried the tray to the cabin but i didnt call this bompard citizen oh no mon capitaine was my little word same as uncle aurette used to answer in king louis navy bompard he liked it he took me on for cabin servant and after that no one asked questions and thus i got good victuals and light work all the way across to america he talked a heap of politics and so did his officers and when this ambassador genet got rid of his landstomach and laid down the law after dinner a rooks parliament was nothing compared to their cabin i learned to know most of the men which had worked the french revolution through waiting at table and hearing talk about em one of our forecasle sixpounders was called danton and tother marat i used to play the fiddle between em sitting on the capstan day in and day out bompard and monsieur genet talked o what france had done and how the united states was going to join her to finish off the english in this war monsieur genet said hed justabout make the united states fight for france he was a rude common man but i liked listening i always helped drink any healths that was proposedspecially citizen dantons whod cut off king louis head an allenglishman might have been shockedbut thats where my french blood saved me  it didnt save me from getting a dose of ships fever though the week before we put monsieur genet ashore at charleston and what was left of me after bleeding and pills took the dumb horrors from living tween decks the surgeon karaguen his name was kept me down there to help him with his plastersi was too weak to wait on bompard i dont remember much of any account for the next few weeks till i smelled lilacs and i looked out of the port and we was moored to a wharfedge and there was a town o fine gardens and redbrick houses and all the green leaves o gods world waiting for me outside  whats this i said to the sickbay manold pierre tiphaigne he was philadelphia says pierre youve missed it all were sailing next week  i just turned round and cried for longing to be amongst the laylocks  if thats your trouble says old pierre you go straight ashore nonell hinder you theyre all gone mad on these coastsfrench and american together tisnt my notion o war pierre was an old king louis man  my legs was pretty tottly but i made shift to go on deck which it was like a fair the frigate was crowded with fine gentlemen and ladies pouring in and out they sung and they waved french flags while captain bompard and his officersyes and some of the menspeechified to all and sundry about war with england they shouted down with englanddown with washingtonhurrah for france and the republic i couldnt make sense of it i wanted to get out from that crunch of swords and petticoats and sit in a field one of the gentlemen said to me is that a genuine cap o liberty youre wearing twas aunt ceciles red one and pretty near wore out oh yes i says straight from france ill give you a shilling for it he says and with that money in my hand and my fiddle under my arm i squeezed past the entryport and went ashore it was like a dreammeadows trees flowers birds houses and people all different i sat me down in a meadow and fiddled a bit and then i went in and out the streets looking and smelling and touching like a little dog at a fair fine folk was setting on the white stone doorsteps of their houses and a girl threw me a handful of laylock sprays and when i said merci without thinking she said she loved the french they all was the fashion in the city i saw more tricolour flags in philadelphia than ever id seen in boulogne and every one was shouting for war with england a crowd o folk was cheering after our french ambassadorthat same monsieur genet which wed left at charleston he was ahorseback behaving as if the place belonged to himand commanding all and sundry to fight the british but id heard that before i got into a long straight street as wide as the broyle where gentlemen was racing horses im fond o horses nobody hindered em and a man told me it was called race street o purpose for that then i followed some black niggers which id never seen close before but i left them to run after a great proud copperfaced man with feathers in his hair and a red blanket trailing behind him a man told me he was a real red indian called red jacket and i followed him into an alleyway off race street by second street where there was a fiddle playing im fond o fiddling the indian stopped at a bakers shopconrad gerhards it wasand bought some sugary cakes hearing what the price was i was going to have some too but the indian asked me in english if i was hungry oh yes i says i must have looked a sore scrattel he opens a door on to a staircase and leads the way up we walked into a dirty little room full of flutes and fiddles and a fat man fiddling by the window in a smell of cheese and medicines fit to knock you down i was knocked down too for the fat man jumped up and hit me a smack in the face i fell against an old spinet covered with pillboxes and the pills rolled about the floor the indian never moved an eyelid  pick up the pills pick up the pills the fat man screeches  i started picking em uphundreds of emmeaning to run out under the indians arm but i came on giddy all over and i sat down the fat man went back to his fiddling  toby says the indian after quite a while i brought the boy to be fed not hit  what says toby i thought it was gert schwankfelder he put down his fiddle and took a good look at me himmel he says i have hit the wrong boy it is not the new boy why are you not the new boy why are you not gert schwankfelder  i dont know i said the gentleman in the pink blanket brought me  says the indian he is hungry toby christians always feed the hungry so i bring him  you should have said that first said toby he pushed plates at me and the indian put bread and pork on them and a glass of madeira wine i told him i was off the french ship which i had joined on account of my mother being french that was true enough when you think of it and besides i saw that the french was all the fashion in philadelphia toby and the indian whispered and i went on picking up the pills  you like pillseh says toby no i says ive seen our ships doctor roll too many of em  ho he says and he shoves two bottles at me whats those  calomel i says and tothers senna  right he says one week have i tried to teach gert schwankfelder the difference between them yet he cannot tell you like to fiddle he says hed just seen my kit on the floor  oh yes says i  oho he says what note is this drawing his bow across  he meant it for a so i told him it was  my brother he says to the indian i think this is the hand of providence i warned that gert if he went to play upon the wharves any more he would hear from me now look at this boy and say what you think  the indian looked me over whole minutesthere was a musical clock on the wall and dolls came out and hopped while the hour struck he looked me over all the while they did it  good he says at last this boy is good  good then says toby now i shall play my fiddle and you shall sing your hymn brother boy go down to the bakery and tell them you are young gert schwankfelder that was the horses are in davy joness locker if you ask any questions you shall hear from me  i left em singing hymns and i went down to old conrad gerhard he wasnt at all surprised when i told him i was young gert schwankfelder that was he knew toby his wife she walked me into the backyard without a word and she washed me and she cut my hair to the edge of a basin and she put me to bed and oh how i slepthow i slept in that little room behind the oven looking on the flower garden i didnt know toby went to the embuscade that night and bought me off dr karaguen for twelve dollars and a dozen bottles of seneca oil karaguen wanted a new lace to his coat and he reckoned i hadnt long to live so he put me down as discharged sick  i like toby said una  who was he said puck  apothecary tobias hirte pharaoh replied one hundred and eighteen second streetthe famous seneca oil man that lived half of every year among the indians but let me tell my tale my own way same as his brown mare used to go to lebanon  then why did he keep her in davy joness locker dan asked that was his joke he kept her under david joness hat shop in the buck tavern yard and his indian friends kept their ponies there when they visited him i looked after the horses when i wasnt rolling pills on top of the old spinet while he played his fiddle and red jacket sang hymns i liked it i had good victuals light work a suit o clean clothes a plenty music and quiet smiling german folk all around that let me sit in their gardens my first sunday toby took me to his church in moravian alley and that was in a garden too the women wore longeared caps and handkerchiefs they came in at one door and the men at another and there was a brass chandelier you could see your face in and a niggerboy to blow the organ bellows i carried tobys fiddle and he played pretty much as he chose all against the organ and the singing he was the only one they let do it for they was a simpleminded folk they used to wash each others feet up in the attic to keep emselves humble which lord knows they didnt need  how very queer said una  pharaohs eyes twinkled ive met many and seen much he said but i havent yet found any better or quieter or forbearinger people than the brethren and sistern of the moravian church in philadelphia nor will i ever forget my first sundaythe service was in english that weekwith the smell of the flowers coming in from pastor meders garden where the big peach tree is and me looking at all the clean strangeness and thinking of tween decks on the embuscade only six days ago being a boy it seemed to me it had lasted for ever and was going on for ever but i didnt know toby then as soon as the dancing clock struck midnight that sundayi was lying under the spineti heard tobys fiddle hed just done his supper which he always took late and heavy gert says he get the horses liberty and independence for ever the flowers appear upon the earth and the time of the singing of birds is come we are going to my country seat in lebanon  i rubbed my eyes and fetched em out of the buck stables red jacket was there saddling his and when id packed the saddlebags we three rode up race street to the ferry by starlight so we went travelling its a kindly softly country there back of philadelphia among the german towns lancaster way little houses and bursting big barns fat cattle fat women and all as peaceful as heaven might be if they farmed there toby sold medicines out of his saddlebags and gave the french warnews to folk along the roads him and his longhilted umberell was as well known as the stagecoaches he took orders for that famous seneca oil which he had the secret of from red jackets indians and he slept in friends farmhouses but he would shut all the windows so red jacket and me slept outside theres nothing to hurt except snakesand they slip away quick enough if you thrash in the bushes  id have liked that said dan  id no fault to find with those days in the cool o the morning the catbird sings hes something to listen to and theres a smell of wild grapevine growing in damp hollows which you drop into after long rides in the heat which is beyond compare for sweetness sos the puffs out of the pine woods of afternoons come sundown the frogs strike up and later on the fireflies dance in the corn oh me the fireflies in the corn we were a week or ten days on the road tacking from one place to anothersuch as lancaster bethlehemephratathou bethlehemephrata no oddsi loved the going about and so we jogged into dozy little lebanon by the blue mountains where toby had a cottage and a garden of all fruits he come north every year for this wonderful seneca oil the seneca indians made for him theyd never sell to any one else and he doctored em with von swieten pills which they valued more than their own oil he could do what he chose with them and of course he tried to make them moravians the senecas are a seemly quiet people and theyd had trouble enough from white menamerican and englishduring the wars to keep em in that walk they lived on a reservation by themselves away off by their lake toby took me up there and they treated me as if i was their own blood brother red jacket said the mark of my bare feet in the dust was just like an indians and my style of walking was similar i know i took to their ways all over  maybe the gipsy drop in your blood helped you said puck  sometimes i think it did pharaoh went on anyhow red jacket and cornplanter the other seneca chief they let me be adopted into the tribe its only a compliment of course but toby was angry when i showed up with my face painted they gave me a sidename which means two tongues because dye see i talked french and english  they had their own opinions ive heard em about the french and the english and the americans theyd suffered from all of em during the wars and they only wished to be left alone but they thought a heap of the president of the united states cornplanter had had dealings with him in some french wars out west when general washington was only a lad his being president afterwards made no odds to em they always called him big hand for he was a largefisted man and he was all of their notion of a white chief cornplanter ud sweep his blanket round him and after id filled his pipe hed beginin the old days long ago when braves were many and blankets were few big hand said if red jacket agreed to the sayso hed trickle a little smoke out of the corners of his mouth if he didnt hed blow through his nostrils then cornplanter ud stop and red jacket ud take on red jacket was the better talker of the two ive laid and listened to em for hours oh they knew general washington well cornplanter used to meet him at epplysthe great dancingplace in the city before district marshal william nichols bought it they told me he was always glad to see em and hed hear em out to the end if they had anything on their minds they had a good deal in those days i came at it by degrees after i was adopted into the tribe the talk up in lebanon and everywhere else that summer was about the french war with england and whether the united states ud join in with france or make a peace treaty with england toby wanted peace so as he could go about the reservation buying his oils but most of the white men wished for war and they was angry because the president wouldnt give the sign for it the newspaper said men was burning guy fawkes images of general washington and yelling after him in the streets of philadelphia youd have been astonished what those two fine old chiefs knew of the ins and outs of such matters the little ive learned of politics i picked up from cornplanter and red jacket on the reservation toby used to read the aurora newspaper he was what they call a democrat though our church is against the brethren concerning themselves with politics  i hate politics too said una and pharaoh laughed  i might ha guessed it he said but heres something that isnt politics one hot evening late in august toby was reading the newspaper on the stoop and red jacket was smoking under a peach tree and i was fiddling of a sudden toby drops his aurora  i am an oldish man too fond of my own comforts he says i will go to the church which is in philadelphia my brother lend me a spare pony i must be there tomorrow night  good says red jacket looking at the sun my brother shall be there i will ride with him and bring back the ponies  i went to pack the saddlebags toby had cured me of asking questions he stopped my fiddling if i did besides indians dont ask questions much and i wanted to be like em  when the horses were ready i jumped up  get off says toby stay and mind the cottage till i come back the lord has laid this on me not on you i wish he hadnt  he powders off down the lancaster road and i sat on the doorstep wondering after him when i picked up the paper to wrap his fiddlestrings in i spelled out a piece about the yellow fever being in philadelphia so dreadful every one was running away i was scared for i was fond of toby we never said much to each other but we fiddled together and musics as good as talking to them that understand  did toby die of yellow feveruna asked  not him theres justice left in the world still he went down to the city and bled em well again in heaps he sent back word by red jacket that if there was war or he died i was to bring the oils along to the city but till then i was to go on working in the garden and red jacket was to see me do it down at heart all indians reckon digging a squaws business and neither him nor cornplanter when he relieved watch was a hard taskmaster we hired a niggerboy to do our work and a lazy grinning runagate he was when i found toby didnt die the minute he reached town why boylike i took him off my mind and went with my indians again oh those days up north at canasedago running races and gambling with the senecas or beehunting in the woods or fishing in the lake pharaoh sighed and looked across the water but its best he went on suddenly after the first frosts you roll out o your blanket and find every leaf left green over night turned red and yellow not by trees at a time but hundreds and hundreds of miles of em like sunsets splattered upside down on one of such daysthe maples was flaming scarlet and gold and the sumach bushes were reddercornplanter and red jacket came out in full wardress making the very leaves look silly feathered warbonnets yellow doeskin leggings fringed and tasselled red horseblankets and their bridles feathered and shelled and beaded no bounds i thought it was war against the british till i saw their faces werent painted and they only carried wristwhips then i hummed yankee doodle at em they told me they was going to visit big hand and find out for sure whether he meant to join the french in fighting the english or make a peace treaty with england i reckon those two would ha gone out on the warpath at a nod from big hand but they knew well if there was war twixt england and the united states their tribe ud catch it from both parties same as in all the other wars they asked me to come along and hold the ponies that puzzled me because they always put their ponies up at the buck or epplys when they went to see general washington in the city and horseholding is a niggers job besides i wasnt exactly dressed for it  dyou mean you were dressed like an indiandan demanded  pharaoh looked a little abashed this didnt happen at lebanon he said but a bit farther north on the reservation and at that particular moment of time so far as blanket hairband moccasins and sunburn went there wasnt much odds twix me and a young seneca buck you may laughhe smoothed down his longskirted brown coatbut i told you i took to their ways all over i said nothing though i was bursting to let out the warwhoop like the young men had taught me  no and you dont let out one here either said puck before dan could ask go on brother squaretoes  we went on pharaohs narrow dark eyes gleamed and danced we went onforty fifty miles a day for days on endwe three braves and how a great tall indian ahorseback can carry his warbonnet at a canter through thick timber without brushing a feather beats me my silly head was banged often enough by low branches but they slipped through like running elk we had evening hymnsinging every night after theyd blown their pipesmoke to the quarters of heaven where did we go ill tell you but dont blame me if youre no wiser we took the old wartrail from the end of the lake along the east susquehanna through the nantego country right down to fort shamokin on the senachse river we crossed the juniata by fort granville got into shippensberg over the hills by the ochwick trail and then to williams ferry its a bad one from williams ferry across the shanedore over the blue mountains through ashbys gap and so southeast by south from there till we found the president at the back of his own plantations id hate to be trailed by indians in earnest they caught him like a partridge on a stump after wed left our ponies we scouted forward through a woody piece and creeping slower and slower at last if my moccasins even slipped red jacket ud turn and frown i heard voicesmonsieur genets for choicelong before i saw anything and we pulled up at the edge of a clearing where some niggers in greyandred liveries were holding horses and halfadozen gentlemenbut one was genetwere talking among felled timber i fancy theyd come to see genet a piece on his road for his portmantle was with him i hid in between two logs as near to the company as i be to that old windlass there i didnt need anybody to show me big hand he stood up very still his legs a little apart listening to genet that french ambassador which never had more manners than a bosham tinker genet was as good as ordering him to declare war on england at once i had heard that clack before on the embuscade he said hed stir up the whole united states to have war with england whether big hand liked it or not  big hand heard him out to the last end i looked behind me and my two chiefs had vanished like smoke says big hand that is very forcibly put monsieur genet  citizencitizen the fellow spits in i at least am a republican  citizen genet he says you may be sure it will receive my fullest consideration this seemed to take citizen genet back a piece he rode off grumbling and never gave his nigger a penny no gentleman  the others all assembled round big hand then and in their way they said pretty much what genet had said they put it to him here was france and england at war in a manner of speaking right across the united states stomach and paying no regards to any one the french was searching american ships on pretence they was helping england but really for to steal the goods the english was doing the same only tother way round and besides searching they was pressing american citizens into their navy to help them fight france on pretence that those americans was lawful british subjects his gentlemen put this very clear to big hand it didnt look to them they said as though the united states trying to keep out of the fight was any advantage to her because she only catched it from both french and english they said that nine out of ten good americans was crazy to fight the english then and there they wouldnt say whether that was right or wrong they only wanted big hand to turn it over in his mind he didfor a while i saw red jacket and cornplanter watching him from the far side of the clearing and how they had slipped round there was another mystery then big hand drew himself up and he let his gentlemen have it  hit em dan asked  no nor yet was it what you might call swearing hehe blasted em with his natural speech he asked them halfadozen times over whether the united states had enough armed ships for any shape or sort of war with any one he asked em if they thought she had those ships to give him those ships and they looked on the ground as if they expected to find em there he put it to em whether setting ships aside their countryi reckon he gave em good reasonswhether the united states was ready or able to face a new big war she having but so few years back wound up one against england and being all holds full of her own troubles as i said the strong way he laid it all before em blasted em and when hed done it was like a still in the woods after a storm a little manbut they all looked littlepipes up like a young rook in a bloweddown nest nevertheless general it seems you will be compelled to fight england quick big hand wheeled on him and is there anything in my past which makes you think i am averse to fighting great britain  everybody laughed except him oh general you mistake us entirely they says i trust so he says but i know my duty we must have peace with england  at any price says the man with the rooks voice  at any price says he word by word our ships will be searchedour citizens will be pressed but  then what about the declaration of independence says one  deal with facts not fancies says big hand the united states are in no position to fight england  but think of public opinion another one starts up the feeling in philadelphia alone is at fever heat  he held up one of his big hands gentlemen he saysslow he spoke but his voice carried fari have to think of our country let me assure you that the treaty with great britain will be made though every city in the union burn me in effigy  at any price the actorlike chap keeps on croaking  the treaty must be made on great britains own terms what else can i do he turns his back on em and they looked at each other and slinked off to the horses leaving him alone and then i saw he was an old man then red jacket and cornplanter rode down the clearing from the far end as though they had just chanced along back went big hands shoulders up went his head and he stepped forward one single pace with a great deep hough so pleased he was that was a statelified meeting to beholdthree big men and two of em looking like jewelled images among the spattle of gaycoloured leaves i saw my chiefs warbonnets sinking together down and down then they made the sign which no indian makes outside of the medicine lodgesa sweep of the right hand just clear of the dust and an inbend of the left knee at the same time and those proud eagle feathers almost touched his boottop  what did it mean said dan  mean pharaoh cried why its what youwhat weits the sachems way of sprinkling the sacred cornmeal in front ofoh its a piece of indian compliment really and it signifies that you are a very big chief  big hand looked down on em first he says quite softly my brothers know it is not easy to be a chief then his voice grew my children says he what is in your minds  says cornplanter we came to ask whether there will be war with king georges men but we have heard what our father has said to his chiefs we will carry away that talk in our hearts to tell to our people  no says big hand leave all that talk behindit was between white men onlybut take this message from me to your peoplethere will be no war  his gentlemen were waiting so they didnt delay him only cornplanter says using his old sidename big hand did you see us among the timber just now  surely says he you taught me to look behind trees when we were both young and with that he cantered off  neither of my chiefs spoke till we were back on our ponies again and a halfhour along the hometrail then cornplanter says to red jacket we will have the corndance this year there will be no war and that was all there was to it  pharaoh stood up as though he had finished  yes said puck rising too and what came out of it in the long run  let me get at my story my own waywas the answer look its later than i thought that shoreham smacks thinking of her supper the children looked across the darkening channel a smack had hoisted a lantern and slowly moved west where brighton pier lights ran out in a twinkling line when they turned round the gap was empty behind them  i expect theyve packed our trunks by now said dan this time tomorrow well be home     if       if you can keep your head when all about you      are losing theirs and blaming it on you      if you can trust yourself

and cover up your face      and after all your trapesings child lie still     a priest in spite of himself   the day after they came home from the seaside they set out on a tour of inspection to make sure everything was as they had left it soon they discovered that old hobden had blocked their best hedgegaps with stakes and thornbundles and had trimmed up the hedges where the blackberries were setting  it cant be time for the gipsies to come along said una why it was summer only the other day  theres smoke in low shaw said dan sniffing lets make sure  they crossed the fields towards the thin line of blue smoke that leaned above the hollow of low shaw which lies beside the kings hill road it used to be an old quarry till somebody planted it and you can look straight down into it from the edge of banky meadow  i thought so dan whispered as they came up to the fence at the edge of the larches a gipsyvannot the showmans sort but the old black kind with little windows high up and a babygate across the doorwas getting ready to leave a man was harnessing the horses an old woman crouched over the ashes of a fire made out of broken fencerails and a girl sat on the vansteps singing to a baby on her lap a wiselooking thin dog snuffed at a patch of fur on the ground till the old woman put it carefully in the middle of the fire the girl reached back inside the van and tossed her a paper parcel this was laid on the fire too and they smelt singed feathers  chicken feathers said dan i wonder if they are old hobdens  una sneezed the dog growled and crawled to the girls feet the old woman fanned the fire with her hat while the man led the horses up to the shafts they all moved as quickly and quietly as snakes over moss  ah said the girl ill teach you she beat the dog who seemed to expect it  dont do that una called down it wasnt his fault  how do you know what im beating him for she answered  for not seeing us said dan he was standing right in the smoke and the wind was wrong for his nose anyhow  the girl stopped beating the dog and the old woman fanned faster than ever  youve fanned some of your feathers out of the fire said una theres a tailfeather by that chestnuttot  what of it said the old woman as she grabbed it  oh nothing said dan only ive heard say that tailfeathers are as bad as the whole bird sometimes  that was a saying of hobdens about pheasants old hobden always burned all feather and fur before he sat down to eat  come on mother the man whispered the old woman climbed into the van and the horses drew it out of the deeprutted shaw on to the hard road  the girl waved her hands and shouted something they could not catch  that was gipsy for thank you kindly brother and sister said pharaoh lee  he was standing behind them his fiddle under his arm gracious you startled me said una  you startled old priscilla savile puck called from below them come and sit by their fire she ought to have put it out before they left  they dropped down the ferny side of the shaw una raked the ashes together dan found a dead wormy oak branch that burns without flame and they watched the smoke while pharaoh played a curious wavery air  thats what the girl was humming to the baby said una  i know ithe nodded and went on       ai lumai lumai lumai  luludia      ai luludia   he passed from one odd tune to another and quite forgot the children at last puck asked him to go on with his adventures in philadelphia and among the seneca indians  im telling it he said staring straight in front of him as he played cant you hear  maybe but they cant tell it aloud said puck  pharaoh shook himself laid his fiddle beside him and began  id left red jacket and cornplanter riding home with me after big hand had said that there wouldnt be any war thats all there was to it we believed big hand and we went home againwe three braves when we reached lebanon we found toby at the cottage with his waistcoat a foot too big for himso hard he had worked amongst the yellowfever people he beat me for running off with the indians but twas worth iti was glad to see himand when we went back to philadelphia for the winter and i was told how hed sacrificed himself over sick people in the yellow fever i thought the world and all of him no i didnt neither id thought that all along that yellow fever must have been something dreadful even in december people had no more than begun to trinkle back to town whole houses stood empty and the niggers was robbing them out but i cant call to mind that any of the moravian brethren had died it seemed like they had just kept on with their own concerns and the good lord hed just looked after em that was the winteryes winter of ninetythreethe brethren bought a stove for the church toby spoke in favour of it because the cold spoiled his fiddle hand but many thought stoveheat not in the bible and there was yet a third party which always brought hickory coal footwarmers to service and wouldnt speak either way they ended by casting the lot for it which is like pitchandtoss after my summer with the senecas churchstoves didnt highly interest me so i took to haunting round among the french emigres which philadelphia was full of my french and my fiddling helped me there dye see they come over in shiploads from france where by what i made out every one was killing every one else by any means and they spread emselves about the citymostly in drinkers alley and elfriths alleyand they did odd jobs till times should mend but whatever they stooped to they were gentry and kept a cheerful countenance and after an evenings fiddling at one of their poor little proud parties the brethren seemed oldfashioned pastor meder and brother adam goos didnt like my fiddling for hire but toby said it was lawful in me to earn my living by exercising my talents he never let me be put upon  in february of ninetyfourno march it must have been because a new ambassador called faucher had come from france with no more manners than genet the old onein march red jacket came in from the reservation bringing news of all kind friends there i showed him round the city and we saw general washington riding through a crowd of folk that shouted for war with england they gave him quite rough music but he looked twixt his horses ears and made out not to notice his stirrup brished red jackets elbow and red jacket whispered up my brother knows it is not easy to be a chief big hand shot just one look at him and nodded then there was a scuffle behind us over some one who wasnt hooting at washington loud enough to please the people we went away to be out of the fight indians wont risk being hit  what do they do if they are dan asked  kill of course thats why they have such proper manners well then coming home by drinkers alley to get a new shirt which a french vicomtes lady was washing to take the stiff out of im always choice in my bodylinen a lame frenchman pushes a paper of buttons at us he hadnt long landed in the united states and please would we buy he surely was a pitiful scrattelhis coat half torn off his face cut but his hands steady so i knew it wasnt drink he said his name was peringuey and hed been knocked about in the crowd round the stadtindependence hall one thing leading to another we took him up to tobys rooms same as red jacket had taken me the year before the compliments he paid to tobys madeira wine fairly conquered the old man for he opened a second bottle and he told this monsieur peringuey all about our great stove dispute in the church i remember pastor meder and brother adam goos dropped in and although they and toby were direct opposite sides regarding stoves yet this monsieur peringuey he made em feel as if he thought each one was in the right of it he said he had been a clergyman before he had to leave france he admired at tobys fiddling and he asked if red jacket sitting by the spinet was a simple huron senecas arent hurons theyre iroquois of course and toby told him so well then in due time he arose and left in a style which made us feel hed been favouring us instead of us feeding him ive never seen that so strong beforein a man we all talked him over but couldnt make head or tail of him and red jacket come out to walk with me to the french quarter where i was due to fiddle at a party passing drinkers alley again we saw a naked window with a light in it and there sat our buttonselling monsieur peringuey throwing dice all alone right hand against left  says red jacket keeping back in the dark look at his face  i was looking i protest to you i wasnt frightened like i was when big hand talked to his gentlemen ii only looked and i wondered that even those dead dumb dice ud dare to fall different from what that face wished itit was a face  he is bad says red jacket but he is a great chief the french have sent away a great chief i thought so when he told us his lies now i know  i had to go on to the party so i asked him to call round for me afterwards and wed have hymnsinging at tobys as usual no he says tell toby i am not christian tonight all indian he had those fits sometimes i wanted to know more about monsieur peringuey and the emigre party was the very place to find out its neither here nor there of course but those french emigre parties they almost make you cry the men that you bought fruit of in market street the hairdressers and fencingmasters and french teachers they turn back again by candlelight to what they used to be at home and you catch their real names there wasnt much room in the washhouse so i sat on top of the copper and played em the tunes they called forsi le roi mavait donne and such nursery stuff they cried sometimes it hurt me to take their money afterwards indeed it did and there i found out about monsieur peringuey he was a proper rogue too none of em had a good word for him except the marquise that kept the french boardinghouse on fourth street i made out that his real name was the count talleyrand de perigorda priest right enough but sorely come down in the world hed been king louis ambassador to england a year or two back before the french had cut off king louis head and by what i heard that head wasnt hardly more than hanging loose before hed run back to paris and prevailed on danton the very man which did the murder to send him back to england again as ambassador of the french republic that was too much for the english so they kicked him out by act of parliament and hed fled to the americas without money or friends or prospects im telling you the talk in the washhouse some of em was laughing over it says the french marquise my friends you laugh too soon that man ll be on the winning side before any of us  i did not know you were so fond of priests marquise says the vicomte his lady did my washing as ive told you  i have my reasons says the marquise he sent my uncle and my two brothers to heaven by the little doorthat was one of the emigre names for the guillotine he will be on the winning side if it costs him the blood of every friend he has in the world  then what does he want here says one of em we have all lost our game  my faith says the marquise he will find out if any one can whether this canaille of a washington means to help us to fight england genet that was my ambassador in the embuscade has failed and gone off disgraced faucher he was the new man hasnt done any better but our abbe will find out and he will make his profit out of the news such a man does not fall  he begins unluckily says the vicomte he was set upon today in the street for not hooting your washington they all laughed again and one remarks how does the poor devil keep himself  he must have slipped in through the washhouse door for he flits past me and joins em cold as ice  one does what one can he says i sell buttons and you marquise  ishe waves her poor white hands all burnedi am a cooka very bad oneat your service abbe we were just talking about you  they didnt treat him like they talked of him they backed off and stood still  i have missed something then he says but i spent this last hour playingonly for buttons marquiseagainst a noble savage the veritable huron himself  you had your usual luck i hope she says  certainly he says i cannot afford to lose even buttons in these days  then i suppose the child of nature does not know that your dice are usually loaded father toutatous she continues i dont know whether she meant to accuse him of cheating he only bows not yet mademoiselle cunegonde he says and goes on to make himself agreeable to the rest of the company and that was how i found out our monsieur peringuey was count charles maurice talleyrand de perigord  pharaoh stopped but the children said nothing  youve heard of him said pharaoh  una shook her head was red jacket the indian he played dice with dan asked  he was red jacket told me the next time we met i asked if the lame man had cheated red jacket said nohe had played quite fair and was a master player i allow red jacket knew ive seen him on the reservation play himself out of everything he had and in again then i told red jacket all id heard at the party concerning talleyrand  i was right he says i saw the mans warface when he thought he was alone thats why i played him i played him face to face hes a great chief do they say why he comes here  they say he comes to find out if big hand makes war against the english i said  red jacket grunted yes he says he asked me that too if he had been a small chief i should have lied but he is a great chief he knew i was a chief so i told him the truth i told him what big hand said to cornplanter and me in the clearingthere will be no war i could not see what he thought i could not see behind his face but he is a great chief he will believe  will he believe that big hand can keep his people back from war i said thinking of the crowds that hooted big hand whenever he rode out  he is as bad as big hand is good but he is not as strong as big hand says red jacket when he talks with big hand he will feel this in his heart the french have sent away a great chief presently he will go back and make them afraid  now wasnt that comical the french woman that knew him and owed all her losses to him the indian that picked him up cut and muddy on the street and played dice with him they neither of em doubted that talleyrand was something by himselfappearances notwithstanding  and was he something by himself asked una  pharaoh began to laugh but stopped the way i look at ithe said talleyrand was one of just three men in this world who are quite by themselves big hand i put first because ive seen him ay said puck im sorry we lost him out of old england who dyou put second  talleyrand maybe because ive seen him too said pharaoh  whos thirdsaid puck  boneyeven though ive seen him  whew said puck every man has his own weights and measures but thats queer reckoning boney said una you dont mean youve ever met napoleon bonaparte  there i knew you wouldnt have patience with the rest of my tale after hearing that but wait a minute talleyrand he come round to hundred and eighteen in a day or two to thank toby for his kindness i didnt mention the diceplaying but i could see that red jackets doings had made talleyrand highly curious about indiansthough he would call him the huron toby as you may believe was all holds full of knowledge concerning their manners and habits he only needed a listener the brethren dont study indians much till they join the church but toby knew em wild so evening after evening talleyrand crossed his sound leg over his game one and toby poured forth having been adopted into the senecas i naturally kept still but toby ud call on me to back up some of his remarks and by that means and a habit he had of drawing you on in talk talleyrand saw i knew something of his noble savages too then he tried a trick coming back from an emigre party he turns into his little shop and puts it to me laughing like that id gone with the two chiefs on their visit to big hand i hadnt told red jacket hadnt told and toby of course didnt know twas just talleyrands guess now he says my english and red jackets french was so bad that i am not sure i got the rights of what the president really said to the unsophisticated huron do me the favour of telling it again i told him every word red jacket had told him and not one word more i had my suspicions having just come from an emigre party where the marquise was hating and praising him as usual  much obliged he said but i couldnt gather from red jacket exactly what the president said to monsieur genet or to his american gentlemen after monsieur genet had ridden away  i saw talleyrand was guessing again for red jacket hadnt told him a word about the white mens powwow  why hadnt he puck asked  because red jacket was a chief he told talleyrand what the president had said to him and cornplanter but he didnt repeat the talk between the white men that big hand ordered him to leave behind oh said puck i see what did you do  first i was going to make some sort of tale round it but talleyrand was a chief too so i said as soon as i get red jackets permission to tell that part of the tale ill be delighted to refresh your memory abbe what else could i have done  is that all he says laughing let me refresh your memory in a month from now i can give you a hundred dollars for your account of the conversation  make it five hundred abbe i says five then says he  that will suit me admirably i says red jacket will be in town again by then and the moment he gives me leave ill claim the money  he had a hard fight to be civil but he come out smiling  monsieur he says i beg your pardon as sincerely as i envy the noble huron your loyalty do me the honour to sit down while i explain  there wasnt another chair so i sat on the buttonbox  he was a clever man he had got hold of the gossip that the president meant to make a peace treaty with england at any cost he had found outfrom genet i reckon who was with the president on the day the two chiefs met him hed heard that genet had had a huff with the president and had ridden off leaving his business at loose ends what he wantedwhat he begged and blustered to knowwas just the very words which the president had said to his gentlemen after genet had left concerning the peace treaty with england he put it to me that in helping him to those very words id be helping three great countries as well as mankind the room was as bare as the palm of your hand but i couldnt laugh at him  im sorry i says when he wiped his forehead as soon as red jacket gives permission  you dont believe me then he cuts in not one little little word abbe i says except that you mean to be on the winning side remember ive been fiddling to all your old friends for months  well then his temper fled him and he called me names  wait a minute cidevant i says at last i am half english and half french but i am not the half of a man i will tell thee something the indian told me has thee seen the president  oh yes he sneers i had letters from the lord lansdowne to that estimable old man  then i says thee will understand the red skin said that when thee has met the president thee will feel in thy heart he is a stronger man than thee  go he whispers before i kill thee go  he looked like it so i left him  why did he want to know so badly said dan  the way i look at it is that if he had known for certain that washington meant to make the peace treaty with england at any price hed ha left old faucher fumbling about in philadelphia while he went straight back to france and told old dantonits no good your wasting time and hopes on the united states because she wont fight on our sidethat ive proof of then danton might have been grateful and given talleyrand a job because a whole mass of things hang on knowing for sure whos your friend and whos your enemy just think of us poor shopkeepers for instance  did red jacket let you tell when he came back una asked  of course not he said when cornplanter and i ask you what big hand said to the whites you can tell the lame chief all that talk was left behind in the timber as big hand ordered tell the lame chief there will be no war he can go back to france with that word  talleyrand and me hadnt met for a long time except at emigre parties when i give him the message he just shook his head he was sorting buttons in the shop  i cannot return to france with nothing better than the word of an unsophisticated savage he says  hasnt the president said anything to you i asked him  he has said everything that one in his position ought to say butbut if only i had what he said to his cabinet after genet rode off i believe i could change europethe world maybe im sorry i says maybe youll do that without my help  he looked at me hard either you have unusual observation for one so young or you choose to be insolent he says  it was intended for a compliment i says but no odds were off in a few days for our summer trip and ive come to make my goodbyes  i go on my travels too he says if ever we meet again you may be sure i will do my best to repay what i owe you  without malice abbe i hope i says  none whatever says he give my respects to your adorable dr pangloss that was one of his sidenames for toby and the huron i never could teach him the difference betwixt hurons and senecas  then sister haga came in for a paper of what we call pilly buttons and that was the last i saw of talleyrand in those parts  but after that you met napoleon didnt you said una wait just a little dearie after that toby and i went to lebanon and the reservation and being older and knowing better how to manage him i enjoyed myself well that summer with fiddling and fun when we came back the brethren got after toby because i wasnt learning any lawful trade and he had hard work to save me from being apprenticed to helmbold and geyer the printers twould have ruined our music together indeed it would and when we escaped that old mattes roush the leatherbreeches maker round the corner took a notion i was cut out for skindressing but we were rescued along towards christmas there comes a big sealed letter from the bank saying that a monsieur talleyrand had put five hundred dollarsa hundred poundsto my credit there to use as i pleased there was a little note from him insidehe didnt give any addressto thank me for past kindnesses and my believing in his future which he said was pretty cloudy at the time of writing i wished toby to share the money i hadnt done more than bring talleyrand up to hundred and eighteen the kindnesses were tobys but toby said no liberty and independence for ever i have all my wants my son so i gave him a set of new fiddlestrings and the brethren didnt advise us any more only pastor meder he preached about the deceitfulness of riches and brother adam goos said if there was war the english ud surely shoot down the bank i knew there wasnt going to be any war but i drew the money out and on red jackets advice i put it into horseflesh which i sold to bob bicknell for the baltimore stagecoaches that way i doubled my money inside the twelvemonth you gipsy you proper gipsy puck shouted  why not twas fair buying and selling well one thing leading to another in a few years i had made the beginning of a worldly fortune and was in the tobacco trade  ah said puck suddenly might i inquire if youd ever sent any news to your people in englandor in france  o course i had i wrote regular every three months after id made money in the horse trade we lees dont like coming home emptyhanded if its only a turnip or an egg its something oh yes i wrote good and plenty to uncle aurette anddad dont read very quicklyuncle used to slip over newhaven way and tell dad what was going on in the tobacco trade  i see       aurettes and lees      like as two peas  go on brother squaretoes said puck pharaoh laughed and went on  talleyrand hed gone up in the world same as me hed sailed to france again and was a great man in the government there awhile but they had to turn him out on account of some story about bribes from american shippers all our poor emigres said he was surely finished this time but red jacket and me we didnt think it likely not unless he was quite dead big hand had made his peace treaty with great britain just as he said he would and there was a roaring trade twixt england and the united states for such as ud take the risk of being searched by british and french menowar those two was fighting and just as his gentlemen told big hand ud happenthe united states was catching it from both if an english manowar met an american ship hed press half the best men out of her and swear they was british subjects most of em was if a frenchman met her hed likely have the cargo out of her swearing it was meant to aid and comfort the english and if a spaniard or a dutchman met herthey was hanging on to englands coattails toolord only knows what they wouldnt do it came over me that what i wanted in my tobacco trade was a fastsailing ship and a man who could be french english or american at a pinch luckily i could lay my hands on both articles so along towards the end of september in the year ninetynine i sailed from philadelphia with a hundred and eleven hogshead o good virginia tobacco in the brig berthe aurette named after mothers maiden name hoping twould bring me luck which she didntand yet she did  where was you bound for puck asked  erany port i found handiest i didnt tell toby or the brethren they dont understand the ins and outs of the tobacco trade  puck coughed a small cough as he shifted a piece of wood with his bare foot  its easy for you to sit and judge pharaoh cried but think o what we had to put up with we spread our wings and run across the broad atlantic like a hen through a horsefair even so we was stopped by an english frigate three days out he sent a boat alongside and pressed seven able seamen i remarked it was hard on honest traders but the officer said they was fighting all creation and hadnt time to argue the next english frigate we escaped with no more than a shot in our quarter then we was chased two days and a night by a french privateer firing between squalls and the dirty little english tengun brig which made him sheer off had the impudence to press another five of our men thats how we reached to the chops of the channel twelve good men pressed out of thirtyfive an eighteenpound shothole close beside our rudder our mainsail looking like spectacles where the frenchman had hit usand the channel crawling with shorthanded british cruisers put that in your pipe and smoke it next time you grumble at the price of tobacco  well then to top it off while we was trying to get at our leaks a french lugger come swooping at us out o the dusk we warned him to keep away but he fell aboard us and up climbed his jabbering redcaps we couldnt endure any moreindeed we couldnt we went at em with all we could lay hands on it didnt last long they was fifty odd to our twentythree pretty soon i heard the cutlasses thrown down and some one bellowed for the sacri captain  here i am i says i dont suppose it makes any odds to you thieves but this is the united states brig berthe aurette  my aunt the man says laughing why is she named that  whos speaking i said twas too dark to see but i thought i knew the voice  enseigne de vaisseau estephe lestrange he sings out and then i was sure  oh i says its all in the family i suppose but you have done a fine days work stephen  he whips out the binnaclelight and holds it to my face he was young lestrange my full cousin that i hadnt seen since the night the smack sank off telscombe tyesix years before  whew he says thats why she was named for aunt berthe is it whats your share in her pharaoh  only half owner but the cargos mine  thats bad he says ill do what i can but you shouldnt have fought us steve i says you arent ever going to report our little fallout as a fight why a revenue cutter ud laugh at it  sod i if i wasnt in the republican navy he says but two of our men are dead dye see and im afraid ill have to take you to the prize court at le havre  will they condemn my baccy i asks  to the last ounce but i was thinking more of the ship shed make a sweet little craft for the navy if the prize court ud let me have her he says  then i knew there was no hope i dont blame hima man must consider his own interests but nigh every dollar i had was in ship or cargo and steve kept on saying you shouldnt have fought us  well then the lugger took us to le havre and that being the one time we did want a british ship to rescue us why o course we never saw one my cousin spoke his best for us at the prize court he owned hed no right to rush alongside in the face o the united states flag but we couldnt get over those two men killed dye see and the court condemned both ship and cargo they was kind enough not to make us prisonersonly beggarsand young lestrange was given the berthe aurette to rearm into the french navy  ill take you round to boulogne he says mother and the restll be glad to see you and you can slip over to newhaven with uncle aurette or you can ship with me like most o your men and take a turn at king georges loose trade theres plenty pickings he says  crazy as i was i couldnt help laughing  ive had my allowance of pickings and stealings i says where are they taking my tobacco twas being loaded on to a barge  up the seine to be sold in paris he says neither you nor i will ever touch a penny of that money  get me leave to go with it i says ill see if theres justice to be gotten out of our american ambassador  theres not much justice in this world he says without a navy but he got me leave to go with the barge and he gave me some money that tobacco was all i had and i followed it like a hound follows a snatched bone going up the river i fiddled a little to keep my spirits up as well as to make friends with the guard they was only doing their duty outside o that they were the reasonablest o gods creatures they never even laughed at me so we come to paris by river along in november which the french had christened brumaire theyd given new names to all the months and after such an outrageous silly piece o business as that they wasnt likely to trouble emselves with my rights and wrongs they didnt the barge was laid up below notre dame church in charge of a caretaker and he let me sleep aboard after id run about all day from office to office seeking justice and fair dealing and getting speeches concerning liberty none heeded me looking back on it i cant rightly blame em id no money my clothes was filthy mucked i hadnt changed my linen in weeks and id no proof of my claims except the ships papers which they said i might have stolen the thieves the doorkeeper to the american ambassadorfor i never saw even the secretaryhe swore i spoke french a sight too well for an american citizen worse than thati had spent my money dye see and ii took to fiddling in the streets for my keep andand a ships captain with a fiddle under his armwell i dont blame em that they didnt believe me  i come back to the barge one daylate in this month brumaire it wasfair beazled out old maingon the caretaker hed lit a fire in a bucket and was grilling a herring  courage mon ami he says dinner is served  i cant eat i says i cant do any more its stronger than i am bah he says nothings stronger than a man me for example less than two years ago i was blown up in the orient in aboukir bay but i descended again and hit the water like a fairy look at me now he says he wasnt much to look at for hed only one leg and one eye but the cheerfullest soul that ever trod shoeleather thats worse than a hundred and eleven hogshead of baccy he goes on youre young too what wouldnt i give to be young in france at this hour theres nothing you couldnt do he says the balls at your feetkick it he says he kicks the old firebucket with his pegleg general buonaparte for example he goes on that mans a babe compared to me and see what hes done already hes conquered egypt and austria and italyoh half europe he says and now he sails back to paris and he sails out to st cloud down the river heredont stare at the river you young fooland all in front of these pigjobbing lawyers and citizens he makes himself consul which is as good as a king hell be king too in the next three turns of the capstanking of france england and the world think o that he shouts and eat your herring  i says something about boney if he hadnt been fighting england i shouldnt have lost my baccyshould i  young fellow says maingon you dont understand  we heard cheering a carriage passed over the bridge with two in it thats the man himself says maingon hell give em something to cheer for soon he stands at the salute  whos tother in black beside him i asks fairly shaking all over  ah hes the clever one youll hear of him before long hes that scoundrelbishop talleyrand  it is i said and up the steps i went with my fiddle and run after the carriage calling abbe abbe  a soldier knocked the wind out of me with the back of his sword but i had sense to keep on following till the carriage stoppedand there just was a crowd round the housedoor i must have been halfcrazy else i wouldnt have struck up si le roi mavait donne paris la grande ville i thought it might remind him  that is a good omen he says to boney sitting all hunched up and he looks straight at me  abbeoh abbe i says dont you remember toby and hundred and eighteen second street  he said not a word he just crooked his long white finger to the guard at the door while the carriage steps were let down and i skipped into the house and they slammed the door in the crowds face you go there says a soldier and shoves me into an empty room where i catched my first breath since id left the barge presently i heard plates rattling next doorthere were only folding doors betweenand a cork drawn i tell you some one shouts with his mouth full it was all that sulky ass sieyes fault only my speech to the five hundred saved the situation  did it save your coat says talleyrand i hear they tore it when they threw you out dont gasconade to me you may be in the road of victory but you arent there yet  then i guessed tother man was boney he stamped about and swore at talleyrand  you forget yourself consul says talleyrand or rather you remember yourselfcorsican  pig says boney and worse  emperor says talleyrand but the way he spoke it sounded worst of all some one must have backed against the folding doors for they flew open and showed me in the middle of the room boney whipped out his pistol before i could stand up  general says talleyrand to him this gentleman has a habit of catching us canaille en deshabille put that thing down  boney laid it on the table so i guessed which was master talleyrand takes my handcharmed to see you again candide he says how is the adorable dr pangloss and the noble huron  they were doing very well when i left i said but im not  do you sell buttons now he says and fills me a glass of wine off the table  madeira says he not so good as some i have drunk  you mountebank boney roars turn that out he didnt even say man but talleyrand being gentle born just went on  pheasant is not so good as pork he says you will find some at that table if you will do me the honour to sit down pass him a clean plate general and as true as im here boney slid a plate along just like a sulky child he was a lankyhaired yellowskinned little man as nervous as a catand as dangerous i could feel that  and now said talleyrand crossing his game leg over his sound one will you tell me your story i was in a fluster but i told him nearly everything from the time he left me the five hundred dollars in philadelphia up to my losing ship and cargo at le havre boney began by listening but after a bit he dropped into his own thoughts and looked at the crowd sideways through the frontroom curtains talleyrand called to him when id done  eh what we need now says boney is peace for the next three or four years  quite so says talleyrand meantime i want the consuls order to the prize court at le havre to restore my friend here his ship  nonsense says boney give away an oakbuilt brig of two hundred and seven tons for sentiment certainly not she must be armed into my navy with tenno fourteen twelvepounders and two long fours is she strong enough to bear a long twelve forward  now i could ha sworn hed paid no heed to my talk but that wonderful headpiece of his seemingly skimmed off every word of it that was useful to him  ah general says talleyrand you are a magiciana magician without morals but the brig is undoubtedly american and we dont want to offend them more than we have  need anybody talk about the affair he says he didnt look at me but i knew what was in his mindjust cold murder because i worried him and hed order it as easy as ordering his carriage  you cant stop em i said theres twentytwo other men besides me i felt a little more ud set me screaming like a wired hare  undoubtedly american talleyrand goes on you would gain something if you returned the shipwith a message of fraternal goodwillpublished in the moniteur thats a french paper like the philadelphia aurora  a good idea boney answers one could say much in a message  it might be useful says talleyrand shall i have the message prepared he wrote something in a little pocket ledger  yesfor me to embellish this evening the moniteur will publish it tonight  certainly sign please says talleyrand tearing the leaf out  but thats the order to return the brig says boney is that necessary why should i lose a good ship havent i lost enough ships already talleyrand didnt answer any of those questions then boney sidled up to the table and jabs his pen into the ink then he shies at the paper again my signature alone is useless he says you must have the other two consuls as well sieyes and roger ducos must sign we must preserve the laws  by the time my friend presents it says talleyrand still looking out of window only one signature will be necessary  boney smiles its a swindle says he but he signed and pushed the paper across  give that to the president of the prize court at le havre says talleyrand and he will give you back your ship i will settle for the cargo myself you have told me how much it cost what profit did you expect to make on it  well then as man to man i was bound to warn him that id set out to run it into england without troubling the revenue and so i couldnt rightly set bounds to my profits  i guessed that all along said puck       there was never a lee to warminghurst      that wasnt a smuggler last and first  the children laughed  its comical enough now said pharaoh but i didnt laugh then says talleyrand after a minute i am a bad accountant and i have several calculations on hand at present shall we say twice the cost of the cargo  say i couldnt say a word i sat choking and nodding like a china image while he wrote an order to his secretary to pay me i wont say how much because you wouldnt believe it  oh bless you abbe god bless you i got it out at last  yes he says i am a priest in spite of myself but they call me bishop now take this for my episcopal blessing and he hands me the paper  he stole all that money from me says boney over my shoulder a bank of france is another of the things we must make are you mad he shouts at talleyrand  quite says talleyrand getting up but be calm the disease will never attack you it is called gratitude this gentleman found me in the street and fed me when i was hungry  i see and he has made a fine scene of it and you have paid him i suppose meantime france waits  oh poor france says talleyrand goodbye candide he says to me by the way he says have you yet got red jackets permission to tell me what the president said to his cabinet after monsieur genet rode away  i couldnt speak i could only shake my head and boneyso impatient he was to go on with his doingshe ran at me and fair pushed me out of the room and that was all there was to it pharaoh stood up and slid his fiddle into one of his big skirtpockets as though it were a dead hare  oh but we want to know lots and lots moresaid dan how you got homeand what old maingon said on the bargeand wasnt your cousin surprised when he had to give back the berthe aurette and  tell us more about toby cried una  yes and red jacket said dan  wont you tell us any more they both pleaded  puck kicked the oak branch on the fire till it sent up a column of smoke that made them sneeze when they had finished the shaw was empty except for old hobden stamping through the larches   they gipsies have took two he said my black pullet and my liddle gingyspeckled cockrel  i thought so said dan picking up one tailfeather that the old woman had overlooked  which way did they go which way did the runagates go said hobden  hobby said una would you like it if we told keeper ridley all your goings and comings     poor honest men        your jar of virginny      will cost you a guinea      which you reckon too much by five shilling or ten      but light your churchwarden      and judge it accordin      when ive told you the troubles of poor honest men       from the capes of the delaware      as you are well aware      we sail with tobacco for englandbut then      our own british cruisers      they watch us come through sirs      and they press half a score of us poor honest men       or if by quick sailing      thick weather prevailing      we leave them behind as we do now and then      we are sure of a gun from      each frigate we run from      which is often destruction to poor honest men       broadsides the atlantic      we tumble shorthanded      with shotholes to plug and new canvas to bend      and off the azores      dutch dons and monsieurs      are waiting to terrify poor honest men       napoleons embargo      is laid on all cargo      which comfort or aid to king george may intend      and since roll twist and leaf      of all comforts is chief      they try for to steal it from poor honest men       with no heart for fight      we take refuge in flight      but fire as we run our retreat to defend      until our sternchasers      cut up her forebraces      and she flies off the wind from us poor honest men       twix the forties and fifties      southeastward the drift is      and so when we think we are making lands end      alas it is ushant      with half the kings navy      blockading french ports against poor honest men       but they may not quit station      which is our salvation      so swiftly we stand to the norard again      and finding the tail of      a homewardbound convoy      we slip past the scillies like poor honest men       twix the lizard and dover      we hand our stuff over      though i may not inform how we do it nor when      but a light on each quarter      low down on the water      is well understanded by poor honest men      even then we have dangers      from meddlesome strangers      who spy on our business and are not content      to take a smooth answer      except with a handspike      and they say they are murdered by poor honest men       to be drowned or be shot      is our natural lot      why should we moreover be hanged in the end      after all our great pains      for to dangle in chains      as though we were smugglers not poor honest men     the conversion of st wilfrid     eddis service        eddi priest of st wilfrid      in the chapel at manhood end      ordered a midnight service      for such as cared to attend      but the saxons were keeping christmas      and the night was stormy as well      nobody came to service      though eddi rang the bell       wicked weather for walking      said eddi of manhood end      but i must go on with the service      for such as care to attend      the altar candles were lighted      an old marsh donkey came      bold as a guest invited      and stared at the guttering flame       the storm beat on at the windows      the water splashed on the floor      and a wet yokeweary bullock      pushed in through the open door      how do i know what is greatest      how do i know what is least      that is my fathers business      said eddi wilfrids priest       but three are gathered together      listen to me and attend      i bring good news my brethren      said eddi of manhood end      and he told the ox of a manger      and a stall in bethlehem      and he spoke to the ass of a rider      that rode to jerusalem       they steamed and dripped in the chancel      they listened and never stirred      while just as though they were bishops      eddi preached them the word       till the gale blew off on the marshes      and the windows showed the day      and the ox and the ass together      wheeled and clattered away       and when the saxons mocked him      said eddi of manhood end      i dare not shut his chapel      on such as care to attend     the conversion of st wilfrid   they had bought peppermints up at the village and were coming home past little st barnabas church when they saw jimmy kidbrooke the carpenters baby kicking at the churchyard gate with a shaving in his mouth and the tears running down his cheeks  una pulled out the shaving and put in a peppermint jimmy said he was looking for his granddaddyhe never seemed to take much notice of his fatherso they went up between the old graves under the leafdropping limes to the porch where jim trotted in looked about the empty church and screamed like a gatehinge  young sam kidbrookes voice came from the belltower and made them jump  why jimmyhe called what are you doin here fetch him father  old mr kidbrooke stumped downstairs jerked jimmy on to his shoulder stared at the children beneath his brass spectacles and stumped back again they laughed it was so exactly like mr kidbrooke  its all right una called up the stairs we found him sam does his mother know  hes come off by himself shell be justabout crazy sam answered  then ill run down street and tell her una darted off  thank you miss una would you like to see how were mendin the bellbeams mus dan  dan hopped up and saw young sam lying on his stomach in a most delightful place among beams and ropes close to the five great bells old mr kidbrooke on the floor beneath was planing a piece of wood and jimmy was eating the shavings as fast as they came away he never looked at jimmy jimmy never stopped eating and the broad giltbobbed pendulum of the church clock never stopped swinging across the whitewashed wall of the tower  dan winked through the sawdust that fell on his upturned face ring a bell he called  i mustnt do that but ill buzz one of em a bit for you said sam he pounded on the soundbow of the biggest bell and waked a hollow groaning boom that ran up and down the tower like creepy feelings down your back just when it almost began to hurt it died away in a hurry of beautiful sorrowful cries like a wineglass rubbed with a wet finger the pendulum clankedone loud clank to each silent swing  dan heard una return from mrs kidbrookes and ran down to fetch her she was standing by the font staring at some one who kneeled at the altarrail  is that the lady who practises the organ she whispered  no shes gone into the organplace besides she wears black dan replied  the figure rose and came down the nave it was a whitehaired man in a long white gown with a sort of scarf looped low on the neck one end hanging over his shoulder his loose long sleeves were embroidered with gold and a deep strip of gold embroidery waved and sparkled round the hem of his gown  go and meet him said pucks voice behind the font its only wilfrid  wilfrid who said dan you come along too  wilfridsaint of sussex and archbishop of york i shall wait till he asks me he waved them forward their feet squeaked on the old graveslabs in the centre aisle the archbishop raised one hand with a pink ring on it and said something in latin he was very handsome and his thin face looked almost as silvery as his thin circle of hair  are you alone he asked  pucks here of course said una do you know him  i know him better now than i used to he beckoned over dans shoulder and spoke again in latin puck pattered forward holding himself as straight as an arrow the archbishop smiled  be welcome said he be very welcome  welcome to you also o prince of the church puck replied  the archbishop bowed his head and passed on till he glimmered like a white moth in the shadow by the font  he does look awfully princely said una isnt he coming back  oh yes hes only looking over the church hes very fond of churches said puck whats that  the lady who practices the organ was speaking to the blowerboy behind the organscreen we cant very well talk here puck whispered lets go to panama corner  he led them to the end of the south aisle where there is a slab of iron which says in queer longtailed letters orate p annema jhone coline the children always called it panama corner  the archbishop moved slowly about the little church peering at the old memorial tablets and the new glass windows the lady who practises the organ began to pull out stops and rustle hymnbooks behind the screen  i hope shell do all the soft lacey tuneslike treacle on porridge said una  i like the trumpety ones best said dan oh look at wilfrid hes trying to shut the altargates  tell him he mustnt said puck quite seriously  he cant anyhow dan muttered and tiptoed out of panama corner while the archbishop patted and patted at the carved gates that always sprang open again beneath his hand  thats no use sir dan whispered old mr kidbrooke says altargates are just the one pair of gates which no man can shut he made em so himself  the archbishops blue eyes twinkled dan saw that he knew all about it  i beg your pardon dan stammeredvery angry with puck  yes i know he made them so himself the archbishop smiled and crossed to panama corner where una dragged up a certain padded armchair for him to sit on  the organ played softly what does that music sayhe asked  una dropped into the chant without thinking o all ye works of the lord bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever we call it the noahs ark because its all lists of thingsbeasts and birds and whales you know  whales said the archbishop quickly  yeso ye whales and all that move in the waters una hummedbless ye the lord it sounds like a wave turning over doesnt it  holy father said puck with a demure face is a little seal also one who moves in the water  eh oh yesyess he laughed a seal moves wonderfully in the waters do the seal come to my island still  puck shook his head all those little islands have been swept away  very possible the tides ran fiercely down there do you know the land of the seacalf maiden  nobut weve seen sealsat brighton  the archbishop is thinking of a little farther down the coast he means seals eyeselseydown chichester waywhere he converted the south saxons puck explained  yesyess if the south saxons did not convert me said the archbishop smiling the first time i was wrecked was on that coast as our ship took ground and we tried to push her off an old fat fellow of a seal i remember reared breasthigh out of the water and scratched his head with his flipper as if he were saying what does that excited person with the pole think he is doing i was very wet and miserable but i could not help laughing till the natives came down and attacked us  what did you do dan asked  one couldnt very well go back to france so one tried to make them go back to the shore all the south saxons are born wreckers like my own northumbrian folk i was bringing over a few things for my old church at york and some of the natives laid hands on them andand im afraid i lost my temper  it is said pucks voice was wickedly meekthat there was a great fight  eh but i must ha been a silly lad wilfrid spoke with a sudden thick burr in his voice he coughed and took up his silvery tones again there was no fight really my men thumped a few of them but the tide rose half an hour before its time with a strong wind and we backed off what i wanted to say though was that the seas about us were full of sleek seals watching the scuffle my good eddimy chaplaininsisted that they were demons yesyess that was my first acquaintance with the south saxons and their seals  but not the only time you were wrecked was it said dan  alas no on sea and land my life seems to have been one long shipwreck he looked at the jhone coline slab as old hobden sometimes looks into the fire ah well  but did you ever have any more adventures among the seals said una after a little  oh the seals i beg your pardon they are the important things yesyess i went back to the south saxons after twelvefifteenyears no i did not come by water but overland from my own northumbria to see what i could do its little one can do with that class of native except make them stop killing each other and themselves why did they kill themselves una asked her chin in her hand  because they were heathen when they grew tired of life as if they were the only people they would jump into the sea they called it going to wotan it wasnt want of food alwaysby any means a man would tell you that he felt grey in the heart or a woman would say that she saw nothing but long days in front of her and theyd saunter away to the mudflats andthat would be the end of them poor souls unless one headed them off one had to run quick but one cant allow people to lay hands on themselves because they happen to feel grey yesyessextraordinary people the south saxons disheartening sometimes what does that say now the organ had changed tune again  only a hymn for next sunday said una the churchs one foundation go on please about running over the mud i should like to have seen you  i dare say you would and i really could run in those days ethelwalch the king gave me some five or six muddy parishes by the sea and the first time my good eddi and i rode there we saw a man slouching along the slob among the seals at manhood end my good eddi disliked sealsbut he swallowed his objections and ran like a hare  whysaid dan  for the same reason that i did we thought it was one of our people going to drown himself as a matter of fact eddi and i were nearly drowned in the pools before we overtook him to cut a long story short we found ourselves very muddy very breathless being quietly made fun of in good latin by a very wellspoken person nohed no idea of going to wotan he was fishing on his own beaches and he showed us the beacons and turfheaps that divided his land from the church property he took us to his own house gave us a good dinner some more than good wine sent a guide with us into chichester and became one of my best and most refreshing friends he was a meon by descent from the west edge of the kingdom a scholar educated curiously enough at lyons my old school had travelled the world over even to rome and was a brilliant talker we found we had scores of acquaintances in common it seemed he was a small chief under king ethelwalch and i fancy the king was somewhat afraid of him the south saxons mistrust a man who talks too well ah now ive left out the very point of my story he kept a great greymuzzled old dogseal that he had brought up from a pup he called it paddaafter one of my clergy it was rather like fat honest old padda the creature followed him everywhere and nearly knocked down my good eddi when we first met him eddi loathed it it used to sniff at his thin legs and cough at him i cant say i ever took much notice of it i was not fond of animals till one day eddi came to me with a circumstantial account of some witchcraft that meon worked he would tell the seal to go down to the beach the last thing at night and bring him word of the weather when it came back meon might say to his slaves padda thinks we shall have wind tomorrow haul up the boats i spoke to meon casually about the story and he laughed  he told me he could judge by the look of the creatures coat and the way it sniffed what weather was brewing quite possible one need not put down everything one does not understand to the work of bad spiritsor good ones for that matter he nodded towards puck who nodded gaily in return  i say so he went on because to a certain extent i have been made a victim of that habit of mind some while after i was settled at selsey king ethelwalch and queen ebba ordered their people to be baptized i fear im too old to believe that a whole nation can change its heart at the kings command and i had a shrewd suspicion that their real motive was to get a good harvest no rain had fallen for two or three years but as soon as we had finished baptizing it fell heavily and they all said it was a miracle  and was it dan asked  everything in life is a miracle butthe archbishop twisted the heavy ring on his fingeri should be slowvery slow should i beto assume that a certain sort of miracle happens whenever lazy and improvident people say they are going to turn over a new leaf if they are paid for it my friend meon had sent his slaves to the font but he had not come himself so the next time i rode overto return a manuscripti took the liberty of asking why he was perfectly open about it he looked on the kings action as a heathen attempt to curry favour with the christians god through me the archbishop and he would have none of it  my dear man i said admitting that that is the case surely you as an educated person dont believe in wotan and all the other hobgoblins any more than padda here the old seal was hunched up on his oxhide behind his masters chair  even if i dont he said why should i insult the memory of my fathers gods i have sent you a hundred and three of my rascals to christen isnt that enough  by no means i answered i want you  he wants us what do you think of that padda he pulled the seals whiskers till it threw back its head and roared and he pretended to interpret no padda says he wont be baptized yet awhile he says youll stay to dinner and come fishing with me tomorrow because youre overworked and need a rest  i wish youd keep yon brute in its proper place i said and eddi my chaplain agreed  i do said meon i keep him just next my heart he cant tell a lie and he doesnt know how to love any one except me it ud be the same if i were dying on a mudbank wouldnt it padda  augh augh said padda and put up his head to be scratched  then meon began to tease eddi padda says if eddi saw his archbishop dying on a mudbank eddi would tuck up his gown and run padda knows eddi can run too padda came into wittering church last sundayall wetto hear the music and eddi ran out  my good eddi rubbed his hands and his shins together and flushed padda is a child of the devil who is the father of lies he cried and begged my pardon for having spoken i forgave him  yes you are just about stupid enough for a musician said meon but here he is sing a hymn to him and see if he can stand it youll find my small harp beside the fireplace  eddi who is really an excellent musician played and sang for quite half an hour padda shuffled off his oxhide hunched himself on his flippers before him and listened with his head thrown back yesyess a rather funny sight meon tried not to laugh and asked eddi if he were satisfied  it takes some time to get an idea out of my good eddis head he looked at me  do you want to sprinkle him with holy water and see if he flies up the chimney why not baptize him said meon  eddi was really shocked i thought it was bad taste myself  thats not fair said meon you call him a demon and a familiar spirit because he loves his master and likes music and when i offer you a chance to prove it you wont take it look here ill make a bargain ill be baptized if youll baptize padda too hes more of a man than most of my slaves  one doesnt bargainor jokeabout these matters i said he was going altogether too far  quite right said meon i shouldnt like any one to joke about padda padda go down to the beach and bring us tomorrows weather  my good eddi must have been a little overtired with his days work i am a servant of the church he cried my business is to save souls not to enter into fellowships and understandings with accursed beasts  have it your own narrow way said meon padda you neednt go the old fellow flounced back to his oxhide at once  man could learn obedience at least from that creature said eddi a little ashamed of himself christians should not curse dont begin to apologise just when i am beginning to like you said meon well leave padda behind tomorrowout of respect to your feelings now lets go to supper we must be up early tomorrow for the whiting  the next was a beautiful crisp autumn morninga weatherbreeder if i had taken the trouble to think but its refreshing to escape from kings and converts for half a day we three went by ourselves in meons smallest boat and we got on the whiting near an old wreck a mile or so off shore meon knew the marks to a yard and the fish were keen yesyess a perfect mornings fishing if a bishop cant be a fisherman who can he twiddled his ring again we stayed there a little too long and while we were getting up our stone down came the fog after some discussion we decided to row for the land the ebb was just beginning to make round the point and sent us all ways at once like a coracle  selsey bill said puck under his breath the tides run something furious there  i believe you said the archbishop meon and i have spent a good many evenings arguing as to where exactly we drifted all i know is we found ourselves in a little rocky cove that had sprung up round us out of the fog and a swell lifted the boat on to a ledge and she broke up beneath our feet we had just time to shuffle through the weed before the next wave the sea was rising its rather a pity we didnt let padda go down to the beach last night said meon he might have warned us this was coming  better fall into the hands of god than the hands of demons said eddi and his teeth chattered as he prayed a norwest breeze had just got updistinctly cool  save what you can of the boat said meon we may need it and we had to drench ourselves again fishing out stray planks  what for said dan  for firewood we did not know when we should get off eddi had flint and steel and we found dry fuel in the old gulls nests and lit a fire it smoked abominably and we guarded it with boatplanks upended between the rocks one gets used to that sort of thing if one travels unluckily im not so strong as i was i fear i must have been a trouble to my friends it was blowing a full gale before midnight eddi wrung out his cloak and tried to wrap me in it but i ordered him on his obedience to keep it however he held me in his arms all the first night and meon begged his pardon for what hed said the night beforeabout eddi running away if he found me on a sandbank you remember you are right in half your prophecy said eddi i have tucked up my gown at any rate the wind had blown it over his head now let us thank god for his mercies  hum said meon if this gale lasts we stand a very fair chance of dying of starvation  if it be gods will that we survive god will provide said eddi at least help me to sing to him the wind almost whipped the words out of his mouth but he braced himself against a rock and sang psalms  im glad i never concealed my opinionfrom myselfthat eddi was a better man than i yet i have worked hard in my timevery hard yesyess so the morning and the evening were our second day on that islet there was rainwater in the rockpools and as a churchman i knew how to fast but i admit we were hungry meon fed our fire chip by chip to eke it out and they made me sit over it the dear fellows when i was too weak to object meon held me in his arms the second night just like a child my good eddi was a little out of his senses and imagined himself teaching a york choir to sing even so he was beautifully patient with them  i heard meon whisper if this keeps up we shall go to our gods i wonder what wotan will say to me he must know i dont believe in him on the other hand i cant do what ethelwalch finds so easycurry favour with your god at the last minute in the hope of being savedas you call it how do you advise bishop my dear man i said if that is your honest belief i take it upon myself to say you had far better not curry favour with any god but if its only your jutish pride that holds you back lift me up and ill baptize you even now  lie still said meon i could judge better if i were in my own hall but to desert ones fathers godseven if one doesnt believe in themin the middle of a gale isnt quitewhat would you do yourself  i was lying in his arms kept alive by the warmth of his big steady heart it did not seem to me the time or the place for subtle arguments so i answered no i certainly should not desert my god i dont see even now what else i could have said  thank you ill remember that if i live said meon and i must have drifted back to my dreams about northumbria and beautiful france for it was broad daylight when i heard him calling on wotan in that high shaking heathen yell that i detest so  lie quiet im giving wotan his chance he said our dear eddi ambled up still beating time to his imaginary choir  yes call on your gods he cried and see what gifts they will send you they are gone on a journey or they are hunting  i assure you the words were not out of his mouth when old padda shot from the top of a cold wrinkled swell drove himself over the weedy ledge and landed fair in our laps with a rockcod between his teeth i could not help smiling at eddis face a miracle a miracle he cried and kneeled down to clean the cod  youve been a long time finding us my son said meon now fishfish for all our lives were starving padda  the old fellow flung himself quivering like a salmon backward into the boil of the currents round the rocks and meon said were safe ill send him to fetch help when this wind drops eat and be thankful  i never tasted anything so good as those rockcodlings we took from paddas mouth and half roasted over the fire between his plunges padda would hunch up and purr over meon with the tears running down his face i never knew before that seals could weep for joyas i have wept  surely said eddi with his mouth full god has made the seal the loveliest of his creatures in the water look how padda breasts the current he stands up against it like a rock now watch the chain of bubbles where he dives and nowthere is his wise head under that rockledge oh a blessing be on thee my little brother padda  you said he was a child of the devil meon laughed there i sinned poor eddi answered call him here and i will ask his pardon god sent him out of the storm to humble me a fool  i wont ask you to enter into fellowships and understandings with any accursed brute said meon rather unkindly shall we say he was sent to our bishop as the ravens were sent to your prophet elijah  doubtless that is so said eddi i will write it so if i live to get home  nono i said let us three poor men kneel and thank god for his mercies  we kneeled and old padda shuffled up and thrust his head under meons elbows i laid my hand upon it and blessed him so did eddi  and now my son i said to meon shall i baptize thee  not yet said he wait till we are well ashore and at home no god in any heaven shall say that i came to him or left him because i was wet and cold i will send padda to my people for a boat is that witchcraft eddi  why no surely padda will go and pull them to the beach by the skirts of their gowns as he pulled me in wittering church to ask me to sing only then i was afraid and did not understand said eddi  you are understanding now said meon and at a wave of his arm off went padda to the mainland making a wake like a warboat till we lost him in the rain meons people could not bring a boat across for some hours even so it was ticklish work among the rocks in that tideway but they hoisted me aboard too stiff to move and padda swam behind us barking and turning somersaults all the way to manhood end  good old padda murmured dan  when we were quite rested and reclothed and his people had been summonednot an hour beforemeon offered himself to be baptized  was padda baptized too una asked  no that was only meons joke but he sat blinking on his oxhide in the middle of the hall when eddi who thought i wasnt looking made a little cross in holy water on his wet muzzle he kissed eddis hand a week before eddi wouldnt have touched him that was a miracle if you like but seriously i was more glad than i can tell you to get meon a rare and splendid soul that never looked backnever looked back the archbishop half closed his eyes  but sir said puck most respectfully havent you left out what meon said afterwards before the bishop could speak he turned to the children and went on meon called all his fishers and ploughmen and herdsmen into the hall and he said listen men two days ago i asked our bishop whether it was fair for a man to desert his fathers gods in a time of danger our bishop said it was not fair you neednt shout like that because you are all christians now my red warboats crew will remember how near we all were to death when padda fetched them over to the bishops islet you can tell your mates that even in that place at that time hanging on the wet weedy edge of death our bishop a christian counselled me a heathen to stand by my fathers gods i tell you now that a faith which takes care that every man shall keep faith even though he may save his soul by breaking faith is the faith for a man to believe in so i believe in the christian god and in wilfrid his bishop and in the church that wilfrid rules you have been baptized once by the kings orders i shall not have you baptized again but if i find any more old women being sent to wotan or any girls dancing on the sly before balder or any men talking about thun or lok or the rest i will teach you with my own hands how to keep faith with the christian god go out quietly youll find a couple of beefs on the beach then of course they shouted hurrah which meant thor help us andi think you laughed sir  i think you remember it all too well said the archbishop smiling it was a joyful day for me i had learned a great deal on that rock where padda found us yesyess one should deal kindly with all the creatures of god and gently with their masters but one learns late  he rose and his goldembroidered sleeves rustled thickly  the organ cracked and took deep breaths  wait a minute dan whispered shes going to do the trumpety one it takes all the wind you can pump its in latin sir  there is no other tongue the archbishop answered  its not a real hymn una explained she does it as a treat after her exercises she isnt a real organist you know she just comes down here sometimes from the albert hall  oh what a miracle of a voice said the archbishop  it rang out suddenly from a dark arch of lonely noisesevery word spoken to the very end       dies irae dies illa      solvet saeclum in favilla      teste david cum sibylla the archbishop caught his breath and moved forward the music carried on by itself a while  now its calling all the light out of the windows una whispered to dan  i think its more like a horse neighing in battle he whispered back the voice continued       tuba mirum spargens sonum      per sepulchre regionum  deeper and deeper the organ dived down but far below its deepest note they heard pucks voice joining in the last line       coget omnes ante thronum  as they looked in wonder for it sounded like the dull jar of one of the very pillars shifting the little fellow turned and went out through the south door  nows the sorrowful part but its very beautiful una found herself speaking to the empty chair in front of her  what are you doing that for dan said behind her you spoke so politely too  i dont know i thought said una funny  tisnt its the part you like best dan grunted  the music had turned softfull of little sounds that chased each other on wings across the broad gentle flood of the main tune but the voice was ten times lovelier than the music       recordare jesu pie      quod sum causa tuae viae      ne me perdas illi die  there was no more they moved out into the centre aisle  that you the lady called as she shut the lid i

hideandseek with bicycle lamps after tea dan had hung his lamp on the apple tree at the end of the hellebore bed in the walled garden and was crouched by the gooseberry bushes ready to dash off when una should spy him he saw her lamp come into the garden and disappear as she hid it under her cloak while he listened for her footsteps somebody they both thought it was phillips the gardener coughed in the corner of the herbbeds  all right una shouted across the asparagus we arent hurting your old beds phippsey  she flashed her lantern towards the spot and in its circle of light they saw a guy fawkeslooking man in a black cloak and a steeplecrowned hat walking down the path beside puck they ran to meet him and the man said something to them about rooms in their head after a time they understood he was warning them not to catch colds  youve a bit of a cold yourself havent you said una for he ended all his sentences with a consequential cough puck laughed  child the man answered if it hath pleased heaven to afflict me with an infirmity  nay nay puck struck in the maid spoke out of kindness i know that half your cough is but a catch to trick the vulgar and thats a pity theres honesty enough in you nick without rasping and hawking  good peoplethe man shrugged his lean shouldersthe vulgar crowd love not truth unadorned wherefore we philosophers must needs dress her to catch their eye orahemtheir ear  and what dyou think of that said puck solemnly to dan  i dont know he answered it sounds like lessons  ahwell there have been worse men than nick culpeper to take lessons from now where can we sit thats not indoors  in the haymow next to old middenboro dan suggested he doesnt mind  eh mr culpeper was stooping over the pale hellebore blooms by the light of unas lamp does master middenboro need my poor services then  save him no said puck he is but a horsenext door to an ass as youll see presently come  their shadows jumped and slid on the fruittree walls they filed out of the garden by the snoring pigpound and the crooning henhouse to the shed where middenboro the old lawnmower pony lives his friendly eyes showed green in the light as they set their lamps down on the chickens drinkingtrough outside and pushed past to the haymow mr culpeper stooped at the door  mind where you lie said dan this hays full of hedgebrishings  in in said puck youve lain in fouler places than this nick ah let us keep touch with the stars he kicked open the top of the halfdoor and pointed to the clear sky there be the planets you conjure with what does your wisdom make of that wandering and variable star behind those apple boughs  the children smiled a bicycle that they knew well was being walked down the steep lane where mr culpeper leaned forward quickly that some countrymans lantern  wrong nick said puck tis a singular bright star in virgo declining towards the house of aquarius the watercarrier who hath lately been afflicted by gemini arent i right una mr culpeper snorted contemptuously  no its the village nurse going down to the mill about some fresh twins that came there last week nurse una called as the light stopped on the flat when can i see the morris twins and how are they  next sunday perhaps doing beautifully the nurse called back and with a pingpingping of the bell brushed round the corner  her uncles a vetinary surgeon near banbury una explained and if you ring her bell at night it rings right beside her bednot downstairs at all then she umps upshe always keeps a pair of dry boots in the fender you knowand goes anywhere shes wanted we help her bicycle through gaps sometimes most of her babies do beautifully she told us so herself  i doubt not then that she reads in my books said mr culpeper quietly twins at the mill he muttered half aloud and again he sayeth return ye children of men  are you a doctor or a rector una asked and puck with a shout turned head over heels in the hay but mr culpeper was quite serious he told them that he was a physicianastrologera doctor who knew all about the stars as well as all about herbs for medicine he said that the sun the moon and five planets called jupiter mars mercury saturn and venus governed everybody and everything in the world they all lived in houseshe mapped out some of them against the dark with a busy forefingerand they moved from house to house like pieces at draughts and they went loving and hating each other all over the skies if you knew their likes and dislikes he said you could make them cure your patient and hurt your enemy and find out the secret causes of things he talked of these five planets as though they belonged to him or as though he were playing long games against them the children burrowed in the hay up to their chins and looked out over the halfdoor at the solemn starpowdered sky till they seemed to be falling upside down into it while mr culpeper talked about trines and oppositions and conjunctions and sympathies and antipathies in a tone that just matched things  a rat ran between middenboros feet and the old pony stamped  mid hates rats said dan and passed him over a lock of hay i wonder why  divine astrology tells us said mr culpeper the horse being a martial beast that beareth man to battle belongs naturally to the red planet marsthe lord of war i would show you him but hes too near his setting rats and mice doing their businesses by night come under the dominion of our lady the moon now between mars and luna the one red tother white the one hot tother cold and so forth stands as i have told you a natural antipathy or as you say hatred which antipathy their creatures do inherit whence good people you may both see and hear your cattle stamp in their stalls for the selfsame causes as decree the passages of the stars across the unalterable face of heaven ahem puck lay along chewing a leaf they felt him shake with laughter and mr culpeper sat up stiffly  i myself said he have saved mens lives and not a few neither by observing at the proper timethere is a time mark you for all things under the sunby observing i say so small a beast as a rat in conjunction with so great a matter as this dread arch above us he swept his hand across the sky yet there are those he went on sourly who have years without knowledge  right said puck no fool like an old fool  mr culpeper wrapped his cloak round him and sat still while the children stared at the great bear on the hilltop  give him time puck whispered behind his hand he turns like a timbertugall of a piece  ahem mr culpeper said suddenly ill prove it to you when i was physician to sayes horse and fought the kingor rather the man charles stuartin oxfordshire i had my learning at cambridge the plague was very hot all around us i saw it at close hands he who says i am ignorant of the plague for example is altogether beside the bridge  we grant it said puck solemnly but why talk of the plague this rare night  to prove my argument this oxfordshire plague good people being generated among rivers and ditches was of a werish watery nature therefore it was curable by drenching the patient in cold water and laying him in wet cloths or at least so i cured some of them mark this it bears on what shall come after  mark also nick said puck that we are not your college of physicians but only a lad and a lass and a poor lubberkin therefore be plain old hyssop on the wall  to be plain and in order with you i was shot in the chest while gathering of betony from a brookside near thame and was took by the kings men before their colonel one blagg or bragge whom i warned honestly that i had spent the week past among our plaguestricken he flung me off into a cowshed much like this here to die as i supposed but one of their priests crept in by night and dressed my wound he was a sussex man like myself  who was that said puck suddenly zack tutshom  no jack marget said mr culpeper  jack marget of new college the little merry man that stammered so why a plague was stuttering jack at oxford then said puck  he had come out of sussex in hope of being made a bishop when the king should have conquered the rebels as he styled us parliament men his college had lent the king some monies too which they never got again no more than simple jack got his bishopric when we met he had had a bitter bellyful of kings promises and wished to return to his wife and babes this came about beyond expectation for so soon as i could stand of my wound the man blagge made excuse that i had been among the plague and jack had been tending me to thrust us both out from their camp the king had done with jack now that jacks college had lent the money and blagges physician could not abide me because i would not sit silent and see him butcher the sick he was a college of physicians man so blagge i say thrust us both out with many vile words for a pair of pestilent prating pragmatical rascals  ha called you pragmatical nick puck started up high time oliver came to purge the land how did you and honest jack fare next  we were in some sort constrained to each others company i was for going to my house in spitalfields he would go to his parish in sussex but the plague was broke out and spreading through wiltshire berkshire and hampshire and he was so mad distracted to think that it might even then be among his folk at home that i bore him company he had comforted me in my distress i could not have done less and i remembered that i had a cousin at great wigsell near by jacks parish thus we footed it from oxford cassock and buff coat together resolute to leave wars on the left side henceforth and either through our mean appearances or the plague making men less cruel we were not hindered to be sure they put us in the stocks one halfday for rogues and vagabonds at a village under st leonards forest where as i have heard nightingales never sing but the constable very honestly gave me back my astrological almanac which i carry with me mr culpeper tapped his thin chest i dressed a whitlow on his thumb so we went forward  not to trouble you with impertinences we fetched over against jack margets parish in a storm of rain about the days end here our roads divided for i would have gone on to my cousin at great wigsell but while jack was pointing me out his steeple we saw a man lying drunk as he conceived athwart the road he said it would be one hebden a parishioner and till then a man of good life and he accused himself bitterly for an unfaithful shepherd that had left his flock to follow princes but i saw it was the plague and not the beginnings of it neither they had set out the plaguestone and the mans head lay on it  whats a plaguestone dan whispered  when the plague is so hot in a village that the neighbours shut the roads against em people set a hollowed stone pot or pan where such as would purchase victual from outside may lay money and the paper of their wants and depart those that would sell come laterwhat will a man not do for gainsnatch the money forth and leave in exchange such goods as their conscience reckons fair value i saw a silver groat in the water and the mans list of what he would buy was rainpulped in his wet hand  my wife oh my wife and babes says jack of a sudden and makes uphilli with him  a woman peers out from behind a barn crying out that the village is stricken with the plague and that for our lives sake we must avoid it  sweetheart says jack must i avoid thee and she leaps at him and says the babes are safe she was his wife  when he had thanked god even to tears he tells me this was not the welcome he had intended and presses me to flee the place while i was clean  nay the lord do so to me and more also if i desert thee now i said these affairs are under gods leave in some fashion my strength  oh sir she says are you a physician we have none  then good people said i i must een justify myself to you by my works  looklook ye stammers jack i took you all this time for a crazy roundhead preacher he laughs and she and then iall three together in the rain are overtook by an unreasonable gust or clap of laughter which none the less eased us we call it in medicine the hysterical passion so i went home with em  why did you not go on to your cousin at great wigsell nick puck suggested tis barely seven mile up the road  but the plague was here mr culpeper answered and pointed up the hill what else could i have done  what were the parsons children called said una  elizabeth alison stephen and charlesa babe i scarce saw them at first for i separated to live with their father in a cartlodge the mother we putforcedinto the house with her babes she had done enough  and now good people give me leave to be particular in this case the plague was worst on the north side of the street for lack as i showed em of sunshine which proceeding from the prime mobile or source of life i speak astrologically is cleansing and purifying in the highest degree the plague was hot too by the cornchandlers where they sell forage to the carters extreme hot in both mills along the river and scatteringly in other places except mark you at the smithy mark here that all forges and smith shops belong to mars even as corn and meat and wine shops acknowledge venus for their mistress there was no plague in the smithy at mundays lane  mundays lane you mean our village i thought so when you talked about the two mills cried dan where did we put the plaguestone id like to have seen it  then look at it now said puck and pointed to the chickens drinkingtrough where they had set their bicycle lamps it was a rough oblong stone pan rather like a small kitchen sink which phillips who never wastes anything had found in a ditch and had used for his precious hens  that said dan and una and stared and stared and stared mr culpeper made impatient noises in his throat and went on  i am at these pains to be particular good people because i would have you follow so far as you may the operations of my mind that plague which i told you i had handled outside wallingford in oxfordshire was of a watery nature conformable to the brookish riverine country it bred in and curable as i have said by drenching in water this plague of ours here for all that it flourished along watercoursesevery soul at both mills died of itcould not be so handled which brought me to a stand ahem  and your sick people in the meantimepuck demanded we persuaded them on the north side of the street to lie out in hitherams field where the plague had taken one or at most two in a house folk would not shift for fear of thieves in their absence they cast away their lives to die among their goods  human nature said puck ive seen it time and again how did your sick do in the fields  they died not near so thick as those that kept within doors and even then they died more out of distraction and melancholy than plague but i confess good people i could not in any sort master the sickness or come at a glimmer of its nature or governance to be brief i was flat bewildered at the brute malignity of the disease and sodid what i should have done beforedismissed all conjectures and apprehensions that had grown up within me chose a good hour by my almanac clapped my vinegarcloth to my face and entered some empty houses resigned to wait upon the stars for guidance  at night were you not horribly frightened said puck  i dared to hope that the god who hath made man so nobly curious to search out his mysteries might not destroy a devout seeker in due timetheres a time as i have said for everything under the suni spied a whitish rat very puffed and scabby which sat beneath the dormer of an attic through which shined our lady the moon whilst i looked on himand hershe was moving towards old cold saturn her ancient allythe rat creeped languishingly into her light and there before my eyes died presently his mate or companion came out laid him down beside there and in like fashion died too lateran hour or less to midnighta third rat did een the same always choosing the moonlight to die in this threw me into an amaze since as we know the moonlight is favourable not hurtful to the creatures of the moon and saturn being friends with her as you would say was hourly strengthening her evil influence yet these three rats had been stricken dead in very moonlight i leaned out of the window to see which of heavens host might be on our side and there beheld i good trusty mars very red and heated bustling about his setting i straddled the roof to see better  jack marget came up street going to comfort our sick in hitherams field a tile slipped under my foot  says he heavily enough watchman what of the night  heart up jack says i methinks theres one fighting for us that like a fool ive forgot all this summer my meaning was naturally the planet mars  pray to him then says he i forgot him too this summer  he meant god whom he always bitterly accused himself of having forgotten up in oxfordshire among the kings men i called down that he had made amends enough for his sin by his work among the sick but he said he would not believe so till the plague was lifted from em he was at his strengths endmore from melancholy than any just cause i have seen this before among priests and overcheerful men i drenched him then and there with a halfcup of waters which i do not say cure the plague but are excellent against heaviness of the spirits  what were they said dan  white brandy rectified camphor cardamoms ginger two sorts of pepper and aniseed whew said puck waters you call em  jack coughed on it valiantly and went downhill with me i was for the lower mill in the valley to note the aspect of the heavens my mind had already shadowed forth the reason if not the remedy for our troubles but i would not impart it to the vulgar till i was satisfied that practice may be perfect judgment ought to be sound and to make judgment sound is required an exquisite knowledge ahem i left jack and his lantern among the sick in hitherams field he still maintained the prayers of the socalled church which were rightly forbidden by cromwell  you should have told your cousin at wigsell said puck and jack would have been fined for it and youd have had half the money how did you come so to fail in your duty nick  mr culpeper laughedhis only laugh that eveningand the children jumped at the loud neigh of it  we were not fearful of mens judgment in those days he answered now mark me closely good people for what follows will be to you though not to me remarkable when i reached the empty mill old saturn low down in the house of the fishes threatened the suns risingplace our lady the moon was moving towards the help of him understand i speak astrologically i looked abroad upon the high heavens and i prayed the maker of em for guidance now mars sparkingly withdrew himself below the sky on the instant of his departure which i noted a bright star or vapour leaped forth above his head as though he had heaved up his sword and broke all about in fire the cocks crowed midnight through the valley and i sat me down by the millwheel chewing spearmint though thats an herb of venus and calling myself all the asses heads in the world twas plain enough now  what was plain said una  the true cause and cure of the plague mars good fellow had fought for us to the uttermost faint though he had been in the heavens and this had made me overlook him in my computations he more than any of the other planets had kept the heavenswhich is to say had been visible some part of each night wellnigh throughout the year therefore his fierce and cleansing influence warring against the moon had stretched out to kill those three rats under my nose and under the nose of their natural mistress the moon i had known mars lean half across heaven to deal our lady the moon some shrewd blow from under his shield but i had never before seen his strength displayed so effectual  i dont understand a bit do you mean mars killed the rats because he hated the moon said una  that is as plain as the pikestaff with which blagges men pushed me forthmr culpeper answered ill prove it why had the plague not broken out at the blacksmiths shop in mundays lane because as ive shown you forges and smithies belong naturally to mars and for his honours sake mars ud keep em clean from the creatures of the moon but was it like think you that hed come down and ratcatch in general for lazy ungrateful mankind that were working a willing horse to death so then you can see that the meaning of the blazing star above him when he set was simply this destroy and burn the creatures of the moon for they are the root of your trouble and thus having shown you a taste of my power good people adieu  did mars really say all that una whispered  yes and twice so much as that to any one who had ears to hear briefly he enlightened me that the plague was spread by the creatures of the moon the moon our lady of illaspect was the offender my own poor wits showed me that i nick culpeper had the people in my charge gods good providence aiding me and no time to lose neither  i posted up the hill and broke into hitherams field amongst em all at prayers  eureka good people i cried and cast down a dead millrat which id found heres your true enemy revealed at last by the stars  nay but im praying says jack his face was as white as washed silver  theres a time for everything under the sun says i if you would stay the plague take and kill your rats  oh mad stark mad says he and wrings his hands  a fellow lay in the ditch beside him who bellows that hed as soon die mad hunting rats as be preached to death on a cold fallow they laughed round him at this but jack marget falls on his knees and very presumptuously petitions that he may be appointed to die to save the rest of his people this was enough to thrust em back into their melancholy you are an unfaithful shepherd jack i says take a bat which we call a stick in sussex and kill a rat if you die before sunrise twill save your people  aye aye take a bat and kill a rat he says ten times over like a child which moved em to ungovernable motions of that hysterical passion before mentioned so that they laughed all and at least warmed their chill bloods at that very hourone oclock or a little afterwhen the fires of life burn lowest truly there is a time for everything and the physician must work with itahemor miss his cure to be brief with you i persuaded em sick or sound to have at the whole generation of rats throughout the village and theres a reason for all things too though the wise physician need not blab em all imprimis or firstly the mere sport of it which lasted ten days drew em most markedly out of their melancholy id defy sorrowful job himself to lament or scratch while hes routing rats from a rick secundo or secondly the vehement act and operation of this chase or war opened their skins to generous transpirationmore vulgarly sweated em handsomely and this further drew off their black bilethe mother of sickness thirdly when we came to burn the bodies of the rats i sprinkled sulphur on the faggots whereby the onlookers were as handsomely suffumigated this i could not have compassed if i had made it a mere physicians business theyd have thought it some conjuration yet more we cleansed limed and burned out a hundred foul pokeholes sinks slews and corners of unvisited filth in and about the houses in the village and by good fortune mark here that mars was in opposition to venus burned the cornhandlers shop to the ground mars loves not venus will noakes the saddler dropped his lantern on a truss of straw while he was rathunting there  had ye given will any of that gentle cordial of yours nick by any chance said puck  a glassor two glassesnot more but as i would say in fine when we had killed the rats i took ash slag and charcoal from the smithy and burnt earth from the brickyard i reason that a brickyard belongs to mars and rammed it with iron crowbars into the ratruns and buries and beneath all the house floors the creatures of the moon hate all that mars hath used for his own clean ends for examplerats bite not iron  and how did poor stuttering jack endure it said puck  he sweated out his melancholy through his skin and catched a loose cough which i cured with electuaries according to art it is noteworthy were i speaking among my equals that the venom of the plague translated or turned itself into and evaporated or went away as a very heavy hoarseness and thickness of the head throat and chest observe from my books which planets govern these portions of mans body and your darkness good people shall be illuminatedahem none the less the plague qua plague ceased and took off for we only lost three more and two of em had it already on em from the morning of the day that mars enlightened me by the lower mill he coughedalmost trumpetedtriumphantly  it is proved he jerked out i say i have proved my contention which is that by divine astrology and humble search into the veritable causes of thingsat the proper timethe sons of wisdom may combat even the plague  hm puck replied for my own part i hold that a simple soul  mine simple forsooth said mr culpeper  a very simple soul a high courage tempered with sound and stubborn conceit is stronger than all the stars in their courses so i confess truly that you saved the village nick  i stubborn i stiffnecked i ascribed all my poor success under gods good providence to divine astrology not to me the glory you talk as that dear weeping ass jack marget preached before i went back to my work in red lion house spitalfields  oh stammering jack preached did he they say he loses his stammer in the pulpit  and his wits with it he delivered a most idolatrous discourse when the plague was stayed he took for his text the wise man that delivered the city i could have given him a better such as there is a time for  but what made you go to church to hear him puck interrupted wail attersole was your lawfully appointed preacher and a dull dog he was  mr culpeper wriggled uneasily  the vulgar said he the old crones andahemthe children alison and the others they dragged me to the house of rimmon by the hand i was in two minds to inform on jack for maintaining the mummeries of the falselycalled church which ill prove to you are founded merely on ancient fables  stick to your herbs and planets said puck laughing you should have told the magistrates nick and had jack fined again why did you neglect your plain duty  becausebecause i was kneeling and praying and weeping with the rest of em at the altarrails in medicine this is called the hysterical passion it may beit may be  thats as may be said puck they heard him turn the hay why your hay is half hedgebrishings he said you dont expect a horse to thrive on oak and ash and thorn

sunday  what what they both leaned forward across the halfdoor it could not have been properly fastened for it opened and tilted them out with hay and leaves sticking all over them  come on we must

you please      whence enormous and manifold      errors were made by our fathers of old       yet when the sickness was sore in the land      and neither planet nor herb assuaged      they took their

much      that those afflicted by doubts and dismays      are mightily helped by a dead mans touch      then be good to us stars above      then be good to us herbs below      we are afflicted by what we can prove      we are distracted by what we know      soah so      down from your heaven or up from your mould      send us the hearts of our fathers of old     simple simon     the thousandth man        one man in a thousand solomon says        will stick more close than a brother      and its worth while seeking him half your days        if you find him before the other      nine hundred and

cattiwow came down the steep lane with his fivehorse timbertug he stopped by the woodlump at the back gate to take off the brakes his real name was brabon but the first time the children met him years and years ago he told them he was carting wood and it sounded so exactly like cattiwow that they never called him anything else  hi una shouted from the top of the woodlump where they had been watching the lane what are you doing why werent we told  theyve just sent for me cattiwow answered theres a middlin big log stacked in the dirt at rabbit shaw andhe flicked his whip back along the lineso theyve sent for us all  dan and una threw themselves off the woodlump almost under black sailors nose cattiwow never let them ride the big beam that makes the body of the timbertug but they hung on behind while their teeth thuttered  the wood road beyond the brook climbs at once into the woods and you see all the horses backs rising one above another like moving stairs cattiwow strode ahead in his sackcloth woodmans petticoat belted at the waist with a leather strap and when he turned and grinned his red lips showed under his sackclothcoloured beard his cap was sackcloth too with a flap behind to keep twigs and bark out of his neck he navigated the tug among pools of heatherwater that splashed in their faces and through clumps of young birches that slashed at their legs and when they hit an old toadstooled stump they never knew whether it would give way in showers of rotten wood or jar them back again  at the top of rabbit shaw halfadozen men and a team of horses stood round a fortyfoot oak log in a muddy hollow the ground about was poached and stoached with sliding hoofmarks and a wave of dirt was driven up in front of the butt  what did you want to bury her for this way said cattiwow he took his broadaxe and went up the log tapping it  shes sticked fast said bunny lewknor who managed the other team  cattiwow unfastened the five wise horses from the tug they cocked their ears forward looked and shook themselves  i believe sailor knows dan whispered to una  he do said a man behind them he was dressed in flour sacks like the others and he leaned on his broadaxe but the children who knew all the woodgangs knew he was a stranger in his size and oily hairiness he might have been bunny lewknors brother except that his brown eyes were as soft as a spaniels and his rounded black beard beginning close up under them reminded una of the walrus in the walrus and the carpenter  dont he justabout know he said shyly and shifted from one foot to the other  yes what cattiwow cant get out of the woods must have roots growing to her dan had heard old hobden say this a few days before  at that minute puck pranced up picking his way through the pools of black water in the ling  look out cried una jumping forward hell see you puck  me and mus robin are pretty middlin well acquainted the man answered with a smile that made them forget all about walruses  this is simon cheyneys puck began and cleared his throat shipbuilder of rye port burgess of the said town and the only  oh look look ye thats a knowing one said the man  cattiwow had fastened his team to the thin end of the log and was moving them about with his whip till they stood at right angles to it heading downhill then he grunted the horses took the strain beginning with sailor next the log like a tugofwar team and dropped almost to their knees the log shifted a nails breadth in the clinging dirt with the noise of a giants kiss  youre getting her simon cheyneys slapped his knee hing on hing on lads or shell master ye ah  sailors left hind hoof had slipped on a heathertuft one of the men whipped off his sack apron and spread it down they saw sailor feel for it and recover still the log hung and the team grunted in despair  hai shouted cattiwow and brought his dreadful whip twice across sailors loins with the crack of a shotgun the horse almost screamed as he pulled that extra last ounce which he did not know was in him the thin end of the log left the dirt and rasped on dry gravel the butt ground round like a buffalo in his wallow quick as an axecut lewknor snapped on his five horses and sliding trampling jingling and snorting they had the whole thing out on the heather  dats the very first time ive knowed you lay into sailorto hurt him said lewknor  it is said cattiwow and passed his hand over the two wheals but id ha laid my own brother open at that pinch now well twitch her down the hill a pieceshe lies just about rightand get her home by the low road my teamll do it bunny you bring the tug along mind out  he spoke to the horses who tightened the chains the great log half rolled over and slowly drew itself out of sight downhill followed by the woodgang and the timbertug in half a minute there was nothing to see but the deserted hollow of the tornup dirt the birch undergrowth still shaking and the water draining back into the hoofprints  ye heard him simon cheyneys asked he cherished his horse but hed ha laid him open in that pinch  not for his own advantage said puck quickly twas only to shift the log  i reckon every man born of woman has his log to shift in the worldif so be youre hintin at any o frankies doings he never hit beyond reason or without reason said simon  i never said a word against frankie puck retorted with a wink at the children an if i did do it lie in your mouth to contest my sayso seeing how you  why dont it lie in my mouth seeing i was the first which knowed frankie for all he was the burly sackclad man puffed down at cool little puck  yes and the first which set out to poison himfrankieon the high seas  simons angry face changed to a sheepish grin he waggled his immense hands but puck stood off and laughed mercilessly  but let me tell you mus robinhe pleaded  ive heard the tale tell the children here look dan look unapucks straight brown finger levelled like an arrow theres the only man that ever tried to poison sir francis drake  oh mus robin tidnt fair youve the vantage of us all in your upbringins by hundreds o years stands to nature you know all the tales against every one  he turned his soft eyes so helplessly on una that she cried stop ragging him puck you know he didnt really  i do but why are you so sure little maid becausebecause he doesnt look like it said una stoutly  i thank you said simon to una ii was always trustablelike with children if you let me alone you double handful o mischief he pretended to heave up his axe on puck and then his shyness overtook him afresh  where did you know sir francis drake said dan not liking being called a child  at rye port to be sure said simon and seeing dans bewilderment repeated it  yes but look heresaid dan drake he was a devon man the song says so  and ruled the devon seas una went on thats what i was thinkingif you dont mind  simon cheyneys seemed to mind very much indeed for he swelled in silence while puck laughed  hutt he burst out at last ive heard that talk too if you listen to them west country folk youll listen to a pack o lies i believe frankie was born somewhere out west among the shires but his father had to run for it when frankie was a baby because the neighbours was wishful to kill him dye see he run to chatham old parson drake did an frankie was brought up in a old hulks of a ship moored in the medway river same as it might ha been the rother brought up at sea you might say before he could walk on landnigh chatham in kent and aint kent backdoor to sussex and dont that make frankie sussex o course it do devon man bah those west country boats theyre always fishin in other folks water  i beg your pardon said dan im sorry  no call to be sorry youve been misled i met frankie at rye port when my uncle that was the shipbuilder there pushed me off his wharfedge on to frankies ship frankie had put in from chatham with his rudder splutted and a mans armmoons that ud bebroken at the tiller take this boy aboard an drown him says my uncle and ill mend your rudderpiece for love  what did your uncle want you drowned forsaid una  that was only his fashion of sayso same as mus robin id a foolishness in my head that ships could be builded out of iron yesiron ships id made me a liddle toy one of iron plates beat out thinand she floated a wonder but my uncle bein a burgess of rye and a shipbuilder he prenticed me to frankie in the fetchin trade to cure this foolishness  what was the fetchin trade dan interrupted  fetchin poor flemishers and dutchmen out o the low countries into england the king o spain dye see he was burnin em in those parts for to make em papishers so frankie he fetched em away to our parts and a risky trade it was his master wouldnt never touch it while he lived but he left his ship to frankie when he died and frankie turned her into this fetchin trade outrageous cruel hard workon besomblack nights bulting back and forth off they dutch roads with shoals on all sides and having to hark out for the frishfrishfrishlike of a spanish galliwopses oars creepin up on ye frankie ud have the tiller and moon hed peer forth at the bows our lantern under his skirts till the boat we was lookin for ud blurt up out o the dark and wed lay hold and haul aboard whoever twasman woman or babean round wed go again the wind bewling like a kite in our riggins and theyd drop into the hold and praise god for happy deliverance till they was all sick  i had nigh a year at it an we must have fetched offoh a hundred pore folk i reckon outrageous bold too frankie growed to be outrageous cunnin he was once we was as near as nothin nipped by a tall ship off tergoes sands in a snowstorm she had the wind of us and spooned straight before it shootin all bow guns frankie fled inshore smack for the beach till he was atop of the first breakers then he hove his anchor out which nigh tore our bows off but it twitched us round endforend into the wind dye see an we clawed off them sands like a drunk man rubbin along a tavern bench when we could see the spanisher was laid flat along in the breakers with the snows whitening on his wet belly he thought he could go where frankie went  what happened to the crew said una  we didnt stop simon answered there was a very liddle new baby in our hold and the mother she wanted to get to some dry bed middlin quick we runned into dover and said nothing  was sir francis drake very much pleased heart alive maid hed no head to his name in those days he was just a outrageous valiant crophaired tuttmouthed boy roarin up an down the narrer seas with his beard not yet quilted out he made a laughingstock of everything all day and hed hold our lives in the bight of his arm all the besomblack night among they dutch sands and wed ha jumped overside to behove him any one time all of us  then why did you try to poison him una asked wickedly and simon hung his head like a shy child  oh that was when he set me to make a pudden for because our cook was hurted i done my uttermost but she all fetched adrift like in the bag an the more i biled the bits of her the less she favoured any fashion o pudden moon he chawed and chammed his piece and frankie chawed and chammed hisn andno words to ithe took me by the ear an walked me out over the bowend an him an moon hove the pudden at me on the bowsprit gub by gub something cruel hard simon rubbed his hairy cheek  nex time you bring me anything says frankie you bring me cannonshot an ill know what im getting but as for poisonin he stopped the children laughed so  of course you didnt said una oh simon we do like you  i was always likeable with children his smile crinkled up through the hair round his eyes simple simon they used to call me through our yard gates  did sir francis mock you dan asked  ah no he was gentleborn laugh he didhe was always laughingbut not so as to hurt a feather an i loved en i loved en before england knew en or queen bess she broke his heart  but he hadnt really done anything when you knew him had he una insisted armadas and those things i mean  simon pointed to the scars and scrapes left by cattiwows great log you tell me that that good ships timber never done nothing against winds and weathers since her upspringing and ill confess ye that young frankie never done nothing neither nothing he adventured and suffered and made shift on they dutch sands as much in any one month as ever he had occasion for to do in a halfyear on the high seas afterwards an what was his tools a coaster boata liddle box o walty plankin an some few fathom feeble rope held together an made able by him sole he drawed our spirits up in our bodies same as a chimneytowel draws a fire twas in him and it comed out all times and shapes i wonder did he ever magine what he was going to be tell himself stories about it said dan with a flush  i expect so we mostly doeven when were grown but bein frankie he took good care to find out beforehand what his fortune might be had i rightly ought to tell em this piece simon turned to puck who nodded  my mother she was just a fair woman but my aunt her sister she had gifts by inheritance laid up in her simon began  oh thatll never do cried puck for the children stared blankly do you remember what robin promised to the widow whitgift so long as her blood and get lasted see dymchurch flit in puck of pooks hill yes there was always to be one of them that could see farther through a millstone than most dan answered promptly  well simons aunts mother said puck slowly married the widows blind son on the marsh and simons aunt was the one chosen to see farthest through millstones do you understand  that was what i was gettin at said simon but youre so desperate quick my aunt she knew what was comin to people my uncle being a burgess of rye he counted all such things odious and my aunt she couldnt be got to practise her gifts hardly at all because it hurted her head for a week afterwards but when frankie heard she had em he was all for nothin till she foretold on himtill she looked in his hand to tell his fortune dye see one time we was at rye she come aboard with my other shirt and some apples and he fair beazled the life out of her about it  oh youll be twice wed and die childless she says and pushes his hand away  thats the womans part he says whatll come to meto me an he thrusts it back under her nose  goldgold past belief or counting she says let go o me lad  sink the gold he says whatll i do mother he coaxed her like no woman could well withstand ive seen him with emeven when they were seasick  if you will have it she says at last you shall have it youll do a many things and eating and drinking with a dead man beyond the worlds end will be the least of them for youll open a road from the east unto the west and back again and youll bury your heart with your best friend by that roadside and the road you open none shall shut so long as youre let lie quiet in your grave   the old ladys prophecy is in a fair way to come true for now the panama canal is finished one end of it opens into the very bay where sir francis drake was buried so ships are taken through the canal and the road round cape horn which sir francis opened is very little used   and if im not he says  why then she says sims iron ships will be sailing on dry land now ha done with this foolishness wheres sims shirt  he couldnt fetch no more out of her and when we come up from the cabin he stood mazedlike by the tiller playing with a apple my sorrow says my aunt dye see that the great world lying in his hand liddle and round like a apple  why tis one you gived him i says  to be sure she says tis just a apple and she went ashore with her hand to her head it always hurted her to show her gifts  him and me puzzled over that talk plenty it sticked in his mind quite extravagant the very next time we slipped out for some fetchin trade we met mus stennings boat over by calais sands and he warned us that the spanishers had shut down all their dutch ports against us english and their galliwopses was out picking up our boats like flies off hogs backs mus stenning he runs for shoreham but frankie held on a piece knowin that mus stenning was jealous of our good trade over by dunkirk a great gorbellied spanisher with the cross on his sails came rampin at us we left him we left him all they bare seas to conquest in  looks like this road was going to be shut pretty soon says frankie humourin her at the tiller ill have to open that other one your aunt foretold of  the spanishers crowdin down on us middlin quick i says no odds says frankie hell have the inshore tide against him did your aunt say i was to be quiet in my grave for ever  till my iron ships sailed dry land i says  thats foolishness he says who cares where frankie drake makes a hole in the water now or twenty years from now  the spanisher kept muckin on more and more canvas i told him so  hes feelin the tide was all he says if he was among tergoes sands with this wind wed be picking his bones proper id give my heart to have all their tall ships there some night before a north gale and me to windward thered be gold in my hands then did your aunt say she saw the world settin in my hand sim  yes but twas a apple says i and he laughed like he always did at me do you ever feel minded to jump overside and be done with everything he asks after a while  no what water comes aboard is too wet as tis i says the spanishers going about  i told you says he never looking back hell give us the popes blessing as he swings come down off that rail theres no knowin where stray shots may hit so i came down off the rail and leaned against it and the spanisher he ruffled round in the wind and his portlids opened all red inside  now whatll happen to my road if they dont let me lie quiet in my grave he says does your aunt mean theres two roads to be found and kept openor what does she mean i dont like that talk about tother road dyou believe in your iron ships sim  he knowed i did so i only nodded and he nodded back again anybody but me ud call you a fool sim he says lie down here comes the popes blessing  the spanisher gave us his broadside as he went about they all fell short except one that smacksmooth hit the rail behind my back an i felt most wonerful cold  be you hit anywhere to signify he says come over to me  o lord mus drake i says my legs wont move and that was the last i spoke for months  why what had happened cried dan and una together  the rail had jarred me in here like simon reached behind him clumsily from my shoulders down i didnt act no shape frankie carried me piggyback to my aunts house and i lay bedrid and tonguetied while she rubbed me day and night month in and month out she had faith in rubbing with the hands praps she put some of her gifts into it too last of all something loosed itself in my pore back and lo i was whole restored again but kittenfeeble  wheres frankie i says thinking id been a longish while abed  downwind amongst the donsmonths ago says my aunt  when can i go after en i says  your dutys to your town and trade now says she your uncle he died last michaelmas and heve left you and me the yard so no more iron ships mind ye  what i says and you the only one that beleft in em   maybe i do still she says but im a woman before im a whitgift and wooden ships is what england needs us to build i lay on ye to do so  thats why ive never teched iron since that daynot to build a toy ship of ive never even drawed a draft of one for my pleasure of evenings simon smiled down on them all whitgift blood is terrible resoluteon the shesidesaid puck  didnt you ever see sir francis drake againdan asked  with one thing and another and my being made a burgess of rye i never clapped eyes on him for the next twenty years oh i had the news of his mighty doings the world over they was the very same bold cunning shifts and passes hed worked with beforetimes off they dutch sands but naturally folk took more note of them when queen bess made him knight he sent my aunt a dried orange stuffed with spiceries to smell to she cried outrageous on it she blamed herself for her foretellings having set him on his wonerful road but i reckon hed ha gone that way all withstanding curious how close she foretelled it the world in his hand like an apple an he burying his best friend mus doughty  never mind for mus doughty puck interrupted tell us where you met sir francis next  oh ha that was the year i was made a burgess of ryethe same year which king philip sent his ships to take england without frankies leave  the armada said dan contentedly i was hoping that would come  i knowed frankie would never let em smell london smoke but plenty good men in rye was twothree minded about the upshot twas the noise of the gunfire tarrified us the wind favoured it our way from off behind the isle of wight it made a mutter like which growed and growed and by the end of a week women was shruckin in the streets then they come slidderin past fairlight in a great smoky pat vambrished with red gunfire and our ships flyin forth and duckin in again the smokepat sliddered over to the french shore so i knowed frankie was edgin the spanishers toward they dutch sands where he was master i says to my aunt the smokes thinnin out i lay frankies just about scrapin his hold for a few last rounds shot tis time for me to go  never in them clothes she says do on the doublet i bought you to be made burgess in and dont you shame this day  so i mucked it on

we crept on till it fell light airs and puffed out the spanishers was all in a huddle over by calais and our ships was strawed about mending emselves like dogs lickin bites now and then a spanisher would fire from a low port and the ball ud troll across the flat swells but both sides was finished fightin for that tide  the first ship we foreslowed on her breastworks was crushed in an men was shorin em up she said nothing the next was a black pinnace his pumps clackin middling quick and he said nothing but the third mending shotholes he spoke out plenty i asked him where mus drake might be and a shinysuited man on the poop looked down into us and saw what we carried  lay alongside you he says well take that all  tis for mus drake i says keeping away lest his size should lee the wind out of my sails  hi ho hither were lord high admiral of england come alongside or well hang ye he says  twas none of my affairs who he was if he wasnt frankie and while he talked so hot i slipped behind a greenpainted ship with her topsides splintered we was all in the middest of em then  hi hoi the green ship says come alongside honest man and ill buy your load im fenner that fought the seven portugalsclean out of shot or bullets frankie knows me  ay but i dont i says and i slacked nothing  he was a masterpiece seein i was for goin on he hails a bridport hoy beyond us and shouts george oh

sailors my aunt answered him quite a piece she was a notable woman  then he come uphis long pennant trailing oversidehis waistcloths and netting tore all to pieces where the spanishers had grappled and his sides blacksmeared with their gunblasts like candlesmoke in a bottle we hooked on to a lower port and hung  oh mus drake mus drake i calls up  he stood on the great anchor cathead his shirt

hoy and left him  but frankie was gentleborn dye see and that sort they never overlook any folks dues  when the hoy passed under his stern he stood bareheaded on the poop same as if my aunt had been his queen and his musicianers played mary ambree on their silver trumpets quite a long while heart alive little maid i never meaned to make you look sorrowful  bunny lewknor in his sackcloth

aught thats new        ahay o  to me o      ill give you bruges and niewport too      and the ten tall churches that stand between em      storm along my gallant captains        all round the horn     the tree of justice     the ballad of minepit shaw        about the time that taverns shut        and men can buy no beer      two lads went up by the keepers hut        to steal lord pelhams deer       night and the liquor was in their heads        they laughed and talked no bounds      till they waked the keepers on their beds        and the keepers loosed the hounds       they had killed a hart they had killed a hind        ready to carry away      when they heard a whimper down the wind        and they heard a bloodhound bay       they took and ran across the fern        their crossbows in their hand      till they met a man with a green lantern        that called and bade em stand       what are you doing o flesh and blood        and whats your foolish will      that you must break into minepit wood        and wake the folk of the hill       oh weve broke into lord pelhams park        and killed lord pelhams deer      and if ever you heard a little dog bark        youll know why we come here       we ask you let us go our way        as fast as we can flee      for if ever you heard a bloodhound bay        youll know how pressed we be       oh lay your crossbows on the bank        and drop the knife from your hand      and though the hounds are at your flank        ill save you where you stand      they laid their crossbows on the bank        they threw their knives in the wood      and the ground before them opened and sank        and saved em where they stood      oh whats the roaring in our ears        that strikes us wellnigh dumb      oh that is just how things appears        according as they come       what are the stars before our eyes        that strike us wellnigh blind      oh that is just how things arise        according as you find       and whys our bed so hard to the bones        excepting where its cold      oh thats because it is precious stones        excepting where tis gold       think it over as you stand        for i tell you without fail      if you havent got into fairyland        youre not in lewes gaol       all night long they thought of it        and come the dawn they saw      theyd tumbled into a great old pit        at the bottom of minepit shaw       and the keepers hound had followed em close        and broke her neck in the fall      so they picked up their knives and their crossbows        and buried the dog  thats all       but whether the man was a poacher too        or a pharisee so bold      i reckon theres more things told than are true        and more things true than are told     the tree of justice  it was a warm dark winter day with the souwest wind singing through dallington forest and the woods below the beacon the children set out after dinner to find old hobden who had a three months job in the rough at the back of pounds wood he had promised to get them a dormouse in its nest the bright leaf still clung to the beech coppice the long chestnut leaves lay orange on the ground and the rides were speckled with scarletlipped sprouting acorns they worked their way by their own short cuts to the edge of pounds wood and heard a horses feet just as they came to the beech where ridley the keeper hangs up the vermin the poor little fluffy bodies dangled from the branchessome perfectly good but most of them dried to twisted strips  three more owls said dan counting two stoats four jays and a kestrel thats ten since last week ridleys a beast  in my time this sort of tree bore heavier fruit sir richard dalyngridge reined up his grey horse swallow in the ride behind them this is the norman knight they met the year before in puck of pooks hill see young men at the manor the knights of the joyous venture and old men at pevensey in that book what play do you makehe asked  nothing sir were looking for old hobdendan repliedhe promised to get us a sleeper  sleeper a dormeuse do you say  yes a dormouse sir i understand i passed a woodman on the low grounds come he wheeled up the ride again and pointed through an opening to the patch of beechstubs chestnut hazel and birch that old hobden would turn into firewood hoppoles peaboughs and housefaggots before spring the old man was as busy as a beaver  something laughed beneath a thorn and puck stole out his finger on his lip  look he whispered along between the spindletrees ridley has been there this halfhour  the children followed his point and saw ridley the keeper in an old dry ditch watching hobden as a cat watches a mouse  huhh cried una hobden always tends to his wires before breakfast he puts his rabbits into the faggots hes allowed to take home hell tell us about em tomorrow  we had the same breed in my day sir richard replied and moved off quietly puck at his bridle the children on either side between the closetrimmed beech stuff  what did you do to them said dan as they repassed ridleys terrible tree  that sir richard jerked his head toward the dangling owls  not he said puck there was never enough brute norman in you to hang a man for taking a buck  ii cannot abide to hear their widows screech but why am i on horseback while you are afoot he dismounted lightly tapped swallow on the chest so that the wise thing backed instead of turning in the narrow ride and put himself at the head of the little procession he walked as though all the woods belonged to him i have often told my friends he went on that red william the king was not the only norman found dead in a forest while he hunted  dyou mean william rufussaid dan  yes said puck kicking a clump of red toadstools off a dead log  for example there was a knight new from normandy sir richard went on to whom henry our king granted a manor in kent near by he chose to hang his foresters son the day before a deerhunt that he gave to pleasure the king  now when would that be said puck and scratched an ear thoughtfully  the summer of the year king henry broke his brother robert of normandy at tenchebrai fight our ships were even then at pevensey loading for the war  what happened to the knightdan asked  they found him pinned to an ash three arrows through his leather coat i should have worn mail that day  and did you see him all bloodydan continued  nay i was with de aquila at pevensey counting horseshoes and arrowsheaves and alebarrels into the holds of the ships the army only waited for our king to lead them against robert in normandy but he sent word to de aquila that he would hunt with him here before he set out for france  why did the king want to hunt so particularly una demanded  if he had gone straight to france after the kentish knight was killed men would have said he feared being slain like the knight it was his duty to show himself debonair to his english people as it was de aquilas duty to see that he took no harm while he did it but it was a great burden de aquila hugh and i ceased work on the ships and scoured all the honour of the eagleall de aquilas landsto make a fit and above all a safe sport for our king look  the ride twisted and came out on the top of pounds hill wood sir richard pointed to the swells of beautiful dappled dallington that showed like a woodcocks breast up the valley ye know the forest said he  you ought to see the bluebells there in spring said una i have seen said sir richard gazing and stretched out his hand hughs work and mine was first to move the deer gently from all parts into dallington yonder and there to hold them till the king came next we must choose some three hundred beaters to drive the deer to the stands within bowshot of the king here was our trouble in the mellay of a deerdrive a saxon peasant and a norman king may come overclose to each other the conquered do not love their conquerors all at once so we needed sure men for whom their village or kindred would answer in life cattle and land if any harm come to the king ye see  if one of the beaters shot the king said puck sir richard wanted to be able to punish that mans village then the village would take care to send a good man  so so it was but lest our work should be too easy the king had done such a dread justice over at salehurst for the killing of the kentish knight twentysix men he hanged as i heard that our folk were half mad with fear before we began it is easier to dig out a badger gone to earth than a saxon gone dumbsullen and atop of their misery the old rumour waked that harold the saxon was alive and would bring them deliverance from us normans this has happened every autumn since santlache fight  but king harold was killed at hastingssaid una  so it was said and so it was believed by us normans but our saxons always believed he would come again that rumour did not make our work any more easy  sir richard strode on down the far slope of the wood where the trees thin out it was fascinating to watch how he managed his long spurs among the lumps of blackened ling  but we did it he said after all a woman is as good as a man to beat the woods and the mere word that deer are afoot makes cripples and crones young again de aquila laughed when hugh told him over the list of beaters half were women and many of the rest were clerkssaxon and norman priests  hugh and i had not time to laugh for eight days till de aquila as lord of pevensey met our king and led him to the first shootingstandby the mill on the edge of the forest hugh and iit was no work for hot heads or heavy handslay with our beaters on the skirts of dallington to watch both them and the deer when de aquilas great horn blew we went forward a line half a league long oh to see the fat clerks their gowns tucked up puffing and roaring and the sober millers dusting the undergrowth with their staves and like as not between them a saxon wench hand in hand with her man shrilling like a kite as she ran and leaping high through the fern all for joy of the sport ah how ah how howah sahowah puck bellowed without warning and swallow bounded forward ears cocked and nostrils cracking  hallallallallahaiie sir richard answered in a high clear shout  the two voices joined in swooping circles of sound and a heron rose out of a red osierbed below them circling as though he kept time to the outcry swallow quivered and swished his glorious tail they stopped together on the same note  a hoarse shout answered them across the bare woods  thats old hobdensaid una  small blame to him it is in his blood said puck did your beaters cry so sir richard  my faith they forgot all else steady swallow steady they forgot where the king and his people waited to shoot they followed the deer to the very edge of the open till the first flight of wild arrows from the stands flew fair over them  i cried ware shot ware shot and a knot of young knights new from normandy that had strayed away from the grand stand turned about and in mere sport loosed off at our line shouting ware santlache arrows ware santlache arrows a jest i grant you but too sharp one of our beaters answered in saxon ware new forest arrows ware red williams arrow so i judged it time to end the jests and when the boys saw my old mail gown for to shoot with strangers i count the same as war they ceased shooting so that was smoothed over and we gave our beaters ale to wash down their anger they were excusable wethey had sweated to show our guests good sport and our reward was a flight of huntingarrows which no man loves and worse a churls jibe over hardfought fairlost hastings fight so before the next beat hugh and i assembled and called the beaters over by name to steady them the greater part we knew but among the netherfield men i saw an old old man in the dress of a pilgrim  the clerk of netherfield said he was well known by repute for twenty years as a witless man that journeyed without rest to all the shrines of england the old man sits saxon fashion head between fists we normans rest the chin on the left palm who answers for him said i if he fails in his duty who will pay his fine  who will pay my fine the pilgrim said i have asked that of all the saints in england these forty years less three months and nine days they have not answered when he lifted his thin face i saw he was oneeyed and frail as a rush nay but father i said to whom hast thou commended thyself he shook his head so i spoke in saxon whose man art thou  i think i have a writing from rahere the kings jester said he after a while i am as i suppose raheres man  he pulled a writing from his scrip and hugh coming up read it  it set out that the pilgrim was raheres man and that rahere was the kings jester there was latin writ at the back  what a plague conjurations here said hugh turning it over pumquumsum ococc magic  black magic said the clerk of netherfield he had been a monk at battle they say rahere is more of a priest than a fool and more of a wizard than either heres raheres name writ and theres raheres red cockscomb mark drawn below for such as cannot read he looked slyly at me  then read it said i and show thy learning he was a vain little man and he gave it us after much mouthing  the charm which i think is from virgilius the sorcerer says when thou art once dead and minos which is a heathen judge has doomed thee neither cunning nor speechcraft nor good works will restore thee a terrible thing it denies any mercy to a mans soul  does it serve said the pilgrim plucking at hughs cloak oh man of the kings blood does it cover me  hugh was of earl godwins blood and all sussex knew it though no saxon dared call him kingly in a normans hearing there can be but one king  it serves said hugh but the day will be long and hot better rest here we go forward now  no i will keep with thee my kinsman he answered like a child he was indeed childish through great age  the line had not moved a bowshot when de aquilas great horn blew for a halt and soon young fulkeour false fulkes sonyes the imp that lit the straw in pevensey castle see old men at pevensey in puck of pooks hillcame thundering up a woodway  uncle said he though he was a man grown he called me uncle those young norman fools who shot at you this morn are saying that your beaters cried treason against the king it has come to harrys long ears and he bids you give account of it there are heavy fines in his eye but i am with you to the hilt uncle when the boy had fled back hugh said to me it was raheres witless man that cried ware red williams arrow i heard him and so did the clerk of netherfield  then rahere must answer to the king for his man said i keep him by you till i send and i hastened down  the king was with de aquila in the grand stand above welansford down in the valley yonder his courtknights and dameslay glittering on the edge of the glade i made my homage and henry took it coldly how came your beaters to shout threats against me said he  the tale has grown i answered one old witless man cried out ware red williams arrow when the young knights shot at our line we had two beaters hit  i will do justice on that man he answered who is his master  hes raheres man said i  raheres said henry has my fool a fool  i heard the bells jingle at the back of the stand and a red leg waved over it then a black one so very slowly rahere the kings jester straddled the edge of the planks and looked down on us rubbing his chin looseknit with cropped hair and a sad priests face under his cockscomb cap that he could twist like a strip of wet leather his eyes were hollowset  nay nay brother said he if i suffer you to keep your fool you must een suffer me to keep mine  this he delivered slowly into the kings angry face my faith a kings jester must be bolder than lions  now we will judge the matter said rahere let these two brave knights go hang my fool because he warned king henry against running after saxon deer through woods full of saxons faith brother if thy brother red william now among the saints as we hope had been timely warned against a certain arrow in new forest one fool of us four would not be crowned fool of england this morning therefore hang the fools fool knights mark the fools cunning rahere had himself given us order to hang the man no king dare confirm a fools command to such a great baron as de aquila and the helpless king knew it  what no hanging said rahere after a silence a gods gracious name kill something then go forward with the hunt  he splits his face ear to ear in a yawn like a fishpond henry says he the next time i sleep do not pester me with thy fooleries then he throws himself out of sight behind the back of the stand  i have seen courage with mirth in de aquila and hugh but stark mad courage of raheres sort i had never even guessed at  what did the king say cried dan  he had opened his mouth to speak when young fulke who had come into the stand with us laughed and boylike once begun could not check himself he kneeled on the instant for pardon but fell sideways crying his legs oh his long waving red legs as he went backward  like a storm breaking our grave king laughedstamped and reeled with laughter till the stand shook so like a storm this strange thing passed  he wiped his eyes and signed to de aquila to let the drive come on  when the deer broke we were pleased that the king shot from the shelter of the stand and did not ride out after the hurt beasts as red william would have done most vilely his knights and barons shot  de aquila kept me beside him and i saw no more of hugh till evening we two had a little hut of boughs by the camp where i went to wash me before the great supper and in the dusk i heard hugh on the couch  wearied hugh said i  a little he says i have driven saxon deer all day for a norman king and there is enough of earl godwins blood left in me to sicken at the work wait awhile with the torch  i waited then and i thought i heard him sob  poor hugh was he so tired said una hobden says beating is hard work sometimes  i think this tale is getting like the woods said dan darker and twistier every minute sir richard had walked as he talked and though the children thought they knew the woods well enough they felt a little lost  a dark tale enough says sir richard but the end was not all black when we had washed we went to wait on the king at meat in the great pavilion just before the trumpets blew for the entryall the guests upstandinglong rahere comes posturing up to hugh and strikes him with his baublebladder  heres a heavy heart for a joyous meal he says but each man must have his black hour or where would be the merit of laughing take a fools advice and sit it out with my man ill make a jest to excuse you to the king if he remember to ask for you thats more than i would do for archbishop anselm  hugh looked at him heavyeyed rahere said he the kings jester oh saints what punishment for my king and smites his hands together gogo fight it out in the dark says rahere and thy saxon saints reward thee for thy pity to my fool he pushed him from the pavilion and hugh lurched away like one drunk  but why said una i dont understand  ah why indeed live you long enough maiden and you shall know the meaning of many whys sir richard smiled i wondered too but it was my duty to wait on the king at the high table in all that glitter and stir  he spoke me his thanks for the sport i had helped show him and he had learned from de aquila enough of my folk and my castle in normandy to graciously feign that he knew and had loved my brother there this also is part of a kings work many great men sat at the high tablechosen by the king for their wits not for their birth i have forgotten their names and their faces i only saw that one night butsir richard turned in his stridebut rahere flaming in black and scarlet among our guests the hollow of his dark cheek flushed with winelong laughing rahere and the stricken sadness of his face when he was not twisting it aboutrahere i shall never forget  at the kings outgoing de aquila bade me follow him with his great bishops and two great barons to the little pavilion we had devised jugglers and dances for the courts sport but henry loved to talk gravely to grave men and de aquila had told him of my travels to the worlds end we had a fire of applewood sweet as incenseand the curtains at the door being looped up we could hear the music and see the lights shining on mail and dresses  rahere lay behind the kings chair the questions he darted forth at me were as shrewd as the flames i was telling of our fight with the apes as ye called them at the worlds end see the knights of the joyous venture in puck of pooks hill but where is the saxon knight that went with you said henry he must confirm these miracles  he is busy said rahere confirming a new miracle  enough miracles for today said the king rahere you have saved your long neck fetch the saxon knight  pest on it said rahere who would be a kings jester ill bring him brother if youll see that none of your homebrewed bishops taste my wine while i am away so he jingled forth between the menatarms at the door  henry had made many bishops in england without the popes leave i know not the rights of the matter but only rahere dared jest about it we waited on the kings next word  i think rahere is jealous of you said he smiling to nigel of ely he was one bishop and william of exeter the otherwalwist the saxons called himlaughed long rahere is a priest at heart shall i make him a bishop de aquila says the king  there might be worse said our lord of pevensey rahere would never do what anselm has done  this anselm archbishop of canterbury had gone off raging to the pope at rome because henry would make bishops without his leave either i knew not the rights of it but de aquila did and the king laughed  anselm means no harm he should have been a monk not a bishop said the king ill never quarrel with anselm or his pope till they quarrel with my england if we can keep the kings peace till my son comes to rule no man will lightly quarrel with our england  amen said de aquila but the kings peace ends when the king dies  that is true the kings peace dies with the king the custom then is that all laws are outlaw and men do what they will till the new king is chosen  i will amend that said the king hotly i will have it so that though king son and grandson were all slain in one day still the kings peace should hold over all england what is a man that his mere death must upheave a people we must have the law  truth said william of exeter but that he would have said to any word of the king  the two great barons behind said nothing this teaching was clean against their stomachs for when the kings peace ends the great barons go to war and increase their lands at that instant we heard raheres voice returning in a scurril saxon rhyme against william of exeter       well wist walwist where lay his fortune      when that he fawned on the king for his crozier  and amid our laughter he burst in with one arm round hugh and one round the old pilgrim of netherfield  here is your knight brother said he and for the better disport of the company here is my fool hold up saxon samson the gates of gaza are clean carried away  hugh broke loose white and sick and staggered to my side the old man blinked upon the company  we looked at the king but he smiled  rahere promised he would show me some sport after supper to cover his mornings offence said he to de aquila so this is thy man rahere  even so said rahere my man he has been and my protection he has taken ever since i found him under the gallows at stamford bridge telling the kites atop of it that he washarold of england  there was a great silence upon these last strange words and hugh hid his face on my shoulder womanfashion  it is most cruel true he whispered to me the old man proved it to me at the beat after you left and again in our hut even now it is harold my king  de aquila crept forward he walked about the man and swallowed  bones of the saints said he staring  many a stray shot goes too well home said rahere  the old man flinched as at an arrow why do you hurt me still he said in saxon it was on some bones of some saints that i promised i would give my england to the great duke he turns on us all crying shrilly thanes he had caught me at rouena lifetime ago if i had not promised i should have lain there all my life what else could i have done i have lain in a strait prison all my life none the less there is no need to throw stones at me he guarded his face with his arms and shivered now his madness will strike him down said rahere cast out the evil spirit one of you new bishops  said william of exeter harold was slain at santlache fight all the world knows it  i think this man must have forgotten said rahere be comforted father thou wast well slain at hastings forty years gone less three months and nine days tell the king  the man uncovered his face i thought they would stone me he said i did not know i spoke before a king he came to his full towering heightno mean man but frail beyond belief  the king turned to the tables and held him out his own cup of wine the old man drank and beckoned behind him and before all the normans my hugh bore away the empty cup saxonfashion upon the knee  it is harold said de aquila his own stiffnecked blood kneels to serve him  be it so said henry sit then thou that hast been harold of england  the madman sat and hard dark henry looked at him between halfshut eyes we others stared like oxen all but de aquila who watched rahere as i have seen him watch a far sail on the sea  the wine and the warmth cast the old man into a dream his white head bowed his hands hung his eye indeed was opened but the mind was shut when he stretched his feet they were scurfed and roadcut like a slaves  ah rahere cried hugh why hast thou shown him thus better have let him die than shame himand me  shame thee said the king would any baron of mine kneel to me if i were witless discrowned and alone and harold had my throne  no said rahere i am the sole fool that might do it brother unlesshe pointed at de aquila whom he had only met that dayyonder tough norman crab kept me company but sir hugh i did not mean to shame him he hath been somewhat punished through maybe little fault of his own  yet he lied to my father the conqueror said the king and the old man flinched in his sleep  maybe said rahere but thy brother robert whose throat we purpose soon to slit with our own hands  hutt said the king laughing ill keep robert at my table for a lifes guest when i catch him robert means no harm it is all his cursed barons  none the less said rahere robert may say that thou hast not always spoken the stark truth to him about england i should not hang too many men on that bough brother and it is certain said hugh thathe pointed to the old manharold was forced to make his promise to the great duke  very strongly forced said de aquila he had never any pride in the duke williams dealings with harold before hastings yet as he said one cannot build a house all of straight sticks  no matter how he was forced said henry england was promised to my father william by edward the confessor is it not so william of exeter nodded harold confirmed that promise to my father on the bones of the saints afterwards he broke his oath and would have taken england by the strong hand  oh la la rahere rolled up his eyes like a girl that ever england should be taken by the strong hand  seeing that red william and henry after him had each in just that fashion snatched england from robert of normandy we others knew not where to look but de aquila saved us quickly  promise kept or promise broken he said harold came near enough to breaking us normans at santlache  was it so close a fight then said henry  a hair would have turned it either way de aquila answered his housecarles stood like rocks against rain where wast thou hugh in it  among godwins folk beneath the golden dragon till your front gave back and we broke our ranks to follow said hugh  but i bade you stand i bade you stand i knew it was all a deceit harold had waked and leaned forward as one crying from the grave  ah now we see how the traitor himself was betrayed said william of exeter and looked for a smile from the king  i made thee bishop to preach at my bidding said henry and turning to harold tell us here how thy people fought us said he their sons serve me now against my brother robert  the old man shook his head cunningly nanana he cried i know better every time i tell my tale men stone me but thanes i will tell you a greater thing listen he told us how many paces it was from some saxon saints shrine to another shrine and how many more back to the abbey of the battle  ay said he i have trodden it too often to be out even ten paces i move very swiftly harold of norway knows that and so does tostig my brother they lie at ease at stamford bridge and from stamford bridge to the battle abbey it is he muttered over many numbers and forgot us  ay said de aquila all in a muse that man broke harold of norway at stamford bridge and came near to breaking us at santlacheall within one month  but how did he come alive from santlache fight asked the king ask him hast thou heard it rahere never he says he has been stoned too often for telling the tale but he can count you off saxon and norman shrines till daylight said rahere and the old man nodded proudly  my faith said henry after a while i think even my father the great duke would pity if he could see him  how if he does see said rahere  hugh covered his face with his sound hand ah why hast thou shamed him he cried again to rahere  nono says the old man reaching to pluck at raheres cape i am raheres man none stone me now and he played with the bells on the scollops of it  how if he had been brought to me when you found him said the king to rahere  you would have held him prisoner againas the great duke did rahere answered  true said our king he is nothing except his name yet that name might have been used by stronger men to trouble my england yes i must have made him my lifes guestas i shall make robert  i knew it said rahere but while this man wandered mad by the wayside none cared what he called himself  i learned to cease talking before the stones flew says the old man and hugh groaned  ye have heard said rahere witless landless nameless and but for my protection masterless he can still make shift to bide his doom under the open sky  then wherefore didst thou bring him here for a mock and a shame cried hugh beside himself with woe  a right mock and a just shame said william of exeter  not to me said nigel of ely i see and i tremble but i neither mock nor judge  well spoken ely rahere falls into the pure fool again ill pray for thee when i turn monk thou hast given thy blessing on a war between two most christian brothers he meant the war forward twixt henry and robert of normandy i charge you brother he says wheeling on the king dost thou mock my fool the king shook his head and so then did smooth william of exeter  de aquila does thou mock him rahere
