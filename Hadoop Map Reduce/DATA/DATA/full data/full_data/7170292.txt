7170292	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                         the hall of fantasy    it has happened to me on various occasions to find myself in a certain edifice which would appear to have some of the characteristics of a public exchange  its interior is a spacious hall with a pavement of white marble  overhead is a lofty dome supported by long rows of pillars of fantastic architecture the idea of which was probably taken from the moorish ruins of the alhambra or perhaps from some enchanted edifice in the arabian tales  the windows of this hall have a breadth and grandeur of design and an elaborateness of workmanship that have nowhere been equalled except in the gothic cathedrals of the old world  like their prototypes too they admit the light of heaven only through stained and pictured glass thus filling the hall with manycolored radiance and painting its marble floor with beautiful or grotesque designs so that its inmates breathe as it were a visionary atmosphere and tread upon the fantasies of poetic minds  these peculiarities combining a wilder mixture of styles than even an american architect usually recognizes as allowablegrecian gothic oriental and nondescriptcause the whole edifice to give the impression of a dream which might be dissipated and shattered to fragments by merely stamping the foot upon the pavement  yet with such modifications and repairs as successive ages demand the hall of fantasy is likely to endure longer than the most substantial structure that ever cumbered the earth  it is not at all times that one can gain admittance into this edifice although most persons enter it at some period or other of their lives if not in their waking moments then by the universal passport of a dream  at my last visit i wandered thither unawares while my mind was busy with an idle tale and was startled by the throng of people who seemed suddenly to rise up around me  bless me  where am i cried i with but a dim recognition of the place  you are in a spot said a friend who chanced to be near at hand which occupies in the world of fancy the same position which the bourse the rialto and the exchange do in the commercial world all who have affairs in that mystic region which lies above below or beyond the actual may here meet and talk over the business of their dreams  it is a noble hall observed i  yes he replied  yet we see but a small portion of the edifice in its upper stories are said to be apartments where the inhabitants of earth may hold converse with those of the moon and beneath our feet are gloomy cells which communicate with the infernal regions and where monsters and chimeras are kept in confinement and fed with all unwholesomeness  in niches and on pedestals around about the hall stood the statues or busts of men who in every age have been rulers and demigods in the realms of imagination and its kindred regions the grand old countenance of homer the shrunken and decrepit form but vivid face of aesop the dark presence of dante the wild ariosto rabelaiss smile of deepwrought mirth the profound pathetic humor of cervantes the allglorious shakespeare spenser meet guest for an allegoric structure the severe divinity of milton and bunyan moulded of homeliest clay but instinct with celestial firewere those that chiefly attracted my eye  fielding richardson and scott occupied conspicuous pedestals  in an obscure and shadowy niche was deposited the bust of our countryman the author of arthur mervyn  besides these indestructible memorials of real genius remarked my companion each century has erected statues of its own ephemeral favorites in wood  i observe a few crumbling relics of such said i  but ever and anon i suppose oblivion comes with her huge broom and sweeps them all from the marble floor  but such will never be the fate of this fine statue of goethe  nor of that next to itemanuel swedenborg said he  were ever two men of transcendent imagination more unlike  in the centre of the hall springs an ornamental fountain the water of which continually throws itself into new shapes and snatches the most diversified lines from the stained atmosphere around  it is impossible to conceive what a strange vivacity is imparted to the scene by the magic dance of this fountain with its endless transformations in which the imaginative beholder may discern what form he will  the water is supposed by some to flow from the same source as the castalian spring and is extolled by others as uniting the virtues of the fountain of youth with those of many other enchanted wells long celebrated in tale and song  having never tasted it i can bear no testimony to its quality  did you ever drink this water i inquired of my friend  a few sips now and then answered he  but there are men here who make it their constant beverageor at least have the credit of doing so  in some instances it is known to have intoxicating qualities  pray let us look at these waterdrinkers said i  so we passed among the fantastic pillars till we came to a spot where a number of persons were clustered together in the light of one of the great stained windows which seemed to glorify the whole group as well as the marble that they trod on  most of them were men of broad foreheads meditative countenances and thoughtful inward eyes yet it required but a trifle to summon up mirth peeping out from the very midst of grave and lofty musings  some strode about or leaned against the pillars of the hall alone and in silence their faces wore a rapt expression as if sweet music were in the air around them or as if their inmost souls were about to float away in song  one or two perhaps stole a glance at the bystanders to watch if their poetic absorption were observed others stood talking in groups with a liveliness of expression a ready smile and a light intellectual laughter which showed how rapidly the shafts of wit were glancing to and fro among them  a few held higher converse which caused their calm and melancholy souls to beam moonlight from their eyes  as i lingered near themfor i felt an inward attraction towards these men as if the sympathy of feeling if not of genius had united me to their ordermy friend mentioned several of their names  the world has likewise heard those names with some it has been familiar for years and others are daily making their way deeper into the universal heart  thank heaven observed i to my companion as we passed to another part of the hall we have done with this techy wayward shy proud unreasonable set of laurelgatherers  i love them in their works but have little desire to meet them elsewhere  you have adopted all old prejudice i see replied my friend who was familiar with most of these worthies being himself a student of poetry and not without the poetic flame  but so far as my experience goes men of genius are fairly gifted with the social qualities and in this age there appears to be a fellowfeeling among them which had not heretofore been developed  as men they ask nothing better than to be on equal terms with their fellowmen and as authors they have thrown aside their proverbial jealousy and acknowledge a generous brotherhood  the world does not think so answered i  an author is received in general society pretty much as we honest citizens are in the hall of fantasy  we gaze at him as if he had no business among us and question whether he is fit for any of our pursuits  then it is a very foolish question said he  now here are a class of men whom we may daily meet on change  yet what poet in the hall is more a fool of fancy than the sagest of them  he pointed to a number of persons who manifest as the fact was would have deemed it an insult to be told that they stood in the hall of fantasy  their visages were traced into wrinkles and furrows each of which seemed the record of some actual experience in life  their eyes had the shrewd calculating glance which detects so quickly and so surely all that it concerns a man of business to know about the characters and purposes of his fellowmen judging them as they stood they might be honored and trusted members of the chamber of commerce who had found the genuine secret of wealth and whose sagacity gave them the command of fortune  there was a character of detail and matter of fact in their talk which concealed the extravagance of its purport insomuch that the wildest schemes had the aspect of everyday realities  thus the listener was not startled at the idea of cities to be built as if by magic in the heart of pathless forests and of streets to be laid out where now the sea was tossing and of mighty rivers to be stayed in their courses in order to turn the machinery of a cottonmill  it was only by an effort and scarcely then that the mind convinced itself that such speculations were as much matter of fantasy as the old dream of eldorado or as mammons cave or any other vision of gold ever conjured up by the imagination of needy poet or romantic adventurer  upon my word said i it is dangerous to listen to such dreamers as these  their madness is contagious  yes said my friend because they mistake the hall of fantasy for actual brick and mortar and its purple atmosphere for unsophisticated sunshine  but the poet knows his whereabout and therefore is less likely to make a fool of himself in real life  here again observed i as we advanced a little farther we see another order of dreamers peculiarly characteristic too of the genius of our country  these were the inventors of fantastic machines  models of their contrivances were placed against some of the pillars of the hall and afforded good emblems of the result generally to be anticipated from an attempt to reduce daydreams to practice the analogy may hold in morals as well as physics for instance here was the model of a railroad through the air and a tunnel under the sea  here was a machinestolen i believefor the distillation of heat from moonshine and another for the condensation of morning mist into square blocks of granite wherewith it was proposed to rebuild the entire hall of fantasy one man exhibited a sort of lens whereby he had succeeded in making sunshine out of a ladys smile and it was his purpose wholly to irradiate the earth by means of this wonderful invention  it is nothing new said i for most of our sunshine comes from womans smile already  true answered the inventor but my machine will secure a constant supply for domestic use whereas hitherto it has been very precarious  another person had a scheme for fixing the reflections of objects in a pool of water and thus taking the most lifelike portraits imaginable and the same gentleman demonstrated the practicability of giving a permanent dye to ladies dresses in the gorgeous clouds of sunset  there were at least fifty kinds of perpetual motion one of which was applicable to the wits of newspaper editors and writers of every description  professor espy was here with a tremendous storm in a gumelastic bag  i could enumerate many more of these utopian inventions but after all a more imaginative collection is to be found in the patent office at washington  turning from the inventors we took a more general survey of the inmates of the hall  many persons were present whose right of entrance appeared to consist in some crotchet of the brain which so long as it might operate produced a change in their relation to the actual world  it is singular how very few there are who do not occasionally gain admittance on such a score either in abstracted musings or momentary thoughts or bright anticipations or vivid remembrances for even the actual becomes ideal whether in hope or memory and beguiles the dreamer into the hall of fantasy  some unfortunates make their whole abode and business here and contract habits which unfit them for all the real employments of life othersbut these are fewpossess the faculty in their occasional visits of discovering a purer truth than the world call impart among the lights and shadows of these pictured windows  and with all its dangerous influences we have reason to thank god that there is such a place of refuge from the gloom and chillness of actual life  hither may come the prisoner escaping from his dark and narrow cell and cankerous chain to breathe free air in this enchanted atmosphere  the sick man leaves his weary pillow and finds strength to wander hither though his wasted limbs might not support him even to the threshold of his chamber  the exile passes through the hall of fantasy to revisit his native soil  the burden of years rolls down from the old mans shoulders the moment that the door uncloses  mourners leave their heavy sorrows at the entrance and here rejoin the lost ones whose faces would else be seen no more until thought shall have become the only fact  it may be said in truth that there is but half a lifethe meaner and earthier halffor those who never find their way into the hall nor must i fail to mention that in the observatory of the edifice is kept that wonderful perspectiveglass through which the shepherds of the delectable mountains showed christian the faroff gleam of the celestial city  the eye of faith still loves to gaze through it  i observe some men here said i to my friend who might set up a strong claim to be reckoned among the most real personages of the day  certainly he replied  if a man be in advance of his age he must be content to make his abode in this hall until the lingering generations of his fellowmen come up with him  he can find no other shelter in the universe  but the fantasies of one day are the deepest realities of a future one  it is difficult to distinguish them apart amid the gorgeous and bewildering light of this ball rejoined i  the white sunshine of actual life is necessary in order to test them  i am rather apt to doubt both men and their reasonings till i meet them in that truthful medium  perhaps your faith in the ideal is deeper than you are aware said my friend  you are at least a democrat and methinks no scanty share of such faith is essential to the adoption of that creed  among the characters who had elicited these remarks were most of the noted reformers of the day whether in physics politics morals or religion  there is no surer method of arriving at the hall of fantasy than to throw onesself into the current of a theory for whatever landmarks of fact may be set up along the stream there is a law of nature that impels it thither  and let it be so for here the wise head and capacious heart may do their work and what is good and true becomes gradually hardened into fact while error melts away and vanishes among the shadows of the ball  therefore may none who believe and rejoice in the progress of mankind be angry with me because i recognized their apostles and leaders amid the fantastic radiance of those pictured windows  i love and honor such men as well as they  it would be endless to describe the herd of real or self styled reformers that peopled this place of refuge  they were the representatives of an unquiet period when mankind is seeking to cast off the whole tissue of ancient custom like a tattered garment many of then had got possession of some crystal fragment of truth the brightness of which so dazzled them that they could see nothing else in the wide universe  here were men whose faith had embodied itself in the form of a potato and others whose long beards had a deep spiritual significance  here was the abolitionist brandishing his one idea like an iron flail  in a word there were a thousand shapes of good and evil faith and infidelity wisdom and nonsensea most incongruous throng  yet withal the heart of the stanchest conservative unless he abjured his fellowship with man could hardly have helped throbbing in sympathy with the spirit that pervaded these innumerable theorists  it was good for the man of unquickened heart to listen even to their folly  far down beyond the fathom of the intellect the soul acknowledged that all these varying and conflicting developments of humanity were united in one sentiment  be the individual theory as wild as fancy could make it still the wiser spirit would recognize the struggle of the race after a better and purer life than had yet been realized on earth  my faith revived even while i rejected all their schemes it could not be that the world should continue forever what it has been a soil where happiness is so rare a flower and virtue so often a blighted fruit a battlefield where the good principle with its shield flung above its head can hardly save itself amid the rush of adverse influences  in the enthusiasm of such thoughts i gazed through one of the pictured windows and behold the whole external world was tinged with the dimly glorious aspect that is peculiar to the hall of fantasy insomuch that it seemed practicable at that very instant to realize some plan for the perfection of mankind  but alas if reformers would understand the sphere in which their lot is cast they must cease to look through pictured windows  yet they not only use this medium but mistake it for the whitest sunshine  come said i to my friend starting from a deep revery let us hasten hence or i shall be tempted to make a theory after which there is little hope of any man  come hither then answered he  here is one theory that swallows up and annihilates all others  he led me to a distant part of the hall where a crowd of deeply attentive auditors were assembled round an elderly man of plain honest trustworthy aspect  with an earnestness that betokened the sincerest faith in his own doctrine he announced that the destruction of the world was close at hand  it is father miller himself exclaimed i  no less a man said my friend and observe how picturesque a contrast between his dogma and those of the reformers whom we have just glanced at  they look for the earthly perfection of mankind and are forming schemes which imply that the immortal spirit will be connected with a physical nature for innumerable ages of futurity on the other hand here comes good father miller and with one puff of his relentless theory scatters all their dreams like so many withered leaves upon the blast  it is perhaps the only method of getting mankind out of the various perplexities into which they have fallen i replied yet i could wish that the world might be permitted to endure until some great moral shall have been evolved  a riddle is propounded  where is the solution  the sphinx did not slay herself until her riddle had been guessed  will it not be so with the world  now if it should be burned tomorrow morning i am at a loss to know what purpose will have been accomplished or how the universe will be wiser or better for our existence and destruction  we cannot tell what mighty truths may have been embodied in act through the existence of the globe and its inhabitants rejoined my companion  perhaps it may be revealed to us after the fall of the curtain over our catastrophe or not impossibly the whole drama in which we are involuntary actors may have been performed for the instruction of another set of spectators  i cannot perceive that our own comprehension of it is at all essential to the matter  at any rate while our view is so ridiculously narrow and superficial it would be absurd to argue the continuance of the world from the fact that it seems to have existed hitherto in vain  the poor old earth murmured i  she has faults enough in all conscience but i cannot hear to have her perish  it is no great matter said my friend  the happiest of us has been weary of her many a time and oft  i doubt it answered i pertinaciously the root of human nature strikes down deep into this earthly soil and it is but reluctantly that we submit to be transplanted even for a higher cultivation in heaven  i query whether the destruction of the earth would gratify any one individual except perhaps some embarrassed man of business whose notes fall due a day after the day of doom  then methought i heard the expostulating cry of a multitude against the consummation prophesied by father miller  the lover wrestled with providence for his foreshadowed bliss  parents entreated that the earths span of endurance might be prolonged by some seventy years so that their newborn infant should not be defrauded of his lifetime  a youthful poet murmured because there would be no posterity to recognize the inspiration of his song  the reformers one and all demanded a few thousand years to test their theories after which the universe might go to wreck  a mechanician who was busied with an improvement of the steamengine asked merely time to perfect his model  a miser insisted that the worlds destruction would be a personal wrong to himself unless he should first be permitted to add a specified sum to his enormous heap of gold  a little boy made dolorous inquiry whether the last day would come before christmas and thus deprive him of his anticipated dainties in short nobody seemed satisfied that this mortal scene of things should have its close just now  yet it must be confessed the motives of the crowd for desiring its continuance were mostly so absurd that unless infinite wisdom had been aware of much better reasons the solid earth must have melted away at once  for my own part not to speak of a few private and personal ends i really desired our old mothers prolonged existence for her own dear sake  the poor old earth i repeated  what i should chiefly regret in her destruction would be that very earthliness which no other sphere or state of existence can renew or compensate  the fragrance of flowers and of newmown hay the genial warmth of sunshine and the beauty of a sunset among clouds the comfort and cheerful glow of the fireside the deliciousness of fruits and of all good cheer the magnificence of mountains and seas and cataracts and the softer charm of rural scenery even the fastfalling snow and the gray atmosphere through which it descendsall these and innumerable other enjoyable things of earth must perish with her  then the country frolics the homely humor the broad openmouthed roar of laughter in which body and soul conjoin so heartily  i fear that no other world call show its anything just like this  as for purely moral enjoyments the good will find them in every state of being but where the material and the moral exist together what is to happen then  and then our mute fourfooted friends and the winged songsters of our woods  might it not be lawful to regret them even in the hallowed groves of paradise  you speak like the very spirit of earth imbued with a scent of freshly turned soil exclaimed my friend  it is not that i so much object to giving up these enjoyments on my own account continued i but i hate to think that they will have been eternally annihilated from the list of joys  nor need they be he replied  i see no real force in what you say  standing in this hall of fantasy we perceive what even the earthclogged intellect of man can do in creating circumstances which though we call them shadowy and visionary are scarcely more so than those that surround us in actual life  doubt not then that mans disembodied spirit may recreate time and the world for itself with all their peculiar enjoyments should there still be human yearnings amid life eternal and infinite but i doubt whether we shall be inclined to play such a poor scene over again  o you are ungrateful to our mother earth rejoined i  come what may i never will forget her  neither will it satisfy me to have her exist merely in idea  i want her great round solid self to endure interminably and still to be peopled with the kindly race of man whom i uphold to be much better than he thinks himself nevertheless i confide the whole matter to providence and shall endeavor so to live that the world may come to an end at any moment without leaving me at a loss to find foothold somewhere else  it is an excellent resolve said my companion looking at his watch  but come it is the dinnerhour  will you partake of my vegetable diet  a thing so matter of fact as an invitation to dinner even when the fare was to be nothing more substantial than vegetables and fruit compelled us forthwith to remove from the hall of fantasy as we passed out of the portal we met the spirits of several persons who had been sent thither in magnetic sleep  i looked back among the sculptured pillars and at the transformations of the gleaming fountain and almost desired that the whole of life might be spent in that visionary scene where the actual world with its hard angles should never rub against me and only be viewed through the medium of pictured windows  but for those who waste all their days in the hall of fantasy good father millers prophecy is already accomplished and the solid earth has come to an untimely end  let us be content therefore with merely an occasional visit for the sake of spiritualizing the grossness of this actual life and prefiguring to ourselves a state in which the idea shall be all in all
