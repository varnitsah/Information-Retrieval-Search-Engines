danny meadow mouse sat on his doorstep with his chin in his hands and it was very plain to see that danny had something on his mind he had only a nod for jimmy skunk and even peter rabbit could get no more than a grumpy good morning it wasnt that he had been caught napping the day before by reddy fox and nearly made an end of no it wasnt that danny had learned his lesson and reddy would never catch him again it wasnt that he was all alone with no one to play with danny was rather glad that he was alone the fact is danny meadow mouse was worried  now worry is one of the worst things in the world and it didnt seem as if there was anything that danny meadow mouse need worry about but you know it is the easiest thing in the world to find something to worry over and make yourself uncomfortable about and when you make yourself uncomfortable you are almost sure to make everyone around you equally uncomfortable it was so with danny meadow mouse striped chipmunk had twice called him cross patch that morning and johnny chuck who had fought reddy fox for him the day before had called him grumpy and what do you think was the matter with danny meadow mouse why he was worrying because his tail was short yes sir that is all that ailed danny meadow mouse that bright morning  you know some people let their looks make them miserable they worry because they are homely or freckled or short or tall or thin or stout all of which is very foolish and danny meadow mouse was just as foolish in worrying because his tail was short  it is short it certainly is all of that danny never had realized how short until he chanced to meet his cousin whitefoot who lives in the green forest he was very elegantly dressed but the most imposing thing about him was his long slim beautiful tail danny had at once become conscious of his own stubby little tail and he had hardly had pride enough to hold his head up as became an honest meadow mouse ever since he had been thinking and thinking and wondering how his family came to have such short tails then he grew envious and began to wish and wish and wish that he could have a long tail like his cousin whitefoot  he was so busy wishing that he had a long tail that he quite forgot to take care of the tail he did have and he pretty nearly lost it and his life with it old whitetail the marsh hawk spied danny sitting there moping on his doorstep and came sailing over the tops of the meadow grasses so softly that he all but caught danny if it hadnt been for one of the merry little breezes danny would have been caught and all because he was envious its a bad bad habit     chapter ii  danny meadow mouse and his short tail   all danny meadow mouse could think about was his short tail he was so ashamed of it that whenever anyone passed he crawled out of sight so that they should not see how short his tail was instead of playing in the sunshine as he used to do he sat and sulked pretty soon his friends began to pass without stopping finally one day old mr toad sat down in front of danny and began to ask questions  whats the matter asked old mr toad  nothing replied danny meadow mouse  i dont suppose there really is anything the matter but what do you think is the matter said old mr toad  danny fidgeted and old mr toad looked up at jolly round red mr sun and winked sun is just as bright as ever isnt it he inquired  yes said danny  got plenty to eat and drink havent you continued mr toad  yes said danny  seems to me that that is a pretty goodlooking suit of clothes youre wearing said mr toad eyeing danny critically sunny weather plenty to eat and drink and good clothesmust be you dont know when youre well off danny meadow mouse  danny hung his head finally he looked up and caught a kindly twinkle in old mr toads eyes mr toad how can i get a long tail like my cousin whitefoot of the green forest he asked  so thats whats the matter ha ha ha danny meadow mouse im ashamed of you i certainly am ashamed of you said mr toad what good would a long tail do you tell me that  for a minute danny didnt know just what to say iiid look so much better if i had a long tail he ventured  old mr toad just laughed you never saw a meadow mouse with a long tail did you of course not what a sight it would be why everybody on the green meadows would laugh themselves sick at the sight you see you need to be slim and trim and handsome to carry a long tail well and then what a nuisance it would be you would always have to be thinking of your tail and taking care to keep it out of harms way look at me im homely some folks call me ugly to look at but no one tries to catch me as farmer browns boy does billy mink because of his fine coat and no one wants to put me in a cage because of a fine voice i am satisfied to be just as i am and if youll take my advice danny meadow mouse youll be satisfied to be just as you are  illustration old mr toad gave danny some good advice  perhaps you are right said danny meadow mouse after a little ill try     chapter iii  danny meadow mouse plays hide and seek   life is always a game of hide and seek to danny meadow mouse you see he is such a fat little fellow that there are a great many other furrycoated people and almost as many who wear feathers who would gobble danny up for breakfast or for dinner if they could some of them pretend to be his friends but danny always keeps his eyes open when they are around and always begins to play hide and seek peter rabbit and jimmy skunk and striped chipmunk and happy jack squirrel are all friends whom he can trust but he always has a bright twinkling eye open for reddy fox and billy mink and shadow the weasel and old whitetail the marsh hawk and several more especially hooty the owl at night  now danny meadow mouse is a stouthearted little fellow and when rough brother north wind came shouting across the green meadows tearing to pieces the snow clouds and shaking out the snowflakes until they covered the green meadows deep deep deep danny just snuggled down in his warm coat in his snug little house of grass and waited danny liked the snow yes sir danny meadow mouse liked the snow he just loved to dig in it and make tunnels through those tunnels in every direction he could go where he pleased and when he pleased without being seen by anybody it was great fun  every little way he made a little round doorway up beside a stiff stalk of grass out of this he could peep at the white world and he could get the fresh cold air sometimes when he was quite sure that no one was around he would scamper across on top of the snow from one doorway to another and when he did this he made the prettiest little footprints  now reddy fox knew all about those doorways and who made them reddy was having hard work to get enough to eat this cold weather and he was hungry most of the time one morning as he came tiptoeing softly over the meadows what should he see just ahead of him but the head of danny meadow mouse pop out of one of those little round doorways reddys mouth watered and he stole forward more softly than ever when he got within jumping distance he drew his stout hind legs under him and made ready to spring presto danny meadow mouse had disappeared reddy fox jumped just the same and began to dig as fast as he could make his paws go he could smell danny meadow mouse and that made him almost frantic  all the time danny meadow mouse was scurrying along one of his little tunnels and when finally reddy fox stopped digging because he was quite out of breath danny popped his head out of another little doorway and laughed at reddy of course reddy saw him and of course reddy tried to catch him there and dug frantically just as before and of course danny meadow mouse wasnt there  after a while reddy fox grew tired of this kind of a game and tried another plan the next time he saw danny meadow mouse stick his head out reddy pretended not to see him he stretched himself out on the ground and made believe that he was very tired and sleepy he closed his eyes then he opened them just the tiniest bit so that he could see danny meadow mouse and yet seem to be asleep danny watched him for a long time then he chuckled to himself and dropped out of sight  no sooner was he gone than reddy fox stole over close to the little doorway and waited hell surely stick his head out again to see if im asleep and then ill have him said reddy to himself so he waited and waited and waited by and by he turned his head there was danny meadow mouse at another little doorway laughing at him  illustration danny meadow mouse was laughing from another little doorway     chapter iv  old granny fox tries for danny meadow mouse   danny meadow mouse had not enjoyed anything so much for a long time as he did that game of hide and seek he tickled and chuckled all the afternoon as he thought about it of course reddy had been it he had been it all the time for never once had he caught danny meadow mouse if he hadwell there wouldnt have been any more stories about danny meadow mouse because there wouldnt have been any danny meadow mouse any more  but danny never let himself think about this he had enjoyed the game all the more because it had been such a dangerous game it had been such fun to dive into one of his little round doorways in the snow run along one of his own little tunnels and then peep out at another doorway and watch reddy fox digging as fast as ever he could at the doorway danny had just left finally reddy had given up in disgust and gone off muttering angrily to try to find something else for dinner danny had sat up on the snow and watched him go in his funny little squeaky voice danny shouted    though reddy fox is smart and sly     hihumdiddledeo   im just as smart and twice as spry     hihumdiddledeo  that night reddy fox told old granny fox all about how he had tried to catch danny meadow mouse granny listened with her head cocked on one side when reddy told how fat danny meadow mouse was her mouth watered you see now that snow covered the green meadows and the green forest granny and reddy fox had hard work to get enough to eat and they were hungry most of the time  ill go with you down on the meadows tomorrow morning and then well see if danny meadow mouse is as smart as he thinks he is said granny fox  so bright and early the next morning old granny fox and reddy fox went down on the meadows where danny meadow mouse lives danny had felt in his bones that reddy would come back so he was watching and he saw them as soon as they came out of the green forest when he saw old granny fox dannys heart beat a little faster than before for he knew that granny fox is very smart and very wise and has learned most of the tricks of all the other little meadow and forest people  this is going to be a more exciting game than the other said danny to himself and scurried down out of sight to see that all his little tunnels were clear so that he could run fast through them if he had to then he peeped out of one of his little doorways hidden in a clump of tall grass  old granny fox set reddy to hunting for dannys little round doorways and as fast as he found them granny came up and sniffed at each she knew that she could tell by the smell which one he had been at last finally she came straight towards the tall bunch of grass danny ducked down and scurried along one of his little tunnels he heard granny fox sniff at the doorway he had just left suddenly something plunged down through the snow right at his very heels danny didnt have to look to know that it was granny fox herself and he squeaked with fright     chapter v  what happened on the green meadows   thick and fast things were happening to danny meadow mouse down on the snowcovered green meadows rather they were almost happening he hadnt minded when reddy fox all alone tried to catch him indeed he had made a regular game of hide and seek of it and had enjoyed it immensely but now it was different granny fox wasnt so easily fooled as reddy fox just granny alone would have made the game dangerous for danny meadow mouse but reddy was with her and so danny had two to look out for and he got so many frights that it seemed to him as if his heart had moved right up into his mouth and was going to stay there yes sir that is just how it seemed  down in his little tunnels underneath the snow danny meadow mouse felt perfectly safe from reddy fox who would stop and dig frantically at the little round doorway where he had last seen danny but old granny fox knew all about those little tunnels and she didnt waste any time digging at the doorways instead she cocked her sharp little ears and listened with all her might now granny fox has very keen ears oh very keen ears and she heard just what she hoped she would hear she heard danny meadow mouse running along one of his little tunnels under the snow  plunge old granny fox dived right into the snow and right through into the tunnel of danny meadow mouse her two black paws actually touched dannys tail he was glad then that it was no longer  ha cried granny fox i almost got him that time  then she ran ahead a little way over the snow listening as before plunge into the snow she went again it was lucky for him that danny had just turned into another tunnel for otherwise she would surely have caught him  granny fox blew the snow out of her nose next time ill get him said she  now reddy fox is quick to learn especially when it is a way to get something to eat he watched granny fox and when he understood what she was doing he made up his mind to have a try himself for he was afraid that if she caught danny meadow mouse she would think that he was not big enough to divide perhaps that was because reddy is very selfish himself so the next time granny plunged into the snow and missed danny meadow mouse just as before reddy rushed in ahead of her and the minute he heard danny running down below he plunged in just as he had seen granny do but he didnt take the pains to make sure of just where danny was and so of course he didnt come anywhere near him but he frightened danny still more and made old granny fox lose her temper  poor danny meadow mouse he had never been so frightened in all his life he didnt know which way to turn or where to run and so he sat still which although he didnt know it was the very best thing he could do when he sat still he made no noise and so of course granny and reddy fox could not tell where he was old granny fox sat and listened and listened and listened and wondered where danny meadow mouse was and down under the snow danny meadow mouse sat and listened and listened and listened and wondered where granny and reddy fox were  pooh said granny fox after a while that meadow mouse thinks he can fool me by sitting still ill give him a scare  then she began to plunge into the snow this way and that way and sure enough pretty soon she landed so close to danny meadow mouse that one of her claws scratched him     chapter vi  danny meadow mouse remembers and reddy fox forgets   there he goes cried old granny fox dont let him sit still again  i hear him shouted reddy fox and plunged down into the snow just as granny fox had done a minute before but he didnt catch anything and when he had blown the snow out of his nose and wiped it out of his eyes he saw granny fox dive into the snow with no better luck  never mind said granny fox as long as we keep him running we can hear him and some one of these times well catch him pretty soon hell get too tired to be so spry and when he is granny didnt finish but licked her chops and smacked her lips reddy fox grinned then licked his chops and smacked his lips then once more they took turns diving into the snow  and down underneath in the little tunnels he had made danny meadow mouse was running for his life he was getting tired just as old granny fox had said he would he was almost out of breath he was sore and one leg smarted for in one of her jumps old granny fox had so nearly caught him that her claws had torn his pants and scratched him  oh dear oh dear if only i had time to think panted danny meadow mouse and then he squealed in still greater fright as reddy fox crashed down into his tunnel right at his very heels ive got to get somewhere ive got to get somewhere where they cant get at me he sobbed and right that very instant he remembered the old fencepost  the old fencepost lay on the ground and was hollow fastened to it were long wires with sharp cruel barbs danny had made a tunnel over to that old fencepost the very first day after the snow came for in that hollow in the old post he had a secret store of seeds why hadnt he thought of it before it must have been because he was too frightened to think but he remembered now and he dodged into the tunnel that led to the old fencepost running faster than ever for though his heart was in his mouth from fear in his heart was hope and hope is a wonderful thing  now old granny fox knew all about that old fencepost and she remembered all about those barbed wires fastened to it although they were covered with snow she knew just about where they lay and just before she reached them she stopped plunging down into the snow reddy fox knew about those wires too but he was so excited that he forgot all about them  stop cried old granny fox sharply  but reddy fox didnt hear or if he heard he didnt heed his sharp ears could hear danny meadow mouse running almost underneath him granny fox could stop if she wanted to but he was going to have danny meadow mouse for his breakfast down into the snow he plunged as hard as ever he could  oh oh wow wow oh dear oh dear  that wasnt the voice of danny meadow mouse oh my no it was the voice of reddy fox yes sir it was the voice of reddy fox he had landed with one of his black paws right on one of those sharp wire barbs and it did hurt dreadfully  i never did know a young fox who could get into as much trouble as you can snapped old granny fox as reddy hobbled along on three legs behind her across the snowcovered green meadows it serves you right for forgetting  yesm said reddy meekly  and safe in the hollow of the old fencepost danny meadow mouse was dressing the scratch on his leg made by the claws of old granny fox     chapter vii  old granny fox tries a new plan   old granny fox kept thinking about danny meadow mouse she knew that he was fat and it made her mouth water every time she thought of him she made up her mind that she must and would have him she knew that danny had been very very much frightened when she and reddy fox had tried so hard to catch him by plunging down through the snow into his little tunnels after him and she felt pretty sure that he wouldnt go far away from the old fencepost in the hollow of which he was snug and safe  old granny fox is very smart danny meadow mouse wont put his nose out of that old fencepost for a day or two then hell get tired of staying inside all the time and hell peep out of one of his little round doorways to see if the way is clear if he doesnt see any danger hell come out and run around on top of the snow to get some of the seeds in the tops of the tall grasses that stick out through the snow if nothing frightens him hell keep going a little farther and a little farther from that old fencepost i must see to it that danny meadow mouse isnt frightened for a few days so said old granny fox to herself as she lay under a hemlock tree studying how she could best get the next meal  then she called reddy fox to her and forbade him to go down on the meadows until she should tell him he might reddy grumbled and mumbled and didnt see why he shouldnt go where he pleased but he didnt dare disobey you see he had a sore foot he had hurt it on a wire barb when he was plunging through the snow after danny meadow mouse and now he had to run on three legs that meant that he must depend upon granny fox to help him get enough to eat so reddy didnt dare to disobey  it all came out just as granny fox had thought it would danny meadow mouse did get tired of staying in the old fencepost he did peep out first and then he did run a little way on the snow and then a little farther and a little farther but all the time he took great care not to get more than a jump or two from one of his little round doorways leading down to his tunnels under the snow  hidden on the edge of the green forest granny fox watched him she looked up at the sky and she knew that it was going to snow again thats good said she tomorrow morning ill have fat meadow mouse for breakfast and she smiled a hungry smile  the next morning before jolly round red mr sun was out of bed old granny fox trotted down onto the meadows and straight over to where down under the snow lay the old fencepost it had snowed again and all the little doorways of danny meadow mouse were covered up with soft fleecy snow behind granny fox limped reddy fox grumbling to himself  when they reached the place where the old fencepost lay buried under the snow old granny fox stretched out as flat as she could then she told reddy to cover her up with the new soft snow reddy did as he was told but all the time he grumbled now you go off to the green forest and keep out of sight said granny fox by and by ill bring you some meadow mouse for your breakfast and granny fox chuckled to think how smart she was and how she was going to catch danny meadow mouse     chapter viii  brother north wind proves a friend   danny meadow mouse had seen nothing of old granny fox or reddy fox for several days every morning the first thing he did even before he had breakfast was to climb up to one of his little round doorways and peep out over the beautiful white meadows to see if there was any danger near but every time he did this danny used a different doorway for said danny to himself if any one should happen just happen to see me this morning they might be waiting just outside my doorway to catch me tomorrow morning you see there is a great deal of wisdom in the little head that danny meadow mouse carries on his shoulders  but the first day and the second day and the third day he saw nothing of old granny fox or of reddy fox and he began to enjoy running through his tunnels under the snow and scurrying across from one doorway to another on top of the snow just as he had before the foxes had tried so hard to catch him but he hadnt forgotten as granny fox had hoped he would no indeed danny meadow mouse hadnt forgotten he was too wise for that  one morning when he started to climb up to one of his little doorways he found that it was closed yes sir it was closed in fact there wasnt any doorway more snow had fallen from the clouds in the night and had covered up every one of the little round doorways of danny meadow mouse  ha said danny i shall have a busy day a very busy day opening all my doorways ill eat my breakfast and then ill go to work  so danny meadow mouse ate a good breakfast of seeds which he had stored in the hollow in the old fencepost buried under the snow and then he began work on the nearest doorway it really wasnt work at all for you see the snow was soft and light and danny dearly loved to dig in it in a few minutes he had made a wee hole through which he could peep up at jolly round mr sun in a few minutes more he had made it big enough to put his head out he looked this way and he looked that way far far off on the top of a tree he could see old roughleg the hawk but he was so far away that danny didnt fear him at all  i dont see anything or anybody to be afraid of said danny and poked his head out a little farther  then he sat and studied everything around him a long long time it was a beautiful white world a very beautiful white world everything was so white and pure and beautiful that it didnt seem possible that harm or danger for anyone could even be thought of but danny meadow mouse learned long ago that things are not always what they seem and so he sat with just his little head sticking out of his doorway and studied and studied just a little way off was a little heap of snow  i dont remember that said danny and i dont remember anything that would make that there isnt any little bush or old log or anything underneath it perhaps rough brother north wind heaped it up just for fun  but all the time danny meadow mouse kept studying and studying that little heap of snow pretty soon he saw rough brother north wind coming his way and tossing the snow about as he came he caught a handful from the top of the little heap of snow that danny was studying and when he had passed dannys sharp eyes saw something red there it was just the color of the cloak old granny fox wears    granny fox you cant fool me   i see you plain as plain can be  shouted danny meadow mouse and dropped down out of sight while old granny fox shook the snow from her red cloak and with a snarl of disappointment and anger slowly started for the green forest where reddy fox was waiting for her     chapter ix  danny meadow mouse is caught at last     tippytoppytippytoe   play and frolic in the snow   now you see me now you dont   think youll catch me but you wont   tippytoppytippytoe   oh such fun to play in snow  danny meadow mouse sang this or at least he tried to sing it as he skipped about on the snow that covered the green meadows but danny meadow mouse has such a little voice such a funny little squeaky voice that had you been there you probably would never have guessed that he was singing he thought he was though and was enjoying it just as much as if he had the most beautiful voice in the world you know singing is nothing in the world but happiness in the heart making itself heard  oh yes danny meadow mouse was happy why shouldnt he have been hadnt he proved himself smarter than old granny fox that is something to make anyone happy some folks may fool granny fox once some may fool her twice but there are very few who can keep right on fooling her until she gives up in disgust that is just what danny meadow mouse had done and he felt very smart and of course he felt very happy  so danny sang his little song and skipped about in the moonlight and dodged in and out of his little round doorways and all the time kept his sharp little eyes open for any sign of granny fox or reddy fox but with all his smartness danny forgot yes sir danny forgot one thing he forgot to watch up in the sky he knew that of course old roughleg the hawk was asleep so he had nothing to fear from him but he never once thought of hooty the owl  dear me dear me forgetting is a dreadful habit if nobody ever forgot there wouldnt be nearly so much trouble in the world no indeed there wouldnt be nearly so much trouble and danny meadow mouse forgot he skipped and sang and was happy as could be and never once thought to watch up in the sky  over in the green forest hooty the owl had had poor hunting and he was feeling cross you see hooty was hungry and hunger is apt to make one feel cross the longer he hunted the hungrier and crosser he grew suddenly he thought of danny meadow mouse  illustration hooty the owl was hungry and cross  i suppose he is asleep somewhere safe and snug under the snow grumbled hooty but he might be he just might be out for a frolic in the moonlight i believe ill go down on the meadows and see  now hooty the owl can fly without making the teeniest weeniest sound it seems as if he just drifts along through the air like a great shadow now he spread his great wings and floated out over the meadows you know hooty can see as well at night as most folks can by day and it was not long before he saw danny meadow mouse skipping about on the snow and dodging in and out of his little round doorways hootys great eyes grew brighter and fiercer without a sound he floated through the moonlight until he was just over danny meadow mouse  too late danny looked up his little song ended in a tiny squeak of fear and he started for his nearest little round doorway hooty the owl reached down with his long cruel claws anddanny meadow mouse was caught at last     chapter x  a strange ride and how it ended   danny meadow mouse often had sat watching skimmer the swallow sailing around up in the blue blue sky he had watched ol mistah buzzard go up up up until he was nothing but a tiny speck and danny had wondered how it would seem to be way up above the green meadows and the green forest and look down it had seemed to him that it must be very wonderful and beautiful sometimes he had wished that he had wings and could go up in the air and look down and now here he was he danny meadow mouse actually doing that very thing  but danny could see nothing wonderful or beautiful now no indeed everything was terrible for you see danny meadow mouse wasnt flying himself he was being carried yes sir danny meadow mouse was being carried through the air in the cruel claws of hooty the owl and all because danny had forgottenforgotten to watch up in the sky for danger  poor poor danny meadow mouse hootys great cruel claws hurt him dreadfully but it wasnt the pain that was the worst no indeed it wasnt the pain it was the thought of what would happen when hooty reached his home in the green forest for he knew that there hooty would gobble him up bones and all as he flew hooty kept chuckling and danny meadow mouse knew just what those chuckles meant they meant that hooty was thinking of the good meal he was going to have  hanging there in hootys great cruel claws danny looked down on the snowcovered green meadows he loved so well they seemed a frightfully long way below him though really they were not far at all for hooty was flying very low but danny meadow mouse had never in all his life been so high up before and so it seemed to him that he was way way up in the sky and he shut his eyes so as not to see but he couldnt keep them shut no sir he couldnt keep them shut he just had to keep opening them there was the dear old green forest drawing nearer and nearer it always had looked very beautiful to danny meadow mouse but now it looked terrible very terrible indeed because over in it hidden away there in some dark place was the home of hooty the owl  just ahead of him was the old briarpatch where peter rabbit lives so safely every old bramble in it was covered with snow and it was very very beautiful really everything was just as beautiful as everthe moonlight the green forest the snowcovered green meadows the old briarpatch the only change was in danny meadow mouse himself and it was all because he had forgotten  suddenly danny began to wriggle and struggle keep still snapped hooty the owl  but danny only struggled harder than ever it seemed to him that hooty wasnt holding him as tightly as at first he felt one of hootys claws slip it tore his coat and hurt dreadfully but it slipped the fact is hooty had only grabbed danny meadow mouse by the loose part of his coat and up in the air he couldnt get hold of danny any better danny kicked squirmed and twisted and twisted squirmed and kicked he felt his coat tear and of course the skin with it but he kept right on for now he was hanging almost free hooty had started down now so as to get a better hold danny gave one more kick and thenhe felt himself falling  danny meadow mouse shut his eyes and held his breath down down down he fell it seemed to him that he never would strike the snowcovered meadows really he fell only a very little distance but it seemed a terrible distance to danny he hit something that scratched him and then plump he landed in the soft snow right in the very middle of the old briarpatch and the last thing he remembered was hearing the scream of disappointment and rage of hooty the owl     chapter xi  peter rabbit gets a fright   peter rabbit sat in his favorite place in the middle of the dear old briarpatch trying to decide which way he would go on his travels that night the night before he had had a narrow escape from old granny fox over in the green forest there was nothing to eat around the smiling pool and no one to talk to there any more and you know that peter must either eat or ask questions in order to be perfectly happy no the smiling pool was too dull a place to interest peter on such a beautiful moonlight night and peter had no mind to try his legs against those of old granny fox again in the green forest  early that morning just after peter had settled down for his morning nap tommy tit the chickadee had dropped into the dear old briarpatch just to be neighborly peter was just dozing off when he heard the cheeriest little voice in the world it was saying    deedeechickadee   i see you can you see me  peter began to smile even before he could get his eyes open and look up there right over his head was tommy tit hanging head down from a nodding old bramble in a twinkling he was down on the snow right in front of peter then up in the brambles again right side up upside down here there everywhere never still a minute and all the time chattering away in the cheeriest little voice in the world    deedeechickadee   im as happy as can be   find it much the better way   to be happy all the day   deedeechickadee   everybodys good to me  hello tommy said peter rabbit whered you come from  from farmer browns new orchard up on the hill its a fine orchard peter rabbit a fine orchard i go there every morning for my breakfast if the winter lasts long enough ill have all the trees cleaned up for farmer brown  peter looked puzzled what do you mean he asked  just what i say replied tommy tit almost turning a somersault in the air theres a million eggs of insects on those young peach trees but im clearing them all off as fast as i can theyre mighty fine eating peter rabbit mighty fine eating and with that tommy tit had said goodby and flitted away  peter was thinking of that young orchard now as he sat in the moonlight trying to make up his mind where to go the thought of those young peach trees made his mouth water it was a long way up to the orchard on the hill a very long way and peter was wondering if it really was safe to go he had just about made up his mind to try it for peter is very very fond of the bark of young peach trees when thump something dropped out of the sky at his very feet  it startled peter so that he nearly tumbled over backward and right at the same instant came the fierce angry scream of hooty the owl that almost made peters heart stop beating although he knew that hooty couldnt get him down there in the old briarpatch when peter got his wits together and his heart didnt go so jumpy he looked to see what had dropped so close to him out of the sky his big eyes grew bigger than ever and he rubbed them to make quite sure that he really saw what he thought he saw yes there was no doubt about itthere at his feet lay danny meadow mouse  illustration peter rabbit was surprised to see danny     chapter xii  the old briarpatch has a new tenant   danny meadow mouse slowly opened his eyes and then closed them again quickly as if afraid to look around he could hear someone talking it was a pleasant voice not at all like the terrible voice of hooty the owl which was the very last thing that danny meadow mouse could remember danny lay still a minute and listened  why danny meadow mouse where in the world did you drop from asked the voice it sounded likewhy very much like peter rabbit speaking danny opened his eyes again it was peter rabbit  wherewhere am i asked danny meadow mouse in a very weak and small voice  in the middle of the dear old briarpatch with me replied peter rabbit but how did you get here you seemed to drop right out of the sky  danny meadow mouse shuddered suddenly he remembered everything how hooty the owl had caught him in great cruel claws and had carried him through the moonlight across the snowcovered green meadows how he had felt hootys claws slip and then had struggled and kicked and twisted and turned until his coat had torn and he had dropped down down down until he had landed in the soft snow and knocked all the breath out of his little body the very last thing he could remember was hootys fierce scream of rage and disappointment danny shuddered again  then a new thought came to him he must get out of sight hooty might catch him again danny tried to scramble to his feet  ouch oh groaned danny and lay still again  there there keep still danny meadow mouse theres nothing to be afraid of here said peter rabbit gently his big eyes filled with tears as he looked at danny meadow mouse for danny was all torn and hurt by the cruel claws of hooty the owl and you know peter has a very tender heart  so danny lay still and while peter rabbit tried to make him comfortable and dress his hurts he told peter all about how he had forgotten to watch up in the sky and so had been caught by hooty the owl and all about his terrible ride in hootys cruel claws  oh dear whatever shall i do now he ended however shall i get back home to my warm house of grass my safe little tunnels under the snow and my little store of seeds in the snug hollow in the old fencepost  peter rabbit looked thoughtful you cant do it said he you simply cant do it it is such a long way for a little fellow like you that it wouldnt be safe to try if you went at night hooty the owl might catch you again if you tried in daylight old roughleg the hawk would be almost sure to see you and night or day old granny fox or reddy fox might come snooping around and if they did they would be sure to catch you i tell you what you stay right here the dear old briarpatch is the safest place in the world why just think here you can come out in broad daylight and laugh at granny and reddy fox and at old roughleg the hawk because the good old brambles will keep them out if they try to get you you can make just as good tunnels under the snow here as you had there and there are lots and lots of seeds on the ground to eat you know i dont care for them myself im lonesome sometimes living here all alone you stay here and well have the old briarpatch to ourselves  danny meadow mouse looked at peter gratefully i will and thank you ever so much peter rabbit he said  and this is how the dear old briarpatch happened to have another tenant     chapter xiii  peter rabbit visits the peach orchard   dont go peter rabbit dont go begged danny meadow mouse  peter hopped to the edge of the old briarpatch and looked over the moonlit snowcovered meadows to the hill back of farmer browns house on that hill was the young peach orchard of which tommy tit the chickadee had told him and ever since peters mouth had watered and watered every time he thought of those young peach trees and the tender bark on them  i think i will danny just this once said peter its a long way and ive never been there before but i guess its just as safe as the meadows or the green forest    oh im as bold as bold can be     sing hoppyhippyhippyhopo   ill hie me forth the world to see     sing hoppyhippyhippyhopo       my ears are long       my legs are strong       so now good day       ill hie away     sing hoppyhippyhippyhopo  and with that peter rabbit left the dear safe old briarpatch and away he went lippertylippertylip across the green meadows towards the hill and the young orchard back of farmer browns house  danny meadow mouse watched him go and shook his head in disapproval foolish foolish foolish he said over and over to himself why cant peter be content with the good things that he has  peter rabbit hurried along through the moonlight stopping every few minutes to sit up to look and listen he heard the fierce hunting call of hooty the owl way over in the green forest so he felt sure that at present there was nothing to fear from him he knew that since their return to the green meadows and the green forest granny and reddy fox had kept away from farmer browns so he did not worry about them  all in good time peter came to the young orchard it was just as tommy tit the chickadee had told him peter hopped up to the nearest peach tree and nibbled the bark my how good it tasted he went all around the tree stripping off the bark he stood up on his long hind legs and reached as high as he could then he dug the snow away and ate down as far as he could when he could get no more tender young bark he went on to the next tree  now though peter didnt know it he was in the very worst kind of mischief you see when he took off all the bark all the way around the young peach tree he killed the tree for you know it is on the inside of the bark that the sap which gives life to a tree and makes it grow goes up from the roots to all the branches so when peter ate the bark all the way around the trunk of the young tree he had made it impossible for the sap to come up in the spring oh it was the worst kind of mischief that peter rabbit was in  but peter didnt know it and he kept right on filling that big stomach of his and enjoying it so much that he forgot to watch out for danger suddenly just as he had begun on another tree a great roar right behind him made him jump almost out of his skin he knew that voice and without waiting to even look behind him he started for the stone wall on the other side of the orchard right at his heels his great mouth wide open was bowser the hound     chapter xiv  farmer brown sets a trap   peter rabbit was in trouble he had got into mischief and now like everyone who gets into mischief he wished that he hadnt the worst of it was that he was a long way from his home in the dear old briarpatch and he didnt know how he ever could get back there again where was he why in the stone wall on one side of farmer browns young peach orchard how peter blessed the old stone wall in which he had found a safe hidingplace bowser had hung around nearly all night so that peter had not dared to try to go home now it was daylight and peter knew it would not be safe to put his nose outside  peter was worried so worried that he couldnt go to sleep as he usually does in the daytime so he sat hidden in the old wall and waited and watched by and by he saw farmer brown and farmer browns boy come out into the orchard right away they saw the mischief which peter had done and he could tell by the sound of their voices that they were very very angry they went away but before long they were back again and all day long peter watched them work putting something around each of the young peachtrees peter grew so curious that he forgot all about his troubles and how far away from home he was he could hardly wait for night to come so that he might see what they had been doing  just as jolly round red mr sun started to go to bed behind the purple hills farmer brown and his boy started back to the house farmer brown was smiling now  i guess that will fix him he said  now what does he mean by that thought peter whom will it fix can it be me i dont need any fixing  he waited just as long as he could when all was still and the moonlight had begun to make shadows of the trees on the snow peter very cautiously crept out of his hidingplace bowser the hound was nowhere in sight and everything was as quiet and peaceful as it had been when he first came into the orchard the night before peter had fully made up his mind to go straight home as fast as his long legs would take him but his dreadful curiosity insisted that first he must find out what farmer brown and his boy had been doing to the young peach trees  so peter hurried over to the nearest tree all around the trunk of the tree from the ground clear up higher than peter could reach was wrapped wire netting peter couldnt get so much as a nibble of the delicious bark he hadnt intended to take any for he had meant to go right straight home but now that he couldnt get any he wanted some more than everjust a bite peter looked around everything was quiet he would try the next tree and then he would go home  but the next tree was wrapped with wire peter hesitated looked around turned to go home thought of how good that bark had tasted the night before hesitated again and then hurried over to the third tree it was protected just like the others then peter forgot all about going home he wanted some of that delicious bark and he ran from one tree to another as fast as he could go  illustration the tree trunks were wrapped in wire netting  at last way down at the end of the orchard peter found a tree that had no wire around it they must have forgotten this one he thought and his eyes sparkled all around on the snow were a lot of little shiny wires but peter didnt notice them all he saw was that delicious bark on the young peach tree he hopped right into the middle of the wires and then just as he reached up to take the first bite of bark he felt something tugging at one of his hind legs     chapter xv  peter rabbit is caught in a snare   when peter rabbit reaching up to nibble the bark of one of farmer browns young trees felt something tugging at one of his hind legs he was so startled that he jumped to get away instead of doing this he fell flat on his face the thing on his hind leg had tightened and held him fast a great fear came to peter rabbit and lying there in the snow he kicked and struggled with all his might but the more he kicked the tighter grew that hateful thing on his leg finally he grew too tired to kick any more and lay still the dreadful thing that held him hurt his leg but it didnt pull when he lay still  when he had grown a little calmer peter sat up to examine the thing which held him so fast it was something like one of the blackberry vines he had sometimes tripped over only it was bright and shiny and had no branches or tiny prickers and one end was fastened to a stake peter tried to bite off the shiny thing but even his great sharp front teeth couldnt cut it then peter knew what it was it was wire it was a snare which farmer brown had set to catch him and which he had walked right into because he had been so greedy for the bark of the young peach tree that he had not used his eyes to look out for danger  oh how peter rabbit did wish that he had not been so curious to know what farmer brown had been doing that day and that he had gone straight home as he had meant to do instead of trying to get one more meal of young peach bark big tears rolled down peters cheeks what should he do what could he do for a long time peter sat in the moonlight trying to think of something to do at last he thought of the stake to which that hateful wire was fastened the stake was of wood and peters teeth would cut wood peters heart gave a great leap of hope and he began at once to dig away the snow from around the stake and then settled himself to gnaw the stake in two  peter had been hard at work on the stake a long time and had it a little more than half cut through when he heard a loud sniff down at the other end of the orchard he looked up to seewhom do you think why bowser the hound he hadnt seen peter yet but he had already found peters tracks and it would be but a few minutes before he found peter himself  poor peter rabbit there wasnt time to finish cutting off the stake what could he do he made a frightened jump just as he had when he first felt the wire tugging at his leg just as before he was thrown flat on his face he scrambled to his feet and jumped again only to be thrown just as before just then bowser the hound saw him and opening his mouth sent forth a great roar peter made one more frantic jump snap the stake had broken peter pitched forward on his head turned a somersault and scrambled to his feet he was free at last that is he could run but after him dragged a piece of the stake  how peter did run it was hard work for you know he had to drag that piece of stake after him but he did it and just in time he crawled into the old stone wall on one side of the orchard while bowser the hound barked his disappointment to the moon     chapter xvi  peter rabbits hard journey   peter rabbit sat in the old stone wall along one side of farmer browns orchard waiting for mrs moon to put out her light and leave the world in darkness until jolly round red mr sun should kick off his rosy bedclothes and begin his daily climb up in the blue blue sky in the winter mr sun is a late sleeper and peter knew that there would be two or three hours after mrs moon put out her light when it would be quite dark and peter also knew too that by this time hooty the owl would probably have caught his dinner so would old granny fox and reddy fox bowser the hound would be too sleepy to be on the watch it would be the very safest time for peter to try to get to his home in the dear old briarpatch  so peter waited and waited twice bowser the hound who had chased him into the old wall came over and barked at him and tried to get at him but the old wall kept peter safe and bowser gave it up and all the time peter sat waiting he was in great pain you see that shiny wire was drawn so tight that it cut into his flesh and hurt dreadfully and to the other end of the wire was fastened a piece of wood part of the stake to which the snare had been made fast and which peter had managed to gnaw and break off  it was on account of this that peter was waiting for mrs moon to put out her light he knew that with that stake dragging after him he would have to go very slowly and he could not run any more risk of danger than he actually had to so he waited and waited and by and by sure enough mrs moon put out her light peter waited a little longer listening with all his might everything was still then peter crept out of the old stone wall  right away trouble began the stake dragging at the end of the wire fast to his leg caught among the stones and pulled peter up short my how it did hurt it made the tears come but peter shut his teeth hard and turning back he worked until he got the stake free then he started on once more dragging the stake after him  very slowly across the orchard and under the fence on the other side crept peter rabbit his leg so stiff and sore that he could hardly touch it to the snow and all the time dragging that piece of stake which seemed to grow heavier and harder to drag every minute peter did not dare to go out across the open fields for fear some danger might happen along and he would have no place to hide so he crept along close to the fences where bushes grow and this made it very very hard for the dragging stake was forever catching in the bushes with a yank at the sore leg which brought peter up short with a squeal of pain  this was bad enough but all the time peter was filled with a dreadful fear that hooty the owl or granny fox might just happen along he had to stop to rest very very often and then he would listen and listen over and over again he said to himself  oh dear whatever did i go up to the young peach orchard for when i knew i had no business there why couldnt i have been content with all the good things that were mine in the green forest and on the green meadows oh dear oh dear  just as jolly round red mr sun began to light up the green meadows peter rabbit reached the dear old briarpatch danny meadow mouse was sitting on the edge of it anxiously watching for him peter crawled up and started to creep in along one of his little private paths he got in himself but the dragging stake caught among the brambles and peter just fell down in the snow right where he was too tired and worn out to move     chapter xvii  danny meadow mouse becomes worried   danny meadow mouse limped around through the dear old briarpatch where he had lived with peter rabbit ever since he had squirmed out of the claws of hooty the owl and dropped there right at the feet of peter rabbit danny limped because he was still lame and sore from hootys terrible claws but he didnt let himself think much about that because he was so thankful to be alive at all so he limped around in the old briarpatch picking up seed which had fallen on the snow and sometimes pulling down a few of the red berries which cling all winter to the wild rose bushes the seeds in these were very nice indeed and danny always felt especially good after a meal of them  danny meadow mouse had grown very fond of peter rabbit for peter had been very very good to him danny felt that he never never could repay all of peters kindness it had been very good of peter to offer to share the old briarpatch with danny because danny was so far from his own home that it would not be safe for him to try to get back there but peter had done more than that he had taken care of danny such good care during the first few days after dannys escape from hooty the owl he had brought good things to eat while danny was too weak and sore to get things for himself oh peter had been very good indeed to him  but now as danny limped around he was not happy no sir he was not happy the truth is danny meadow mouse was worried it was a different kind of worry from any he had known before you see for the first time in his life danny was worrying about someone else he was worrying about peter rabbit peter had been gone from the old briarpatch a whole night and a whole day he often was gone all night but never all day too danny was sure that something had happened to peter he thought of how he had begged peter not to go up to farmer browns young peach orchard he had felt in his bones that it was not safe that something dreadful would happen to peter how peter had laughed at him and bravely started off why hadnt he come home  as he limped around danny talked to himself    why cannot people be content   with all the good things that are sent   and mind their own affairs at home   instead of going forth to roam  it was now the second night since peter rabbit had gone away danny meadow mouse couldnt sleep at all round and round through the old briarpatch he limped and finally sat down at the edge of it to wait and watch at last just as jolly round red mr sun sent his first long rays of light across the green meadows danny saw something crawling towards the old briarpatch he rubbed his eyes and looked again it wasno it couldnt beyes it was peter rabbit but what was the matter with him always before peter had come home lippertylippertylippertylip but now he was crawling actually crawling danny meadow mouse didnt know what to make of it  nearer and nearer came peter something was following him no peter was dragging something after him at last peter started to crawl along one of his little private paths into the old briarpatch the thing dragging behind caught in the brambles and peter fell headlong in the snow too tired and worn out to move then danny saw what the trouble was a wire was fast to one of peters long hind legs and to the other end of the wire was fastened part of a stake peter had been caught in a snare danny hurried over to peter and tears stood in his eyes  poor peter rabbit oh im so sorry peter he whispered     chapter xviii  danny meadow mouse returns a kindness   there peter rabbit lay he had dragged that piece of stake a long way a very long way indeed but now he could drag it no farther for it had caught in the bramble bushes so peter just dropped on the snow and cried yes sir he cried you see he was so tired and worn out and frightened and his leg was so stiff and sore and hurt him so and then it was so dreadful to actually get home and be stopped right on your very own doorstep so peter just lay there and cried just supposing old granny fox should come poking around and find peter caught that way all she would have to do would be to get hold of that hateful stake caught in the bramble bushes and pull peter out where she could get him do you wonder that peter cried  by and by he became aware that someone was wiping away his tears it was danny meadow mouse and danny was singing in a funny little voice pretty soon peter stopped crying and listened and this is what he heard    isnt any use to cry     not a bit not a bit   wipe your eyes and wipe em dry     use your wit use your wit   just remember that tomorrow   never brings a single sorrow   yesterday has gone forever   and tomorrow gets here never   chase your worries all away   nothings worse than just today  peter smiled in spite of himself  thats right thats right smile away peter rabbit smile away your troubles sir are all today and between you and me i dont believe they are so bad as you think they are now you lie still just where you are while i go see what can be done  with that off whisked danny meadow mouse as spry as you please in spite of his lame leg and in a few minutes peter knew by little twitches of the wire on his leg that danny was doing something at the other end he was danny meadow mouse had set out to gnaw that piece of stake all to splinters so there he sat and gnawed and gnawed and gnawed jolly round red mr sun climbed higher and higher in the sky and danny meadow mouse grew hungry but still he kept right on gnawing at that bothersome stake  illustration danny gnawed the stake which held peter  by and by happening to look across the snowcovered green meadows he saw something that made his heart jump it was farmer browns boy coming straight over towards the dear old briarpatch  danny didnt say a word to peter rabbit but gnawed faster than ever  farmer browns boy was almost there when danny stopped gnawing there was only a tiny bit of the stake left now and danny hurried to tell peter rabbit that there was nothing to stop him now from going to his most secret retreat in the very heart of the old briarpatch while peter slowly dragged his way along danny trotted behind to see that the wire did not catch on the bushes  they had safely reached peter rabbits secretest retreat when farmer browns boy came up to the edge of the dear old briarpatch  so this is where that rabbit that killed our peach tree lives said he well try a few snares and put you out of mischief  and for the rest of the afternoon farmer browns boy was very busy around the edge of the old briarpatch     chapter xix  peter rabbit and danny meadow mouse live high   peter rabbit sat in his secretest place in the dear old briarpatch with one of his long hind legs all swelled up and terribly sore because of the fine wire fast around it and cutting into it he could hear farmer browns boy going around on the edge of the dear old briarpatch and stopping every little while to do something in spite of his pain peter was curious finally he called danny meadow mouse  danny you are small and can keep out of sight easier than i can go as near as ever you dare to farmer browns boy and find out what he is doing said peter rabbit  so danny meadow mouse crept out as near to farmer browns boy as ever he dared and studied and studied to make out what farmer browns boy was doing by and by he returned to peter rabbit  i dont know what hes doing peter but hes putting something in every one of your private little paths leading into the briarpatch from the green meadows  ha said peter rabbit  there are little loops of that queer stuff youve got hanging to your leg peter continued danny meadow mouse  just so said peter rabbit  and hes put cabbage leaves and pieces of apple all around said danny  we must be careful said peter rabbit  peters leg was in a very bad way indeed and peter suffered a great deal of pain the worst of it was he didnt know how to get off the wire that was cutting into it so he had tried to cut the wire with his big teeth but he couldnt do it danny meadow mouse had tried and tried to gnaw the wire but it wasnt the least bit of use but danny wasnt easily discouraged and he kept working and working at it once he thought he felt it slip a little he said nothing but kept right on working pretty soon he was sure that it slipped he went right on working harder than ever by and by he had it so loose that he slipped it right off of peters leg and peter didnt know anything about it you see that cruel wire snare had been so tight that peter didnt have any feeling except of pain left in his leg and so when danny meadow mouse pulled the cruel wire snare off peter didnt know it until danny held it up in front of him  my how thankful peter was and how he did thank danny meadow mouse but danny said that it was nothing at all just nothing at all and that he owed more than that to peter rabbit for being so good to him and letting him live in the dear old briarpatch  it was a long time before peter could hop as he used to but after the first day he managed to get around he found that farmer browns boy had spread those miserable wire snares in every one of his private little paths but peter knew what they were now he showed danny meadow mouse how he because he was so small could safely run about among the snares and steal all the cabbage leaves and apples which farmer browns boy had put there for bait  danny meadow mouse thought this great fun and a great joke on farmer browns boy so every day he stole the bait and he and peter rabbit lived high while peters leg was getting well and all the time farmer browns boy wondered why he couldnt catch peter rabbit     chapter xx  timid danny meadow mouse   danny meadow mouse is timid everybody says so and what everybody says ought to be so but just as anybody can make a mistake sometimes so can everybody still in this case it is quite likely that everybody is right danny meadow mouse is timid ask peter rabbit ask sammy jay ask striped chipmunk they will all tell you the same thing sammy jay might even tell you that danny is afraid of his own shadow or that he tries to run away from his own tail of course this isnt true sammy jay likes to say mean things it isnt fair to danny meadow mouse to believe what sammy jay says  but the fact is danny certainly is timid more than this he isnt ashamed of itnot the least little bit  you see its this way said danny as he sat on his doorstep one sunny morning talking to his friend old mr toad if i werent afraid i wouldnt be all the time watching out and if i werent all the time watching out i wouldnt have any more chance than that foolish red ant running across in front of you  old mr toad looked where danny was pointing and his tongue darted out and back again so quickly that danny wasnt sure that he saw it at all but when he looked for the ant it was nowhere to be seen and there was a satisfied twinkle in mr toads eyes there was an answering twinkle in dannys own eyes as he continued  no sir said he i wouldnt stand a particle more chance than that foolish ant did now if i were big and strong like old man coyote or had swift wings like skimmer the swallow or were so homely and uglylooking that no one wanted me likelike danny hesitated and then finished rather lamely like some folks i know i suppose i wouldnt be afraid  old mr toad looked up sharply when danny mentioned homely and uglylooking people but danny was gazing far out across the green meadows and looked so innocent that mr toad concluded that he couldnt have had him in mind  well said he thoughtfully scratching his nose i suppose you may be right but for my part fear seems a very foolish thing now i dont know what it is i mind my own business and no one ever bothers me i should think it would be a very uncomfortable feeling  it is replied danny but as i said before it is a very good thing to keep one on guard when there are as many watching for one as there are for me now theres mr blacksnake and  where exclaimed old mr toad turning as pale as a toad can turn and looking uneasily and anxiously in every direction  danny turned his head to hide a smile if old mr toad wasnt showing fear no one ever did oh said he i didnt mean that he is anywhere around here now what i was going to say was that there is mr blacksnake and granny fox and reddy fox and redtail the hawk and hooty the owl and others i might name always watching for a chance to make a dinner from poor little me do you wonder that i am afraid most of the time  no replied old mr toad no i dont wonder that you are afraid it must be dreadful to feel hungry eyes are watching for you every minute of the day and night too  oh its not so bad replied danny its rather exciting besides it keeps my wits sharp all the time i am afraid i should find life very dull indeed if like you i feared nothing and nobody by the way see how queerly that grass is moving over there it looks as if mr blacksnakewhy mr toad where are you going in such a hurry  ive just remembered an important engagement with my cousin grandfather frog at the smiling pool shouted old mr toad over his shoulder as he hurried so that he fell over his own feet  danny chuckled as he sat alone on his doorstep oh no old mr toad doesnt know what fear is said he funny how some people wont admit what everybody can see for themselves now i am afraid and im willing to say so     chapter xxi  an exciting day for danny meadow mouse   danny meadow mouse started along one of his private little paths very early one morning he was on his way to get a supply of a certain kind of grass seed of which he is very fond he had been thinking about that seed for some time and waiting for it to get ripe now it was just right as he had found out the day before by a visit to the place where this particular grass grew the only trouble was it grew a long way from dannys home and to reach it he had to cross an open place where the grass was so short that he couldnt make a path under it  i feel it in my bones that this is going to be an exciting day said danny to himself as he trotted along i suppose that if i were really wise i would stay nearer home and do without that nice seed but nothing is really worth having unless it is worth working for and that seed will taste all the better if i have hard work getting it  so he trotted along his private little path his ears wide open and his eyes wide open and his little nose carefully testing every merry little breeze who happened along for any scent of danger which it might carry most of all he depended upon his ears for the grass was so tall that he couldnt see over it even when he sat up he had gone only a little way when he thought he heard a queer rustling behind him he stopped to listen there it was again and it certainly was right in the path behind him he didnt need to be told who was making it there was only one who could make such a sound as thatmr blacksnake  now danny can run very fast along his private little paths but he knew that mr blacksnake could run faster if my legs cant save me my wits must thought danny as he started to run as fast as ever he could i must reach that fallen old hollow fencepost  he was almost out of breath when he reached the post and scurried into the open end he knew by the sound of the rustling that mr blacksnake was right at his heels now the old post was hollow its whole length but halfway there was an old knothole just big enough for danny to squeeze through mr blacksnake didnt know anything about that hole and because it was dark inside the old post he didnt see danny pop through it danny ran back along the top of the log and was just in time to see the tip of mr blacksnakes tail disappear inside then what do you think danny did why he followed mr blacksnake right into the old post but in doing it he didnt make the least little bit of noise  mr blacksnake kept right on through the old post and out the other end for he was sure that that was the way danny had gone he kept right on along the little path now danny knew that he wouldnt go very far before he found out that he had been fooled and of course he would come back so danny waited only long enough to get his breath and then ran back along the path to where another little path branched off for just a minute he paused  if mr blacksnake follows me he will be sure to think that of course i have taken this other little path thought danny so i wont do it  then he ran harder than ever until he came to a place where two little paths branched off one to the right and one to the left he took the latter and scampered on sure that by this time mr blacksnake would be so badly fooled that he would give up the chase and danny was right    brains are better far than speed   as wise men long ago agreed  said danny as he trotted on his way for the grass seed he liked so well i felt it in my bones that this would be an exciting day i wonder what next     chapter xxii  what happened next to danny meadow mouse   danny is so used to narrow escapes that he doesnt waste any time thinking about them he didnt this time he who tries to look two ways at once is pretty sure to see nothing says danny and he knew that if he thought too much about the things that had already happened he couldnt keep a sharp watch for the things that might happen  nothing more happened as he hurried along his private little path to the edge of a great patch of grass so short that he couldnt hide under it he had to cross this and all the way he would be in plain sight of anyone who happened to be near very cautiously he peeped out and looked this way and looked that way not forgetting to look up in the sky he could see no one anywhere drawing a long breath danny started across the open place as fast as his short legs could take him  now all the time redtail the hawk had been sitting in a tree some distance away sitting so still that he looked like a part of the tree itself that is why danny hadnt seen him but redtail saw danny the instant he started across the open place for redtails eyes are very keen and he can see a great distance with a satisfied chuckle he spread his broad wings and started after danny  just about halfway to the safety of the long grass on the other side danny gave a hurried look behind him and his heart seemed to jump right into his mouth for there was redtail with his cruel claws already set to seize him danny gave a frightened squeak for he thought that surely this time he would be caught but he didnt mean to give up without trying to escape three jumps ahead of him was a queerlooking thing he didnt know what it was but if there was a hole in it he might yet fool redtail  one jump would he be able to reach it two jumps there was a hole in it three jumps with another frightened squeak danny dived into the opening just in time and what do you think he was in why an old tomato can farmer browns boy had once used to carry bait in when he went fishing at the smiling pool he had dropped it there on his way home  redtail screamed with rage and disappointment as he struck the old can with his great claws he had been sure very sure of danny meadow mouse this time he tried to pick the can up but he couldnt get hold of it it just rolled away from him every time try as he would finally in disgust he gave up and flew back to the tree from which he had first seen danny  illustration redtail the hawk screamed with rage as danny escaped  of course danny had been terribly frightened when the can rolled and by the noise the claws of redtail made when they struck his queer hidingplace but he wisely decided that the best thing he could do was to stay there for a while and it was very fortunate that he did so as he was very soon to find out     chapter xxiii  reddy fox grows curious   danny meadow mouse had sat perfectly still for a long time inside the old tomato can in which he had found a refuge from redtail the hawk he didnt dare so much as put his head out for a look around lest redtail should be circling overhead ready to pounce on him  if i stay here long enough hell get tired and go away if he hasnt already thought danny this has been a pretty exciting morning so far and i find that i am a little tired i may as well take a nap while i am waiting to make sure that the way is clear  with that danny curled up in the old tomato can but it wasnt meant that danny should have that nap he had closed his eyes but his ears were still open and presently he heard soft footsteps drawing near his eyes flew open and he forgot all about sleep you may be sure for those footsteps sounded familiar they sounded to danny very very much like the footsteps ofwhom do you think why reddy fox dannys heart began to beat faster as he listened could it be he didnt dare peep out presently a little whiff of scent blew into the old tomato can then danny knewit was reddy fox  oh dear i hope he doesnt find that i am in here thought danny i wonder what under the sun has brought him up here just now  if the truth were to be known it was curiosity that had brought reddy up there reddy had been hunting for his breakfast some distance away on the green meadows when redtail the hawk had tried so hard to catch danny meadow mouse reddys sharp eyes had seen redtail the minute he left the tree in pursuit of danny and he had known by the way redtail flew that he saw something he wanted to catch he had watched redtail swoop down and had heard his scream of rage when he missed danny because danny had dodged into the old tomato can he had seen redtail strike and strike again at something on the ground and finally fly off in disgust with empty claws  now i wonder what it was redtail was after and why he didnt get it thought reddy he acts terribly put out and disappointed i believe ill go over there and find out  off he started at a smart trot towards the patch of short grass where he had seen redtail the hawk striking at something on the ground as he drew near he crept very softly until he reached the very edge of the open patch there he stopped and looked sharply all over it there was nothing to be seen but an old tomato can reddy had seen it many times before  now what under the sun could redtail have been after here thought reddy the grass isnt long enough for a grasshopper to hide in and yet redtail didnt get what he was after its very queer it certainly is very queer  he trotted out and began to run back and forth with his nose to the ground hoping that his nose would tell him what his eyes couldnt back and forth back and forth he ran and then suddenly he stopped  ha exclaimed reddy he had found the scent left by danny meadow mouse when he ran across towards the old tomato can right up to the old can reddys nose led him he hopped over the old can but on the other side he could find no scent of danny meadow mouse in a flash he understood and a gleam of satisfaction shone in his yellow eyes as he turned back to the old can he knew that danny must be hiding in there  ive got you this time he snarled as he sniffed at the opening in the end of the can     chapter xxiv  reddy fox loses his temper   reddy fox had caught danny meadow mouse and yet he hadnt caught him he had found danny hiding in the old tomato can and it didnt enter reddys head that he couldnt get danny out when he wanted to he was in no hurry he had had a pretty good breakfast of grasshoppers and so he thought he would torment danny a while before gobbling him up he lay down so that he could peep in at the open end of the old can and see danny trying to make himself as small as possible at the other end reddy grinned until he showed all his long teeth reddy always is a bully especially when his victim is a great deal smaller and weaker than himself  ive got you this time mr smarty havent i taunted reddy  danny didnt say anything  you think youve been very clever because you have fooled me two or three times dont you well this time ive got you where your tricks wont work continued reddy so what are you going to do about it  danny didnt answer the fact is he was too frightened to answer besides he didnt know what he could do so he just kept still but his bright eyes never once left reddys cruel face for all his fright danny was doing some hard thinking he had been in tight places before and had learned never to give up hope something might happen to frighten reddy away anyway reddy had to get him out of that old can before he would admit that he was really caught  for a long time reddy lay there licking his chops and saying all the things he could think of to frighten poor danny meadow mouse at last he grew tired of this and made up his mind that it was time to end it and danny meadow mouse at the same time he thrust his sharp nose in at the opening in the end of the old can but the opening was too small for him to get more than his nose in and he only scratched it on the sharp edges without so much as touching danny  ill pull you out said reddy and thrust in one black paw  danny promptly bit it so hard that reddy yelped with pain and pulled it out in a hurry presently he tried again with the other paw danny bit this one harder still and reddy danced with pain and anger then he lost his temper completely a very foolish thing to do as it always is he hit the old can and away it rolled with danny meadow mouse inside this seemed to make reddy angrier than ever he sprang after it and hit it again then he batted it first this way and then that way growing angrier and angrier and all the time danny meadow mouse managed to keep inside although he got a terrible shaking up  back and forth across the patch of short grass reddy knocked the old can and he was in such a rage that he didnt notice where he was knocking it to finally he sent it spinning into the long grass on the far side of the open patch close to one of dannys private little paths like a flash danny was out and scurrying along the little path he dodged into another and presently into a third which brought him to a tangle of barbed wire left there by farmer brown when he had built a new fence under this he was safe  phew exclaimed danny breathing very hard that was the narrowest escape yet but i guess ill get that special grass seed i started out for after all  and he did while to this day reddy fox wonders how danny got out of the old tomato can without his knowing it  and so you see what temper does   for those who give it rein it cheats them of the very thing   they seek so hard to gain
