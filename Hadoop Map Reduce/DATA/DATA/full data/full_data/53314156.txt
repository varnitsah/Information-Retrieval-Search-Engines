the dead and the living one a new years eve in war time i met a man i looked up from my writing  finale the coming of the end afterwards    moments of vision          that mirror    which makes of men a transparency       who holds that mirror and bids us such a breastbare spectacle see       of you and me        that mirror    whose magic penetrates like a dart       who lifts that mirror and throws our mind back on us and our heart       until we start        that mirror    works well in these night hours of ache       why in that mirror are tincts we never see ourselves once take       when the world is awake        that mirror    can test each mortal when unaware       yea that strange mirror may catch his last thoughts whole life foul or fair       glassing itwhere    the voice of things    forty augustsaye and several moreago    when i paced the headlands loosed from dull employ the waves huzzad like a multitude below    in the sway of an allincluding joy       without cloy  blankly i walked there a double decade after    when thwarts had flung their toils in front of me and i heard the waters wagging in a long ironic laughter    at the lot of men and all the vapoury       things that be  wheeling change has set me again standing where    once i heard the waves huzza at lammastide but they supplicate nowlike a congregation there    who murmur the confessioni outside       prayer denied    why be at pains wooers song    why be at pains that i should know    you sought not me do breezes then make features glow    so rosily come the lit port is at our back    and the tumbling sea elsewhere the lampless uphill track    to uncertainty  o should not we two waifs join hands    i am alone you would enrich me more than lands    by being my own yet though this facile moment flies    close is your tone and ere tomorrows dewfall dries    i plough the unknown    we sat at the window bournemouth 1875    we sat at the window looking out and the rain came down like silken strings that swithins day  each gutter and spout babbled unchecked in the busy way    of witless things nothing to read nothing to see seemed in that room for her and me    on swithins day  we were irked by the scene by our own selves yes for i did not know nor did she infer how much there was to read and guess by her in me and to see and crown    by me in her wasted were two souls in their prime and great was the waste that july time    when the rain came down    afternoon service at mellstock circa 1850       on afternoons of drowsy calm       we stood in the panelled pew singing onevoiced a tateandbrady psalm       to the tune of cambridge new     we watched the elms we watched the rooks       the clouds upon the breeze between the whiles of glancing at our books       and swaying like the trees     so mindless were those outpourings        though i am not aware that i have gained by subtle thought on things       since we stood psalming there    at the wicketgate    there floated the sounds of churchchiming    but no one was nigh till there came as a break in the loneness    her father she i and we slowly moved on to the wicket    and downlooking stood till anon people passed and amid them    we parted for good  greater wiser may part there than we three    who parted there then but never will fates colderfeatured    hold sway there again of the churchgoers through the still meadows    no single one knew what a play was played under their eyes there    as thence we withdrew    in a museum    i  heres the mould of a musical bird long passed from light which over the earth before man came was winging theres a contralto voice i heard last night that lodges in me still with its sweet singing  ii  such a dream is time that the coo of this ancient bird has perished not but is blent or will be blending mid visionless wilds of space with the voice that i heard in the fullfugued song of the universe unending  exeter    apostrophe to an old psalm tune    i met you firstah when did i first meet you when i was full of wonder and innocent standing meekeyed with those of choric bent    while dimming day grew dimmer       in the pulpitglimmer  much riper in years i met youin a temple where summer sunset streamed upon our shapes and you spread over me like a gauze that drapes    and flapped from floor to rafters       sweet as angels laughters  but you had been stripped of some of your old vesture by monk or another  now you wore no frill and at first you startled me  but i knew you still    though i missed the minims waver       and the dotted quaver  i grew accustomed to you thus  and you hailed me through one who evoked you often  then at last your raiser was borne off and i mourned you had passed    from my life with your late outsetter       till i said tis better  but you waylaid me  i rose and went as a ghost goes and said eyesfull ill never hear it again it is overmuch for scathed and memoried men    when sitting among strange people       under their steeple  now a new stirrer of tones calls you up before me and wakes your speech as she of endor did when sought by saul who in disguises hid    fell down on the earth to hear it       samuels spirit  so your quired oracles beat till they make me tremble as i discern your mien in the old attire here in these turmoiled years of belligerent fire    living still onand onward maybe       till dooms great day be  sunday august 13 1916    at the word farewell    she looked like a bird from a cloud    on the clammy lawn moving alone barebrowed    in the dim of dawn the candles alight in the room    for my parting meal made all things withoutdoors loom    strange ghostly unreal  the hour itself was a ghost    and it seemed to me then as of chances the chance furthermost    i should see her again i beheld not where all was so fleet    that a plan of the past which had ruled us from birthtime to meet    was in working at last  no prelude did i there perceive    to a drama at all or foreshadow what fortune might weave    from beginnings so small but i rose as if quicked by a spur    i was bound to obey and stepped through the casement to her    still alone in the gray  i am leaving you    farewell i said    as i followed her on by an alley bare boughs overspread    i soon must be gone even then the scale might have been turned    against love by a feather  but crimson one cheek of hers burned    when we came in together    first sight of her and after    a day is drawing to its fall    i had not dreamed to see the first of many to enthrall    my spirit will it be or is this eve the end of all    such new delight for me  i journey home  the pattern grows    of moonshades on the way soon the first quarter i suppose    skyglancing travellers say i realize that it for those    has been a common day    the rival       i determined to find out whose it was     the portrait he looked at so and sighed bitterly have i rued my meanness       and wept for it since he died     i searched his desk when he was away    and there was the likenessyes my own taken when i was the seasons fairest       and timelines all unknown     i smiled at my image and put it back    and he went on cherishing it until i was chafed that he loved not the me then living       but that past woman still     well such was my jealousy at last    i destroyed that face of the former me could you ever have dreamed the heart of woman       would work so foolishly    heredity    i am the family face flesh perishes i live on projecting trait and trace through time to times anon and leaping from place to place over oblivion  the yearsheired feature that can in curve and voice and eye despise the human span of durancethat is i the eternal thing in man that heeds no call to die    you were the sort that men forget       you were the sort that men forget       though inot yet  perhaps not ever  your slighted weakness    adds to the strength of my regret     youd not the artyou never had       for good or bad  to make men see how sweet your meaning    which visible had charmed them glad     you would by words inept let fall       offend them all even if they saw your warm devotion    would hold your lifes blood at their call     you lacked the eye to understand       those friends offhand whose mode was crude though whose dim purport    outpriced the courtesies of the bland     i am now the only being who       remembers you it may be  what a waste that nature    grudged soul so dear the art its due    she i and they          i was sitting       she was knitting and the portraits of our forefolk hung around    when there struck on us a sigh    ahwhat is that said i was it not you said she  a sigh did sound        i had not breathed it       nor the nightwind heaved it and how it came to us we could not guess    and we looked up at each face    framed and glazed there in its place still hearkening but thenceforth was silentness        half in dreaming       then its meaning said we must be surely this that they repine    that we should be the last    of stocks once unsurpassed and unable to keep up their sturdy line  1916    near lanivet 1872    there was a stunted handpost just on the crest    only a few feet high she was tired and we stopped in the twilighttime for her rest    at the crossways close thereby  she leant back being so weary against its stem    and laid her arms on its own each open palm stretched out to each end of them    her sad face sideways thrown  her whiteclothed form at this dimlit cease of day    made her look as one crucified in my gaze at her from the midst of the dusty way    and hurriedly dont i cried  i do not think she heard  loosing thence she said    as she stepped forth ready to go i am rested nowsomething strange came into my head    i wish i had not leant so  and wordless we moved onward down from the hill    in the west clouds murked obscure and looking back we could see the handpost still    in the solitude of the moor  it struck her too i thought for as if afraid    she heavily breathed as we trailed till she said i did not think how twould look in the shade    when i leant there like one nailed  i lightly  theres nothing in it  for you anyhow   o i know there is not said she    yet i wonder      if no one is bodily crucified now    in spirit one may be  and we dragged on and on while we seemed to see    in the running of times far glass her crucified as she had wondered if she might be    some dayalas alas    joys of memory       when the spring comes round and a certain day looks out from the brume by the eastern copsetrees          and says remember       i begin again as if it were new       a day of like date i once lived through       whiling it hour by hour away          so shall i do till my december             when spring comes round     i take my holiday then and my rest away from the dun life here about me          old hours regreeting       with the quiet sense that bring they must       such throbs as at first till i house with dust       and in the numbness my heartsome zest          for things that were be past repeating             when spring comes round    to the moon       what have you looked at moon       in your time    now long past your prime o i have looked at often looked at       sweet sublime sore things shudderful night and noon       in my time     what have you mused on moon       in your day    so aloof so far away o i have mused on often mused on       growth decay nations alive dead mad aswoon       in my day     have you much wondered moon       on your rounds    selfwrapt beyond earths bounds yea i have wondered often wondered       at the sounds reaching me of the human tune       on my rounds     what do you think of it moon       as you go    is life much or no o i think of it often think of it       as a show god ought surely to shut up soon       as i go    copying architecture in an old minster wimborne       how smartly the quarters of the hour march by       that the jackoclock never forgets    dingdong and before i have traced a cusps eye or got the true twist of the ogee over          a double dingdong ricochetts     just so did he clang here before i came       and so will he clang when im gone    through the minsters cavernous hollowsthe same tale of hours never more to be will he deliver       to the speechless midnight and dawn     i grow to conceive it a call to ghosts       whose mould lies below and around    yes the next come come draws them out from their posts and they gather and one shade appears and another       as the evedamps creep from the ground     seea courtenay stands by his quatrefoiled tomb       and a duke and his duchess near    and one sir edmund in columned gloom and a saxon king by the presbytery chamber       and shapes unknown in the rear     maybe they have met for a parle on some plan       to better ailstricken mankind    i catch their cheepings though thinner than the overhead creak of a passagers pinion       when leaving land behind     or perhaps they speak to the yet unborn       and caution them not to come    to a world so ancient and troubletorn of foiled intents vain lovingkindness       and ardours chilled and numb     they waste to fog as i stir and stand       and move from the arched recess    and pick up the drawing that slipped from my hand and feel for the pencil i dropped in the cranny       in a moments forgetfulness    to shakespeare after three hundred years       bright baffling soul least capturable of themes    thou who displaydst a life of commonplace    leaving no intimate word or personal trace    of high design outside the artistry       of thy penned dreams still shalt remain at heart unread eternally     through human orbits thy discourse today    despite thy formal pilgrimage throbs on    in harmonies that cow oblivion    and like the wind with alluncared effect       maintain a sway not foredesired in tracks unchosen and unchecked     and yet at thy last breath with mindless note    the borough clocks but samely tongued the hour    the avon just as always glassed the tower    thy age was published on thy passingbell       but in due rote with other dwellers deaths accorded a like knell     and at the strokes some townsman met maybe    and thereon queried by some squires good dame    driving in shopward may have given thy name    with yes a worthy man and welltodo       though as for me i knew him but by just a neighbours nod tis true     i faith few knew him much here save by word    he having elsewhere led his busier life    though to be sure he left with us his wife   ah one of the tradesmens sons i now recall          witty ive heard    we did not know him    well goodday  death comes to all     so like a strange bright bird we sometimes find    to mingle with the barndoor brood awhile    then vanish from their homely domicile     into mans poesy we wot not whence       flew thy strange mind lodged there a radiant guest and sped for ever thence  1916    quid hic agis    i  when i weekly knew an ancient pew and murmured there the forms of prayer and thanks and praise in the ancient ways and heard read out during august drought that chapter from kings harvesttime brings  how the prophet broken by griefs unspoken went heavily away to fast and to pray and while waiting to die the lord passed by and a whirlwind and fire drew nigher and nigher and a small voice anon bade him up and be gone  i did not apprehend as i sat to the end and watched for her smile across the sunned aisle that this tale of a seer which came once a year might when sands were heaping be like a sweat creeping or in any degree bear on her or on me  ii  when later by chance of circumstance it befel me to read on a hot afternoon at the lectern there the selfsame words as the lesson decreed to the gathered few from the hamlets near  folk of flocks and herds sitting half aswoon who listened thereto as women and men not overmuch concerned at such  so like them then i did not see what drought might be with me with her as the kalendar moved on and time devoured our prime  iii  but now at last when our glory has passed and there is no smile from her in the aisle but where it once shone a marble men say with her name thereon is discerned today and spiritless in the wilderness i shrink from sight and desire the night though as in old wise i might still arise go forth and stand and prophesy in the land i feel the shake of wind and earthquake and consuming fire nigher and nigher and the voice catch clear what doest thou here  the spectator 1916  during the war    on a midsummer eve    i idly cut a parsley stalk and blew therein towards the moon i had not thought what ghosts would walk with shivering footsteps to my tune  i went and knelt and scooped my hand as if to drink into the brook and a faint figure seemed to stand above me with the bygone look  i lipped rough rhymes of chance not choice i thought not what my words might be there came into my ear a voice that turned a tenderer verse for me    timing her written to an old folktune    lalages coming where is she now o turning to bow o and smile is she just at parting parting parting as she is starting to come to me  where is she now o now and now o shadowing a bough o of hedge or tree as she is rushing rushing rushing gossamers brushing to come to me  lalages coming where is she now o climbing the brow o of hills i see yes she is nearing nearing nearing weather unfearing to come to me  near is she now o now and now o milk the rich cow o forward the tea shake the down bed for her linen sheets spread for her drape round the head for her coming to me  lalages coming shes nearer now o end anyhow o todays husbandry would a gilt chair were mine slippers of vair were mine brushes for hair were mine of ivory  what will she think o she whos so comely viewing how homely a sort are we nothing resplendent no prompt attendant not one dependent pertaining to me  lalages coming where is she now o fain id avow o full honestly nought heres enough for her all is too rough for her even my love for her poor in degree  shes nearer now o still nearer now o she tis i vow o passing the lea rush down to meet her there call out and greet her there never a sweeter there crossed to me  lalages come aye come is she now o    does heaven allow o a meeting to be yes she is here now here now here now nothing to fear now heres lalage    before knowledge    when i walked roseless tracks and wide ere dawned your date for meeting me o why did you not cry halloo across the stretch between and say  we move while years as yet divide on closing lines whichthough it be you know me not nor i know you  will intersect and join some day     then well i had borne    each scraping thorn    but the winters froze    and grew no rose    no bridge bestrode    the gap at all    no shape you showed    and i heard no call    the blinded bird    so zestfully canst thou sing and all this indignity with gods consent on thee blinded ere yet awing by the redhot needle thou i stand and wonder how so zestfully thou canst sing  resenting not such wrong thy grievous pain forgot eternal dark thy lot groping thy whole life long after that stab of fire enjailed in pitiless wire resenting not such wrong  who hath charity  this bird who suffereth long and is kind is not provoked though blind and alive ensepulchred who hopeth endureth all things who thinketh no evil but sings who is divine  this bird    the wind blew words    the wind blew words along the skies    and these it blew to me through the wide dusk  lift up your eyes    behold this troubled tree complaining as it sways and plies    it is a limb of thee  yea too the creatures sheltering round     dumb figures wild and tame yea too thy fellows who abound     either of speech the same or far and strangeblack dwarfed and browned    they are stuff of thy own frame  i moved on in a surging awe    of inarticulateness at the pathetic me i saw    in all his huge distress making selfslaughter of the law    to kill break or suppress    the faded face    how was this i did not see such a look as here was shown ere its womanhood had blown past its first felicity  that i did not know you young    faded face       know you young  why did time so ill bestead that i heard no voice of yours hail from out the curved contours of those lips when rosy red weeted not the songs they sung    faded face       songs they sung  by these blanchings blooms of old and the relics of your voice  leavings rare of rich and choice from your early tone and mould  let me mournaye sorrowwrung    faded face       sorrowwrung    the riddle    i  stretching eyes west over the sea wind foul or fair always stood she prospectimpressed solely out there did her gaze rest never elsewhere seemed charm to be  ii  always eyes east ponders she now  as in devotion  hills of blank brow where no waves plough never the least room for emotion drawn from the ocean does she allow    the duel          i am here to time you see the glade is wellscreenedehagainst alarm    fit place to vindicate by my arm    the honour of my spotless wife    who scorns your libel upon her life       in boasting intimacy        all hushofferings youll spurn my husband  two must come one only go    she said  that hell be you i know    to faith like ours heaven will be just    and i shall abide in fullest trust       your speedy glad return     good  here am also i and well proceed without more waste of words    to warm your cockpit  of the swords    take you your choice  i shall thereby    feel that on me no blame can lie       whatever fate accords     so stripped they there and fought and the swords clicked and scraped and the onsets sped    till the husband fell and his shirt was red    with streams from his hearts hot cistern  nought    could save him now and the other wrought       maybe to pity said     why did you urge on this your wife assured you and t had better been    that you had let things pass serene    in confidence of longtried bliss    holding there could be nought amiss       in what my words might mean     then seeing nor ruth nor rage could move his foeman morenow deaths deaf thrall     he wiped his steel and with a call    like turtledove to dove swift broke    into the copse where under an oak       his horse cropt held by a page     alls over sweet he cried to the wife thus guised for the young page was she    tis as we hoped and said t would be    he never guessed    we mount and ride    to where our love can reign uneyed       hes clay and we are free    at mayfair lodgings    how could i be aware the opposite window eyeing as i lay listless there that through its blinds was dying one i had rated rare before i had set me sighing for another more fair  had the housefront been glass my vision unobscuring could aught have come to pass more happinessinsuring to her loved as a lass when spouseless allalluring i reckon not alas  so the square window stood steadily nightlong shining in my close neighbourhood who looked forth undivining that soon would go for good one there in pain reclining unpardoned unadieud  silently screened from view her tragedy was ending that need not have come due had she been less unbending how near near were we two at that last vital rending  and neither of us knew    to my fathers violin       does he want you down there    in the nether glooms where the hours may be a dragging load upon him    as he hears the axle grind       round and round    of the great world in the blind       still profound of the nighttime  he might liven at the sound of your string revealing you had not forgone him     in the gallery west the nave    but a few yards from his grave did you tucked beneath his chin to his bowing    guide the homely harmony       of the quire    who for long years strenuously        son and sire  caught the strains that at his fingering low or higher from your four thin threads and effholes came outflowing     and too what merry tunes    he would bow at nights or noons that chanced to find him bent to lute a measure    when he made you speak his heart       as in dream    without book or musicchart       on some theme elusive as a jackolanthorns gleam and the psalm of duty shelved for trill of pleasure     well you can not alas    the barrier overpass that screens him in those mournful meads hereunder    where no fiddling can be heard       in the glades    of silentness no bird       thrills the shades where no viol is touched for songs or serenades no bowing wakes a congregations wonder     he must do without you now    stir you no more anyhow to yearning concords taught you in your glory    while your strings a tangled wreck       once smart drawn    ten wormwounds in your neck       purflings wan with dusthoar here alone i sadly con your present dumbness shape your olden story  1916    the statue of liberty       this statue of liberty busy man       here erect in the city square i have watched while your scrubbings this early morning          strangely wistful          and half tristful       have turned her from foul to fair     with your bucket of water and mop and brush       bringing her out of the grime that has smeared her during the smokes of winter          with such glumness          in her dumbness       and aged her before her time     you have washed her down with motherly care        head shoulders arm and foot to the very hem of the robes that drape her           all expertly          and alertly       till a long stream black with soot     flows over the pavement to the road       and her shape looms pure as snow i read you are hired by the city guardians           may be yearly          or once merely        to treat the statues so     oh im not hired by the councilmen       to cleanse the statues here i do this one as a selfwilled duty          not as paid to          or at all made to       but because the doing is dear     ah then i hail you brother and friend       libertys knight divine what you have done would have been my doing          yea most verily          well and thoroughly       had but your courage

alas she died in this distant place       before i was warned to betake myself to her side    and in love of my darling          in love of the fame of her          and the good name of her       i do

else seen there  between the blooms where the sod basked bright    by the bobbing fuchsia trees was another and yet more eyesome sight     the sight that richened these  i shall seek those beauties in the spring    when the days are fit and fair but only as foils to the one more thing    that also will flower there    the change       out of the past there rises a week        who shall read the

remains with me alone     in that week there was heard a singing        who shall spell the years the years     in that week there was heard a singing       and the white owl wondered why    in that week yea a voice was ringing    and forth from the casement were candles flinging radiance that fell on the deodar and lit up the path thereby     could that song have a mocking note        who shall unroll the years o     could that song have a mocking note       to the white owls sense as it fell    could that song have a mocking note    as it trilled out warm from the singers throat and who was

with a traveltired smile        who shall lift the years o     she said with a traveltired smile       half scared by scene so strange    she said outworn by mile on mile    the blurred lamps wanning

bridge echo of an old song       sitting on the bridge    past the barracks town and ridge at once the spirit seized us to sing a song that pleased us  as the fifth were much in rumour it was whilst im in the humour    take me paddy will you now    and a lancer soon drew nigh    and his royal irish eye    said willing faith am i o to take you anyhow dears    to take you anyhow     but lodad walking by    cried what you lightheels  fie    is this the way you roam    and mock the sunset gleam    and he marched us straightway home though we said we are only daddy singing will you take me

a seared and cynic face    which winked and tokened towards the window like a mage       enchanting me to gaze again thereat  iii           it was a mirror now       and in it a long perspective i could trace    of my begetters dwindling backward each past each          all with the kindred look       whose names had since been inked down in their place          on the recorders book generation

he lay dead    whom in his life i had never clearly read i thought if i could peer into that citadel    his heart i should at last know full and well     what hereto had been known to him alone    despite our long sitout of years foreflown and if i said i do this for his memorys sake    it would not wound him even if he could wake     so i bent over him  he seemed to smile    with a calm confidence the whole long while that i withdrawing his heart held it and bit by bit    perused the unguessed things found written on it     it was inscribed like a terrestrial sphere    with quaint vermiculations close and clear  his graving  had i known would i have risked the stroke    its reading brought and my own heart nigh broke     yes there at last eyes opened did i see    his whole sincere symmetric history there were his truth his simple singlemindedness    strained maybe by times storms but there no less     there were the daily deeds from sun to sun    in blindness but good faith that he had done there were regrets at instances wherein he swerved    as he conceived from cherishings i had deserved     there were old hours all figured down as bliss     those spent with mehow little had i thought this there those when at my absence whether he slept or waked    though i knew not twas so his spirit ached     there that when we were severed how day dulled    till time joined us anew was chronicled and arguments and battlings in defence of me    that heart recorded clearly and ruddily     i put it back and left him as he lay    while pierced the morning pink and then the gray into each dreary room and corridor around    where i shall wait but his step will not sound    where they lived       dishevelled leaves creep down    upon that bank today some green some yellow and some pale brown    the wet bents bob and sway the once warm slippery turf is sodden    where we laughingly sat or lay     the summerhouse is gone    leaving a weedy space the bushes that veiled it once have grown    gaunt trees that interlace through whose lank limbs i see too clearly    the nakedness of the place     and where were hills of blue    blind drifts of vapour blow and the names of former dwellers few    if any people know and instead of a voice that called come in dears    time calls pass below    the occultation    when the cloud shut down on the morning shine    and darkened the sun i said so ended that joy of mine    years back begun  but day continued its lustrous roll    in upper air and did my late irradiate soul    live on somewhere    life laughs onward    rambling i looked for an old abode where years back one had lived i knew its site a dwelling duly showed    but it was new  i went where not so long ago the sod had riven two breasts asunder daisies throve gaily there as though    no grave were under  i walked along a terrace where loud children gambolled in the sun the figure that had once sat there    was missed by none  life laughed and moved on unsubdued i saw that old succumbed to young twas well  my too regretful mood    died on my tongue    the peaceoffering    it was but a little thing yet i knew it meant to me ease from what had given a sting to the very birdsinging    latterly  but i would not welcome it and for all i then declined o the regrettings infinite when the nightprocessions flit    through the mind    something tapped    something tapped on the pane of my room    when there was never a trace of wind or rain and i saw in the gloom    my weary beloveds face  o i am tired of waiting she said    night morn noon afternoon so cold it is in my lonely bed    and i thought you would join me soon  i rose and neared the windowglass    but vanished thence had she only a pallid moth alas    tapped at the pane for me  august 1913    the wound    i climbed to the crest    and fogfestooned the sun lay west    like a crimson wound  like that wound of mine    of which none knew for id given no sign    that

wing on the air and where that spot is nothing shows    there ivy calmly grows    and no one knows    what a birth was there  that kiss is gone where none can tell  not even those who felt its spell it cannot have died that know we well somewhere it pursues its flight one of a long procession of sounds    travelling aethereal rounds    far from earths bounds    in the infinite    the announcement    they came the brothers and took two chairs    in their usual quiet way and for a time we did not think       they had much to say  and they began and talked awhile    of ordinary things till spread that silence in the room       a pent thought brings  and then they said  the end has come    yes  it has come at last and we looked down and knew that day       a spirit had passed    the oxen

the oxen kneel  in the lonely barton by yonder coomb    our childhood used to know i should go with him in the gloom    hoping it might be so  1915    the tresses       when the air was damp it made my curls hang slack as they kissed my neck and back while i footed the saltaired track    i loved to tramp     when it was dry they would roll up crisp and tight as i went on in the light of the sun

breasts and mouth and hair  thank god she is out of it now i said at last in a great relief of heart when the thing was done    that had set my soul aghast and nothing was left of the picture unsheathed from the past but the ashen ghost of the card it had figured on  she was a woman long hid amid packs of years she might have been living or dead she was lost to my sight    and the deed that had nigh drawn tears was done in a casual clearance of lifes arrears but i felt as if i had put her to death that night          well she knew nothing thereof did she survive and suffered nothing if numbered among the dead    yetyetif on earth alive did she feel a smart and with vague strange anguish strive if in heaven did she smile at me sadly and shake her head    on a heath    i could hear

yellowly the sun sloped low down to westward       and dark was the east with cloud     then amid the shadow of that livid sad east    where the light was least and a gate stood wide something flashed the fire of the sun that was facing it       like a brief blaze on that side     looking hard and harder i knew what it meant     the sudden shine sent from the livid east scene it meant the west

above the fog       something do i see above the fog that sheets the mead a figure like to life indeed moving along with spectrespeed    seen by none but me     o the vision keen  tripping along to me for love as in the flesh it used to move only its hat and plume above    the evening fogfleece seen     in the dayfall wan when nighted birds break off their song mere ghostly head it skims along just as it did when warm and strong    body seeming gone     such it is i see above the fog that sheets the mead  yea that which once could breathe and plead  skimming along with spectrespeed    to a last tryst with me    overlooking the river stour    the swallows flew in the curves of an eight    above the rivergleam    in the wet junes last beam like little crossbows animate the swallows flew in the curves of an eight    above the rivergleam  planing up shavings of crystal spray    a moorhen darted out    from the bank thereabout and through the streamshine ripped his way planing up shavings of crystal spray    a moorhen darted out  closed were the kingcups and the mead    dripped in monotonous green    though the days morning sheen had shown it golden and honeybeed closed were the kingcups and the mead    dripped in monotonous green  and never i turned my head alack    while these things met my gaze    through the panes dropdrenched glaze to see the more behind my back    o never i turned but let alack    these less things hold my gaze    the musical box       lifelong to be seemed the fair colour of the time that there was standing shadowed near a spirit who sang to the gentle chime of the selfstruck notes i did not hear    i did not see     thus did it sing to the mindless lyre that played indoors as she came to listen for me without o value what the nonce outpours  this best of lifethat shines about    your welcoming     i had slowed along after the torrid hours were done though still the posts and walls and road flung back their sense of the hotfaced sun and had walked by stourside mill where broad    streamlilies throng     and i descried the dusky house that stood apart and her whitemuslined waiting there in the porch with highexpectant heart while still the thin mechanic air    went on inside     at whiles would flit swart bats whose wings bewebbed and tanned whirred like the wheels of ancient clocks she laughed a hailing as she scanned me in the gloom the tuneful box    intoning it     lifelong to be i thought it  that there watched hard by a spirit who sang to the indoor tune o make the most of what is nigh i did not hear in my dull soulswoon     i did not see    on sturminster footbridge onomatopoeic    reticulations creep upon the slack streams face    when the wind skims irritably past the current clucks smartly into each

the queen will stand to the child    twill be handed down in song and its no more than their deserving with my lord so faithful at court so long       and so staunch and strong  o never before was

traveller    in a flagon of silver wrought and by caravan stagecoach wain and waggon a precious trickle has been brought       clear as when caught  the morning came  to the park of the peer    the royal couple bore and the font was filled with the jordan water and the household awaited their guests before       the carpeted door  but when they went to the silklined cot    the child was found to have died whats now to be done  we can disappoint not the king and queen the family cried       with eyes spread wide  even now they approach the chestnutdrive    the service must be read well since we cant christen the child alive by god we shall have to christen him dead       the marquis said  thus breathforsaken a corpse was taken    to the private chapelyea  and the king knew not nor the

days of their mothers mothers    but well i know how it is with me       continually  i see the hands of the generations    that owned each shiny familiar thing in play on its knobs and indentations    and with its ancient fashioning       still dallying  hands behind hands growing paler and paler    as in a mirror a candleflame shows images of itself each frailer    as it recedes though the eye may frame       its shape the same  on the clocks dull dial a foggy finger    moving to set the minutes right with tentative touches that lift and linger    in the wont of a moth on a summer night       creeps to my sight  on this old viol too fingers are dancing     as whilomjust over the strings by the nut the tip of a bow receding advancing    in airy quivers as if it would cut       the plaintive gut  and i see a face by that box for tinder    glowing forth in fits from the dark and fading again as the linten cinder    kindles to red at the flinty spark       or goes out stark  well well  it is best to be up and doing    the world has no use for one today who eyes things thusno aim pursuing    he should not continue in this stay       but sink away    a thought in two moods    i saw itpink and whiterevealed    upon the white and green the white and green was a daisied field    the pink and white ethleen  and as i looked it seemed in kind    that difference they had none the two fair bodiments combined    as varied miens of one  a sense that in some mouldering year    as one they both would lie made me move quickly on to her    to pass the pale thought by  she laughed and said  out there to me    you looked so weatherbrowned and brown in clothes you seemed to be    made of the dusty ground    the last performance    i am playing my oldest tunes declared she    all the old tunes i know  those i learnt ever so long ago  why she should think just then shed play them    silence cloaks like snow  when i returned from the town at nightfall    notes continued to pour as when i had left two hours before its the very last time she said in closing    from now i play no more  a few morns onward found her fading    and as her life outflew i thought of her playing her tunes right through and i felt she had known of what was coming    and wondered how she knew  1912    you on the tower    i  you on the tower of my factory     what do you see up there do you see enjoyment with wide wings    advancing to reach me here  yea i see enjoyment with wide wings    advancing to reach you here  ii  good  soon ill come and ask you    to tell me again thereon    well what is he doing now  hoi there   he still is flying on ah waiting till i have fullfinished    good  tell me again anon     iii  hoi watchman  im here  when comes he    between my sweats i am chill   oh you there working still why surely he reached you a time back    and took you miles from your mill he duly came in his winging    and now he has passed out of view how can it be that you missed him    he brushed you by as he flew    the interloper    and i saw the figure and visage of madness seeking for a home  there are three folk driving in a quaint old chaise and the cliffside track looks green and fair i view them talking in quiet glee as they drop down towards the puffins lair by the roughest of ways but another with the three rides on i see    whom i like not to be there  no  its not anybody you think of  next a dwelling appears by a slow sweet stream where two sit happy and half in the dark they read helped out by a frailwickd gleam some rhythmic text but one sits with them whom they dont mark    one im wishing could not be there  no  not whom you knew and name  and now i discern gay diners in a mansionplace and the guests dropping witpert prim or choice and the hostesss tender and laughing face and the hosts bland brow i cannot help hearing a hollow voice    and id fain not hear it there  no  its not from the stranger you met once  ah yet a goodlier scene than that succeeds people on a lawnquite a crowd of them  yes and they chatter and ramble as fancy leads and they say hurrah to a blithe speech made save one mirthless    who ought not to be there  nay  its not

best lives corrode    would would it could not be there    logs on the hearth a memory of a sister       the fire advances along the log       of the tree we felled which bloomed and bore striped apples by the peck    till its last hour of bearing knelled     the fork that first my hand would reach       and then my foot in climbings upward inch by inch lies now    sawn sapless darkening with soot     where the bark chars is where one year       it was pruned and bled  then overgrew the wound  but now at last    its growings all have stagnated     my fellowclimber rises dim       from her

  no more a screen from the weakest ray    nothing to tell us the hue of its dyes    nothing but rusty bones as it lies    in its coffin of stone unseen till today  where is the woman who carried that

and scan the scene while blithely spoke the wind to the little sycamore tree     but storms have raged    those walls about    and the head has aged    that once looked out    and zest is suaged    and trust is doubt    and slow effacement    is rife throughout while fiercely girds the wind at the longlimbed sycamore tree    the caged goldfinch    within a churchyard on a recent grave    i saw a little cage that jailed a goldfinch  all was silence save    its hops from stage to stage  there was inquiry in its wistful eye    and once it tried to sing of him or her who placed it there and why    no one knew anything    at madame tussauds in victorian years    that same first fiddler who leads the orchestra tonight    here fiddled four decades of years ago he bears the same babelike smile of selfcentred delight same trinket on watchchain same ring on the hand with the bow  but his face if regarded is woefully wanner and drier    and his once dark beard has grown straggling and gray yet a blissful existence he seems to have led with his lyre in a trance of his own where no wearing or tearing had sway  mid these wax figures who nothing can do it may seem    that to do but a little thing

1915    at a seaside town in 1869 young lovers reverie    i went and stood outside myself    spelled the dark sky    and shiplights nigh and grumbling winds that passed thereby  then next inside myself i looked    and there above    all shone my love that nothing matched the image of  beyond myself again i ranged    and saw the free    life by the sea and folk indifferent to me  o twas a charm to draw within    thereafter where    but she was care for one thing only her hid there  but so it chanced without myself    i had to look    and then i took more heed of what i had long forsook  the boats the sands the esplanade    the laughing crowd    lighthearted loud greetings from some not illendowed  the evening sunlit cliffs the talk    hailings and halts    the keen seasalts the band the morgenblatter waltz  still when at night i drew inside    forward she came    sad but the same as when i first had known her name  then rose a time when as by force    outwardly wooed    by contacts crude her image in abeyance stood     at last i said  this outside life    shall not endure    ill seek the pure thoughtworld and bask in her allure  myself again i crept within    scanned with keen care    the temple where shed shone but could not find her there  i sought and sought  but o her soul    has not since thrown    upon my own one beam  yea she is gone is gone  from an old note    the glimpse    she sped through the door and following in haste and stirred to the core i entered hotfaced but i could not find her no sign was behind her where is she i said  who they asked that sat there not a souls come in sight  a maid with red hair  ah  they paled  she is dead people see her at night but you are the first on whom she has burst in the keen common light  it was ages ago when i was quite strong i have waited sinceo i have waited so long  yea i set me to own the house where now lone i dwell in void rooms booming hollow as tombs but i never come near her though nightly i hear her and my cheek has grown thin and my hair has grown gray with this waiting therein but she still keeps away    the pedestrian an incident of 1883    sir will you let me give you a

that sunday afternoon  when he too scanned the lovebirds    on entering there that day    twas as if he had nought to say of his long journey citywards when he too scanned the lovebirds    on entering there that day  and billed and billed the lovebirds    as twere in fond despair    at the stress of silence where had once been tones in tenor thirds and billed and billed the lovebirds    as twere in fond despair  o his speech that chilled the lovebirds    and smote like death on me    as i learnt what was to be and knew my life was broke in sherds o his speech that chilled the lovebirds    and smote like death on me    paying calls    i went by footpath and by stile    beyond where bustle ends strayed here a mile and there a mile    and called upon some friends  on certain ones i had not seen    for years past did i call and then on others who had been    the oldest friends of all  it was the time of midsummer    when they had used to roam but now though tempting was the air    i found them all at home  i spoke to one and other of them    by mound and stone and tree of things we had done ere days were dim    but they spoke not to me    the upper birchleaves    warm

at an epoch of my prime mornings berylbespread and evenings goldenred    nothing gray and in my heart i said however this chanced to be it is too full for me too rare too rapturous rash its spell must close with a crash    some day  the radiance went on anon and yet anon and sweetness fell around like manna on the ground    ive no claim said i to be thus crowned i am not worthy this must it not go amiss  well    let the end foreseen come dulyi am serene   and it came    he wonders about himself    no use hoping or feeling vext tugged by a force above or under like some fantocine much i wonder

of the quick than i saw of the dead  he was a man i had met with somewhere before but how or when i now could recall no more  the hazy mazy moonlight at one in the morning spread out as a sea across the frozen snow glazed to live sparkles like the great breastplate adorning the priest of the temple with urim and thummim aglow  the yewtree arms glued hard to the stiff stark air hung still in the village sky as theatrescenes when i came by the churchyard wall and halted there at a shutin sound of fiddles and tambourines  and as i stood hearkening dulcimers hautboys and shawms and violoncellos and a threestringed doublebass joined in and were intermixed with a singing of psalms and i looked over at the dead mens dwellingplace  through the shine of the slippery snow i now could see as it were through a crystal roof a great company of the dead minueting in stately step underground to the tune of the instruments i had before heard sound  it was eden new and dancing they sang in a chore we are out of it allyea in littleease cramped no more and their shrouded figures pacing with joy i could see as you see the stage from the gallery  and they had no heed of me  and i lifted my head quite dazed from the churchyard wall and i doubted not that it warned i should soon have my call but    then in the ashes he emptied the dregs of his cup and onward he went and the darkness swallowed him up    he revisits his first school    i should not have shown in the flesh i ought to have gone as a ghost it was awkward unseemly almost standing solidly there as when fresh    pink tiny crispcurled    my pinions yet furled    from the winds of the world  after waiting so many a year to wait longer and go as a sprite from the tomb at the mid of some night was the right radiant way to appear    not as one wanzing weak    from lifes roar and reek    his rest still to seek  yea beglimpsed through the quaint quarried glass of green moonlight by me greener made when theyd cry perhaps there sits his shade in his olden hauntjust as he was    when in walkingame he    conned the grand ruleofthree    with the bent of a bee  but to show in the afternoon sun with an aspect of holloweyed care when none wished to see me come there was a garish thing better undone    yes wrong was the way    but yet let me say    i may right itsome day    i thought my heart    i thought my heart that you had healed of those sore smartings of the past and that the summers had oversealed    all mark of them at last but closely scanning in the night i saw them standing crimsonbright       just as she made them       nothing could fade them       yea i can swear       that there they were        they still were there  then the vision of her who cut them came and looking over my shoulder said i am sure you deal me all the blame    for those sharp smarts and red but meet me dearest tomorrow night in the churchyard at the moons halfheight       and so strange a kiss       shall be mine i wis       that youll cease to know       if the wounds you show       be there or no    fragment    at last i entered a long dark gallery    catacomblined and ranged at the side    were the bodies of men from far and wide who motion past were nevertheless not dead  the sense of waiting here strikes strong    everyones waiting waiting it seems to me    what are you waiting for so long  what is to happen i said  o we are waiting for one called god said they    though by some the will or force or laws    and vaguely by some the ultimate cause waiting for him to see us before we are clay yes waiting waiting for god to know it        to know what questioned i to know how things have been going on earth and below it    it is clear he must know some day    i thereon asked them why  since he made us humble pioneers of himself in consciousness of lifes tears it needs no mighty prophecy to tell that what he could mindlessly show his creatures he himself will know  by some still closecowled mystery we have reached feeling faster than he but he will overtake us anon    if the world goes on    midnight on the great western    in the thirdclass seat sat the journeying boy    and the rooflamps oily flame played down on his listless form and face bewrapt past knowing to what he was going       or whence he came  in the band of his hat the journeying boy    had a ticket stuck and a string around his neck bore the key of his box that twinkled gleams of the lamps sad beams       like a living thing  what past can be yours o journeying boy    towards a world unknown who calmly as if incurious quite on all at stake can undertake       this plunge alone  knows your soul a sphere o journeying boy    our rude realms far above whence with spacious vision you mark and mete this region of sin that you find you in       but are not of    honeymoon time at an inn    at the shiver of morning a little before the false dawn       the moon was at the windowsquare    deedily brooding in deformed decay     the curve hewn off her cheek as by an adze at the shiver of morning a little before the false dawn    so the moon looked in there  her speechless eyeing reached across the chamber       where lay two souls opprest    one a white lady sighing why am i sad    to him who sighed back sad my love am i and speechlessly the old moon conned the chamber    and these two reft of rest  while their largepupilled vision swept the scene there       nought seeming imminent    something fell sheer and crashed and from the floor    lay glittering at the pair with a shattered gaze while their largepupilled vision swept the scene there    and the manyeyed thing outleant  with a start they saw that it was an oldtime pierglass       which had stood on the mantel near    its silvering blemishedyes as if worn away    by the eyes of the countless dead who had smirked at it ere these two ever knew that oldtime pierglass    and its vague and vacant leer  as he looked his bride like a moth skimmed forth and kneeling       quick with quivering sighs    gathered the pieces under the moons sly ray    unwitting as an automaton what she did till he entreated hasting to where she was kneeling    let it stay where it lies  long years of sorrow this means breathed the lady       as they retired  alas    and she lifted one pale hand across her eyes    dont trouble love its nothing the bridegroom said long years of sorrow for us murmured the lady    or ever this evil pass  and the spirits ironic laughed behind the wainscot       and the spirits of pity sighed    its good said the spirits ironic to tickle their minds    with a portent of their wedlocks aftergrinds and the spirits of pity sighed behind the wainscot    its a portent we cannot abide  more what shall happen to prove the truth of the portent      oh in brief they will fade till old    and their loves grow numbed ere death by the cark of care  but nought see we that asks for portents there  tis the lot of allwell no less true is a portent    that it fits all mortal mould    the robin    when up aloft i fly and fly i see in pools the shining sky and a happy bird am i am i  when i descend towards their brink i stand and look and stoop and drink and bathe my wings and chink and prink  when winter frost makes earth as steel i search and search but find no meal and most unhappy then i feel  but when it lasts and snows still fall i get to feel no grief at all for i turn to a cold stiff feathery ball    i rose and went to routor town she alone    i rose and went to routor town    with gaiety and good heart    and ardour for the start that morning ere the moon was down that lit me off to routor town    with gaiety and good heart  when sojourn soon at routor town    wrote sorrows on my face    i strove that none should trace the pale and gray once pink and brown when sojourn soon at routor town    wrote sorrows on my face  the evil wrought at routor town    on him id loved so true    i cannot tell anew but nought can quench but nought can drown the evil wrought at routor town    on him id loved so true    the nettles       this then is the grave of my son    whose heart she won  and nettles grow upon his mound and she lives just below     how he upbraided me and left    and our lives were cleft because i said she was hard unfeeling caring but to wed     well to see this sight i have fared these miles    and her firelight smiles from her window there whom he left his mother to cherish with tender care     it is enough  ill turn and go    yes nettles grow where lone lies he who spurned me for seeing what he could not see    in a waitingroom    on a morning sick as the day of doom    with the drizzling gray    of an english may there were few in the railway waitingroom about its walls were framed and varnished pictures of liners flyblown tarnished the table bore a testament for travellers reading if suchwise bent        i read it on and on    and thronging the gospel of saint john    were figuresadditions multiplications  by some one scrawled with sundry emendations       not scoffingly designed       but with an absent mind     plainly a bagmans counts of cost    what he had profited what lost and whilst i wondered if there could have been       any particle of a soul       in that poor man at all     to cypher rates of wage    upon that printed page    there joined in the charmless scene and stood over me and the scribbled book    to lend the hours mean hue    a smear of tragedy too a soldier and wife with haggard look subdued to stone by strong endeavour    and then i heard    from a casual word they were parting as they believed for ever     but next there came    like the eastern flame of some high altar childrena pair  who laughed at the flyblown pictures there here are the lovely ships that we mother are by and by going to see when we get there its most sure to be fine and the band will play and the sun will shine  it rained on the skylight with a din as we waited and still no train came in but the words of the child in the squalid room had spread a glory through the gloom    the clockwinder    it is dark as a cave or a vault in the nave when the iron door is closed and the floor of the church relaid with trowel and spade  but the parishclerk cares not for the dark as he winds in the tower at a regular hour the rheumatic clock whose dilatory knock you can hear when praying at the days decaying or at any lone while from a pew in the aisle  up up from the ground around and around in the turret stair he clambers to where the wheelwork is with its tick click whizz reposefully measuring each day to its end that mortal men spend in sorrowing and pleasuring nightly thus does he climb to the trackway of time  him i followed one night to this place without light and ere i spoke heard him say word by word at the end of his winding the darkness unminding  so i wipe out one more my dear of the sore sad days that still be like a drying dead sea between you and me  who she was no man knew he had long borne him blind to all womankind and was ever one who kept his past out of view    old excursions    whats the good of going to ridgeway    cerne or sydling mill    or to yellham hill blithely bearing casterbridgeway    as we used to do she will no more climb up there or be visible anywhere    in those haunts we knew  but tonight while walking weary    near me seemed her shade    come as twere to upbraid this my mood in deeming dreary    scenes that used to please and if she did come to me still solicitous there may be    good in going to these  so ill care to roam to ridgeway    cerne or sydling mill    or to yellham hill blithely bearing casterbridgeway    as we used to do since her phasm may flit out there and may greet me anywhere    in those haunts we knew  april 1913    the masked face    i found me in a great surging space    at either end a door and i said  what is this giddying place    with no firmfixed floor    that i knew not of before    it is life said a maskclad face  i asked  but how do i come here    who never wished to come can the light and air be made more clear    the floor more quietsome    and the doors set wide  they numb    fastlocked and fill with fear  the mask put on a bleak smile then    and said o vassalwight there once complained a goosequill pen    to the scribe of the infinite    of the words it had to write    because they were past its ken    in a whispering gallery    that whisper takes the voice of a spirits compassionings close but invisible and throws me under a spell at the kindling vision it brings and for a moment i rejoice and believe in transcendent things that would mould from this muddy earth a spot for the splendid birth of everlasting lives whereto no night arrives and this gaunt gray gallery a tabernacle of worth on this drabaired afternoon when you can barely see across its hazed lacune if opposite aught there be of fleshed humanity wherewith i may commune or if the voice so near be a souls voice floating here    the something that saved him       it was when whirls of thick waters laved me    again and again

  and sang    the enemys portrait    he saw the portrait of his enemy offered at auction in a street he journeyed nigh that enemy now late dead who in his lifetime had injured deeply him the passerby to get that picture pleased be god ill try and utterly destroy it and no more shall be inflicted on mans mortal eye a countenance so sinister and sore  and so he bought the painting  driving homeward the frame will come in useful he declared the rest is fuel  on his arrival weary asked what he bore with him and how he fared he said he had bid for a picture though he cared for the frame only  on the morrow he would burn the canvas which could well be spared seeing that it portrayed his enemy  next day some other duty found him busy the foe was laid his face against the wall but on the next he set himself to loosen the strainingstrips  and then a casual call prevented his proceeding therewithal and thus the picture waited day by day its owners pleasure like a wretched thrall until a month and more had slipped away  and then upon a morn he found it shifted hung in a corner by a servitor why did you take on you to hang that picture you know it was the frame i bought it for it stood in the way of every visitor and i just hitched it therewell it must go i dont commemorate men whom i abhor remind me tis to do  the frame ill stow  but things become forgotten  in the shadow of the dark

its circles as heretofore i watch them from the porch again but no songnotes within the door       now call to me    to shun the dripping lea       and forth i stride  jan 1914    signs and tokens

tree hard by with a rhythmic swing    and they shaped in my imagining to the shade that a wellknown head and shoulders    threw there when she was gardening        i thought her behind my back    yea her i long had learned to lack and i said  i am sure you are standing behind me    though how do you get into this old track    and there was no sound but the fall of a leaf    as a sad response and to keep down grief i would not turn my head to discover    that there was nothing in my belief        yet i wanted to look and see    that nobody stood at the back of me but i thought once more  nay

here abide and it would not task us we would with our lutes play over him by his gravebrim the psalm he liked best  the one whose sense suits mount ephraim  and perhaps we should seem to him in deaths dream like the seraphim  as soon as i knew that his spirit was gone i thought this his due and spoke thereupon i think said the vicar a read service quicker than viols outofdoors in these frosts and hoars that oldfashioned way requires a fine day and it seems to me it had better not be  hence that afternoon though never knew he that his wish could not be to get through it faster they buried the master without any tune  but twas said that when at the dead of next night the vicar looked out there struck on his ken thronged roundabout where the frost was graying the headstoned grass a band all

to hoist them on the towers and citadels of my own country that the musical rhymes  rung by them into space at meted times amid the markets daily stir and stress and the nights empty starlit

the dead woman lay in her first nights grave and twilight fell from the clouds concave and those she had asked to forgive forgave  the woman passing came to a pause by the heaped white shapes of wreath and cross and looked upon where the other was  and as she mused there thus spoke she never your countenance did i see but youve been a good good friend to me  rose a plaintive voice from the sod below o woman whose accents i do not know what is it that makes you approve me so  o dead one ere my soldier went i heard him saying with warm intent to his friend when won by your blandishment  i would change for that lass here and now and if i return i may break my vow to my present love and contrive somehow  to call my own this newfound pearl whose eyes have the light whose lips the curl i always have looked for in a girl  and this is why that by ceasing to be  though never your countenance did i see  you prove you a good good friend to me  and i pray each hour for your souls repose in gratitude for your joining those no lover will clasp when his campaigns close  away she turned when arose to her eye a martial phantom of gory dye that said with a thin and faroff sigh  o sweetheart neither shall i clasp you for the foe this day has pierced me through and sent me to where she is  adieu   and forget not when the nightwinds whine calls over this turf where her limbs recline that it travels on to lament by mine  there was a cry by the whiteflowered mound there was a laugh from underground there was a deeper gloom around  1915    a new years eve in war time    i     phantasmal fears    and the flap of the flame    and the throb of the clock    and a loosened slate    and the blind nights drone which tiredly the spectral pines intone  ii  and the blood in my ears strumming always the same and the gablecock with its fitful grate and myself alone  iii  the twelfth hour nears handhid as in shame i undo the lock and listen and wait for the young unknown  iv  in the dark there careers  as if death astride came to numb all with his knock  a horse at mad rate over rut and stone  v  no figure appears no call of my name no sound but tictoc without check  past the gate it

severance and shock    is the order from fate    that the rider speeds on to pale europe and tiredly the pines intone  19151916    i met a man       i met a man when night was nigh    who said with shining face and eye    like moses after sinai     i have seen the moulder of monarchies       realms peoples plains and hills    sitting upon the sunlit seas     and as he sat soliloquies fell from him like an antiphonic breeze       that pricks the waves to thrills     meseemed that of the maimed and dead       mown down upon the globe     their plenteous blooms of promise shed    ere fruitingtimehis words were said sitting against the western web of red       wrapt in his crimson robe     and i could catch them now and then      why let these gambling clans    of human cockers pit liege men    from mart and city dale and glen in deathmains but to swell and swell again       their swollen allempery plans     when a mere nod if my malign       compeer but passive keep    would mend that old mistake of mine    i made with saul and ever consign all lords of war whose sanctuaries enshrine       liberticide to sleep     with violence the lands are spread       even as in israels day    and it repenteth me i bred    chartered armipotents lustled to feuds    yea grieves my heart as then i said       to see their evil way    the utterance grew and flapped like flame       and further speech i feared    but no celestial tongued acclaim    and no huzzas from earthlings came and the heavens mutely masked as twere in shame       till daylight disappeared  thus ended he as night rode high  the man of shining face and eye like moses after sinai  1916    i looked up from my writing    i looked up from my writing    and gave a start to see as if rapt in my inditing    the moons full gaze on me  her meditative misty head    was spectral in its air and i involuntarily said    what are you doing there  oh ive been scanning pond and hole    and waterway hereabout for the body of one with a sunken soul    who has put his lifelight out  did you hear his frenzied tattle    it was sorrow for his son who is slain in brutish battle    though he has injured none  and now i am curious to look    into the blinkered mind of one who wants to write a book    in a world of such a kind  her temper overwrought me    and i edged to shun her view for i felt assured she thought me    one who should drown him too    the coming of the end       how it came to an end the meeting afar from the crowd and the lovelooks and laughters unpenned the parting when much was avowed    how it came to an end     it came to an end yes the outgazing over the stream with the sun on each serpentine bend or later the luring moongleam    it came to an end     it came to an end the housebuilding furnishing planting as if there were ages to spend in welcoming feasting and jaunting    it came to an end     it came to an end that journey of one day a week it always goes on said a friend just the same in bright weathers or bleak    but it came to an end     how will come to an end this orbit so smoothly begun unless some convulsion attend i often said  what will be done    when it comes to an end     well it came to an end quite silentlystopped without jerk better close no prevision could lend working out as one planned it should work    ere it came to an end    afterwards    when the present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay    and the may month flaps its glad green leaves like wings delicatefilmed as newspun silk will the neighbours say    he was a man who used to notice such things  if it be in the dusk when like an eyelids soundless blink    the dewfallhawk comes crossing the shades to alight upon the windwarped upland thorn a gazer may think    to him this must have been a familiar sight  if i pass during some nocturnal blackness mothy and warm    when the hedgehog travels furtively over the lawn one may say he strove that such innocent creatures should come to no harm    but he could do little for them and now he is gone  if when hearing that i have been stilled at last they stand at the door    watching the fullstarred heavens that winter sees will this thought rise on those who will meet my face no more    he was one who had an eye for such mysteries  and will any say when my bell of quittance is heard in the gloom    and a crossing breeze cuts a pause in its outrollings till they rise again as they were a new bells boom    he hears it not now but used to notice such things    footnotes  1  jer li 20
