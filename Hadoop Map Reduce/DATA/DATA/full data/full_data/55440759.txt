 the fire at tranter sweatleys    heiress and architect    the two men    lines    i look into my glass     preface  of the miscellaneous collection of verse that follows only four pieces have been published though many were written long ago and other partly written  in some few cases the verses were turned into prose and printed as such it having been unanticipated at that time that they might see the light  whenever an ancient and legitimate word of the district for which there was no equivalent in received english suggested itself as the most natural nearest and often only expression of a thought it has been made use of on what seemed good grounds  the pieces are in a large degree dramatic or personative in conception and this even where they are not obviously so  the dates attached to some of the poems do not apply to the rough sketches given in illustration which have been recently made and as may be surmised are inserted for personal and local reasons rather than for their intrinsic qualities  t h september 1898     the temporary the all    change and chancefulness in my flowering youthtime set me sun by sun near to one unchosen wrought us fellowlike and despite divergence    friends interlinked us  cherish him can i while the true one forthcome  come the rich fulfiller of my prevision life is roomy yet and the odds unbounded    so selfcommuned i  thwart my wistful way did a damsel saunter fair the while unformed to be alleclipsing maiden meet held i till arise my forefelt    wonder of women  long a visioned hermitage deep desiring tenements uncouth i was fain to house in let such lodging be for a breathwhile thought i    soon a more seemly  then high handiwork will i make my lifedeed truth and light outshow but the ripe time pending intermissive aim at the thing sufficeth    thus i    but lo me  mistress friend place aims to be bettered straightway bettered not has fate or my hands achieving sole the showance those of my onward earthtrack     never transcended    amabel    i marked her ruined hues her customstraitened views and asked can there indwell    my amabel  i looked upon her gown once rose now earthen brown the change was like the knell    of amabel  her steps mechanic ways had lost the life of mays her laugh once sweet in swell    spoilt amabel  i mused  who sings the strain i sang ere warmth did wane who thinks its numbers spell    his amabel   knowing that though love cease loves race shows undecrease all find in dorp or dell    an amabel   i felt that i could creep to some housetop and weep that time the tyrant fell    ruled amabel  i said the while i sighed that love like ours had died fond things ill no more tell    to amabel  but leave her to her fate and fling across the gate till the last trump farewell    o amabel  1865    hap    if but some vengeful god would call to me from up the sky and laugh  thou suffering thing know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy that thy loves loss is my hates profiting  then would i bear and clench myself and die steeled by the sense of ire unmerited halfeased in that a powerfuller than i had willed and meted me the tears i shed  but not so  how arrives it joy lies slain and why unblooms the best hope ever sown  crass casualty obstructs the sun and rain and dicing time for gladness casts a moan    these purblind doomsters had as readily strown blisses about my pilgrimage as pain  1866    in vision i roamed to     in vision i roamed the flashing firmament so fierce in blazon that the night waxed wan as though with an awed sense of such ostent and as i thought my spirit ranged on and on  in footless traverse through ghast heights of sky to the last chambers of the monstrous dome where stars the brightest here to darkness die then any spot on our own earth seemed home  and the sick grief that you were far away grew pleasant thankfulness that you were near who might have been set on some outstep sphere less than a want to me as day by day i lived unware uncaring all that lay locked in that universe taciturn and drear  1866    at a bridal to     when you paced forth to wait maternity a dream of other offspring held my mind compounded of us twain as love designed rare forms that corporate now will never be  should i too wed as slave to modes decree and each thus found apart of false desire a stolid line whom no high aims will fire as had fired ours could ever have mingled we  and grieved that lives so matched should miscompose each mourn the double waste and question dare to the great dame whence incarnation flows why those highpurposed children never were what will she answer  that she does not care if the race all such sovereign types unknows  1866    postponement    snowbound in woodland a mournful word dropt now and then from the bill of a bird reached me on windwafts and thus i heard    wearily waiting  i planned her a nest in a leafless tree but the passers eyed and twitted me and said  how reckless a bird is he    cheerily mating  fearfilled i stayed me till summertide in lewth of leaves to throne her bride but alas her love for me waned and died    wearily waiting  ah had i been like some i see born to an evergreen nestingtree none had eyed and twitted me    cheerily mating  1866    a confession to a friend in trouble    your troubles shrink not though i feel them less here far away than when i tarried near i even smile old smileswith listlessness  yet smiles they are not ghastly mockeries mere  a thought too strange to house within my brain haunting its outer precincts i discern  that i will not show zeal again to learn your griefs and sharing them renew my pain     it goes like murky bird or buccaneer that shapes its lawless figure on the main and each new impulse tends to make outflee the unseemly instinct that had lodgment here yet comrade old can bitterer knowledge be than that though banned such instinct was in me  1866    neutral tones    we stood by a pond that winter day and the sun was white as though chidden of god and a few leaves lay on the starving sod   they had fallen from an ash and were gray  your eyes on me were as eyes that rove over tedious riddles solved years ago and some words played between us to and fro     on which lost the more by our love  the smile on your mouth was the deadest thing alive enough to have strength to die and a grin of bitterness swept thereby    like an ominous bird awing     since then keen lessons that love deceives and wrings with wrong have shaped to me your face and the godcurst sun and a tree    and a pond edged with grayish leaves  1867    she at his funeral    they bear him to his restingplace  in slow procession sweeping by i follow at a strangers space his kindred they his sweetheart i unchanged my gown of garish dye though sablesad is their attire but they stand round with griefless eye whilst my regret consumes like fire  187    her initials    upon a poets page i wrote of old two letters of her name part seemed she of the effulgent thought whence that high singers rapture came  when now i turn the leaf the same immortal light illumes the lay but from the letters of her name the radiance has died away  1869    her dilemma in  church    the two were silent in a sunless church whose mildewed walls uneven pavingstones and wasted carvings passed antique research and nothing broke the clocks dull monotones  leaning against a wormy poppyhead so wan and worn that he could scarcely stand  for he was soon to diehe softly said tell me you love meholding hard her hand  she would have given a world to breathe yes truly so much his life seemed handing on her mind and hence she lied her heart persuaded throughly twas worth her soul to be a moment kind  but the sad need thereof his nearing death so mocked humanity that she shamed to prize a world conditioned thus or care for breath where nature such dilemmas could devise  1866    revulsion    though i waste watches framing words to fetter some spirit to mine own in clasp and kiss out of the night there looms a sense twere better to fail obtaining whom one fails to miss  for winning love we win the risk of losing and losing love is as ones life were riven it cuts like contumely and keen illusing to cede what was superfluously given  let me then feel no more the fateful thrilling that devastates the loveworn wooers frame the hot ado of fevered hopes the chilling that agonizes disappointed aim so may i live no junctive law fulfilling and my hearts table bear no womans name  1866    she to himi    when you shall see me in the toils of time my lauded beauties carried off from me my eyes no longer stars as in their prime my name forgot of maiden fair and free  when in your being heart concedes to mind and judgment though you scarce its process know recalls the excellencies i once enshrined and you are irked that they have withered so  remembering that with me lies not the blame that sportsman time but rears his brood to kill knowing me in my soul the very same  one who would die to spare you touch of ill  will you not grant to old affections claim the hand of friendship down lifes sunless hill  1866    she to himii    perhaps long hence when i have passed away some others feature accent thought like mine will carry you back to what i used to say and bring some memory of your loves decline  then you may pause awhile and think poor jade and yield a sigh to meas ample due not as the tittle of a debt unpaid to one who could resign her all to you   and thus reflecting you will never see that your thin thought in two small words conveyed was no such fleeting phantomthought to me but the whole life wherein my part was played and you amid its fitful masquerade a thoughtas i in yours but seem to be  1866    she to himiii    i will be faithful to thee aye i will and death shall choose me with a wondering eye that he did not discern and domicile one his by right ever since that last goodbye  i have no care for friends or kin or prime of manhood who deal gently with me here amid the happy people of my time who work their loves fulfilment i appear  numb as a vane that cankers on its point true to the wind that kissed ere canker came despised by souls of now who would disjoint the mind from memory and make life all aim  my old dexterities of hue quite gone and nothing left for love to look upon  1866    she to himiv    this love puts all humanity from me i can but maledict her pray her dead for giving love and getting love of thee  feeding a heart that else mine own had fed  how much i love i know not life not known save as some unit i would add love by but this i know my being is but thine own fused from its separateness by ecstasy  and thus i grasp thy amplitudes of her ungrasped though helped by nighregarding eyes canst thou then hate me as an envier who see unrecked what i so dearly prize believe me lost one love is lovelier the more it shapes its moan in selfishwise  1866    ditty e l g    beneath a knap where flown    nestlings play within walls of weathered stone    far away from the files of formal houses by the bough the firstling browses lives a sweet  no merchants meet no man barters no man sells    where she dwells  upon that fabric fair    here is she seems written everywhere    unto me but to friends and nodding neighbours fellowwights in lot and labours who descry the times as i no such lucid legend tells    where she dwells  should i lapse to what i was    ere we met such can not be but because    some forget let me feign itnone would notice that where she i know by rote is spread a strange and withering change like a drying of the wells    where she dwells  to feel i might have kissed     loved as true  otherwhere nor mine have missed    my life through had i never wandered near her is a smart severeseverer in the thought that she is nought even as i beyond the dells    where she dwells  and devotion droops her glance    to recall what bondservants of chance    we are all i but found her in that going on my errant path unknowing i did not outskirt the spot that no spot on earth excels   where she dwells  1870    the sergeants song

brought you a daughter dear  i watched her today a more comely maid as she danced in her muslin bowed with blue round a hintock maypole never gayed  aye aye i watched her this day too    as it happens the sergeant said  my daughter is now he again began of just such an age as one i knew when we of the line and forlornhope van on an august morninga chosen few     stormed san sebastian  shes a score less three so about was she  the maiden i wronged in peninsular days    you may prate of your prowess in lusty times but as years gnaw inward you blink your bays    and see too well your crimes  wed stormed it at night by the vlankerlight of burning towers and the mortars boom wed topped the breach but had failed to stay for our files were misled by the baffling gloom    and we said wed storm by day  so out of the trenches with features set on that hot still morning in measured pace our column climbed climbed higher yet past the faussbray scarp up the curtainface    and along the parapet  from the battened hornwork the cannoneers hove crashing balls of iron fire on the shaking gap mount the volunteers in files and as they mount expire    amid curses groans and cheers  five hours did we storm five hours reform as death cooled those hot blood pricked on till our cause was helped by a woe within they swayed from the summit wed leapt upon    and madly we entered in  on end for plunder mid rain and thunder that burst with the lull of our cannonade we vamped the streets in the stifling air  our hunger unsoothed our thirst unstayed     and ransacked the buildings there  down the stony steps of the housefronts white we rolled rich puncheons of spanish grape till at length with the fire of the wine alight i saw at a doorway a fair fresh shape     a woman a sylph or sprite  afeard she fled and with heated head i pursued to the chamber she called her own  when might is right no qualms deter and having her helpless and alone    i wreaked my will on her  she raised her beseeching eyes to me and i heard the words of prayer she sent in her own soft language    seemingly i copied those eyes for my punishment    in begetting the girl you see  so today i stand with a godset brand like cains when he wandered from kindreds ken    i served through the war that made europe free i wived me in peaceyear  but hid from men    i bear that mark on me  and i nightly stray on the ivel way as

reigned sole undulled by whirr of merchandize from pummerytout to where the gibbet is  i crossed my pleasaunce hard by glydpath rise and stood beneath the wall  eleven strokes went and to the door they came contrariwise  and met in clasp so close i had but bent my lifted blade upon them to have let their two souls loose upon the firmament  but something held my arm  a moment yet as praytime ere you wantons die i said and then they saw me  swift her gaze was set  with eye and cry of love illimited upon her heartking  never upon me had she thrown look of love so thoroughsped     at once she flung her faint form shieldingly on his against the vengeance of my vows the which oerruling her shape shielded he  blanked by such love i stood as in a drowse and the slow moon edged from the upland nigh my sad thoughts moving thuswise  i may house  and i may husband her yet what am i but licensed tyrant to this bonded pair says charity do as ye would be done by     hurling my iron to the bushes there i bade them stay  and as if brain and breast were passive they walked with me to the stair  inside the house none watched and on we prest before a mirror in whose gleam i read her beauty hisand mine own mien unblest  till at her room i turned  madam i said have you the wherewithal for this  pray speak love fills no cupboard  youll need daily bread  weve nothing sire said she and nothing seek twere base in me to rob my lord unware our hands will earn a pittance week by week  and next i saw shed piled her raiment rare within the garderobes and her household purse her jewels and least lace of personal wear  and stood in homespun  now grown wholly hers i handed her the gold her jewels all and him the choicest of her robes diverse  ill take you to the doorway in the wall and then adieu i to them  friends withdraw they did so and she wentbeyond recall  and as i paused beneath the arch i saw their moonlit figuresslow as in surprise  descend the slope and vanish on the haw  fool some

volunteer in modest bliss te deum sang with wife and friends  we praise thee lord discerning       that thou hast helped in this    her death and after    twas a deathbed summons and forth i went by the way of the western wall so drear on that winter night and sought a gate        the home by fate    of one i had long held dear  and there as i paused by her tenement and the trees shed on me their rime and hoar i thought of the man who had left her lone        him who made her his own    when i loved her long before  the rooms within had the piteous shine that homethings wear when theres aught amiss from the stairway floated the rise and fall       of an infants call    whose birth had brought her to this  her life was the price she would pay for that whine  for a child by the man she did not love but let that rest for ever i said       and bent my tread    to the chamber up above  she took my hand in her thin white own and smiled her thanksthough nigh too weak  and made them a sign to leave us there       then faltered ere    she could bring herself to speak  twas to see you before i gohell condone such a natural thing now my times not much when death is so near it hustles hence       all passioned sense    between woman and man as such  my husband is absent  as heretofore the city detains him  but in truth he has not been kind    i will speak no blame       butthe child is lame    o i pray she may reach his ruth  forgive past daysi can say no more  maybe if wed wedded youd now repine    but i treated you ill  i was punished  farewell      truth shall i tell    would the child were yours and mine  as a wife i was true  but such my unease that could i insert a deed back in time id make her yours to secure your care       and the scandal bear    and the penalty for the crime   when i had left and the swinging trees rang above me as lauding her candid say another was i  her words were enough       came smooth came rough    i felt i could live my day  next night she died and her obsequies in the field of tombs by the via renowned had her husbands heed  his tendance spent       i often went    and pondered by her mound  all that year and the next year whiled and i still went thitherward in the gloam but the town forgot her and her nook       and her husband took    another love to his home  and the rumour flew that the lame lone child whom she wished for its safety child of mine was treated ill when offspring came       of the newmade dame    and marked a more vigorous line  a smarter grief within me wrought than even at loss of her so dear dead the being whose soul my soul suffused       her child illused    i helpless to interfere  one eve as i stood at my spot of thought in the whitestoned garth brooding thus her wrong her husband neared and to shun his view       by her hallowed mew    i went from the tombs among  to the cirque of the gladiators which faced  that haggard mark of imperial rome whose pagan echoes mock the chime       of our christian time    it was void and i inward clomb  scarce night the suns gold touch displaced from the vast rotund and the neighbouring dead when her husband followed bowed halfpassed       with lip upcast    then halting sullenly said  it is noised that you visit my first wifes tomb now i gave her an honoured name to bear while living when dead  so ive claim to ask       by what right you task    my patience by vigiling there  theres decency even in death i assume preserve it sir and keep away for the mother of my firstborn you       show mind undue   sir ive nothing more to say  a desperate stroke discerned i then  god pardonor pardon notthe lie she had sighed that she wished lest the child should pine       of slights twere mine    so i said  but the father i  that you thought it yours is the way of men but i won her troth long ere your day you learnt how in dying she summoned me       twas in fealty   sir ive nothing more to say  save that if youll hand me my little maid ill take her and rear her and spare you toil think it more than a friendly act none can       im a lonely man    while youve a large pot to boil  if not and youll put it to ball or blade  tonight tomorrow night anywhen  ill meet you here    but think of it       and in season fit    let me hear from you again   well i went away hoping but nought i heard of my stroke for the child till there greeted me a little voice that one day came       to my windowframe    and babbled innocently  my father whos not my own sends word im to stay here sir where i belong next a writing came  since the child was the fruit       of your lawless suit    pray take her to right a wrong  and i did  and i gave the child my love and the child loved me and estranged us none but compunctions loomed for id harmed the dead       by what id said    for the good of the living one   yet though god wot i am sinner enough and unworthy the woman who drew me so perhaps this wrong for her darlings good       she forgives or

as ere her mind had sought a solace in domestic joys and ere the vanished pair of boys    were sent to sun her cot  she numbered near on sixty years    and passed as elderly when in the street with

  that whisked the years away  she rose and rayed and decked her head    where the bleached hairs ran thin upon her cap two bows of red    she fixed with hasty pin unheard descending to the street she trod the flags with tuneled feet    and stood before the inn  save for the dancers not a sound    disturbed the icy air no watchman on his midnight round    or traveller was there but over allsaints

and as oernight from pummery ridge to maembury ring and standfast bridge    no life stirred near or far  though inner mischief worked amain    she reached her husbands side where toilweary as he had

joyance and grasses and grove shone in garments    of glory to me  she lives in a plenteous wellbeing    today as aforehand the dead bore the namethough a rare one     the name that bore she  she lived    i afar in the city    of frenzyled factions had squandered green years and maturer    in bowing the knee  to baals illusive and specious    till chance had there voiced me that one i loved vainly in nonage    had ceased her to be  the passion the planets had scowled on    and change had let dwindle her deathrumour smartly relifted    to full apogee  i mounted a steed in the dawning    with acheful remembrance and made for the ancient west highway    to far exonbry  passing heaths and the house of long sieging    i neared the thin steeple that tops the fair fane of poores olden    episcopal see  and changing anew my onbearer    i traversed the downland whereon the bleak hillgraves of chieftains    bulge barren of tree  and still sadly onward i followed    that highway the icen which trails its pale riband down wessex    oer lynchet and lea  along through the stourbordered forum    where legions had wayfared and where the slow river upglasses    its green canopy  and by weatherbury castle and thencefrom    through casterbridge held i still on to entomb her my vision    saw stretched pallidly  no highwaymans trot blew the nightwind    to me so lifeweary but only the

whose name had once opened    my heart as a key  id looked on unknowing and witnessed    her jests with the tapsters her liquorfired face her thick accents    in naming her fee  o god why this seeming derision    i cried in my anguish o once loved o fair unforgotten     that thingmeant it thee  inurned and at peace lost but sainted    were grief i could compass depravedtis for christs poor dependent    a cruel decree  i backed on the highway but passed not    the hostel  within there too mocking to loves reexpression    was times repartee  uptracking where legions had wayfared    by cromlechs unstoried and lynchets and sepultured chieftains    in selfcolloquy  a feeling stirred in me and strengthened    that she was not my love but she of the garth who lay rapt in    her long reverie  and thence till today i persuade me    that this was the true one that death stole intact her young dearness    and innocency  frailwitted illuded they call me    i may be  tis better to dream than to own the debasement    of sweet cicely  moreover i rate it unseemly    to hold that kind heaven could work such deviceto her ruin    and my misery  so lest i disturb my choice vision    i shun the west highway even now when the knaps ring with rhythms    from blackbird and bee  and feel that with slumber halfconscious    she rests in the churchhay her spirit unsoiled as in youthtime    when lovers were we    her immortality    upon a noon i pilgrimed through    a pasture mile by mile unto the place where i last saw    my dead loves living smile  and sorrowing i lay me down    upon the heated sod it seemed as if my body pressed    the very ground she trod  i lay and thought and in a trance    she came and stood me by the same even to the marvellous ray    that used to light her eye  you draw me and i come to you    my faithful one she said in voice that had the moving tone    it bore ere breath had fled  she said  tis seven years since i died    few now remember me my husband clasps another bride    my childrens love has she  my brethren sisters and my friends    care not to meet my sprite who prized me most i did not know    till i passed down from sight  i said  my days are lonely here    i need thy smile alway ill use this night my ball or blade    and join thee ere the day  a tremor stirred her tender lips    which parted to dissuade that cannot be o friend she cried    think i am but a shade  a shade but in its mindful ones    has immortality by living me you keep alive    by dying you slay me  in you resides my single power    of sweet continuance here on your fidelity i count    through many a coming year   i started through me at her plight    so suddenly confessed dismissing late distaste for life    i craved its bleak unrest  i will not die my one of all     to lengthen out thy days ill guard me from minutest harms    that may invest my ways  she smiled and went  since then she comes    oft when her birthmoon climbs or at the seasons ingresses    or anniversary times  but grows my grief  when i surcease    through whom alone lives she ceases my love her words her ways    never again to be    the ivywife    i longed to love a fullboughed beech    and be as high as he i stretched an arm within his reach    and signalled unity but with his drip he forced a breach    and tried to poison me  i gave the grasp of partnership    to one of other race a plane  he barked him strip by strip    from upper bough to base and me therewith for gone my grip    my arms could not enlace  in new affection next i strove    to coll an ash i saw and he in trust received my love    till with my soft green claw i cramped and bound him as i wove       such was my love  haha  by this i gained his strength and height    without his rivalry but in my triumph i lost sight    of afterhaps  soon he being barkbound flagged snapped fell outright    and in his fall felled me    a meeting with despair    as evening shaped i found me on a moor    which sight could scarce sustain the black lean land of featureless contour    was like a tract in pain  this scene like my own life i said is one    where many glooms abide toned by its fortune to a

scent and hue of buds and travelling bees may come in through the note of birds and singings of the sea    for these are much to me     an idle whim    broke forth from him whom nought could warm to

won away his look    for you will fade  then said she faintly  o contrive some way  some narrow winding turret quite mine own to reach a loft where i may grieve alone it is a slight thing hence do not

for pleasing them and theirs so well  idly attired with features wan in secret swift he laboured on such press of power had brought much gold applied to things of meaner mould  sometimes he wished his aims had been to gather gains like other men then thanked his god hed traced his track too far for wish to drag him back  he looked from his loft one day to where his slighted garden lay nettles and hemlock hid each lawn and every flower was starved and gone  he fainted in his heart whereon he rose and sought his plighted one resolved to loose her bond withal lest she should perish in his fall  he met her with a careless air as though hed ceased to find her fair and said  true love is dust to me i cannot kiss  i tire of thee  that she might scorn him was he fain to put her sooner out of pain for incensed love breathes quick and dies when famished love alingering lies  once done his soul was so betossed it found no more the force it lost hope was his only drink and food and hope extinct decay ensued  and living long so closely penned he had not kept a single friend he dwindled thin as phantoms be and drooped to death in poverty     meantime his schoolmate had gone out to join the

live by doing nought  i plan a valued scheme he said to some  but lend me of your bread and when the vast result looms nigh in profit you shall stand as i  yet they took counsel to restrain their kindness till they saw the gain and since his substance now had run he rose to do what might be done  he went unto his love by night and said  my love i faint in fight deserving as thou dost a crown my cares shall never drag thee down  he had descried a maid whose line would hand her on much corn and wine and held her far in worth above one who could only pray and love  but this fair read him whence he failed to do the deed so blithely hailed he saw his projects wholly marred and gloom and want oppressed him hard  till living to so mean an end whereby hed lost his every friend he perished
