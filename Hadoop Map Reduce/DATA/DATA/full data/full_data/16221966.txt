making a meal of young mice                                      120  his legs were so long and his neck was so   long that all his neighbors laughed at him                       216                                         i                     how old king eagle won his white head                          mother west wind how stories                                      i                     how old king eagle won his white head   peter rabbit sat on the edge of the dear old briarpatch staring up into the sky with his head tipped back until it made his neck ache way way up in the sky was a black speck sailing across the snowy white face of a cloud it didnt seem possible that it could be alive way up there but it was peter knew that it was and he knew who it was it was king eagle by and by it disappeared over towards the great mountain peter rubbed the back of his neck which ached because he had tipped his head back so long then he gave a little sigh  i wonder what it seems like to be able to fly like that said he out loud a way he sometimes has  are you envious asked a voice so close to him that peter jumped there was sammy jay sitting in a little tree just over his head  no snapped peter for it made him a wee bit cross to be so startled  no im not envious sammy jay im not envious of any bird the ground is good enough for me i was just wondering thats all  have you ever seen king eagle close to asked sammy  once replied peter once he came down to the green meadows and sat in that lone tree over there and i was squatting in a bunch of grass quite near and could see him very plainly he is big and fiercelooking but he looks his name every inch a king ive wondered a good many times since how it happens that he has a white head  because replied sammy he is just what he looks to beking of the birdsand that white head is the sign of his royalty given his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather by old mother nature way back in the beginning of things  peters eyes sparkled tell me about it sammy he begged tell me about it and i wont quarrel with you any more  all right peter ill tell you the story because it will do you good to hear it i supposed everybody knew it all birds do that is why we all look up to king eagle replied sammy  way back in the beginning of things old king bear ruled in the green forest as you know that is he ruled the animals and all the little people who lived on the ground but he didnt rule the birds you see the birds were not willing to be ruled over by an animal they wanted one of their own kind so they refused to have old king bear as their king and went to old mother nature to ask her to appoint a king of the air now mr eagle was one of the biggest and strongest and most respected of all the birds of the air there were some like mr goose and mr swan who were bigger but they spent most of their time on the water or the earth and they had no great claws or hooked beak to command respect as did mr eagle so old mother nature made mr eagle king of the air and as was quite right and proper all the birds hastened to pay him homage  so king eagle ruled the air and none dared to cross him or to disobey him unlike old king bear he accepted no tribute from his subjects but hunted for himself and instead of growing fat and lazy as did old king bear he grew stronger of wing and feared no one and nothing now this was in the days when the world was young and old mother nature was very busy trying to make the world a good place to live in so she had very little time to look after the birds and the animals thus she left matters very much to king eagle and old king bear they settled all the quarrels between their subjects and for a while everything went smoothly  king eagle made his home on the cliff of a mountain so that he could look down on all below and see what was going on every day he went down to the green forest and sat on the tallest tree while he listened to the complaints of the other birds and settled their disputes and none questioned his decisions now after a while this little part of the earth where the animals and the birds first lived became overcrowded it became harder and harder to get enough to eat quarrels became more frequent until king eagle had little time for anything but straightening out these troubles and trying to keep peace  old mother nature had been away a long time trying to make other parts of the world fit to live in no one knew when she was coming back or just where she was king eagle sitting on the edge of the cliff on the mountain thought it all over old mother nature ought to know how things were he would send a messenger to try to find her so the next day he called all the birds together and asked who would go out into the unknown great world to look for old mother nature and take a message to her  no one offered this one had a family to look after that one was not feeling well another had a pain in his wings one and all they had an excuse until hummer the tiniest of all the birds was reached he darted into the air before king eagle ill go said he  all the others laughed the very idea of such a tiny fellow going out to dare the dangers of the unknown great world seemed to them so absurd that they just had to laugh but king eagle didnt laugh he thanked hummer and told him that his heart was as big as his body was small but that he would not send him out into the great world for he would go himself he had been but trying out his subjects and he had found but one who was worthy and that one was the smallest of them all then king eagle said things that made all the other birds hang their heads for shame and want to sneak out of sight  after that he told them that no king who was worthy to be king would ask his subjects to do what he would not do himself and that where there was danger to be faced or something hard to do it was the kings place to do it so he himself was going out into the unknown great world to find mother nature and see what could be done to make things better and happier for them then he spread his great wings and sailed away every inch a king they watched him until he was a speck in the sky and finally he disappeared altogether  day after day they watched for him to come back but there was no sign of him they began to shake their heads and openly talk of choosing a new king only little mr hummer kept his faith and day after day flew away in the direction old king eagle had gone hoping to meet him coming back at last a day was set to choose a new king that morning as soon as it was light enough to see little mr hummer darted away and his heart was heavy he would take no part in choosing a new king he would go until he found king eagle or until something happened to him pretty soon he saw a speck way up against a cloud a speck no bigger than himself it grew bigger and bigger and at last he knew that it was king eagle himself little mr hummer turned and flew as he never had flown before he wanted to get back before a new king was chosen so that king eagle might never know that his subjects had lost faith in him  he was so out of breath when he reached the other birds that he couldnt say a word for a few minutes then he told them that king eagle was coming the other birds had proved that they were not brave when they had refused to go out in search of old mother nature and now they proved it again instead of waiting to give king eagle a royal welcome they hurried away one after another they were afraid to meet him because in their hearts they knew that they had done a cowardly thing in deciding to choose a new king so when king eagle weary and with torn wings and broken tail feathers dropped down to the tall tree in the green forest there was none to give him greeting save little mr hummer  king eagle said nothing about the failure of the other birds to give him greeting but at once sent little mr hummer around to tell all the others that far away he had found old mother nature preparing a new land for them and that when she gave the word he would lead them to it then king eagle flew to his home on the cliff of the mountain and not one word did he ever say of his terrible journey of how he had gone hungry had been beaten by storms and had suffered from cold and weariness yet never once had turned back  but when old mother nature came later and announced that the new land was ready for the birds she first called them together and told them all that king eagle had suffered and how he had proved himself a royal king as a reward she promised that his family should be rulers over the birds forever and as a sign that this should be so she reached forth and touched his black head and it became snowy white and all the birds cried long live the king  then old mother nature turned to tiny mr hummer and touched his throat and behold a shining ruby was there the reward of loyalty faith and bravery  then king eagle mounted into the air and proudly led the way to the promised land and so the birds went forth and peopled the great world and king eagle and his children and his childrens children have ruled the air ever since and have worn the snowy crown which king eagle of long ago so bravely won                                       ii                   how old mr mink taught himself to swim                                       ii                   how old mr mink taught himself to swim   of all the little people who live in the green forest or on the green meadows or around the smiling pool billy mink has the most accomplishments at least it seems that way to his friends and neighbors he can run very swiftly he can climb very nimbly his eyes and his ears and his nose are all wonderfully keen andhe can swim like a fish yes sir billy mink is just as much at home in the water as out of it so wherever he happens to be in the green forest out on the green meadows along the laughing brook or in the smiling pool he feels perfectly at home and quite able to look out for himself  once billy mink had boasted that he could do anything that any one else who wore fur could do but boasters almost always come to grief and grandfather frog had brought billy to grief that time he had invited every one to meet at the smiling pool and see billy mink do whatever any one else who wore fur could do and then when billy had run and jumped and climbed and swum grandfather frog had called flitter the bat there was some one wearing fur who could fly and of course billy mink couldnt do that it cured billy of boastingfor a while anyway  now peter rabbit who can do little but run and jump used sometimes to feel a wee bit of envy in his heart when he thought of all the things that billy mink could do and do well somehow peter could never make it seem quite right that one person should be able to do so many things when others could do only one or two things he said as much to grandfather frog one day as they watched billy mink catch a fat trout  chugarum said grandfather frog and looked sharply at peter chugarum people never know what they can do till they try once upon a time billy minks greatgreateversogreatgrandfather couldnt swim any more than you can but he didnt waste any time foolishly wishing that he could  what did he do asked peter eagerly  learned how replied grandfather frog gruffly made it his business to learn how then he taught his children and they taught their children and after a long time it came natural to the mink family to swim  did it take old mr mink very long to learn how asked peter wistfully  quite a while replied grandfather frog quite a while perhaps you would like to hear about it  oh if you please grandfather frog cried peter if you please i should love dearly to hear about it perhaps then i can learn to swim  grandfather frog snapped up a foolish green fly that happened his way and peter heard something that sounded very much like a chuckle he looked at grandfather frog suspiciously was that chuckle because of the foolish green fly or was grandfather frog laughing at him peter wasnt sure  it all happened a long time ago when the world was young as a great many other things happened began grandfather frog old mr mink the eversogreatgrandfather of billy mink couldnt do all the things that billy can now for instance he couldnt swim but he could do a great many things and he was very smart it has always run in the mink family to be smart he dressed very much as billy does now except that he didnt have the waterproof coat that billy has and he was a great traveler just as billy is everybody smaller than he and some who were bigger were a little bit afraid of old mr mink for he was quite as sly and cunning as mr fox and it was suspected that he knew a great deal more than he ever admitted about eggs that were stolen and nests that were broken up and other strange things that happened in the green forest and along the laughing brook but he never was caught doing anything wrong and always seemed to be minding his own business so all things considered he got along very well with his neighbors  now mr mink was small and spry and his wits were as nimble as his feet he saw all that was going on about him and he was wise enough to keep his tongue still so that it never got him into trouble as gossipy tongues do some people i know  peter rabbit fidgeted uneasily it seemed to him that grandfather frog had looked at him very hard when he said this but grandfather frog just cleared his throat and went on with his story  yes sir old mr mink kept his eyes wide open and his ears wide open and the wits in his little brown head always working he noticed that those who were fussy about what they ate and insisted on having a special kind of food often went hungry or had to hunt long and hard to find what they liked so he made up his mind to learn to eat many kinds of food this is how it happens that he learned to like fish his big cousin mr otter often caught a bigger fish than he could eat all himself and would leave some of it on the bank mr mink would find it and help himself  but having to depend on mr otter to get the fish for him didnt suit mr mink at all in the first place he didnt have as much as he wanted and then again he didnt have it when he wanted it if i could learn to catch fish for myself i would be much better off thought mr mink after this he spent a great deal of time on the banks of the smiling pool watching mr otter swim to see just how he did it if he can swim i can swim said mr mink to himself and went off up the laughing brook to a quiet little pool where the water was not deep  at first he didnt like it at all the water got in his ears and up his nose and choked him and then it was so dreadfully wet but he would grit his teeth and keep at it after a while he got so that he could paddle around a little gradually he lost his fear of the water then he found that because he naturally moved so quickly he could sometimes catch foolish minnows who swam in where the water was very shallow this was great sport and he quite often had fish for dinner now  but he wasnt satisfied no sir he wasnt satisfied whatever mr mink did he wanted to do well he could run well and climb well and there was no better hunter in all the green forest he was bound that he would swim well so he kept trying and trying he learned to fill his lungs with air and hold his breath for a long time while he swam as fast as ever he could with his head under water as he had seen his cousin mr otter swim the more he did this the longer he could hold his breath after a while he found that because he was slim and trim and moved so fast he could outswim mr muskrat and this made him feel very good indeed for mr muskrat spent nearly all his time in the water and was accounted a very good swimmer there was only one thing that bothered mr mink the water was so dreadfully wet every time he came out of it he had to run his hardest to dry off and keep from getting cold this was very tiresome and he did wish that there was an easier way of drying off  then came the bad time the sad time when food was scarce and most of the little people in the green forest and on the green meadow went hungry but mr mink didnt go hungry oh my no you see he had learned to catch fish and so he had plenty to eat when old mother nature came to see how all the little people were getting along she was very much surprised to find that mr mink had become a famous swimmer she watched him catch a fish then she watched him run about to dry off and keep from getting cold and her eyes twinkled  he who helps himself deserves to be helped said old mother nature mr mink didnt know what she meant by that but the next morning he found out yes sir the next morning he found out he found that he had a brand new coat over his old one and the new one was waterproof he could swim as much as he pleased and not get the least bit wet because the water couldnt get through that new coat and ever since that longago day when the world was young the minks have had waterproof coats and have been famous fishermen hello peter rabbit what under the sun are you trying to do swelling yourself up that way  ii was just practising holding my breath replied peter and looked very very foolish  ho ho ho ha ha ha laughed grandfather frog you cant learn to swim by holding your breath on dry land peter rabbit                                      iii                     how old mr toad learned to sing                                      iii                     how old mr toad learned to sing   peter rabbit never will forget how he laughed the first time he heard old mr toad say that he could sing and was going to sing why peter would as soon think of singing himself and that is something he can no more do than he can fly peter had known old mr toad ever since he could remember he was rather fond of him even if he did play jokes on him once in a while but he always thought of old mr toad as one of the homeliest of all his friendsslow awkward and too commonplace to be very interesting so when in the glad joyousness of the spring old mr toad had told jimmy skunk that he was going down to the smiling pool to sing because without him the great chorus there would lack one of its sweetest voices peter and jimmy had laughed till the tears came  a few days later peter happened over to the smiling pool for a call on grandfather frog a mighty chorus of joy from unseen singers rose from all about the smiling pool peter knew about those singers they were hylas the little cousins of stickytoes the tree toad peter sat very still on the edge of the bank trying to see one of them suddenly he became aware of a new note one he never had noticed before and sweeter than any of the others indeed it was one of the sweetest of all the spring songs as sweet as the love notes of tommy tit the chickadee than which there is none sweeter  it seemed to come from the shallow water just in front of peter and he looked eagerly for the singer then his eyes opened until it seemed as if they would pop right out of his head and he dropped his lower jaw foolishly there was old mr toad with a queer bag peter never had seen before swelled out under his chin and as surely as peter was sitting on that bank it was old mr toad who was the sweet singer  old mr toad paid no attention to peter not even when he was spoken to he was so absorbed in his singing that he just didnt hear peter sat there a while to listen then he called jimmy skunk and unc billy possum who were also listening to the music and they were just as surprised as peter then he spied jerry muskrat at the other end of the smiling pool and hurried over there peter was so full of the discovery he had made that he could think of nothing else he fairly ached to tell  jerry he cried oh jerry muskrat do you know that old mr toad can sing  jerry looked surprised that peter should ask such a question of course i know it said he it would be mighty funny if i didnt know it seeing that he is the sweetest singer in the smiling pool and has sung here every spring since i can remember  peter looked very much chagrined i didnt know it until just how he confessed i didnt believe him when he told me that he could sing i wonder how he ever learned  he didnt learn any more than you learned how to jump replied jerry it just came to him naturally his father sang and his grandfather and his great grandfather way back to the beginning of things i thought everybody knew about that  i dont tell me about it please do jerry begged peter  all right i will replied jerry goodnaturedly its something you ought to know about anyway in the first place old mr toad belongs to a very old and honorable family one of the very oldest ive heard say that it goes way back almost to the very beginning of things when there wasnt much land anyway the first toad the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of old mr toad and own cousin to the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of grandfather frog was one of the first to leave the water for the dry land  old mother nature met him hopping along and making hard work of it because of course it was so new she looked at him sharply what are you doing here she demanded arent you contented with the water where you were born  mr toad bowed very low yesm said he very humbly ill go right back there if you say so i thought there must be some things worth finding out on the land and that i might be of some use in the great world  his answer pleased old mother nature she was worried she had planted all kinds of things on the land and they were springing up everywhere but she had discovered that bugs of many kinds liked the tender green things and were increasing so fast and were so greedy that they threatened to strip the land of all that she had planted she had so many things to attend to that she hadnt time to take care of the bugs if you truly want to be of some use said she you can attend to some of those bugs  mr toad went right to work and old mother nature went about some other business having so many other things to look after she quite forgot about mr toad and it was several weeks before she came that way again right in the middle of a great bare place where the bugs had eaten everything was a beautiful green spot and patiently hopping from plant to plant was mr toad snapping up every bug he could see he didnt see old mother nature and kept right on working she watched him a while as he hopped from plant to plant catching bugs as fast as he could and then she spoke  have you stayed right here ever since i last saw you she asked  mr toad gave a start of surprise yesm said he  but i thought you wanted to see the great world and learn things said she  mr toad looked a little embarrassed so i did he replied but i wanted to be of some use and the bugs have kept me so busy there was no time to travel besides i have learned a great deal right here ii couldnt get around fast enough to save all the plants but i have saved what i could  old mother nature was more pleased than she was willing to show for mr toad was the first of all the little people who had tried to help her and he had done what he could willingly and faithfully  i suppose said she speaking a little gruffly you expect me to reward you  mr toad looked surprised and a little hurt i dont want any reward said he i didnt do it for that it will be reward enough to know that i really have helped and to be allowed to continue to help  at that old mother natures face lighted with one of her most beautiful smiles mr toad said she if you could have just what you want what would it be  mr toad hesitated a few minutes and then said shyly a beautiful voice  it was old mother natures turn to look surprised a beautiful voice she exclaimed pray why do you want a beautiful voice  so that i can express my happiness in the most beautiful way i know ofby singing replied mr toad  you shall have it declared old mother nature but not all the time lest you be tempted to forget your work which you know is the real source of true happiness in the spring of each year you shall go back to your home in the water and there for a time you shall sing to your hearts content and there shall be no sweeter voice than yours  sure enough when the next spring came mr toad was filled with a great longing to go home when he got there he found that in his throat was a little music bag and when he swelled it out he had one of the sweetest voices in the world and so it has been ever since with the toad family old mr toad is one of the sweetest singers in the smiling pool but when it is time to go back to work he never grumbles but is one of the most faithful workers in mother natures garden concluded jerry muskrat  peter sighed i never could work said he perhaps that is why i cannot sing  very likely replied jerry muskrat quite forgetting that he cannot sing himself although he is a great worker                                       iv                    how old mr crow lost his double tongue                                       iv                    how old mr crow lost his double tongue   caw caw caw caw blacky the crow sat in the top of a tall tree and seemed trying to see just how much noise he could make with that harsh voice of his peter rabbit peered out from the dear old briarpatch and frowned  if i had a voice as unpleasant as that id forget i could talk yes sir id forget i had a tongue declared peter  somebody laughed and peter turned quickly to find jimmy skunk what are you laughing at demanded peter  at the idea of you forgetting that you had a tongue replied jimmy  well i would if i had a voice like blackys persisted peter although he grinned a wee bit foolishly as he looked at jimmy skunk for you know peter is a great gossip  its lucky for you that you havent then retorted jimmy im afraid that you would lose your tongue just as old mr crow did  that sounded like a story right away peter sat up and took notice did old mr crow really lose his tongue how did he lose it why did he lose it when  jimmy skunk clapped a hand over each ear and pretended that he was going to run away peter jumped in front of him no you dont he cried youve just got to tell me that story jimmy skunk  what story asked jimmy as if he hadnt the least idea in the world what peter was talking about though of course he knew perfectly well  caw caw caw caw shouted blacky the crow from the distant treetop  the story of how old mr crow lost his tongue you may as well tell me first as last because ill give you no peace until you do insisted peter  jimmy grinned if thats the case i guess ill have to said he wait until i find a comfortable place to sit down i never could tell a story standing up  at last he found a place to suit him and after changing his position two or three times to make sure that he was perfectly comfortable he began  once upon a time  never mind about that interrupted peter i dont see why all stories have to begin once upon a time it seems as if everything interesting happened long ago  if you dont watch out this story wont begin at all declared jimmy  peter looked properly ashamed for interrupting and jimmy started again  once upon a time old mr crow the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of blacky over there possessed the most wonderful tongue of any of the little people who ran walked crawled or flew he could imitate any and everybody and he did he could sing like mr meadow lark or he could bark like mr wolf he could whistle like mr quail or he could growl like old king bear there wasnt anybody whose voice he couldnt imitate and do it so well that if you had been there and heard but not seen him you never would have guessed that it was an imitation  now the imp of mischief was in old mr crow just as it is in blacky today and he was smart too there wasnt anybody smarter than old mr crow its from him that blacky gets his smartness it didnt take him long to discover that no one else had such a wonderful tongue it was even more wonderful than the tongue of old mr mocker the mocking bird mr mocker could imitate the songs of other birds but old mr crow could imitate anybody as i have said he puzzled over it a good deal himself for a while he couldnt understand how he could make any sound he pleased while his neighbors could make only a few special sounds  being very smart and shrewd just as blacky is he finally made up his mind that it must be in his tongue as soon as he thought of that he started out to find out and on one excuse or another he managed to get all his neighbors to show him their tongues sure enough his own tongue was different from any of the others it was split a little so that it was almost like two tongues in one  thats it he chuckled i knew it its this little old tongue of mine nobody else has got one like it but nobody knows that but me i must make good use of it yes sir i must make good use of it  now when old mr crow said that he didnt really mean good use at all that is he didnt mean what you or i or any of his neighbors would have called good use what he did mean was the use that would bring to himself the greatest gain in pleasure and being a great joker he began by having a lot of fun with his neighbors when he saw mr rabbit your grandfather a thousand times removed coming along he would hide and just as mr rabbit was passing he would snarl like mr lynx of course mr rabbit would be scared almost to death and away he would go lippertylippertylip and old mr crow would laugh so that he had to hold his black sides he would hide in the top of a tree near mr squirrels home and just when mr squirrel had found a fat nut and started to eat it he would scream like mr hawk and then laugh to see mr squirrel drop his nut and dive headfirst into the nearest hole he would squeak like a mouse when mr fox was passing just to see mr fox hunt and hunt for the dinner he felt sure was close at hand  but after a while mr crow wasnt satisfied with harmless jokes times were getting hard and everybody had to work to get enough to eat this didnt suit mr crow at all and one day when he chanced to discover one of his neighbors just sitting down to a good meal a new idea came to him he stole as near as he could without being seen and suddenly growled like old king bear of course that meal was left in a hurry it is too bad to see all that good food go to waste said mr crow and promptly ate it  after that instead of hunting for food himself he just kept a sharp eye on his neighbors and when they had found something he wanted he frightened them away and helped himself all the time he was so sly about it that never once was he suspected he was a great talker was mr crow and spent a great deal of time gossiping and he was always one of the first to offer sympathy to those who had lost a meal  now all this time unknown to old mr crow old mother nature knew just what was going on for you cant fool her and its of no use to try one morning mr crow discovered mr coon just sitting down to a good breakfast he stole up behind mr coon and opened his mouth to bark like mr coyote but instead of a bark there came forth a harsh caw caw caw it is a question which was the more surprised mr coon or mr crow mr coon didnt forget his manners he politely invited mr crow to sit down and take breakfast with him but mr crow had lost his appetite somehow his tongue felt very queer he thanked mr coon and begged to be excused then he hurried over to the nearest pool of water in which he could see his reflection and stuck out his tongue it was no longer split into a double tongue then old mr crow guessed that old mother nature had found him out and punished him but to make sure he flew to the most lonesome place he knew of and there he tried to imitate the voices of his neighbors but try as he would all he could say was caw caw caw  for a long long time after that no one ever heard mr crow say a word his neighbors didnt know what to make of it for you remember he had been a great gossip they said that he must have lost his tongue of course he hadnt but he felt that he might as well have and ever since then the crow family has had the harshest of all voices  caw caw caw shouted blacky from the top of the tree where he was sitting  i wonder said peter rabbit thoughtfully if he could imitate other people if his tongue should be split  ive heard say that he could replied jimmy skunk but i dont know one thing is sure and that is that he is just as smart and sly as his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather was and i guess it is just as well that his tongue is just as it is                                        v                      how howler the wolf got his name                                        v                      how howler the wolf got his name   peter rabbit never had seen howler the wolf but he had heard his voice in the distance and the mere sound had given him cold shivers it just went all through him it was very different from the voice of old man coyote the latter is bad enough sounding as it does like many voices but there is not in it that terrible fierceness which the voice of his big cousin contains peter had no desire to hear it any nearer the first time he met his cousin jumper the hare he asked him about howler for jumper had come down to the green forest from the great woods where howler lives and is feared  did you hear him exclaimed jumper i hope he wont take it into his head to come down here i dont believe he will because it is too near the homes of men if the sound of his voice way off there gave you cold shivers im afraid youd shake all to pieces if you heard him close by hes just as fierce as his voice sounds there is one thing about him that i like though and that is that he gives fair warning when he is hunting he doesnt come sneaking about without a sound like tufty the lynx he hunts like bowser the hound and lets you know that he is out hunting did you ever hear how he got his name  no how did he get his name asked peter eagerly  well of course its a family name now and is handed down and has been for years and years ever since the first wolf began hunting way back when the world was young explained jumper for a long time the first wolf had no name most of the other animals and birds had names but nothing seemed to just fit the big gray wolf he looked a great deal like his cousin mr dog and still more like his other cousin mr coyote but he was stronger than either could run farther and faster than either and had quite as wonderful a nose as either  with mr wolf as with all the other animals life was an easy matter at first there was plenty to eat and everybody was on good terms with everybody else but there came a time as you know when food became scarce it was then that the big learned to hunt the small and fear was born into the world mr wolf was swift of leg and keen of nose his teeth were long and sharp and he was so strong that there were few he feared to fight with in fact he didnt know fear at all for he simply kept out of the way of those who were too big and strong for him to fight  most people like to do the things they know they can do well mr wolf early learned the joy of hunting i cant understand it myself can you  peter shook his head you see neither jumper nor peter ever have hunted any one in all their lives it is always they who are hunted  perhaps it was because he was so strong of wind and leg that he enjoyed running and because he was so keen of nose that he enjoyed following a trail anyway he scorned to spend his time sneaking about as did his cousin mr coyote but chose to follow the swiftest runners and to match his nose and speed and skill against their speed and wits he didnt bother to hunt little people like us when there were big people like mr deer the longer and harder the hunt the more mr wolf seemed to enjoy it  at first he hunted silently running swiftly with his nose to the ground but this gave the ones he hunted very little chance he was upon them before they even suspected that he was on their trail it always made mr wolf feel mean he never could hold his head and his tail up after that kind of a hunt he felt so like a sneak that he just had to put his tail between his legs for very shame there was nothing to be proud about in such a hunt  one night he sat thinking about it gentle mistress moon looked down at him through the treetops and something inside him urged him to tell her his troubles he pointed his sharp nose up at her opened his mouth and because she was so far away did his best to make her hear that was the very first wolf howl ever heard there was something very lonely and shivery and terrible in the sound and all who heard it shook with fear mr wolf didnt know this but he did know that he felt better for howling so every night he pointed his nose up at mistress moon and howled  it happened that once as he did this a deer jumped at the first sound and rushed away in great fright this gave mr wolf an idea the next day when he went hunting he threw up his head and howled at the very first smell of fresh tracks that day he had the longest hunt he ever had known for the deer had had fair warning mr wolf didnt get the deer because the latter swam across a lake and so got away but he returned home in high spirits in spite of an empty stomach you see he felt that it had been a fair hunt after that he always gave fair warning as he ran he howled for very joy no longer did he carry his bushy tail between his legs for no longer did he feel like a coward and a sneak instead he carried it proudly of all the animals who hunted he was the only one who gave fair warning and he felt that he had a right to be proud all the others hunted by stealth he alone hunted openly and boldly  illustration old king bear who was king no longer would growl a deep rumblygrumbly growl page 66  now this earned for him first the dislike and then the hatred of the other hunters you see when he was hunting he spoiled the hunting of those who stole softfooted through the green forest and caught their victims by surprise the little people heard his voice and either hid away or were on guard so that it was hard work for the silent hunters to surprise them at the sound of his hunting cry old king bear who was king no longer would growl a deep rumblygrumbly growl though he didnt mind so much as some because he did very little hunting he wouldnt have done any if food had not been so scarce because he would have been entirely satisfied with berries and roots if he could have found enough mr lynx and mr panther would snarl angrily mr coyote and mr fox would show their teeth and mutter about what they would do to mr wolf if only they were big enough and strong enough and brave enough  of course it wasnt long before mr wolf discovered that he had no friends the little people feared him and the big people hated him because he spoiled their hunting but he didnt mind in fact he looked down on mr lynx and mr panther and mr coyote and mr fox and when he met them he lifted his tail a little more proudly than ever sometimes he would howl out of pure mischief just to spoil the hunting of the others so little by little he began to be spoken of as howler the wolf and after a while everybody called him howler  of course howler taught his children how to hunt and that the only honorable and fair way was to give those they hunted fair warning so it grew to be a fixed habit of the wolf family to give fair warning that they were abroad and then trust to their wind and wits and speed and noses to catch those they were after the result was that they grew strong able to travel long distances keen of nose and sharp of wit because the big people hated them and the little people feared them they lived by themselves and so formed the habit of hunting together for company  it has been so ever since and the name howler has been handed down to this day no sound in all the great woods carries with it more fear than does the voice of howler the wolf and no one hunts so openly boldly and honorably be thankful peter that howler never comes down to the green forest but stays far from the homes of men  i am replied peter just the same i think he deserves a better name for the fair way in which he hunts though his name certainly does fit him i would a lot rather be caught by some one who had given me fair warning than by some one who came sneaking after me and gave me no warning but i dont want to be caught at all so i think ill hurry back to the dear old briarpatch and peter did                                       vi                    how old mr squirrel became thrifty                                       vi                    how old mr squirrel became thrifty   grandfather frog sat on his big green lilypad in the smiling pool and shook his head reprovingly at peter rabbit peter is such a happygolucky little fellow that he never thinks of anything but the good time he can have in the present he never looks ahead to the future so of course peter seldom worries if the sun shines today peter takes it for granted that it will shine tomorrow so he hops and skips and has a good time and just trusts to luck  now grandfather frog is very old and very wise and he doesnt believe in luck no sir grandfather frog doesnt believe in luck  chugarum says grandfather frog luck never just happens what people call bad luck is just the result of their own foolishness or carelessness or both and what people call good luck is just the result of their own wisdom and carefulness and common sense  peter rabbit had been making fun of happy jack squirrel because happy jack said that he had too much to do to stop and play that morning here it was summer and winter was a long way off what was summer for if not to play in and have a good time yet happy jack was already thinking of winter and was hunting for a new storehouse so as to have it ready when the time to fill it with nuts should come it was much better to play and take sunnaps among the buttercups and daisies and just have a good time all day long  chugarum said grandfather frog did you ever hear how old mr squirrel learned thrift  no cried peter rabbit stretching himself out in the soft grass on the edge of the smiling pool do tell us about it please do grandfather frog  you know peter dearly loves a story  all the other little meadow and forest people who were about the smiling pool joined peter rabbit in begging grandfather frog for the story and after they had teased for it a long time grandfather frog dearly loves to be teased he cleared his throat and began  once upon a time when the world was young in the days when old king bear ruled in the green forest everybody had to take king bear presents of things to eat that was because he was king you know kings never have to work like other people to get enough to eat everybody brings them a little of their best and so kings have the best in the land without the trouble of working for it it was just this way with old king bear that was before he grew so fat and lazy and selfish that old mother nature declared that he should be king no longer  now in those days lived old mr squirrel the grandfather a thousand times removed of happy jack squirrel whom you all know of course he wasnt old then he was young and frisky just like happy jack and he was a great favorite with old king bear he was a saucy fellow was mr squirrel and he used to spend most of his time playing tricks on the other meadow and forest people he even dared to play jokes on old king bear sometimes old king bear would lose his temper and then mr squirrel would whisk up in the top of a tall tree and keep out of sight until old king bear had recovered his good nature  those were happy days very happy days indeed and old king bear was a very wise ruler there was plenty of everything to eat and so nobody missed the little they brought to old king bear having so much brought to him he grew very particular yes sir old king bear grew very particular indeed some began to whisper behind his back that he was fussy he would pick out the very best of everything for himself and give the rest to his family and special friends or else just let it go to waste  now old king bear was very fond of lively little mr squirrel and often he would give mr squirrel some of the good things for which he had no room in his own stomach mr squirrel was smart he soon found out that the more he amused old king bear the more of king bears good things he had it was a lot easier to get his living this way than to hunt for his food as he always had in the past besides it was a lot more fun so little mr squirrel studied how to please old king bear and he grew fat on the good things which other people had earned  one day old king bear gave little mr squirrel six big fat nuts you see old king bear didnt care for nuts himself not the kind with the hard shells anyway so he really wasnt as generous as he seemed which is the way with a great many people it is easy to give what you dont want yourself little mr squirrel bowed very low and thanked old king bear in his best manner he really didnt want those nuts for his stomach was full at the time but it wouldnt do to refuse a gift from the king so he took the nuts and pretended to be delighted with them  what shall i do with them said little mr squirrel as soon as he was alone it wont do for me to leave them where old king bear will find them for it might make him very angry at last he remembered a certain hollow tree the very place cried little mr squirrel ill drop them in there and no one will be any the wiser  no sooner thought of than it was done and little mr squirrel frisked away in his usual happygolucky fashion and forgot all about the nuts in the hollow tree it wasnt very long after this that old mother nature began to hear complaints of old king bear and his rule in the green forest he had grown fat and lazy and all his relatives had grown fat and lazy because you see none of them had to work for the things they ate the little forest and meadow people were growing tired of feeding the bear family it was just at the beginning of winter when old mother nature came to see for herself what the trouble was it didnt take her long to find out no sir it didnt take her long you cant fool old mother nature and its of no use to try she took one good look at old king bear nodding in the cave where he used to sleep he was so fat he looked as if he would burst his skin  old mother nature frowned you are such a lazy fellow that you shall be king no longer instead you shall sleep all winter and grow thin and thinner till you awake in the spring and then you will have to hunt for your own food for never again shall you live on the gifts of others said she  all the little forest and meadow people who had been bringing tribute that is things to eat to old king bear rejoiced that they need do so no longer and went about their business all of old king bears family including his cousin mr coon had been put to sleep just like old king bear himself yes sir they were all asleep fast asleep  little mr squirrel felt lonesome he grew more lonesome every day none of the other little people would have anything to do with him because they remembered how he had lived without working when he was the favorite of king bear the weather was cold and it was hard work to find anything to eat mr squirrel was hungry all the time he couldnt think of anything but his stomach and how empty it was he grew thin and thinner  one cold day when the snow covered the earth little mr squirrel went without breakfast then he went without dinner you see he couldnt find so much as a pineseed to eat late in the afternoon he crept into a hollow tree to get away from the cold bitter wind he was very tired and very cold and very very hungry tears filled his eyes and ran over and dripped from his nose he curled up on the leaves at the bottom of the hollow to try to go to sleep and forget under him was something hard he twisted and turned but he couldnt get in a comfortable position finally he looked to see what the trouble was caused by what do you think he found six big fat nuts yes sir six big fat nuts little mr squirrel was so glad that he cried for very joy  when he had eaten two he felt better and decided to keep the others for the next day then he began to wonder how those nuts happened to be in that hollow tree he thought and thought and at last he remembered how he had hidden six nuts in this very hollow a long time before when he had had more than he knew what to do with these were the very nuts the present of old king bear  right then as he thought about it little mr squirrel had a bright idea he made up his mind that thereafter he would stop his happygolucky idleness and the first time that ever he found plenty of food he would fill that hollow tree just as full as he could pack it and then if there should come a time when food was scarce he would have plenty and that is just what he did do the next fall when nuts were plentiful he worked from morning till night storing them away in the hollow tree and all that winter he was happy and fat for he had plenty to eat he never had to beg of any one he had learned to save  and ever since then the squirrels have been among the wisest of all the little forest people and always the busiest      the squirrel family long since learned      that things are best when duly earned      that play and fun are found in work      by him who does not try to shirk  and thats all finished grandfather frog  thank you thank you grandfather frog cried peter rabbit                                      vii                   how lightfoot the deer learned to jump                                      vii                   how lightfoot the deer learned to jump   it isnt often that peter rabbit is filled with envy as a rule peter is very free from anything like envy usually he is quite content with the gifts bestowed upon him by old mother nature and if others have more than he has he is glad for them and wastes no time fretting because he has not been so fortunate but once in a great while peter becomes really and truly envious it was that way the first time he saw lightfoot the deer leap over a fallen tree and ever after when he saw lightfoot a little of that same feeling stirred in his heart you see peter always had been very proud of his own powers of jumping to be sure jumper the hare could jump higher and farther than he could but jumper is his own cousin so it was all in the family so to speak and peter didnt mind but to see lightfoot the deer go sailing over the tops of the bushes and over the fallen trees as if he had springs in his legs was quite another matter  i wish i could jump like that said peter right out loud one day as he stood with his hands on his hips watching lightfoot leap over a pile of brush  why dont you learn to asked jimmy skunk with a mischievous twinkle in the eye which peter couldnt see lightfoot couldnt always jump like that he had to learn why dont you find out how probably grandfather frog knows all about it he knows about almost everything if i were you id ask him  iii dont just like to replied peter ive asked him so many questions that i am afraid hell think me a nuisance i tell you what jimmy you ask him peters eyes brightened as he said this  jimmy chuckled no you dont said he if there is anything you want to know from grandfather frog ask him yourself i dont want to know how lightfoot learned to jump he may jump over the moon for all i care have you seen any fat beetles this morning peter  no replied peter shortly im not interested in beetles there may never be any fat beetles for all i care  jimmy laughed it was a goodnatured chuckling kind of a laugh dont get huffy peter said he heres hoping that you learn how to jump like lightfoot the deer and that i get a stomachful of fat beetles with that jimmy skunk slowly ambled along down the crooked little path  peter watched him out of sight sighed started for the dear old briarpatch stopped sighed again and then headed straight for the smiling pool grandfather frog was there on his big green lilypad and peter wasted no time  how did lightfoot the deer learn to jump so splendidly grandfather frog he blurted out almost before he had stopped running  grandfather frog blinked his great goggly eyes chugarum said he if youll jump across the laughing brook over there where it comes into the smiling pool ill tell you  peter looked at the laughing brook in dismay it was quite wide at that point ii cant he stammered  then i cant tell you how lightfoot learned to jump replied grandfather frog quite as if the matter were settled  iill try peter hastened to blurt out  all right while you are trying ill see if i can remember the story replied grandfather frog  peter went back a little so as to get a good start then he ran as hard as he knew how and when he reached the bank of the laughing brook he jumped with all his might it was a good jumpa splendid jumpbut it wasnt quite enough of a jump and peter landed with a great splash in the water grandfather frog opened his great mouth as wide as he could which is very wide indeed and laughed until the tears rolled down from his great goggly eyes jerry muskrat and billy mink rolled over and over on the bank laughing until their sides ached even spotty the turtle smiled which is very unusual for spotty  now peter does not like the water and though he can swim he doesnt feel at all at home in it he paddled for the shore as fast as he could and in his heart was something very like anger no one likes to be laughed at peter intended to start for home the very minute he reached the shore but just before his feet touched bottom he heard the great deep voice of grandfather frog  that is just the way lightfoot the deer learned to jumptrying to do what he couldnt do and keeping at it until he could it all happened a great while ago when the world was young grandfather frog was talking quite as if nothing had happened and he had never thought of laughing peter was so put out that he wanted to keep right on but he just couldnt miss that story his curiosity wouldnt let him so he shook himself and then lay down in the sunniest spot he could find within hearing  lightfoots greatgreateversogreatgrandfather was named lightfoot too and was not a whit less handsome than lightfoot is now continued grandfather frog in his best storytelling voice he had just such slim legs as lightfoot has now and just such wonderful branching horns when he had the latter he was not much afraid of anybody those enemies swift enough of foot to catch him he could successfully fight with his horns and those too big and strong for him to fight were not swift enough to catch him but there was a season in every year when he had no horns as is the case with lightfoot you know or ought to know that every spring lightfoot loses his horns and through the summer a new pair grows it was so with mr deer of that longago time and when he lost those great horns he felt very helpless and timid  now old mr deer loved the open meadows and spent most of his time there when he had to run he wanted nothing in the way of his slim legs and how he could run my my my how he could run but there were others who could run swiftly in those days toomr wolf and mr dog mr deer always had a feeling that some day one or the other would catch him when he had his horns this thought didnt worry him much but when he had lost his horns it worried him a great deal he felt perfectly helpless then the thing for me to do is to keep out of sight said he to himself and so instead of going out on the meadows and in the open places he hid among the bushes and in the brush on the edge of the green forest and behind the fallen trees in the green forest  but one thing troubled old mr deer who wasnt old then you know yes sir one thing troubled him a great deal he couldnt run fast at all among the bushes and the fallen trees and the old logs this was a new worry and it troubled him almost as much as the old worry he felt that he was in a dreadful fix you see hard times had come and the big and strong were preying on the weak and small in order to live  if i stay out on the meadows i cannot fight if i am caught and if i stay here i cannot run fast if i am found by my enemies oh dear oh dear what shall i do cried mr deer as he lay hidden among the branches of a fallen hemlocktree  just at that very minute along came mr hare the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of your cousin jumper a big log was in his path and he jumped over it as lightly as a feather mr deer watched him and sighed if only he could jump like that in proportion to his size he would just jump over the bushes and the fallen logs and the fallen trees instead of trying to run around them or squeeze between them right then he had an idea why shouldnt he learn to jump he could try anyway so when he was sure that no one was around to see him he practised jumping over little low bushes at first he couldnt do much but he kept trying and trying and little by little he jumped higher it was hard work and he scraped his slim legs many times when he tried to jump over old logs and stumps  now all this time some one had been watching him though he didnt know it it was old mother nature one day she stopped him as he was trotting along a path what is this you are doing when you think no one is watching she demanded looking very cross havent i given you beauty and speed and yet you are not satisfied mr deer hung his head then suddenly he threw it up proudly and told old mother nature that he had not complained but that through his own efforts he was just trying to add to the blessings which he did have and he explained why he wanted to learn to jump old mother nature heard him through let me see you jump over that bush she snapped crossly pointing to a bush almost as high as mr deer himself  oh i cant jump nearly as high as that he cried then tossing his head proudly he added but ill try so just as peter rabbit tried to jump the laughing brook when he felt sure that he couldnt mr deer tried to jump the bush just imagine how surprised he was when he sailed over it without even touching the top of it with his hoofs old mother nature had given him the gift of jumping as a reward for his perseverance and because she saw that he really had need of it  so ever since that longago day the deer have lived where the brush is thickest and the green forest most tangled because they are such great jumpers that they can travel faster there than their enemies and they are no longer so swift of foot in the open meadows now peter lets see you jump over the laughing brook  what do you think peter did why he tried again and laughed just as hard as the others when once more he landed in the water with a great splash                                      viii                   how mr flying squirrel almost got wings                                      viii                   how mr flying squirrel almost got wings   jimmy skunk and peter rabbit were having a dispute it was a goodnatured dispute but both jimmy and peter are very decided in their opinions and neither would give in to the other finally they decided that as neither could convince the other they should leave it for grandfather frog to decide which was right so they straightway started for the smiling pool where on his big green lilypad grandfather frog was enjoying the twilight and leading the great frog chorus both agreed that they would accept grandfather frogs decision you see each was sure that he was right  when they reached the smiling pool they found grandfather frog looking very comfortable and old and wise good evening grandfather frog i hope you are feeling just as fine as you look said jimmy skunk who never forgets to be polite  chugarum im feeling very well thank you replied grandfather frog what brings you to the smiling pool this fine evening he looked very hard at peter rabbit for he suspected that peter had come for a story  to get the wisest person of whom we know to decide a matter on which peter and i cannot agree and who is there so wise as grandfather frog replied jimmy  grandfather frog looked immensely pleased it always pleases him to be considered wise chugarum said he gruffly you have a very smooth tongue jimmy skunk but what is this matter on which you cannot agree  how many animals can fly returned jimmy by way of answer  one replied grandfather frog i thought everybody knew that flitter the bat is the only animal who can fly  you forget timmy the flying squirrel cried peter excitedly that makes two  grandfather frog shook his head peter peter whatever is the matter with those eyes of yours he exclaimed they certainly are big enough i wonder if you ever will learn to use them halfseeing is sometimes worse than not seeing at all timmy cannot fly any more than i can  what did i tell you cried jimmy skunk triumphantly  but ive seen him fly lots of times persisted peter i guess that any one who has envied him as often as i have ought to know  hump grunted grandfather frog i guess thats the trouble there was so much envy that it got into your eyes and you couldnt see straight envy is a bad thing  jimmy skunk chuckled  did you ever see him away from trees continued grandfather frog  no confessed peter  did you ever see him cut circles in the air like flitter the bat  noo replied peter slowly  of course not retorted grandfather frog the reason is because he doesnt fly he hasnt any wings what he does do is to coast on the air hes the greatest jumper and coaster in the green forest  coast on the air exclaimed peter i never heard of such a thing  there are many things you never have heard of replied grandfather frog sit down peter and stop fidgeting and ill tell you a story  the very word story was enough to make peter forget everything else and he promptly sat down with his big eyes fixed on grandfather frog  it happened began grandfather frog that way back in the beginning of things there lived a very timid member of the squirrel family own cousin to mr red squirrel and mr gray squirrel but not at all like them for he was very gentle and very shy perhaps this was partly because he was very small and was not big enough or strong enough to fight his way as the others did in fact this little mr squirrel was so timid that he preferred to stay out of sight during the day when so many were abroad he felt safer in the dusk of evening and so he used to wait until jolly round red mr sun had gone to bed behind the purple hills before he ventured out to hunt for his food then his quarrelsome cousins had gone to bed and there was no one to drive him away when he found a feast of good things  but even at night there was plenty of danger there was mr owl to be watched out for and other night prowlers in fact little mr squirrel didnt feel safe on the ground a minute and so he kept to the trees as much as possible of course when the branches of one tree reached to the branches of another tree it was an easy matter to travel through the treetops but every once in a while there would be open places to cross and many a fright did timid little mr squirrel have as he scampered across these open places he used to sit and watch old mr bat flying about and wish that he had wings then he thought how foolish it was to wish for something he hadnt got and couldnt have  the thing to do said little mr squirrel to himself is to make the most of what i have got now i am a pretty good jumper but if i keep jumping perhaps i can learn to jump better than i do now  so every night mr squirrel used to go off by himself where he was sure no one would see him and practise jumping he would climb an old stump and then jump as far as he could then he would do it all over again ever so many times and after a little he found that he went farther quite a little farther than when he began then one night he made a discovery he found that by spreading his arms and legs out just as far as possible and making himself as flat as he could he could go almost twice as far as he had been able to go before and he landed a great deal easier it was like sliding down on the air it was great fun and pretty soon he was spending all his spare time doing it  one moonlight night old mother nature happened along and sat down on a log to watch him little mr squirrel didnt see her and when at last she asked him what he was doing he was so surprised and confused that he could hardly find his tongue at last he told her that he was trying to learn to jump better that he might better take care of himself the idea pleased old mother nature you know she is always pleased when she finds people trying to help themselves  thats a splendid idea said she ill help you ill make you the greatest jumper in the green forest  then she gave to little mr squirrel something almost but not quite like wings between his fore legs and hind legs on each side she stretched a piece of skin that folded right down against his body when he was walking or running so as to hardly show and wasnt in the way at all  now said she climb that tall tree over yonder clear to the top and then jump with all your might for that tree over there across that open place  it was ten times as far as little mr squirrel ever had jumped before and the tree was so tall that he felt sure that he would break his neck when he struck the ground he was afraid very much afraid but old mother nature had told him to do it he knew that he ought to trust her so he climbed the tall tree it was a frightful distance down to the ground and that other tree was so far away that it was foolish to even think of reaching it  jump commanded old mother nature  little mr squirrel gulped very hard trying to swallow his fear then he jumped with all his might and just as he had taught himself to do spread himself out as flat as he could just imagine how surprised he was and how tickled when he just coasted down on the air clear across the open place and landed as lightly as a feather on the foot of that distant tree you see the skin between his legs when he spread them out had kept him from falling straight down of course if he hadnt jumped with all his might as old mother nature had told him to even though he thought it wouldnt be of any use he wouldnt have reached that other tree  he was so delighted that he wanted to do it right over again but he didnt forget his manners he first thanked old mother nature  she smiled see that you keep out of danger for that is why i have made you the greatest jumper in the green forest said she  little mr squirrel did people who like peter did not use their eyes thought that he could fly and he was called the flying squirrel he was the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of timmy whom you both know  and timmy doesnt really fly at all does he asked jimmy skunk  certainly not he jumps and slides on the air replied grandfather frog  what did i tell you cried jimmy triumphantly to peter  well anyway its next thing to flying i wish i could do it replied peter                                       ix                     how mr weasel was made an outcast                                       ix                     how mr weasel was made an outcast   chatterer the red squirrel peered down from the edge of an old nest built long ago in a big hemlocktree in the green forest and if you could have looked into chatterers eyes you would have seen there a great fear he looked this way he looked that way little by little the fear left him and when at last he saw peter rabbit coming his way he gave a little sigh of relief and ran down the tree peter saw him and headed straight toward him to pass the time of day  peter whispered chatterer as soon as peter was near enough to hear have you seen shadow the weasel  it was peters turn to look frightened and he hastily glanced this way and that way no he replied is he anywhere about here  i saw him pass about five minutes ago but he seemed to be in a hurry and i guess he has gone now returned chatterer still whispering  i hope so my goodness i hope so exclaimed peter still looking this way and that way uneasily  i hate him declared chatterer fiercely  so do i replied peter i guess everybody does it must be dreadful to be hated by everybody i dont believe he has got a single friend in the wide wide world not even among his own relatives i wonder why it is he never tries to make any friends  here comes jimmy skunk lets ask him he ought to know for he is shadows cousin said chatterer  jimmy came ambling up in his usual lazy way for you know he never hurries it seemed to chatterer and peter that he was slower than usual but he got there at last  why is it jimmy skunk that your cousin shadow the weasel never tries to make any friends cried chatterer as soon as jimmy was near enough  ive never asked him but i suppose its because he doesnt want them replied jimmy  but why asked peter  i guess its because he is an outcast replied jimmy  what is an outcast demanded peter  why somebody with whom nobody else will have anything to do stupid replied jimmy i thought everybody knew that  but how did it happen that he became an outcast in the first place persisted peter  hes always been an outcast ever since he was born and i suppose he is used to it declared jimmy his father was an outcast and his grandfather and his greatgrandfathers way back to the days when the world was young  tell us about it do tell us about it begged peter  jimmy smiled goodnaturedly well seeing that i havent anything else to do just now i will perhaps you fellows may learn something from the story said he then he settled himself comfortably with his back to an old stump and began  illustration one day mr rabbit surprised mr weasel making a meal of young mice page 124    when old king bear ruled in the forest long long ago and the greatgreateversogreatgrandfathers of all of us and of everybody else lived in peace and happiness with each other slim trim spry mr weasel lived with the rest he was small just as shadow is now and he looked just the same as shadow does now he was on the best of terms with all his neighbors and no one had a word to say against him in fact he was rather liked and had quite as many friends as anybody but all the time he had a mean disposition he hid it from his neighbors but he had it just the same now mean dispositions are easily hidden when everything is pleasant and there are no worries and that is the way it was then no one suspected any one else of meanness for with plenty to eat and nothing to worry about there was no cause for meanness  with his mean disposition mr weasel was also very crafty being small and moving so swiftly he was hard to keep track of you know how it is with shadownow you see him and now you dont  chatterer and peter nodded they knew that it is because of this that he is called shadow  well continued jimmy it didnt take him long to find that if he were careful he could go where he pleased and no one would be the wiser they say that he used to practise dodging out of sight when he saw any one coming and after a while he got so that he could disappear right under the very noses of his neighbors being so slim he could go where any of his fourfooted neighbors could and it wasnt long before he knew all about every hole and nook and corner anywhere around there were no secrets that he didnt find out and all the time no one suspected him  of course hard times came to mr weasel at last just as to everybody else but they didnt worry him much you see he knew all about the secret hidingplaces in which some of his neighbors had stored away food so when he was hungry all he had to do was to help himself so mr weasel became a thief and still no one suspected him now one bad habit almost always leads to another mr weasel developed a great fondness for eggs our whole family has always had rather a weakness that way  jimmy grinned for he knew that peter and chatterer knew that he himself never could pass a fresh egg when he found it  one day he found a nest in which were four little baby birds instead of the eggs he had been expecting to find there and having a mean disposition he flew into a rage and killed those four little birds yes sir thats what he did he found the taste of young birds very much to his liking and he began to hunt for more then he discovered a nest of young mice and he found these quite as good as young birds then came a great fear upon the littlest people but not once did they suspect mr weasel he was very crafty and went and came among them just as always they suspected only the larger and stronger people of the forest who because food was getting very scarce had begun to hunt the smaller people  but you know wrongdoing is bound to be found out sooner or later one day mr rabbit surprised mr weasel making a meal of young mice and of course he hurried to tell all his neighbors then mr weasel knew that it was no longer of use to pretend that he was what he was not and he boldly joined the bigger animals in hunting the smaller ones it makes most people angry to be caught in wrongdoing and it was just that way with mr weasel he flew into a great rage and vowed that he would kill mr rabbit and when he couldnt catch mr rabbit he hunted others of his neighbors until there was no one not even fierce mr wolf or mr panther or mr lynx of whom the littlest people were in such fear you see they could hide from the big hunters but they couldnt hide from mr weasel because he knew all their hidingplaces and he was so slim and small that wherever they could go he could go  now the big people like mr wolf and mr panther killed only for food that they might live and when they found mr weasel killing more than he could eat they would have nothing to do with him and even threatened to kill him if they caught him so pretty soon mr weasel found that he hadnt a friend in the world this made him more savage than ever and he hunted and killed just for the pleasure of it he took pleasure in the fear which he read in the eyes of his neighbors when they saw him  old mother nature was terribly shocked when she discovered what was going on but she found that she could do nothing with mr weasel he wasnt sorry for what he had done and he wouldnt promise to do better very well said old mother nature from this time on you and your children and your childrens children forever and ever shall be outcasts among the people of the green forest and the green meadows hated by all little and big and it has been so to this day even i am not on speaking terms with shadow although he is my own cousin concluded jimmy skunk  peter rabbit shuddered isnt it dreadful not to have a single friend he exclaimed i would rather have to run for my life twenty times a day than to be hated and feared and without a single friend i wouldnt be an outcast for all the world  theres not the least bit of danger of that for you peter laughed jimmy skunk                                        x                   how the eyes of old mr owl became fixed                                        x                   how the eyes of old mr owl became fixed   blacky the crow had discovered hooty the owl dozing the bright day away in a thick hemlocktree blacky knew that the bright light hurt hootys big eyes and half blinded him this meant that he could have no end of fun teasing hooty and that hooty would have to sit still and take it all because he couldnt see well enough to fly away or to try to catch blacky now if the day had been dark as it sometimes is on cloudy days or if the dusk of evening had been settling over the green meadows and the green forest matters would have been very different blacky would have taken care the very greatest care not to let hooty know that he was anywhere around but as it was here was a splendid chance to spoil hootys sleep and to see him grow very very angry and do it without running any great risk  caw caw caw caw caw yelled blacky at the top of his voice and at once all his relatives came flocking over to join in the fun dear me dear me such a racket as there was then they flew over his head and they settled in the tree all around him all yelling as hard as ever they could everybody within hearing knew what it meant and everybody who dared to hurried over to watch the fun somehow most people seem to take pleasure in seeing some one else made uncomfortable especially if it is some one of whom they stand in fear and who is for the time being helpless  most of the little meadow and forest people are very much afraid of hooty the owl as soon as it begins to grow dark for that is when he can see best and does all his hunting so though it wasnt at all nice of them they enjoyed seeing him tormented by blacky and his relatives but all the time they took the greatest care to keep out of sight themselves peter rabbit was there so was jumper the hare and happy jack the gray squirrel and chatterer the red squirrel and whitefoot the wood mouse and striped chipmunk and a lot more of course sammy jay was there but sammy didnt try to keep out of sight oh my no he joined right in with the crows calling hooty all sorts of bad names and flying about just out of reach in the most impudent way you see he knew just how helpless hooty was  hooty was very very angry he hissed and he snapped his bill and he told his tormentors what he would do to them if he caught them after dark and all the time he kept turning his head with its great round glaring yellow eyes so as not to give his tormentors a chance to pull out any of his feathers as the boldest of them tried to do now hooty can turn his head as no one else can he can turn it so that he looks straight back over his tail so that his head looks as if it were put on the wrong way then he can snap it around in the other direction so quickly that you can hardly see him do it and sometimes it seems as if he turned his head clear around  that interested peter rabbit immensely he couldnt think of anything else he kept trying to do the same thing himself but of course he couldnt he could turn his head sideways but that was all he puzzled over it all the rest of the day and that night when his cousin jumper the hare called at the dear old briarpatch the first thing he did was to ask a question  cousin jumper do you know why it is that hooty the owl can turn his head way around and nobody else can  of course i know replied jumper i thought everybody knew that its because his eyes are fixed in their sockets and he cant turn them so he turns his whole head in order to see in all directions the rest of us can roll our eyes but hooty cant  peter scratched his long left ear with his long right hindfoot a way he has when he is thinking or is puzzled thats funny said he i wonder why his eyes are fixed  because his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather rolled his eyes too much replied jumper yawning he saw too much its a bad thing to see too much  tell me about it please do cousin jumper begged peter  jumper looked up at the moon to see what time of night it was  all right said he settling himself comfortably all the owl family way back to the very beginning have had very big eyes old mr owl had them he could move them just as we can ours and because they were so big and because he could roll them there was very little going on that mr owl didnt see it happened one day that old mother nature took it into her wise old head to put the little people of the green meadows and the green forest to a test she wanted to see just how many of them she could trust to obey her orders so she lined them all up in a row then she made them turn so that their backs were to her  now said she everybody is to keep eyes to the front i am going to be very busy back here for a few minutes but not one of you is to peek i shall know if you do and i shall see to it that you never forget it as long as you live  that sounded as if something dreadful might happen so everybody sat perfectly still looking straight before them some of them felt as if they would die of curiosity to know what old mother nature was doing but for a while no one thought of disobeying old mr rabbit just itched all over with curiosity it seemed to him that he just must turn his head but for once he managed to get the best of his curiosity and stared straight ahead  now mr owl had tremendous great ears just as hooty has today you cant see them because the feathers cover them but they are there just the same  peter nodded he knew all about those wonderful ears and how they heard the teeniest weeniest noise when hooty was flying at night  those big ears continued jumper heard every little sound that old mother nature made and they sounded queer to mr owl if i roll back my eyes without turning my head i believe i can see what she is doing and she wont be any the wiser thought he so he rolled his eyes back and then looked straight ahead again what he had seen made him want to see more he tried it again just imagine how he felt when he found that his eyes wouldnt roll he couldnt move them a bit all he could do was to stare straight ahead it frightened him dreadfully and he kept trying and trying to roll his eyes but they were fixed fast he could see in only one direction the way his head was turned  when at last old mother nature told all the little people that they might look mr owl didnt want to look he didnt want to face old mother nature for he knew perfectly well what had happened to his eyes he knew that old mother nature had seen him roll them back and that as a punishment she had fixed them so that he would always stare straight ahead he didnt say anything he was too ashamed to he flew away home the very first chance he got for a long time after that mr owl never could see behind him at all he could only turn his head part way the same as most folks and he couldnt roll his eyes to see the rest of the way it made him dreadfully nervous and unhappy he felt all the time as if people were doing things behind his back but he didnt complain he was ashamed to do that  old mother nature was watching him all the time after a long long while she decided that he had been punished enough but she didnt want him to forget so she kept his eyes fixed so that they would look straight ahead but she gave him the power to turn his head farther than any one else so that he could look straight behind him without turning his body at all and ever since that time all owls have had fixed eyes but have been able to turn their heads so as to make them look as if they were facing the wrong way  thank you cousin jumper cried peter but there is one thing you forgot to tell what was it that old mother nature was doing when mr owl rolled his eyes to look back  that replied jumper mr owl never told and nobody else knew so i cant tell you                                       xi                 how it happens johnny chuck sleeps all winter                                       xi                 how it happens johnny chuck sleeps all winter   peter rabbit was bothered he was bothered in his mind and when peter is bothered in his mind he loses his appetite it was so now he had been up in the old orchard and as is his way had stopped at johnny chucks for a bit of gossip as he sat there talking it suddenly came over him that johnny was looking unusually fat he said so johnny yawned in a very sleepy way as he replied  one has to get fat in order to sleep comfortably all winter ive got to get fatter than i am now before i turn in and with that johnny chuck fell to eating as if his sides were falling in instead of threatening to burst and peter could get no more from him  so he went home to think it over and the more he thought the more troubled he became how could anybody sleep all winter and what good did just getting fat do johnny chuck couldnt eat his own fat so what was the use of it must be its to keep him warm thought peter and brightened up but why wasnt a good thick coat of fur just as good or even better he didnt have any trouble keeping warm neither did billy mink or little joe otter or reddy fox no it couldnt be that johnny chuck put on all that fat just to keep warm besides he would spend the winter way down deep in the ground and there was no excuse for being cold there  i couldnt sleep all winter if i wanted to and i wouldnt if i could for there is too much fun to miss muttered peter as he started for the smiling pool in search of grandfather frog he found him sitting on his big lilypad but somehow grandfather frog didnt look as chipper and smart as usual he certainly is growing old thought peter he isnt as spry as he used to be seems as if he had grown old in the last two or three weeks too bad too bad  aloud peter said why grandfather frog how well you are looking you are enough to make us young fellows envious  grandfather frog looked at peter sharply perhaps he read the truth in peters eyes chugarum said he be honest peter be honest dont try to flatter because it is a bad habit to get into i know how i look i look old and tired now isnt that so  peter looked a little shamefaced he didnt know just what to say so he said nothing and just nodded his head  thats better said grandfather frog gruffly always tell the truth the fact is i am tired i am so tired that im going to sleep for the winter and im going to do it this very day  oh grandfather frog peter had found his tongue please tell me something before you go i can understand how you may want to sleep all winter because you have no nice fur coat to keep you warm but why does johnny chuck do it and how does he do it why doesnt he starve to death  grandfather frog had to smile at the eager curiosity in peters voice i see you are just as full of questions as ever peter said he i suppose i may as well tell you one more story because it will be a long time before you will get another from me johnny chuck sleeps all winter because he is sensible and he is sensible because it runs in the family to be sensible his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather was sensible its a very good thing to have good sound common sense run in the family peter  once more peter nodded his head jerry muskrat who was sitting on the big rock listening winked at peter and peter winked back then he made himself comfortable and prepared not to miss a word of grandfather frogs story  you must know peter that a long time ago when the world was young there was a time when there was no winter began grandfather frog that was before the hard times of which i have told you before everybody had plenty to eat and everybody was on the best of terms with all his neighbors then came the hard times and the beginning of the hard times was the coming of rough brother north wind and jack frost their coming made the first winter it wasnt a very long or a very hard winter but it was long enough and hard enough to make a great deal of discomfort particularly for those little people who lived altogether on tender young green plants yes sir it certainly was hard on them some of them nearly starved to death that first winter short as it was old mr chuck who of course wasnt old then was one of them by the time the tender young green things began to grow again he was just a shadow of what he used to be he was so thin that sometimes he used to listen to see if he couldnt hear his bones rattle inside his skin  of course he couldnt but he was quite sure that when the wind blew it went right through him at last warm weather returned just as it does now every summer and once more there was plenty to eat some of the little people seemed to forget all about the hard times of the cold weather but not mr chuck he had been too cold and too hungry to ever forget of course with plenty to eat he soon grew fat and comfortable again but all the time he kept thinking about the terrible visit of rough brother north wind and jack frost and wondering if they would come again he talked about it with his neighbors but most of them laughed and told him that he was borrowing trouble and that they didnt believe that brother north wind and jack frost ever would come again  so after a while mr chuck kept his thoughts to himself and went about his business as usual but all the time he was turning over and over in his mind the possibility of another period of cold and starvation and trying to think of some way to prepare for it he didnt once think of going to old mother nature and begging her to take care of him for he was very independent was mr chuck and believed that those are best helped who help themselves so he kept studying and studying how he could live through another cold spell if it should come  i havent got as thick a fur coat as mr mink or mr otter or mr squirrel or some others and i cant run around as fast as they can so of course i cant keep as warm said he to himself as he sat taking a sunbath one day i must find some other way of keeping warm now i dont believe the cold can get very deep down in the ground so if i build me a house way down deep in the ground it always will be comfortable anyway it never will be very cold i believe that is a good idea ill try it at once  so without wasting any time mr chuck began to dig he dug and he dug and he dug when his neighbors grew curious and asked questions he smiled goodnaturedly and said that he was trying an experiment when he had made a long hall which went down so deep that he was quite sure that jack frost could not get down there he made a bedroom and put in it a bed of soft grass when it was finished he was so pleased with it that he retired to it every night as soon as the sun went down and didnt come out again until morning  anyway i wont freeze to death said he then he sighed as he remembered how hungry how terribly hungry he had been now if only i can think of some way to get food enough to carry me through ill be all right  at first he thought of storing up food but when he tried that he soon found that the tender green things on which he lived wouldnt keep they shriveled and dried so that he couldnt eat them at all he was still trying to think of some plan when old mother nature sent warning that rough brother north wind and jack frost were coming again mr chucks heart sank he thought of how soon all the tender green things would disappear right then an idea was born in mr chucks head he would eat all he could while he could and then he would go down into his bedroom and sleep just as long as he could  so day after day he spent stuffing himself and his neighbors called him mr greedy but he didnt mind that he kept right on eating and of course he grew fatter and fatter so that at last he was so fat he could hardly get about the days grew cooler and cooler and then mr chuck noticed that because he was so fat he didnt feel the cold as he had before there came a morning at last when mr chuck stuck his nose out to find jack frost waiting to pinch it all the tender green things were black and dead back to his bed scrambled mr chuck and curled up to sleep just as long as he could he made up his mind that he wouldnt worry until he had to he had done his best and that was all he could do  when old mother nature came to see how the little people were faring she missed mr chuck she asked his neighbors what had become of him but no one knew at length she came to his house and looking inside found him fast asleep she saw right away what he had done and how fat he had grown she knew without being told what it all meant and the idea amused her instead of wakening him as she had at first intended to do she touched mr chuck and put him into a deeper sleep saying      you shall sleep mr chuck       through the time of frost and snow      for your courage and your pluck       you shall no discomfort know  and so mr chuck slept on until the tender young green things began once more to grow the cold could not reach him and the fat he had stored under his skin took the place of food when he awoke in the spring he knew nothing of the hard times his neighbors were talking about and ever since then the chuck family has slept through the winter because it is the most comfortable and sensible thing to do i know because i have done the same thing for years goodby peter rabbit no more stories until spring  before peter could say a word there was a splash in the smiling pool and grandfather frog was nowhere to be seen  ii dont see how they do it said peter shaking his head in a puzzled way as he slowly hopped towards the dear old briarpatch                                       xii                     how old mr otter learned to slide                                       xii                     how old mr otter learned to slide   little joe otter was having the jolliest kind of a time little joe otter is a jolly little chap anyway and just now he was extra happy you see he had a brand new slipperyslide yes sir little joe had just built a new slipperyslide down the steepest part of the bank into the smiling pool it was longer and smoother than his old slipperyslide and it seemed to little joe as if he could slide and slide all day long of course he enjoyed it more because he had built it himself he would stretch out full length at the top of the slipperyslide give a kick to start himself shoot down the slipperyslide disappear headfirst with a great splash into the smiling pool and then climb up the bank and do it all over again  peter rabbit and johnny chuck sat watching him from the bank on the other side of the smiling pool right down below them sitting on his big green lilypad was grandfather frog and there was a sparkle in his big goggly eyes and his great mouth was stretched in a broad grin as he watched little joe otter he even let a foolish green fly brush the tip of his nose and didnt snap at it  chugarum exclaimed grandfather frog to no one in particular that reminds me of the days when i was young and the greatest diver in the smiling pool my goodness it makes me feel young just to watch little joe shoot down that slipperyslide if i werent so old id try it myself wheee  with that grandfather frog suddenly jumped it was a great long beautiful jump and with his long hind legs straight out behind him grandfather frog disappeared in the smiling pool so neatly that he made hardly a splash at all only a whole lot of rings on the surface of the water that grew bigger and bigger until they met the rings made by little joe otter and then became all mixed up  half a minute later grandfather frogs head bobbed up out of the water and for the first time he saw johnny chuck and peter rabbit  come on in the waters fine he cried and rolled one big goggly eye up at jolly round bright mr sun and winked it in the most comical way for he knew and he knew that mr sun knew just how johnny chuck and peter rabbit dislike the water  no thanks replied peter but there was a wistful look in his big eyes as he watched little joe otter splash into the smiling pool little joe was having such a good time peter actually was wishing that he did like the water  grandfather frog climbed out on his big green lilypad he settled himself comfortably so as to face johnny chuck and peter and at the same time watch little joe out of the corner of one big goggly eye  chugarum said he as once more little joe splashed into the smiling pool did you ever hear about little joes family secret he asked in his deep gruff voice  no cried peter rabbit do tell us about it i just love secrets there was a great deal of eagerness in peters voice and it made grandfather frog smile  is that the reason you never can keep them he asked  peter looked a wee bit foolish but he kept still and waited patiently after what seemed a long long time grandfather frog cleared his throat two or three times and this is the story he told johnny chuck and peter rabbit  once upon a time when the world was young the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of little joe otter got into a peck of trouble yes sir he certainly did get into a peck of trouble you see it was winter and everything was covered with snow so that food was hard to get most of the little forest and meadow people found little to eat and it took a great deal of hunting to find that little only those who like old mr squirrel had been wise enough to lay up a store of food when there was plenty and two or three others like mr mink and mr otter who could go fishing in the springholes which had not frozen over had full stomachs  now an empty stomach almost always makes a short temper it is hard very hard indeed to be hungry and goodnatured at the same time so as most of the people of the green forest were hungry all the time they were also shorttempered all the time mr otter knew this when any of them came prowling around the springhole where he was fishing he would tease them by letting them see how fat he was sometimes he would bring up a fine fish and eat it right before them without offering to share so much as a mouthful he had done this several times to mr lynx and though mr lynx had begged and begged for just a bite mr otter had refused the teeniest weeniest bit and had even made fun of mr lynx for not being smart enough to get sufficient to eat  now it happened that one fine morning mr otter took it into his head to take a walk in the green forest it was a beautiful morning and mr otter went farther than he intended he was just trying to make up his mind whether to turn back or go just a little farther when he heard stealthy footsteps behind him he looked over his shoulder and what he saw helped him to make up his mind in a hurry there creeping over the frozen snow was mr lynx and the sides of mr lynx were very thin and the eyes of mr lynx looked very hungry and fierce and the claws of mr lynx were very long and strong and cruel looking mr otter made up his mind right away that the cold black water of that open springhole was the only place for him and he started for it without even passing the time of day with mr lynx  now mr otters legs were very short just as little joes are but it was surprising how fast he got over the snow that beautiful morning when he came to the top of a little hill he would slide down because he found that he could go faster that way but in spite of all he could do mr lynx traveled faster coming with great jumps and snarling and spitting with every jump mr otter was almost out of breath when he reached the high bank just above the open springhole it was very steep very steep indeed mr otter threw a hasty glance over his shoulder mr lynx was so near that in one more jump he would catch him there wasnt time to run around to the place where the bank was low mr otter threw himself flat gave a frantic kick with his hind legs shut his eyes and shot down down down the slippery bank so fast that he lost what little breath he had left then he landed with a great splash in the cold black water and was safe for mr lynx was afraid of the water he stopped right on the very edge of the steep bank where he growled and screeched and told mr otter what dreadful things he would do to him if ever he caught him  now in spite of his dreadful fright mr otter had enjoyed that exciting slide down the steep bank he got to thinking about it after mr lynx had slunk away into the green forest and when he was rested and could breathe comfortably again he made up his mind to try it once more so he climbed out where the bank was low and ran around to the steep place and once more slid down into the water it was great fun the greatest fun mr otter ever had had he did it again and again in fact he kept doing it all the rest of that day and he found that the more he slid the smoother and more slippery became the slipperyslide for the water dripped from his brown coat and froze on the slide  after that as long as the snow lasted mr otter spent all his time between eating and sleeping sliding down his slipperyslide he learned just how to hold his legs so that they would not be hurt when gentle sister south wind came in the spring and took away all the snow mr otter hardly knew what to do with himself until one day a bright idea popped into his head and made him laugh aloud why not make a slipperyslide of mud and clay right away he tried it it wasnt as good as the snow slide but by trying and trying he found a way to make it better than at first after that mr otter was perfectly happy for summer and winter he had a slipperyslide he taught his children and they taught their children how to make slipperyslides and ever since that longago day when the world was young the making of slipperyslides has been the family secret of the otters  and its the best secret in the world said little joe otter swimming up behind grandfather frog just then  i wishi wish i had a slipperyslide said peter rabbit wistfully  chugarum said grandfather frog chugarum be content with the blessings you have got peter rabbit be content with the blessings you have got no good comes of wishing for things which it never was meant that you should have it is a bad habit and it makes discontent                                      xiii                how drummer the woodpecker came by his red cap                                      xiii                how drummer the woodpecker came by his red cap   drummer the woodpecker was beating his long roll on a hollow tree in the green forest ratatattattattat ratatattattattat drummer thought it the most beautiful sound in the world after each long roll he would stop and listen for a reply you see sometimes one of his family in another part of the green forest or over in the old orchard would hear him drumming and would hasten to find a hollow tree himself and drum too then they would drum back and forth to each other for the longest time until all the other little people would scold because of the racket and would wish they could stop their ears but it was music real music to drummer and all the members of his family and drummer never was happier than when beating his long roll as he was doing now  ratatattattat ratatattattat suddenly drummer heard a scratching sound inside the hollow tree once more he beat the long roll and the scratching sound grew louder then he heard a voice just a little way above him  do ah hear some one knocking asked the voice  drummer looked up there was unc billy possums sharp little face sticking out of his doorway and unc billy looked very sleepy and very cross and at the same time as if he were trying very hard to be polite and pleasant  hello unc billy is this your house i didnt know it when i began to drum i wasnt knocking i was drumming i just love to drum replied drummer  ah reckons yo do by the noise yo have been making but ah dont like being inside the drum ahm feelin powerful bad in the haid just now brer drummer and ah certnly will take it kindly if yo will find another drum said unc billy holding his head in both hands as if he had a terrible headache  drummer looked disappointed and a little bit hurt but he is one of the bestnatured little people in the green forest and always willing to be obliging  im sorry if i have disturbed you unc billy he replied promptly of course i wont drum here any longer if you dont like it ill look for another hollow tree though i dont believe i can find another as good it is one of the best sounding trees i have ever drummed on its simply beautiful there was a great deal of regret in his voice as if it were the hardest work to give up that tree  ahll tell yo where theres another just as good replied unc billy yo see the top of that ol chestnuttree way down there in the holler well yo try that ahm sure yo will like it  drummer thanked unc billy politely and bobbed his redcapped head as he spread his wings and started in the direction of the big chestnuttree unc billy grinned as he watched him then he slowly and solemnly winked one eye at peter rabbit who had just come along  whats the joke asked peter  ah done just sent brer drummer down to the big chestnuttree to drum unc billy replied winking again  why thats bobby coons house cried peter and then he saw the joke and began to grin too  in a few minutes they heard drummers long roll then again and again the third time it broke off right in the middle and right away a terrible fuss started down at the big chestnuttree they could hear drummers voice and it sounded very angry  ah reckon brer coon was waked up and lost his temper chuckled unc billy its a bad habit to lose ones temper yes sah it certnly is a bad habit ah reckons ah better be turning in fo another nap brer rabbit with that unc billy disappeared still chuckling  hardly was he out of sight when peter saw drummer heading that way and drummer looked very much put out about something he just nodded to peter and flew straight to unc billys tree then he began to drum how he did drum his redcapped head flew back and forth as peter never had seen it fly before ratatattattattat ratatattattat ratatattattattat drummer hardly paused for breath there was too much noise for peter and he kicked up his heels and started for the smiling pool and all the way there he laughed  i hope unc billy is enjoying a good nap he chuckled drummer certainly has turned the joke back on unc billy this time and i guess it serves him right  he was still laughing when he reached the smiling pool grandfather frog watched him until he began to smile too you know laughter is catching ha ha ha ho ho ho laughed peter and held his sides  what is the joke demanded grandfather frog in his deepest voice  when peter could get his breath he told grandfather frog all about the joke on unc billy possum listen said peter at the end of the story they both listened ratatattattattat the long roll of drummer the woodpecker could be heard clear down to the smiling pool and peter and grandfather frog knew by the sound that it still came from unc billys house  chugarum that reminds me said grandfather frog did you ever hear how drummer came by his red cap  no replied peter how did he there was great eagerness in peters voice  well said grandfather frog settling himself in a way that peter knew meant a story of course drummer over there came by his red cap because it was handed down in the family but of course theres a reason  of course said peter quite as if he knew all about it  grandfather frog rolled his great goggly eyes and looked at peter suspiciously but peter looked so innocent and eager that he went on with his story  of course it all happened way back in the days when the world was young  of course said peter  this time grandfather frog took no notice drummers grandfather a thousand times removed was just a plain little black and white bird without the least bit of bright color on him he didnt have any sweeter voice than drummer has today altogether he seemed to his neighbors a noaccount little fellow and they didnt have much to do with him so mr woodpecker lived pretty much alone in fact he lived alone so much that when he found a hollow tree he used to pound on it just to make a noise and keep from being lonesome and that is how he learned to drum you see he hadnt any voice for singing and so he got in the habit of drumming to keep his spirits up  now all the time right down in his heart mr woodpecker envied the birds who had handsome coats he used to wish and wish that he had something bright if it were no more than a pretty necktie but he never said anything about it and no one suspected it but old mother nature and mr woodpecker didnt know that she knew it whenever he got to wishing too much he would try to forget it by hunting for worms that bored into the trees of the green forest and which other birds could not get because they did not have the stout bill and the long tongue mr woodpecker possessed  now it happened that while old mother nature was busy elsewhere a great number of worms settled in the green forest and began to bore into the trees so that after a while many trees grew sickly and then died none of the other little people seemed to notice it or if they did they said it was none of their business and that old mother nature ought to look out for such things they shrugged their shoulders and went on playing and having a good time but mr woodpecker was worried he loved the green forest dearly and he began to fear that if something wasnt done there wouldnt be any green forest he said as much to some of his neighbors but they only laughed at him the more he thought about it the more mr woodpecker worried  something must be done said he to himself yes sir something must be done if old mother nature doesnt come to attend to things pretty soon it will be too late then he made up his mind that he would do what he could from early morning until night he hunted worms and dug them out of the trees he would start at the bottom of a tree and work up going all over it until he was sure that there wasnt another worm left then he would fly to the next tree he pounded with his bill until his neck ached he didnt even take time to drum his neighbors laughed at him at first but he kept right on working working working every hour of the day  at last old mother nature appeared very unexpectedly she went all through the green forest and her sharp eyes saw all that mr woodpecker had done she didnt say a word to him but she called all the little people of the green forest before her and when they were all gathered around she sent for mr woodpecker she made him sit up on a dead limb of a tall chestnuttree where all could see him then she told just what he had done and how he had saved the green forest and how great a debt the other little people owed to him  and now that you may never forget it she concluded i herewith make mr woodpecker the policeman of the trees and this is his reward to be worn by him and his children forever and ever with that she called mr woodpecker down before her and put on his head a beautiful red cap for she knew how in his heart he had longed to wear something bright mr woodpecker thanked old mother nature as best he could and then slipped away where he could be alone with his happiness all the rest of the day the other little people heard him drumming off by himself in the green forest and smiled for they knew that that was the way he was expressing his joy having no voice to sing  and that concluded grandfather frog is how drummer whom you know came by his red cap  isnt it splendid cried peter rabbit and then he and grandfather frog both smiled as they heard a long ratatattattat roll out from the green forest                                       xiv                 how old mr tree toad found out how to climb                                       xiv                 how old mr tree toad found out how to climb   of all the puzzling things over which peter rabbit had sat and thought and wondered until the brains in that funny little head of his were topsyturvy none was more puzzling than the fact that stickytoes the tree toad could climb often peter had watched him climb up the trunk of a tree or jump from one branch to another and then thought of old mr toad own cousin to stickytoes and of grandfather frog another own cousin who couldnt climb at all and wondered how it had all come about that one cousin could climb and be just as much at home in the trees as the birds while the others couldnt climb at all  he had it on his mind one morning when he met old mr toad solemnly hopping down the lone little path right then and there peter resolved to ask old mr toad good morning mr toad said peter politely have you a few minutes to spare  old mr toad hopped into the shade of a big mullein leaf i guess so if it is anything important said he phew hot isnt it i simply cant stand the sun now what is that youve got on your mind peter  peter hesitated a minute for he wasnt at all sure that old mr toad would think the matter sufficiently important for him to spend his time in story telling then he blurted out the whole matter and how he had puzzled and puzzled why stickytoes was able to climb when none of the rest of the toad family could old mr toad chuckled  looking for a story as usual i see said he you ought to go to grandfather frog for this one because stickytoes is really a frog and not a toad but we are all cousins and i dont mind telling you about stickytoes or rather about his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather who was the first of the family ever to climb a tree you see it is all in the family and i am very proud of my family which is one of the very oldest  peter settled himself comfortably and prepared to listen old mr toad snapped up a foolish spider who came too near and then cleared his throat  once on a time he began when old mother nature made the first land and the first trees and plants the toads and the frogs were the first to leave the water to see what dry land was like the toads being bolder than the frogs went all over the new land while the frogs kept within jumping distance of the water just as grandfather frog does to this day there was one frog however who seeing how bravely and boldly the toads went forth to see all that was to be seen in the new land made up his mind that he too would see the great world he was the smallest of the frogs and his friends and relatives warned him not to go saying that he would come to no good end  but he wouldnt listen to their dismal croakings and hurried after the toads being able to make longer jumps than they could he soon caught up with them and they all journeyed on together the toads were so pleased that one of their cousins was brave enough to join them that they made him very welcome and treated him as one of themselves so that they soon got to thinking of him as a toad and not as a frog at all  now the toads soon found that old mother nature was having a hard time to make plants grow because as fast as they came up they were eaten by insects you see she had so many things to attend to in those days when the world was young that she had to leave a great many things to take care of themselves and get along the best they could and it was this way with the plants it was then that the great idea came to my greatgreateversogreatgrandfather and he called all the toads together and proposed that they help old mother nature by catching the bugs and worms that were destroying the plants  little mr frog who had been adopted by the toads was one of the most eager to help and he was busy every minute after a while the toads had caught most of the bugs and worms on the ground and within reach and the plants began to grow but when the plants got above the reach of the toads the bugs and the worms were safe once more and began to multiply so that the plants suffered and stopped growing you see there were no birds in those days to help one day little mr frog sat under a bush on which most of the leaves had been eaten he saw a worm eating a leaf on one of the lower branches it was quite a way above his head it worried him he kept his eyes on that worm and thought and thought until his head ached at last he got an idea i wonder thought he if i jump as hard as i can if i can catch that fellow ill try it it will do no harm to try  so he drew his long legs close under him and then he jumped up with all his might he didnt quite reach the bug but he got his hands on the branch and by pulling and struggling he managed to get up on it it was a very uncertain seat but he hung on and crept along until he could dart his tongue out and catch that worm then he saw another and in trying to catch that one he lost his balance and fell to the ground with a thump it quite knocked the wind from his body  that night little mr frog studied and studied trying to think of some way by which he could get up in the bushes and trees and clear them of bugs and worms if only i could hold on once i get up there i would be all right thought he then i could leave the bugs and worms on the ground for my cousins the toads to look after while i look after those beyond their reach  the next day and the next and for many days thereafter little mr frog kept jumping for bugs on the bushes he got many thumps and bumps but he didnt mind these for little by little he was learning how to hang on to the branches once he got up in them then one day just by accident he put one hand against the trunk of a young pinetree and when he started to take it away he found it stuck fast he had to pull to get it free like a flash an idea popped into his head he rubbed a little of the pitch for that was what had made his hand stick on both hands and then he started to climb a tree as long as the pitch lasted he could climb  little mr frog was tickled to death with his discovery but he didnt say a word to any one about it every day he rubbed pitch on his hands and then climbed about in the bushes and low trees ridding them of bugs and worms of course it wasnt very pleasant to have that pitch on his hands because dirt and all sorts of things which he happened to touch stuck to them but he made the best of a bad matter and washed them carefully when he was through with his days work  quite unexpectedly old mother nature returned to see how the trees and the plants were getting on you see she was worried about them when she found what the toads had been doing she was mightily pleased then she noticed that some of the bushes and low trees had very few leaves left while others looked thrifty and strong  thats queer said old mother nature to herself and went over to examine a bush hanging on to a branch for dear life she saw a queer little fellow who was so busy that he didnt see her at all it was little mr frog he was catching bugs as fast as he could old mother nature wrinkled up her brows now however did he learn to climb thought she then she hid where she could watch by and by she saw little mr frog tumble out of the bush because you know the pitch on his hands had worn off he hurried over to a pinetree and rubbed more pitch on and then jumped up into the bush and went to work again  you can guess how astonished old mother nature was when she saw this performance and she was pleased oh yes indeed old mother nature was wonderfully pleased she was pleased because little mr frog was trying so hard to help her and she was pleased because he had been so smart in finding a way to climb when she had laughed until she could laugh no more at the way little mr frog had managed to stick to his work she took him down very gently and wiped the pitch from his hands then she gently pinched the end of each finger and each toe so that they ended in little round discs instead of being pointed as before and in each little disc was a clean sticky substance then she tossed him up in a tree and when he touched a branch he found that he could hold on without the least danger of falling  i appoint you caretaker of my trees said old mother nature and from that day on little mr frog lived in the trees as did his children and his childrens children even as stickytoes does today and though he was really a frog he was called the tree toad and the toads have always been proud to have him so called and this is the end of the story concluded old mr toad                                       xv                     how old mr heron learned patience                                       xv                     how old mr heron learned patience   whenever in the spring or summer peter rabbit visited the smiling pool or the laughing brook he was pretty sure to run across longlegs the heron the first tune peter saw him he thought that never in all his life had he seen such a homely fellow longlegs was standing with his feet in the water and his head drawn back on his shoulders so that he didnt seem to have any neck at all peter sat and stared at him most impolitely he knew that he was impolite but for the life of him he couldnt help staring  hes all legs thought peter old mother nature must have been in a hurry when she made his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather way back when the world was young and forgot to give him a neck i wonder why he doesnt move  but longlegs didnt move peter stared as long as his patience held out then he gave up and went on to see what else he could find but in a little while peter was back again at the place where he had seen longlegs he didnt really expect to find him there but he did so far as peter could see longlegs hadnt moved must be asleep thought peter and after watching for a few minutes went away again half an hour later peter was once more back there stood longlegs just as before now i know he is asleep muttered peter  no sooner were the words out of his mouth than something happened something so sudden and surprising that peter lost his balance and nearly fell over backward the long bill which peter had seen sticking forth from between those humpedup shoulders darted out and down into the water like a flash behind that bill was the longest neck peter ever had seen it was so long that peter blinked to be perfectly sure that his eyes had not been playing him a trick but they hadnt for longlegs was gulping down a little fish he had just caught and when at last it was down he stretched his neck up very straight while he looked this way and that way and peter just gasped  i thought he was all legs but instead of that hes all neck muttered peter  then longlegs slowly drew his head down and it seemed to peter as if he must somehow wind that long neck up inside his body to get it so completely out of the way in a minute longlegs was standing just as before with seemingly no neck at all peter watched until he grew tired but longlegs didnt move again after that peter went every chance he had to watch longlegs but he never had patience to watch long enough to see longlegs catch another fish he spoke of it one day to grandfather frog at the mere mention of longlegs grandfather frog sat up and took notice  where did you see him asked grandfather frog and peter thought his voice sounded anxious  down the laughing brook replied peter why  oh nothing said grandfather frog trying to make his voice sound as if he werent interested i just wondered where the longlegged nuisance might be  hes the laziest fellow i ever saw declared peter he just stands doing nothing all day  huh exclaimed grandfather frog if your family had suffered from him as much as mine has you would say that he was altogether too busy ask the trout what they think or the minnow family  oh said peter you mean that when he stands still that way he is fishing  grandfather frog nodded  well said peter all i can say is that he is the most patient fellow i ever saw i didnt suppose there was such patience  he comes rightly by it returned grandfather frog he gets it from his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather who lived when the world was young he learned it then  how demanded peter eager for a story  grandfather frogs eyes took on a faraway look as if he were seeing into that longago past chugarum he began it always seemed to old mr heron as if old mother nature must have made him last of all the birds and was in such a hurry that she didnt care how he looked his legs were so long and his neck was so long that all his neighbors laughed at him and made fun of him he was just as awkward as he looked his long legs were in his way he didnt know what to do with his long neck when he tried to run everybody shouted with laughter when he tried to fly he stretched his long neck out and then he couldnt keep his balance and just flopped about while all his neighbors laughed harder than ever poor mr heron was ashamed of himself actually ashamed of himself he quite overlooked the fact that old mother nature had given him a really beautiful coat of feathers some of those who laughed at him would have given anything to have possessed such a beautiful coat but mr heron didnt know this he couldnt bear to be laughed at wherein he was very like most people  so he tried his best to keep out of sight as much as possible now in those days as at present the rushes grew tall beside the smiling pool and among them mr heron found a hidingplace because his legs were long he could wade out in the water and keep quite out of sight of those who lived on the land so he found a use for his long legs and was glad that they were long at first he used to go ashore to hunt for food one day as he was wading ashore he surprised a school of little fish and managed to catch one it tasted so good that he wanted more and every day he went fishing whenever he saw little fish swimming where the water was shallow he would rush in among them and do his best to catch one sometimes he did but more often he didnt you see he was so clumsy and awkward that he made a great splashing and the fish would hear him coming and get away  one day after he had tried and tried without catching even one he stopped just at the edge of the rushes to rest his long neck ached and to rest it he laid it back on his shoulders for a long time he stood there resting the water around his feet was cool and comforting he was very comfortable but for one thinghe was hungry he was just making up his mind to go on and hunt for something to eat when he saw a school of little fish swimming straight towards him perhaps thought he if i keep perfectly still they will come near enough for me to catch one so he kept perfectly still he didnt dare even stretch his long neck up sure enough the little fish swam almost to his very feet they didnt see him at all when they were near enough he darted his long neck forward and caught one without any trouble at all mr heron was almost as surprised as the fish he had caught you see he discovered that with his neck laid back on his shoulders that way he could dart his head forward ever so much quicker than when he was holding it up straight it really was a great discovery for mr heron  of course all the other fish darted away in great fright but mr heron didnt mind he settled himself in great contentment for now he was less hungry by and by some foolish tadpoles came wriggling along ill just try catching one of them for practice maybe they are good to eat thought mr heron and just as before darted his head and great bill downward and caught a tadpole  umm they are good exclaimed mr heron and once more settled himself to watch and wait  that was a sad day for the frog family but a great day for mr heron when he discovered that tadpoles were good to eat grandfather frog sighed mournfully yes he continued that was a great day for mr heron he had discovered that he could gain more by patient waiting than by frantic hunting and he had found that his long neck really was a blessing after that whenever he was hungry he would stand perfectly still beside some little pool where foolish young fish or careless tadpoles were at play and wait patiently until they came within reach  one day he was startled into an attempt to fly by hearing the stealthy footsteps of mr fox behind him his head was drawn back on his shoulders at the time and he was so excited that he forgot to straighten it out just imagine how surprised he was and how surprised mr fox was when he sailed away in beautiful flight his long legs trailing behind him with his neck carried that way he could fly as well as any one from that day on no one laughed at mr heron because of his long legs and long neck mr heron himself became proud of them you see he had learned how to use what he had been given also he had learned the value of patience so he was happy and envied no one but he still liked best to keep by himself and became known as the lone fisherman just as longlegs is today chugarum isnt that longlegs coming this way this very minute this is no place for me  with a great splash grandfather frog dived into the smiling pool  illustration his legs were so long and his neck was so long that all his neighbors laughed at him page 210                                       xvi             how tufty the lynx happens to have a stump of a tail                                       xvi             how tufty the lynx happens to have a stump of a tail   in all his life peter rabbit had seen tufty the lynx but once but that once was enough tufty you know lives in the great woods but once when the winter was very cold he had ventured down into the green forest hoping that it would be easier to get a living there it was then that peter had seen him in fact peter had had the narrowest of escapes and the very memory of it made him shiver he never would forget that great gray skulking form that slipped like a shadow through the trees that fierce bearded face those cruel pale yellowgreen eyes or that switching stump of a tail  that tail fascinated peter it was just an apology for a tail for tuftys size it was hardly as much of a tail as peter himself has it made peter feel a lot better also it made him very curious the first chance he got he asked his cousin jumper the hare about it you know jumper used to live in the great woods where tufty lives and peter felt sure that he must know the reason why tufty has such a ridiculous stub of a tail jumper did know and this is the story he told peter  way back in the beginning of things lived old mr lynx  i know interrupted peter he was the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of tufty and he wasnt old then  whos telling this story demanded jumper crossly if you know it why did you ask me  i beg your pardon indeed i do i wont say another word replied peter hastily  all right see that you dont interruptions always spoil a story said jumper you are quite right about old mr lynx he wasnt old then no one was old because it was in the beginning of things at that time mr lynx boasted a long tail quite as fine a tail as his cousin mr panther he was very proud of it you know there is a saying that pride goes before a fall it was so with mr lynx he boasted about his tail he said that it was the finest tail in the world he said so much that his neighbors got tired of hearing about it he made a perfect nuisance of himself he switched and waved his long tail about continually it seemed as if that tail were never still he made fun of those whose tails were shorter or of different shape or less handsome he quite forgot that that tail had been given him by old mother nature but talked and acted as if he had grown that tail himself  when at last his neighbors could stand it no longer they decided to teach him a lesson one day while he was off hunting they held a meeting and it was decided that the very next time that mr lynx boasted of his tail old king bear should slip up behind him and step on it as close to his body as he could and then each of the others should pull a little tuft of hair from it so that it would be a long time before mr lynx would be able to boast of its beauty again  the chance came that very evening mr lynx had had a very successful day and he was feeling very fine he began to boast of what a great hunter he was and of how very clever and very smart he was and then as usual he got to boasting about his tail he was so intent on his boasting that he didnt notice old king bear slipping around behind him old king bear waited until that long tail was still for just an instant and then he stepped on it as close to the roots of it as he could then all the other little people shouted with glee and began to pull little tufts of hair from it until it was the most disreputablelooking tail ever seen  old mr lynx let out a yowl and a screech that was enough to make your blood run cold but he couldnt do a thing though he tore the ground up with his great claws and pulled with all his might you see old king bear was very big and very heavy and mr lynx couldnt budge his tail a bit and he couldnt turn to fight old king bear though it seemed as if he would turn himself inside out trying to  at last when old king bear thought he had been punished enough he gave the word to the others and they all scattered to safe hidingplaces for they were of no mind to be within reach of those great claws of mr lynx then old king bear let him go  by the looks of it i hardly think that you will boast of that tail for a long time to come mr lynx said he in his deep rumblygrumbly voice  mr lynx turned and screamed in old king bears face but that was all he dared do for you know old king bear was very big and strong then he turned and slunk away in the shadows by himself now mr lynx had a terrible temper and when he saw how ragged and disreputable his once beautiful tail looked he flew into a terrible rage and he swore that no one should laugh at his tail what do you think he did  what asked peter eagerly  he bit it off replied jumper slowly yes sir he bit it off right at the place where old king bear had stepped on it of course he was sorry the minute he had done it but it was done and that was all there was to it after that he kept out of sight of all his neighbors he prowled around mostly at night and was very stealthy and softfooted always keeping in the shadows his temper grew worse and worse from brooding over his lost tail when any one chanced to surprise him he would switch his stub of a tail just as he used to switch his long tail you see he would forget then when he was laughed at by those bigger than he he would scream angrily and slink away like a great gray shadow  once he besought old mother nature to give him a new tail but in vain she gave him a lecture which he never forgot she told him that it was no ones fault but his own that he had lost the beautiful tail that he did have and had nothing but a stub left mr lynx crawled on his stomach to the feet of old mother nature and begged with tears in his eyes old mother nature looked him straight in the eyes but he couldnt look straight back he tried but he couldnt do it he would shift his eyes from side to side  look me straight in the face mr lynx and tell me that if i give you a handsome new tail you will never boast about it or take undue pride in it said she  mr lynx looked her straight in the face and said i then his eyes shifted he brought them back to old mother natures face with a jerk and began again i promise once more his eyes shifted then he gave up and sneaked away into the darkest shadows he could find you see he couldnt look old mother nature in the face and tell a lie and that was just what he had been trying to do the only reason he wanted a new tail was so that he could be proud of it and boast of it as he had of the old one he hadnt a single real use for it as he had found out since he had had only that stub  old mother nature knew this perfectly well for you cant fool her and its of no use to try so mr lynx never did get a new tail he continued to live very much by himself in the darkest parts of the green forest never showing himself to others if he could help it to the little people he was like a fearsome shadow to be watched out for at all times his children were just like him and his childrens children tufty is the same way no one likes him all who are smaller than he fear him and if he knows why he has only a stub of a tail he never mentions it but you will notice that he switches it just as if it were a real tail i think he likes to imagine that it is a real one  ive noticed replied peter he was silent for a few minutes then he added isnt it curious how often we want things we dont need at all and how those are the things that make us the most trouble in this world                                   the end
