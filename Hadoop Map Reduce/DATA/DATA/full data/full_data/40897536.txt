40897536	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle      frederick the great     book i  birth and parentage  1712     chapter i  proem friedrichs history from the distance we are at  about fourscore years ago there used to be seen sauntering on the terraces of sans souci for a short time in the afternoon or you might have met him elsewhere at an earlier hour riding or driving in a rapid business manner on the open roads or through the scraggy woods and avenues of that intricate amphibious potsdam region a highly interesting lean little old man of alert though slightly stooping figure whose name among strangers was king friedrich the second or frederick the great of prussia and at home among the common people who much loved and esteemed him was vater fritzfather freda name of familiarity which had not bred contempt in that instance he is a king every inch of him though without the trappings of a king presents himself in a spartan simplicity of vesture no crown but an old military cockedhatgenerally old or trampled and kneaded into absolute softness if newno sceptre but one like agamemnons a walkingstick cut from the woods which serves also as a ridingstick with which he hits the horse between the ears say authorsand for royal robes a mere soldiers blue coat with red facings coat likely to be old and sure to have a good deal of spanish snuff on the breast of it rest of the apparel dim unobtrusive in color or out ending in high overknee military boots which may be brushed and i hope kept soft with an underhand suspicion of oil but are not permitted to be blackened or varnished day and martin with their sootpots forbidden to approach  the man is not of godlike physiognomy any more than of imposing stature or costume closeshut mouth with thin lips prominent jaws and nose receding brow by no means of olympian height head however is of long form and has superlative gray eyes in it not what is called a beautiful man nor yet by all appearance what is called a happy on the contrary the face bears evidence of many sorrows as they are termed of much hard labor done in this world and seems to anticipate nothing but more still coming quiet stoicism capable enough of what joy there were but not expecting any worth mention great unconscious and some conscious pride well tempered with a cheery mockery of humorare written on that old face which carries its chin well forward in spite of the slight stoop about the neck snuffy nose rather flung into the air under its old cockedhatlike an old snuffy lion on the watch and such a pair of eyes as no man or lion or lynx of that century bore elsewhere according to all the testimony we have those eyes says mirabeau which at the bidding of his great soul fascinated you with seduction or with terror portaient au gre de son ame heroique la seduction ou la terreur mirabeau histoire secrete de la cour de berlin lettre 28 24 september 1786 p 128 in edition of paris 1821 most excellent potent brilliant eyes swiftdarting as the stars steadfast as the sun gray we said of the azuregray color large enough not of glaring size the habitual expression of them vigilance and penetrating sense rapidity resting on depth which is an excellent combination and gives us the notion of a lambent outer radiance springing from some great inner sea of light and fire in the man the voice if he speak to you is of similar physiognomy clear melodious and sonorous all tones are in it from that of ingenuous inquiry graceful sociality lightflowing banter rather prickly for most part up to definite word of command up to desolating word of rebuke and reprobation a voice the clearest and most agreeable in conversation i ever heard says witty dr moore moore view of society and manners in france switzerland and germany london 1779 ii 246 he speaks a great deal continues the doctor yet those who hear him regret that he does not speak a good deal more his observations are always lively very often just and few men possess the talent of repartee in greater perfection  just about threescore and ten years ago ad 185617th august 1786 his speakings and his workings came to finis in this world of time and he vanished from all eyes into other worlds leaving much inquiry about him in the minds of menwhich as my readers and i may feel too well is yet by no means satisfied as to his speech indeed though it had the worth just ascribed to it and more and though masses of it were deliberately put on paper by himself in prose and verse and continue to be printed and kept legible what he spoke has pretty much vanished into the inane and except as record or document of what he did hardly now concerns mankind but the things he did were extremely remarkable and cannot be forgotten by mankind indeed they bear such fruit to the present hour as all the newspapers are obliged to be taking note of sometimes to an unpleasant degree editors vaguely account this man the creator of the prussian monarchy which has since grown so large in the world and troublesome to the editorial mind in this and other countries he was indeed the first who in a highly public manner notified its creation announced to all men that it was in very deed created standing on its feet there and would go a great way on the impulse it had got from him and others as it has accordingly done and may still keep doing to lengths little dreamt of by the british editor in our time whose prophesyings upon prussia and insights into prussia in its past or present or future are truly as yet inconsiderable in proportion to the noise he makes with them the more is the pity for himand for myself too in the enterprise now on hand  it is of this figure whom we see by the minds eye in those potsdam regions visible for the last time seventy years ago that we are now to treat in the way of solacing ingenuous human curiosity we are to try for some historical conception of this man and king some answer to the questions what was he then whence how and what did he achieve and suffer in the worldsuch answer as may prove admissible to ingenuous mankind especially such as may correspond to the fact which stands there abstruse indeed but actual and unalterable and so be sure of admissibility one day  an enterprise which turns out to be the longer one looks at it the more of a formidable not to say unmanageable nature concerning which on one or two points it were good if conveniently possible to come to some preliminary understanding with the reader here flying on loose leaves are certain incidental utterances of various date these as the topic is difficult i will merely label and insert instead of a formal discourse which were too apt to slide into something of a lamentation or otherwise take an unpleasant turn     1 friedrich then and friedrich now  this was a man of infinite mark to his contemporaries who had witnessed surprising feats from him in the world very questionable notions and ways which he had contrived to maintain against the world and its criticisms as an original man has always to do much more an original ruler of men the world in fact had tried hard to put him down as it does unconsciously or consciously with all such and after the most conscious exertions and at one time a deadlift spasm of all its energies for seven years had not been able principalities and powers imperial royal czarish papal enemies innumerable as the seasand had risen against him only one helper left among the worlds potentates and that one only while there should be help rendered in return and he led them all such a dance as had astonished mankind and them  no wonder they thought him worthy of notice every original man of any magnitude isnay in the longrun who or what else is but how much more if your original man was a king over men whose movements were polar and carried from day to day those of the world along with them the samson agonisteswere his life passed like that of samuel johnson in dirty garrets and the produce of it only some bits of written paperthe agonistes and how he will comport himself in the philistine mill this is always a spectacle of truly epic and tragic nature the rather if your samson royal or other is not yet blinded or subdued to the wheel much more if he vanquish his enemies not by suicidal methods but march out at last flourishing his miraculous fighting implement and leaving their mill and them in quite ruinous circumstances as this king friedrich fairly managed to do  for he left the world all bankrupt we may say fallen into bottomless abysses of destruction he still in a paying condition and with footing capable to carry his affairs and him when he died in 1786 the enormous phenomenon since called french revolution was already growling audibly in the depths of the world meteoricelectric coruscations heralding it all round the horizon strange enough to note one of friedrichs last visitors was gabriel honore riquetti comte de mirabeau these two saw one another twice for half an hour each time the last of the old gods and the first of the modern titansbefore pelion leapt on ossa and the foul earth taking fire at last its vile mephitic elements went up in volcanic thunder this also is one of the peculiarities of friedrich that he is hitherto the last of the kings that he ushers in the french revolution and closes an epoch of worldhistory finishing off forever the trade of king think many who have grown profoundly dark as to kingship and him  the french revolution may be said to have for about half a century quite submerged friedrich abolished him from the memories of men and now on coming to light again he is found defaced under strange mudincrustations and the eyes of mankind look at him from a singularly changed what we must call oblique and perverse point of vision this is one of the difficulties in dealing with his historyespecially if you happen to believe both in the french revolution and in him that is to say both that real kingship is eternally indispensable and also that the destruction of sham kingship a frightful process is occasionally so on the breakingout of that formidable explosion and suicide of his century friedrich sank into comparative obscurity eclipsed amid the ruins of that universal earthquake the very dust of which darkened all the air and made of day a disastrous midnight black midnight broken only by the blaze of conflagrationswherein to our terrified imaginations were seen not men french and other but ghastly portents stalking wrathful and shapes of avenging gods it must be owned the figure of napoleon was titanic especially to the generation that looked on him and that waited shuddering to be devoured by him in general in that french revolution all was on a huge scale if not greater than anything in human experience at least more grandiose all was recorded in bulletins too addressed to the shillinggallery and there were fellows on the stage with such a breadth of sabre extent of whiskerage strength of windpipe and command of men and gunpowder as had never been seen before how they bellowed stalked and flourished about counterfeiting joves thunder to an amazing degree terrific drawcansir figures of enormous whiskerage unlimited command of gunpowder not without sufficient ferocity and even a certain heroism stageheroism in them compared with whom to the shillinggallery and frightened excited theatre at large it seemed as if there had been no generals or sovereigns before as if friedrich gustavus cromwell william conqueror and alexander the great were not worth speaking of henceforth  all this however in half a century is considerably altered the drawcansir equipments getting gradually torn off the natural size is seen better translated from the bulletin style into that of fact and history miracles even to the shillinggallery are not so miraculous it begins to be apparent that there lived great men before the era of bulletins and agamemnon austerlitz and wagram shot away more gunpowdergunpowder probably in the proportion of ten to one or a hundred to one but neither of them was tenthpart such a beating to your enemy as that of rossbach brought about by strategic art human ingenuity and intrepidity and the loss of 165 men leuthen too the battle of leuthen though so few english readers ever heard of it may very well hold up its head beside any victory gained by napoleon or another for the odds were not far from three to one the soldiers were of not far from equal quality and only the general was consummately superior and the defeat a destruction napoleon did indeed by immense expenditure of men and gunpowder overrun europe for a time but napoleon never by husbanding and wisely expending his men and gunpowder defended a little prussia against all europe year after year for seven years long till europe had enough and gave up the enterprise as one it could not manage so soon as the drawcansir equipments are well torn off and the shillinggallery got to silence it will be found that there were great kings before napoleonand likewise an art of war grounded on veracity and human courage and insight not upon drawcansir rodomontade grandiose dickturpinism revolutionary madness and unlimited expenditure of men and gunpowder you may paint with a very big brush and yet not be a great painter says a satirical friend of mine this is becoming more and more apparent as the dustwhirlwind and huge uproar of the last generation gradually dies away again     2 eighteenth century  one of the grand difficulties in a history of friedrich is all along this same that he lived in a century which has no history and can have little or none a century so opulent in accumulated falsitiessad opulence descending on it by inheritance always at compound interest and always largely increased by fresh acquirement on such immensity of standing capitalopulent in that bad way as never century before was which had no longer the consciousness of being false so false had it grown and was so steeped in falsity and impregnated with it to the very bone thatin fact the measure of the thing was full and a french revolution had to end it to maintain much veracity in such an element especially for a king was no doubt doubly remarkable but now how extricate the man from his century how show the man who is a reality worthy of being seen and yet keep his century as a hypocrisy worthy of being hidden and forgotten in the due abeyance  to resuscitate the eighteenth century or call into mens view beyond what is necessary the poor and sordid personages and transactions of an epoch so related to us can be no purpose of mine on this occasion the eighteenth century it is well known does not figure to me as a lovely one needing to be kept in mind or spoken of unnecessarily to me the eighteenth century has nothing grand in it except that grand universal suicide named french revolution by which it terminated its otherwise most worthless existence with at least one worthy actsetting fire to its old home and self and going up in flames and volcanic explosions in a truly memorable and important manner a very fit termination as i thankfully feel for such a century century spendthrift fraudulentbankrupt gone at length utterly insolvent without real money of performance in its pocket and the shops declining to take hypocrisies and speciosities any fartherwhat could the poor century do but at length admit well it is so i am a swindlercentury and have long beenhaving learned the trick of it from my father and grandfather knowing hardly any trade but that in false bills which i thought foolishly might last forever and still bring at least beef and pudding to the favored of mankind and behold it ends and i am a detected swindler and have nothing even to eat what remains but that i blow my brains out and do at length one true action which the poor century did many thanks to it in the circumstances  for there was need once more of a divine revelation to the torpid frivolous children of men if they were not to sink altogether into the ape condition and in that whirlwind of the universelights obliterated and the torn wrecks of earth and hell hurled aloft into the empyrean black whirlwind which made even apes serious and drove most of them madthere was to men a voice audible voice from the heart of things once more as if to say lying is not permitted in this universe the wages of lying you behold are death lying means damnation in this universe and beelzebub never so elaborately decked in crowns and mitres is not god this was a revelation truly to be named of the eternal in our poor eighteenth century and has greatly altered the complexion of said century to the historian ever since  whereby in short that century is quite confiscate fallen bankrupt given up to the auctioneersjewbrokers sorting out of it at this moment in a confused distressing manner what is still valuable or salable and in fact it lies massed up in our minds as a disastrous wrecked inanity not useful to dwell upon a kind of dusky chaotic background on which the figures that had some veracity in thema small company and ever growing smaller as our demands rise in strictnessare delineated for usand yet it is the century of our own grandfathers cries the reader yes reader truly it is the ground out of which we ourselves have sprung whereon now we have our immediate footing and first of all strike down our roots for nourishmentand alas in large sections of the practical world it what we specially mean by it still continues flourishing all round us to forget it quite is not yet possible nor would be profitable what to do with it and its forgotten fooleries and histories worthy only of forgettingwell so much of it as by nature adheres what of it cannot be disengaged from our hero and his operations approximately so much and no more let that be our bargain in regard to it     3 english prepossessions  with such wagonloads of books and printed records as exist on the subject of friedrich it has always seemed possible even for a stranger to acquire some real understanding of himthough practically here and now i have to own it proves difficult beyond conception alas the books are not cosmic they are chaotic and turn out unexpectedly void of instruction to us small use in a talent of writing if there be not first of all the talent of discerning of loyally recognizing of discriminating what is to be written books born mostly of chaoswhich want all things even an indexare a painful object in sorrow and disgust you wander over those multitudinous books you dwell in endless regions of the superficial of the nugatory to your bewildered sense it is as if no insight into the real heart of friedrich and his affairs were anywhere to be had truth is the prussian dryasdust otherwise an honest fellow and not afraid of labor excels all other dryasdusts yet known i have often sorrowfully felt as if there were not in nature for darkness dreariness immethodic platitude anything comparable to him he writes big books wanting in almost every quality and does not even give an index to them he has made of friedrichs history a widespread inorganic trackless matter dismal to your mind and barren as a continent of brandenburg sandenough he could do no other i have striven to forgive him let the reader now forgive me and think sometimes what probably my rawmaterial was  curious enough friedrich lived in the writing eramorning of that strange era which has grown to such a noon for usand his favorite society all his reign was with the literary or writing sort nor have they failed to write about him they among the others about him and about him and it is notable how little real light on any point of his existence or environment they have managed to communicate dim indeed for most part a mere epigrammatic sputter of darkness visible is the picture they have fashioned to themselves of friedrich and his country and his century men not of genius apparently alas no men fatally destitute of true eyesight and of loyal heart first of all so far as i have noticed there was not with the single exception of mirabeau for one hour any man to be called of genius or with an adequate power of human discernment that ever personally looked on friedrich had many such men looked successively on his history and him we had not found it now in such a condition still altogether chaotic as a history fatally destitute even of the indexes and mechanical appliances friedrichs self and his country and his century still undeciphered very dark phenomena all three to the intelligent part of mankind  in prussia there has long been a certain stubborn though planless diligence in digging for the outward details of friedrichs lifehistory though as to organizing them assorting them or even putting labels on them much more as to the least interpretation or human delineation of the man and his affairsyou need not inquire in prussia in france in england it is still worse there an immense ignorance prevails even as to the outward facts and phenomena of friedrichs life and instead of the prussian nointerpretation you find in these vacant circumstances a great promptitude to interpret whereby judgments and prepossessions exist among us on that subject especially on friedrichs character which are very ignorant indeed  to englishmen the sources of knowledge or conviction about friedrich i have observed are mainly these two first for his public character it was an allimportant fact not to it but to this country in regard to it that george ii seeing good to plunge headforemost into german politics and to take maria theresas side in the austriansuccession war of 17401748 needed to begin by assuring his parliament and newspapers profoundly dark on the matter that friedrich was a robber and villain for taking the other side which assurance resting on what basis we shall see by and by georges parliament and newspapers cheerfully accepted nothing doubting and they have reechoed and reverberated it they and the rest of us ever since to all lengths down to the present day as a fact quite agreed upon and the preliminary item in friedrichs character robber and villain to begin with that was one settled point  afterwards when george and friedrich came to be allies and the grand fightings of the sevenyears war took place georges parliament and newspapers settled a second point in regard to friedrich one of the greatest soldiers ever born this second item the british writer fully admits ever since but he still adds to it the quality of robber in a loose wayand images to himself a royal dick turpin of the kind known in reviewarticles and disquisitions on progress of the species and labels it frederick very anxious to collect new babblement of lying anecdotes false criticisms hungry french memoirs which will confirm him in that impossible idea had such proved on survey to be the character of friedrich there is one british writer whose curiosity concerning him would pretty soon have died away nor could any amount of unwise desire to satisfy that feeling in fellowcreatures less seriously disposed have sustained him alive in those baleful historic acherons and stygian fens where he has had to dig and to fish so long far away from the upper lightlet me request all readers to blow that sorry chaff entirely out of their minds and to believe nothing on the subject except what they get some evidence for  second english source relates to the private character friedrichs biography or private character the english like the french have gathered chiefly from a scandalous libel by voltaire which used to be called  vie privee du roi de prusse  private life of the king of prussia first printed from a stolen copy at geneva 1784 first proved to be voltaires which some of his admirers had striven to doubt paris 1788 stands avowed ever since in all the editions of his works ii 9113 of the edition by bandouin freres 97 vols paris 18251834 under the title  memoires pour servir a vie de m de voltaire with patches of repetition in the thing called commentaire historique which follows ibid at great length libel undoubtedly written by voltaire in a kind of fury but not intended to be published by him nay burnt and annihilated as he afterwards imagined no line of which that cannot be otherwise proved has a right to be believed and large portions of which can be proved to be wild exaggerations and perversions or even downright lieswritten in a mood analogous to the frenzy of john dennis this serves for the biography or private character of friedrich imputing all crimes to him natural and unnaturaloffering indeed if combined with facts otherwise known or even if well considered by itself a thoroughly flimsy incredible and impossible image like that of some flaming devils head done in phosphorus on the walls of the blackhole by an artist whom you had locked up there not quite without reason overnight  poor voltaire wrote that  vie privee  in a state little inferior to the frenzy of john dennishow brought about we shall see by and by and this is the document which english readers are surest to have read and tried to credit as far as possible our counsel is out of window with it he that would know friedrich of prussia keep it awhile he that would know francois arouet de voltaire and a certain numerous unfortunate class of mortals whom voltaire is sometimes capable of sinking to be spokesman for in this worldalas go where you will especially in these irreverent ages the noteworthy dead is sure to be found lying under infinite dung no end of calumnies and stupidities accumulated upon him for the class we speak of class of flunkies doing  saturnalia  below stairs is numerous is innumerable and can well remunerate a vocal flunky that will serve their purposes on such an occasion  friedrich is by no means one of the perfect demigods and there are various things to be said against him with good ground to the last a questionable hero with much in him which one could have wished not there and much wanting which one could have wished but there is one feature which strikes you at an early period of the inquiry that in his way he is a reality that he always means what he speaks grounds his actions too on what he recognizes for the truth and in short has nothing whatever of the hypocrite or phantasm which some readers will admit to be an extremely rare phenomenon we perceive that this man was far indeed from trying to deal swindlerlike with the facts around him that he honestly recognized said facts wherever they disclosed themselves and was very anxious also to ascertain their existence where still hidden or dubious for he knew well to a quite uncommon degree and with a merit all the higher as it was an unconscious one how entirely inexorable is the nature of facts whether recognized or not ascertained or not how vain all cunning of diplomacy management and sophistry to save any mortal who does not stand on the truth of things from sinking in the longrun sinking to the very mudgods with all his diplomacies possessions achievements and becoming an unnamable object hidden deep in the cesspools of the universe this i hope to make manifest this which i long ago discerned for myself with pleasure in the physiognomy of friedrich and his life which indeed was the first real sanction and has all along been my inducement and encouragement to study his life and him how this man officially a king withal comported himself in the eighteenth century and managed not to be a liar and charlatan as his century was deserves to be seen a little by men and kings and may silently have didactic meanings in it  he that was honest with his existence has always meaning for us be he king or peasant he that merely shammed and grimaced with it however much and with whatever noise and trumpetblowing he may have cooked and eaten in this world cannot long have any some men do cook enormously let us call it cooking what a man does in obedience to his hunger merely to his desires and passions merelyroasting whole continents and populations in the flames of war or other discordwitness the napoleon above spoken of for the appetite of man in that respect is unlimited in truth infinite and the smallest of us could eat the entire solar system had we the chance given and then cry like alexander of macedon because we had no more solar systems to cook and eat it is not the extent of the mans cookery that can much attach me to him but only the man himself and what of strength he had to wrestle with the mudelements and what of victory he got for his own benefit and mine     4 encouragements discouragements  french revolution having spent itself or sunk in france and elsewhere to what we see a certain curiosity reawakens as to what of great or manful we can discover on the other side of that still troubled atmosphere of the present and immediate past curiosity quickened or which should be quickened by the great and allabsorbing question how is that same exploded past ever to settle down again not lost forever it would appear the new era has not annihilated the old eras new era could by no means manage thatnever meant that had it known its own mind which it did not its meaning was and is to get its own well out of them to readapt in a purified shape the old eras and appropriate whatever was true and not combustible in them that was the poor new eras meaning in the frightful explosion it made of itself and its possessions to begin with  and the question of questions now is what part of that exploded past the ruins and dust of which still darken all the air will continually gravitate back to us be reshaped transformed readapted that so in new figures under new conditions it may enrich and nourish us again what part of it not being incombustible has actually gone to flame and gas in the huge worldconflagration and is now gaseous mounting aloft and will know no beneficence of gravitation but mount and roam upon the waste winds forevernature so ordering it in spite of any industry of art this is the universal question of afflicted mankind at present and sure enough it will be long to settle  on one point we can answer only what of the past was true will come back to us that is the one asbestos which survives all fire and comes out purified that is still ours blessed be heaven and only that by the law of nature nothing more than that and also by the same law nothing less than that let art struggle how it may for or againstas foolish art is seen extensively doing in our timethere is where the limits of it will be in which point of view may not friedrich if he was a true man and king justly excite some curiosity again nay some quite peculiar curiosity as the lost crowned reality there was antecedent to that general outbreak and abolition to many it appears certain there are to be no kings of any sort no government more less and less need of them henceforth new era having come which is a very wonderful notion important if true perhaps still more important just at present if untrue my hopes of presenting in this last of the kings an exemplar to my contemporaries i confess are not high  on the whole it is evident the difficulties to a history of friedrich are great and many and the sad certainty is at last forced upon me that no good book can at this time especially in this country be written on the subject wherefore let the reader put up with an indifferent or bad one he little knows how much worse it could easily have beenalas the ideal of history as my friend sauerteig knows is very high and it is not one serious man but many successions of such and whole serious generations of such that can ever again build up history towards its old dignity we must renounce ideals we must sadly take up with the mournfulest barren realitiesdismal continents of brandenburg sand as in this instance mere tumbled mountains of marinestores without so much as an index to them  has the reader heard of sauerteigs last batch of  springwurzeln  a rather curious valedictory piece all history is an imprisoned epic nay an imprisoned psalm and prophecy says sauerteig there i wish from my soul he had disimprisoned it in this instance but he only says in magniloquent language how grand it would be if disimprisonedand hurls out accidentally striking on this subject the following rough sentences suggestive though unpractical with which i shall conclude  schiller it appears at one time thought of writing an  epic poem upon friedrich the great  upon some action of friedrichs schiller says happily schiller did not do it by oversetting fact disregarding reality and tumbling time and space topsyturvy schiller with his fine gifts might no doubt have written a temporary epic poem of the kind read an admired by many simple persons but that would have helped little and could not have lasted long it is not the untrue imaginary picture of a man and his life that i want from my schiller but the actual natural likeness true as the face itself nay truer in a sense which the artist if there is one might help to give and the botcher  pfuscher never can alas and the artist does not even try it leaves it altogether to the botcher being busy otherwise  men surely will at length discover again emerging from these dismal bewilderments in which the modern ages reel and stagger this long while that to them also as to the most ancient men all pictures that cannot be credited arepictures of an idle nature to be mostly swept out of doors such veritably were it never so forgotten is the law mistakes enough lies enough will insinuate themselves into our most earnest portrayings of the true but that we should deliberately and of forethought rake together what we know to be not true and introduce that in the hope of doing good with it i tell you such practice was unknown in the ancient earnest times and ought again to become unknown except to the more foolish classes that is sauerteigs strange notion not now of yesterday as readers knowand he goes then into homers iliad the hebrew bible terrible hebrew veracity of every line of it discovers an alarming kinship of fiction to lying and asks if anybody can compute the damage we poor moderns have got from our practices of fiction in literature itself not to speak of awfully higher provinces men will either see into all this by and by continues he or plunge head foremost in neglect of all this whither they little dream as yet  but i think all real poets to this hour are psalmists and iliadists after their sort and have in them a divine impatience of lies a divine incapacity of living among lies likewise which is a corollary that the highest shakspeare producible is properly the fittest historian producibleand that it is frightful to see the  gelehrte dummkopf  what we here may translate dryasdust doing the function of history and the shakspeare and the goethe neglecting it interpreting events interpreting the universally visible entirely indubitable revelation of the author of this universe how can dryasdust interpret such things the dark chaotic dullard who knows the meaning of nothing cosmic or noble nor ever will know poor wretch one sees what kind of meaning he educes from mans history this long while past and has got all the world to believe of it along with him unhappy dryasdust thriceunhappy world that takes dryasdusts reading of the ways of god but what else was possible they that could have taught better were engaged in fiddling for which there are good wages going and our damage therefrom our damageyes if thou be still human and not cormorantperhaps it will transcend all californias english national debts and show itself incomputable in continents of bullion  believing that mankind are not doomed wholly to doglike annihilation i believe that much of this will mend i believe that the world will not always waste its inspired men in mere fiddling to it that the man of rhythmic nature will feel more and more his vocation towards the interpretation of fact since only in the vital centre of that could we once get thither lies all real melody and that he will become he once again the historian of eventsbewildered dryasdust having at last the happiness to be his servant and to have some guidance from him which will be blessed indeed for the present dryasdust strikes me like a hapless nigger gone masterless nigger totally unfit for selfguidance yet without master good or bad and whose feats in that capacity no god or man can rejoice in  history with faithful genius at the top and faithful industry at the bottom will then be capable of being written history will then actually be writtenthe inspired gift of god employing itself to illuminate the dark ways of god a thing thricepressingly needful to be donewhereby the modern nations may again become a little less godless and again have their epics of a different from the schiller sort and again have several things they are still more fatally in want of at present  so that it would seem there will gradually among mankind if friedrich last some centuries be a real epic made of his history that is to say presumably it will become a perfected melodious truth and duly significant and duly beautiful bit of belief to mankind the essence of it fairly evolved from all the chaff the portrait of it actually given and its real harmonies with the laws of this universe brought out in bright and dark according to the gods fact as it was which poor dryasdust and the newspapers never could get sight of but were always far from  well if soand even if not quite soit is a comfort to reflect that every true worker who has blown away chaff c were his contribution no bigger than my own may have brought the good result nearer by a handbreadth or two and so we will end these preludings and proceed upon our problem courteous reader     chapter ii  friedrichs birth  friedrich of brandenburghohenzollern who came by course of natural succession to be friedrich ii of prussia and is known in these ages as frederick the great was born in the palace of berlin about noon on the 24th of january 1712 a small infant but of great promise or possibility and thrice and four times welcome to all sovereign and other persons in the prussian court and prussian realms in those cold winter days his father they say was like to have stifled him with his caresses so overjoyed was the man or at least to have scorched him in the blaze of the fire when happily some much suitabler female nurse snatched this little creature from the rough paternal pawsand saved it for the benefit of prussia and mankind if heaven will but please to grant it length of life for there have already been two little princekins who are both dead this friedrich is the fourth child and only one little girl wise wilhelmina of almost too sharp wits and not too vivacious aspect is otherwise yet here of royal progeny it is feared the hohenzollern lineage which has flourished here with such beneficent effect for three centuries now and been in truth the very making of the prussian nation may be about to fail or pass into some side branch which change or any change in that respect is questionable and a thing desired by nobody  five years ago on the death of the first little prince there had surmises risen obscure rumors and hints that the princess royal mother of the lost baby never would have healthy children or even never have a child more upon which as there was but one other resourcea widowed grandfather namely and except the prince royal no son to himsaid grandfather still only about fifty did take the necessary steps but they have been entirely unsuccessful no new son or child only new affliction new disaster has resulted from that third marriage of his and though the princess royal has had another little prince that too has died within the yearkilled some say on the other hand by the noise of the cannon firing for joy over it forster  friedrich wilhelm i konig von preussen

these same parties farther say was crushed to death by the weighty dress you put upon it at christening time especially by the little crown it wore which had left a visible black mark upon the poor soft infants brow in short it is a questionable case undoubtedly a questionable outlook for prussian mankind and the appearance of this little prince a third trumpcard in the hohenzollern game is an unusually interesting event the joy over him not in berlin palace only but in berlin city and over the prussian nation was very great and universalstill testified in manifold dull unreadable old pamphlets records official and volunteerwhich were then all ablaze like the bonfires and are now fallen dark enough and hardly credible even to the fancy of this new time  the poor old grandfather friedrich i the first king of prussiafor as we intimate he was still alive and not very old though now infirm enough and laden beyond his strength with sad reminiscences disappointments and chagrinshad taken much to wilhelmina as she tells us  memoires de frederique sophie wilhelmine de prusse margrave de bareith soeur d fredericlegrand  london 1812 i 5 and would amuse himself whole days with the pranks and prattle of the little child good old man he we need not doubt brightened up into unusual vitality at sight of this invaluable little brother of hers through whom he can look once more into the waste dim future with a flicker of new hope poor old man he got his own back halfbroken by a careless nurse letting him fall and has slightly stooped ever since some fifty and odd years now much against his will for he would fain have been beautiful and has struggled all his days very hard if not very wisely to make his existence beautifulto make it magnificent at least and regardless of expenseand it threatens to come to little courage poor grandfather here is a new second edition of a friedrich the first having gone off with so little effect this ones back is still

mighty fellow this one and a strange related not only to the upholsteries and heralds colleges but to the sphereharmonies and the divine and demonic powers of a swift fardarting nature this one like

the purblind rotting century in the acknowledged rank of a king thereman of genius that is to say man of originality and veracity capable of seeing with his eyes and incapable of not believing what he

name given him was karl friedrich charles frederick karl perhaps and perhaps also not in delicate compliment to the chief gossip the abovementioned kaiser karl or charles vi at any rate the karl gradually or from the first dropped altogether out of practice and went as nothing he himself or those about him never used it nor except in some dim english pamphlet here and there have i met with any trace of it friedrich richinpeace a name of old prevalence in the hohenzollern kindred which he himself wrote frederic in his french way and at last even federic with a very singular sense of euphony is throughout and was his sole designation sunday 31st january 1712 age then precisely one week then and in this manner was he ushered on the scene and labelled among his fellowcreatures we must now look round a little and see if possible by any method or exertion what kind of scene it was     chapter iii  father and mother the hanoverian connection  friedrich wilhelm crownprince of prussia son of friedrich i and father of this little infant who will one day be friedrich ii did himself make some noise in the world as second king of prussia notable not as friedrichs father alone and will much concern us during the rest of his life he is at this date in his twentyfourth year a thickset sturdy florid brisk young fellow with a jovial laugh in him yet of solid grave ways occasionally somewhat volcanic much given to soldiering and outofdoor exercises having little else to do at present he has been manager or as it were viceking on an occasional absence of his father he knows practically what the state of business is and greatly disapproves of it as is thought but being bound to silence on that head he keeps silence and meddles with nothing political he addicts himself chiefly to mustering drilling and practical military duties while here at berlin runs out often enough wife and perhaps a comrade or two along with him to hunt and take his ease at wusterhausen some fifteen or twenty miles english milesas always unless the contrary be stated the german meile is about five miles english german stunde about three southeast of berlin where he has a

among other things the fiery battle of malplaquet one of the terriblest and deadliest feats of war ever done no want of intrepidity and rugged soldiervirtue in the prussian troops or their crownprince least of all on that terrible day 11th september 1709of which he keeps the anniversary ever since and will do all his life the doomsday of malplaquet always a memorable day to him forster i 138 he is more and more intimate with leopold and loves good soldiering beyond all things here at berlin he has already got a regiment of his own tallish fine men and strives to make it in all points a very pattern of a regiment  for the rest much here is out of joint and far from satisfactory to him seven years ago 1st february 1705 he lost his own brave mother and her love of which we must speak farther by and by in her stead he has got a fantastic melancholic illnatured stepmother with whom there was never any good to be done who in fact is now fairly mad and kept to her own apartments he has to see here and say little a chagrined heartworn father flickering painfully amid a scene much filled with expensive futile persons and their extremely pitiful cabals and mutual rages scene chiefly of pompous inanity and the art of solemnly and with great labor doing nothing such waste of labor and of means what can one do but be silent the other year preussen prussia proper province lying far eastward out of sight was sinking under pestilence and black ruin and despair the crownprince contrary to wont broke silence and begged some dole or subvention for these poor people but there was nothing to be had nothing in the treasury your royal highnesspreussen will shift for itself sublime dramaturgy which we call his majestys government costs so much and preussen mown away by death lies much of it vacant ever since which has completed the crownprinces disgust and i believe did produce some change of ministry or other ineffectual expedient on the old fathers part upon which the crownprince locks up his thoughts again he has confused whirlpools of court intrigues ceremonials and troublesome fantasticalities to steer amongst which he much dislikes no man more having an eye and heart set on the practical only and being in mind as in body something of the genus robustum of the genus ferox withal he has been wedded six years lost two children as we saw and now again he has two living  his wife sophie dorothee of hanover is his cousin as well she is brothersdaughter of his mother sophie charlotte let the reader learn to discriminate these two names sophie charlotte late queen of prussia was also of hanover she probably had sometimes in her quiet motherly thought anticipated this connection for him while she yet lived it is certain friedrich wilhelm was carried to hanover in early childhood his motherthat sophie charlotte a famed queen and lady in her day daughter of electress sophie and sister of the george who became george i of england by and bytook him thither some time about the beginning of 1693 his age then five and left him there on trial alleging and expecting he might have a better breeding there and this in a court where electress sophie was chief lady and elector ernst fit to be called gentleman ernst her highness the electress sophie has the character of the merry debonnaire princess of germany a lady of extraordinary virtues and accomplishments mistress of the italian french high and low dutch and english languages which she speaks to perfection her husband elector ernst has the title of the gentleman of germany a graceful

of men was chief lordand where leibnitz to say nothing of lighter notabilities was flourishingseemed a reasonable expectation nevertheless it came to nothing this articulate purpose of the visit though perhaps the deeper silent purposes of it might not be quite unfulfilled  gentleman ernst had lately been made elector  kurfurst  instead of  herzog his hanover no longer a mere sovereign duchy but an electorate henceforth new ninth electorate by ernsts lifelong exertion and good luckwhich has spread a fine radiance for the time over court and people in those parts and made ernst a happier man than ever in his old age gentleman ernst and electress sophie we need not doubt were glad to see their burly prussian grandsona robust rather mischievous boy of five years oldand anything that brought her daughter oftener about her an only daughter too and one so gifted was sure to be welcome to the cheery old electress and her leibnitz and her circle for sophie charlotte was a bright presence and a favorite with sage and gay  uncle george again  kurprinz  georg ludwig electoral prince and heirapparent who became george i of england he always a taciturn saturnine somewhat grimvisaged man not without thoughts of his own but mostly inarticulate thoughts was just at this time in a deep domestic intricacy uncle george the kurprinz was painfully detecting in these very months that his august spouse and cousin a brilliant not uninjured lady had become an indignant injuring one that she had gone and was going far astray in her walk of life thus all is not radiance at hanover either ninth elector though we are but in the soft sunlight there quivers a streak of the blackness of very erebus withal kurprinz george i think though he too is said to have been good to the boy could not take much interest in this burly nephew of his just now  sure enough it was in this year 1693 that the famed konigsmark tragedy came ripening fast towards a crisis in hanover and next year the catastrophe arrived a most tragic business of which the little boy now here will know more one day perhaps it was on this very visit on one visit it credibly was that sophie charlotte witnessed a sad scene in the schloss of hanover high words rising where low cooings had been more appropriate harsh words mutually recriminative rising ever higher ending it is thought in things or menaces and motions towards things actual box on the ear some call itnever to be forgotten or forgiven and on sunday 1st of july 1694 colonel count philip konigsmark colonel in the hanover dragoons was seen for the last time in this world from that date he has vanished suddenly underground in an inscrutable manner never more shall the light of the sun or any human eye behold that handsome blackguard man not for a hundred and fifty years shall human creatures know or guess with the smallest certainty what has become of him  and shortly after konigsmarks disappearance there is this sad phenomenon visible a once very radiant princess witty haughtyminded beautiful not wise or fortunate now gone all ablaze into angry tragic conflagration getting locked into the old castle of ahlden in the moory solitudes of luneburg heath to stay there till she diethirty years as it provedand go into ashes and angry darkness as she may old peasants late in the next century will remember that they used to see her sometimes driving on the heathbeautiful lady long black hair and the glitter of diamonds in it sometimes the reins in her own hand but always with a party of cavalry round her and their swords drawn  die herzogin von ahlden  leipzig 1852 p 22 divorce was 28th december 1694 death 13th november 1726age then 60 duchess of ahlden that was her title in the eclipsed state born

is to be and a queen george ii of england sophie dorothee of prussia but must not now call them hers or ever see them again  this was the konigsmark tragedy at hanover fast ripening towards its catastrophe while little friedrich wilhelm was there it has been ever since a rumor and dubious frightful mystery to mankind but within these few years by curious accidents thefts discoveries of written documents in various countries and diligent study of them it has at length become a certainty and clear fact to those who are curious about it fact surely of a rather horrible sortyet better i must say than was suspected not quite so bad in the state of fact as in that of rumor crime enough is in it sin and folly on both sides there is killing too but not assassination as it turns out on the whole there is nothing of atrocity or nothing that was not accidental unavoidableand there is a certain greatness of decorum on the part of those hanover princes and official gentlemen a depth of silence of polite stoicism which deserves more praise than it will get in our times enough now of the konigsmark tragedy a considerable dreary mass of books pamphlets lucubrations false all and of no worth or of less have accumulated on this dark subject during the last hundred and fifty years nor has the process yet stoppedas it now well might for there have now two things occurred in regard to it first in the year 1847 a swedish professor named palmblad groping about for other objects in the college library of lund which is in the country of the konigsmark connections came upon a box of old lettersletters undated signed only with initials and very enigmatic till well searched intowhich have turned out to be the very autographs of the princess and her konigsmark throwing of course a henceforth indisputable light on their relation second thing a cautious exact old gentleman of diplomatic habits understood to be count von schulenburgklosterrode of dresden has since that event unweariedly gone into the whole matter and has brayed it everywhere and pounded it small sifting with sublime patience not only those swedish autographs but the whole mass of lying books pamphlets hints and notices old and recent and bringing out truly in an intricate and thricewearisome but for the first time in an authentic way what real evidence there is in which evidence the facts or essential fact lie at last indisputable enough his book thick pamphlet rather is that same  herzogin von ahlden  leipzig 1852 cited above the dreary wheelbarrowful of others i had rather not mention again but leave count von schulenburg to mention and describe themwhich he does abundantly so many as had accumulated up to that date of 1852 to the affliction more or less of sane mankind contemporaneous with friedrich wilhelms stay at hanover but not otherwise much related to him or his doings there  he got no improvement in breeding as we intimated none at all fought on the contrary with his young cousin afterwards our george ii a boy twice his age though of weaker bone and gave him a bloody nose to the scandal and consternation of the french protestant gentlewomen and courtdames in their stiff silks ahee your electoral highness this had been a rough unruly boy from the first discovery of him at a very early stage he one morning while the nurses were dressing him took to investigating one of his shoe buckles would in spite of remonstrances slobber it about in his mouth and at length swallowed it downbeyond mistake and the whole world cannot get it up whereupon wild wail of nurses and his mother came screaming poor motherit is the same small shoebuckle which is still shown with a ticket and date to it 31 december 1692 in the berlin  kunstkammer  for it turned out harmless after all the screaming and a few grains of rhubarb restored it safely to the light of day henceforth a thricememorable shoebuckle forster i 74 erman  memoires de sophie charlotte  berlin 1801 p 130  another time it is recorded though with less precision of detail his governess the dame montbail having ordered him to do something which was intolerable to the princely mind the princely mind resisted in a very strange way the princely body namely flung itself suddenly out of a thirdstory window nothing but the hands left within and hanging on there by the sill and fixedly resolute to obey gravitation rather than montbail soon brought the poor lady to terms upon which indeed he had been taken from her and from the women altogether as evidently now needing rougher government always an unruly fellow and dangerous to trust among crockery at hanover he could do no good in the way of breeding sage leibnitz himself with his big black periwig and large patient nose could have put no metaphysics into such a boy sublime  theodicee  leibnitzian justification of the ways of god was not an article this individual had the least need of nor at any time the least value for justify what doomed dog questions it then are you for bedlam thenand in maturer years his rattan might have been dangerous for this was a singular individual of his day human soul still in robust health and not given to spin its bowels into cobwebs he is known only to have quarrelled much with cousin george during the year or so he spent in those parts  but there was another cousin at hanover just one other little sophie dorothee called after her mother a few months older than himself by all accounts a really pretty little child whom he liked a great deal better she i imagine was his main resource while on this hanover visit with her were laid the foundations of an intimacy which ripened well afterwards some say it was already settled by the parents that there was to be a marriage in due time settled it could hardly be for wilhelmina tells us  memoires de la margrave de bareith  i l her father had a choice of three allowed him on coming to wed and it is otherwise discernible there had been eclipses and uncertainties in the interim on his part settled no but hoped and vaguely prefigured we may well suppose and at all events it has actually come to pass father being ardently in love with the hanover princess says our margravine and much preferring her to the other two or to any and all others wedded with great pomp 28th november 1706 forster i 117and sophie dorothee the same that was his pretty little cousin at hanover twenty years ago she is mother of the little boy now born and christened whom men are to call frederick the great in coming generations  sophie dorothee is described to us by courtier contemporaries as one of the most beautiful princesses of her day wilhelmina on the other hand testifies that she was never strictly to be called beautiful but had a pleasant attractive physiognomy which may be considered better than strict beauty uncommon grace of figure and look testifies wilhelmina much dignity and soft dexterity on social occasions perfect in all the arts of deportment and left an impression on you at once kindly and royal portraits of her as queen at a later age are frequent in the prussian galleries she is painted sitting where i best remember her a serious comely rather plump maternallooking lady something thoughtful in those gray still eyes of hers in the turn of her face and carriage of her head as she sits there considerately gazing out upon a world which would never conform to her will decidedly a handsome wholesome and affectionate aspect of face hanoverian in type that is to say blond florid slightly profuseyet the better kind of hanoverian little or nothing of the worse or at least the worst kind the eyes as i say are gray and quiet almost sad expressive of reticence and reflection of slow constancy rather than of speed in any kind one expects could the picture speak the querulous sound of maternal and other solicitude of a temper tending towards the obstinate the quietly unchangeableloyal patience not wanting yet in still larger measure royal impatience well concealed and long and carefully cherished this is what i read in sophie dorothees portraitsprobably remembering what i had otherwise read and come to know of her she too will not a little concern us in the first part of this history i find for one thing she had given much of her physiognomy to the friedrich now born in his portraits as princeroyal he strongly resembles her it is his mothers face informed with youth and new fire and translated into the masculine gender in his later portraits one less and less recognizes the mother  friedrich wilhelm now in the sixth year of wedlock is still very fond of his sophie dorothee fiechen feekin diminutive of  sophie  as he calls her she also having and continuing to have the due wifes regard for her solid honest if somewhat explosive bear he troubles her a little now and then it is said with whiffs of jealousy but they are whiffs only the product of accidental moodinesses in him or of transient aspects misinterpreted in the courtlife of a young and pretty woman as the general rule he is beautifully goodhumored kind even for a bear and on the whole they have begun their partnership under good omens and indeed we may say in spite of sad tempests that arose they continued it under such she brought him gradually no fewer than fourteen children of whom ten survived him and came to maturity and it is to be admitted their conjugal relation though a royal was always a human one the main elements of it strictly observed on both sides all quarrels in it capable of being healed again and the feeling on both sides true however troublous a rare fact among royal wedlocks and perhaps a unique one in that epoch  the young couple as is natural in their present position have many eyes upon them and not quite a paved path in this confused court of friedrich i but they are true to one another they seem indeed to have held well aloof from all public business or private cabal and go along silently expecting and perhaps silently resolving this and that in the future tense but with moderate immunity from paternal or other criticisms for the present the crownprince drills or hunts with his grumkows anhaltdessaus these are harmless employmentsand a man may have within his own head what thoughts he pleases without offence so long as he keeps them there friedrich the old grandfather lived only thirteen months after the birth of his grandson friedrich wilhelm was then king thoughts then to any length could become actions on the part of friedrich wilhelm     chapter iv

then about seventeen whom she had with effort forced herself to send abroad that he might see the world a little for the first time her sorrow on this occasion has in it something beautiful in so bright and gay a woman shows us the mother strong in her to a touching degree the rough cub in whom she noticed rugged perverse elements tendencies to avarice and a want of princely graces and the more brilliant qualities in mind and manner had given her many thoughts and some uneasy ones but he was evidently all she had to love in the world a rugged creature inexpressibly precious to her for days after his departure she had kept solitary busied with little indulging in her own sad reflections without stint among the papers she had been scribbling there was found one slip with a heart sketched on it and round the heart parti gone my heart is gonepoor lady and after what a jewel but nature is very kind to all children and to all mothers that are true to her  sophie charlottes deep sorrow and dejection on this parting was the secret herald of fate to herself it had meant ill health withal and the gloom of broken nerves all autumn and into winter she had felt herself indefinitely unwell she determined however on seeing hanover and her good old mother at the usual time the gloomy sorrow over friedrich wilhelm had been the premonition of a sudden illness which seized her on the road to hanover some five months afterwards and which ended fatally in that city her death was not in the light style friedrich her grandson ascribes to it  memoires de brandebourg  preusss edition of  oeuvres  berlin 1847 et seqq i 112 she died without epigram and though in perfect simple courage with the reverse of levity  here at first hand is the specific account of that event which as it is brief and indisputable we may as well fish from the imbroglios and render legible to counteract such notions and illuminate for moments an old scene of things the writing apparently a quite private piece is by m de la bergerie pastor of the french church at hanover respectable edictofnantes gentleman who had been called in on the occasiongives an authentic momentary picture though a feeble and vacant one of a locality at that time very interesting to englishmen m de la bergerie privately records  the night between the last of january and the first of february 1705 between one and two oclock in the morning i was called to the queen of prussia who was then dangerously ill  entering the room i threw myself at the foot of her bed testifying to her in words my profound grief to see her in this state after which i took occasion to say she might know now that kings and queens are mortal equally with all other men and that they are obliged to appear before the throne of the majesty of god to give an account of their deeds done no less than the meanest of their subjects to which her majesty replied i know it well  je le sais bien i went on to say to her madam your majesty must also recognize in this hour the vanity and nothingness of the things here below for which it may be you have had too much interest and the importance of the things of heaven which perhaps you have neglected and contemned thereupon the queen answered true  cela est vrai  nevertheless madam said i does not your majesty place really your trust in god do you not very earnestly  bien serieusement crave pardon of him for all the sins you have committed do not you fly  natelle pas recours  to the blood and merits of jesus christ without which it is impossible for us to stand before god the queen answered  oui  yeswhile this was going on her brother duke ernst august came into the queens roomperhaps with his eye upon me and my motionsas they wished to speak together i withdrew by order  this duke ernst august age now 31 is the youngest brother of the family there never was any sister but this dying one who is four years older ernst august has some tincture of soldiership at this time marlborough wars and the like as all his kindred had but ultimately he got the bishopric of osnabruck that singular spiritual heirloom or halfheirloom of the family and there lived or vegetated without noise poor soul he is the same bishop of osnabruck to whose house twentytwo years hence george i struck by apoplexy was breathlessly galloping in the summer midnight one wish now left in him to be with his brotherand arrived dead or in the article of death that was another scene ernst august had to witness in his life i suspect him at present of a thought that m de la bergerie with his pious commonplaces is likely to do no good other trait of ernst augusts life or of the schloss of hanover that nightor where the sorrowing old mother sat invincible though weeping in some neighboring roomi cannot give m de la bergerie continues his narrative  some time after i again presented myself before the queens bed to see if i could have occasion to speak to her on the matter of her salvation but monseigneur the duke ernst august then said to me that it was not necessary that the queen was at peace with her god  etait bien avec son dieu which will mean also that m de la bergerie may go home however he still writes  next day the prince told me that observing i was come near the queens bed he had asked her if she wished i should still speak to her but she had replied that it was not necessary in any way  nullement  that she already knew all that could be said to her on such an occasion that she had said it to herself that she was still saying it and that she hoped to be well with her god  in the end a faint coming upon the queen which was what terminated her life i threw myself on my knees at the other side of her bed the curtains of which were open and i called to god with a loud voice that he would rank his angels round this great princess to guard her from the insults of satan that he would have pity on her soul that he would wash her with the blood of jesus christ her heavenly spouse that having forgiven her all her sins he would receive her to his glory and in that moment she expired erman p 242age thirtysix and some months only daughter of electress

expanded in many ways into ampler fulfilment she too had the sage leibnitz often with her at berlin no end to her questionings of him eagerly desirous to draw water from that deep wella wet rope with cobwebs sticking to it too often all she got endless rope and the bucket never coming to view which however she took patiently as a thing according to nature she had her learned beausobres and other

politeness itself though they treated the fathers so ill her majesty with beautiful art in this letter smooths the raven plumage of votaand at the same time throws into him as with invisible needlepoints an excellent dose of acupuncturation on the subject of the primitive fathers and the ecumenic councils on her own score let us give some excerpt in condensed state  how can st jerome for example be a key to scripture she insinuates citing from jerome this remarkable avowal of his method of composing books especially of his method in that book  commentary on the galatians  where he accuses both peter and paul of simulation and even of hypocrisy the great st augustine has been charging him with this sad fact says her majesty who gives chapter and verse epist 28 edit paris and jeromes answer ibid epist 76 and jerome answers i followed the commentaries of origen offive or six different persons who turned out mostly to be heretics before jerome had quite done with them in coming yearsand to confess the honest truth to you continues jerome i read all that and after having crammed my head with a great many things i sent for my amanuensis and dictated to him now my own thoughts now those of others without much recollecting the order nor sometimes the words nor even the sense in another place in the book itself farther on  commentary on the galatians  chap iii he says i do not myself write i have an amanuensis and i dictate to him what comes into my mouth if i wish to reflect a little to say the thing better or a better thing he knits his brows and the whole look of him tells me sufficiently that he cannot endure to waithere is a sacred old gentleman whom it is not safe to depend on for interpreting the scriptures thinks her majesty but does not say so leaving father vota to his reflections  then again coming to councils she quotes st gregory nazianzen upon him who is truly dreadful in regard to ecumenic councils of the churchand indeed may awaken thoughts of deliberative assemblies generally in the modern constitutional mind he says  greg nazian de vita sua  no council ever was successful so many mean human passions getting into conflagration there with noise with violence and uproar more like those of a tavern or still worse placethese are his words he for his own share had resolved to avoid all such rendezvousing of the geese and cranes flocking together to throttle and tatter one another in that sad manner nor had st theodoret much opinion of the council of nice except as a kind of miracle nothing good to be expected from councils says he except when god is pleased to interpose and destroy the machinery of the devil  with more of the like sort all delicate as invisible needlepoints in her majestys hand letter undated datable

enough and with a dust vortex of courtier intrigues and cabals encircling himfrom which it is better to stand quite to windward moreover he was slightly crooked most sensitive thin of skin and liable to sudden flaws of temper though at heart very kind and good sophie charlotte is she who wrote once leibnitz talked to me of the infinitely little  de linfiniment petit mon dieu  as if i did not know enough of that besides it is whispered she was once near marrying to louis xivs dauphin her mother sophie and her cousin the dowager duchess of orleans cunning women both had brought her to paris in

wilhelm the rough boy and perhaps nothing more of very precious property her first child likewise a boy had soon died and there came no third tedious ceremonials and the infinitely little were mainly her lot in this world  all which however she had the art to take up not in the tragic way but in the mildly comicoften not to take up at all but leave lying thereand thus to manage in a handsome and softly victorious manner with delicate female tact with fine female stoicism too keeping all things within limits she was much respected by her husband much loved indeed and greatly mourned for by the

this dignity after long and intricate negotiations in the first year of the century 16th november 1700 his ambassador returned triumphant from vienna the kaiser had at last consented we are to wear a crown royal on the top of our periwig the old electorate of brandenburg is to become the kingdom of prussia and the family of hohenzollern slowly mounting these many centuries has reached the uppermost round of the ladder  friedrich the old gentleman who now looks upon his little grandson destined to be third king of prussia with such interestis not a very memorable man but he has had his adventures too his losses and his gains and surely among the latter the gain of a crown royal into his house gives him if only as a chronological milestone some place in history he was son of him they call the great elector friedrich wilhelm by name of whom the prussians speak much in an eagerly celebrating manner and whose strenuous toilsome work in this world celebrated or not is still deeply legible in the actual life and affairs of germany a man of whom we must yet find some opportunity to say a word from him and a beautiful and excellent princess luise princess of orangedutch william our dutch williams auntthis crooked royal friedrich came  he was not born crooked straight enough once and a fine little boy of six months old or so there being an elder prince now in his third year also full of hope but in a rough journey to konigsberg and back winter of 1657 as is guessed one of the many rough jolting journeys this faithful electress made with her husband a careless or unlucky

too thin a skinthat may be considered as the summary of his misfortunes and on the whole there is no other heavy sin to be charged against him  he had other loads laid upon him poor youth his kind pious mother died his elder brother died he at the age of seventeen saw himself heirapparentand had got a stepmother with new heirs if he should disappear sorrows enough in that one fact with the venomous whisperings commentaries and suspicions which a court population female and male in little berlin town can contrive to tack to it does not the new sovereign lady in her heart wish you were dead my prince hope it perhaps health at any rate weak and by the aid of a little pharmacyye heavens  such suspicions are now understood to have had no basis except in the waste brains of courtier men and women but their existence there can become tragical enough add to which the great elector like all the hohenzollerns was a choleric man capable of blazing into volcanic explosions when affronted by idle masses of cobwebs in the midst of his serious businesses it is certain the young prince friedrich had at one time got into quite high shrill and mutually minatory terms with his stepmother so that once after some such shrill dialogue between them ending with you shall repent this sirhe found it good to fly off in the night with only his tutor or secretary and a valet to hessencassel to an aunt who stoutly protected him in this emergency and whose daughter after the difficult readjustment of matters became his wife but did not live long and it is farther certain the same prince during this his first wedded time dining one day with his stepmother was taken suddenly ill felt ill after his cup of coffee retired into another room in violent spasms evidently in an alarming state and secretly in a most alarmed one his tutor or secretary one dankelmann attended him thither and as the doctor took some time to arrive and the symptoms were instant and urgent secretary dankelmann produced from a pocketbook some drug of his own or of the hessencassel aunt emetic i suppose and gave it to the poor princewho said often and felt ever after with or without notion of poison that dankelmann had saved his life in consequence of which adventure he again quitted court without leave and begged to be permitted to remain safe in the country if papa would be so good pollnitz

poisoning as to have despised even the suspicion of it she was much given to practical economics dairyfarming marketgardening and industrial and commercial operations such as offered and was thought to be a very strict reckoner of money she founded the  dorotheenstadt  now oftener called the  neustadt  chief quarter of berlin and planted just about the time of this unlucky dinner ad 1680 or so

recollections and comparisons now and then but with a stepson of unsteady nerves it became evident to him there could never be soft neighborhood prince friedrich and his father came gradually to some understanding tacit or express on that sad matter prince friedrich was allowed to live on his separate allowance mainly remote from court which he did for perhaps six or eight years till the great electors death henceforth in a peaceful manner or at least without open explosions  his young hessencassel wife died suddenly in 1683 and again there was mad rumor of poisoning which electress dorothee disregarded as below her and of no consequence to her and attended to industrial operations that would pay that poor young wife when dying exacted a promise from prince friedrich that he would not wed again but be content with the daughter she had left him which promise if ever seriously given could not be kept as we have seen prince friedrich brought his sophie charlotte home about fifteen months after with the stepmother and with the court there was armed neutrality under tolerable forms and no open explosion farther  in a secret way however there continued to be difficulties and such difficulties had already been that the poor young man not yet come to his heritages and having with probably some turn for expense a covetous unamiable stepmother had fallen into the usual difficulties and taken the methods too usual namely had given ear to the austrian court which offered him assistancesomewhat as an aged jew will to a young christian gentleman in quarrel with papaupon condition of his signing a certain bond bond which much surprised prince friedrich when he came to understand it of which we shall hear more and even much more in the course of time  neither after his accession year 1688 his cousin dutch william of the glorious and immortal memory just lifting anchor towards these shores was the new electors life an easy one we may say it was replete with troubles rather and unhappily not so much with great troubles which could call forth antagonistic greatness of mind or of result as with neverending shoals of small troubles the antagonism to which is apt to become itself of smallish character do not search into his history you will remember almost nothing of it i hope after never so many readings garrulous pollnitz and others have written enough about him but it all runs off from you again as a thing that has no affinity with the human skin he had a court  rempli dintrigues  full of neverending cabals forster i 74 quoting  memoires du comte de dohna  c cabout what  one question only are we a little interested in how he came by the kingship how did the like of him contrive to achieve kingship we may answer it was not he that achieved it it was those that went before him who had gradually got itas is very usual in such cases all that he did was to knock at the gate the kaisers gate and the worlds and ask is it achieved then is brandenburg grown ripe for having a crown will it be needful for you to grant brandenburg a crown which question after knocking as loud as possible they at last took the trouble to answer yes it will be needful  elector friedrichs turn for ostentationor as we may interpret it the high spirit of a hohenzollern working through weak nerves and a crooked backhad early set him athinking of the kingship and no doubt the exaltation of rival saxony which had attained that envied dignity in a very unenviable manner in the person of elector august made king of poland in 1697 operated as a new spur on his activities then also duke ernst of hanover his fatherinlaw was struggling to become elector ernst hanover to be the ninth electorate which it actually attained in 1698 not to speak of england and quite endless prospects there for ernst and hanover these my lucky neighbors are all rising all this the kaiser has granted to my lucky neighbors why is there no promotion he should grant me among them  elector friedrich had 30000 excellent troops kaiser leopold the little man in red stockings had no end of wars wars in turkey wars in italy all dutch williams wars and more on our side of europeand here is a spanishsuccession war coming dubiously on which may prove greater than all the rest together elector friedrich sometimes in his own high person a courageous and high though thinskinned man otherwise by skilful deputy had done the kaiser service often signal service in all these wars and was never wanting in the time of need in the post of difficulty with those famed prussian troops of his a loyal gallant elector this it must be owned capable withal of doing signal damage if we irritated him too far why not give him this promotion since it costs us absolutely nothing real not even the price of a yard of ribbon with metal cross at the end of it kaiser leopold himself it is said had no particular objection but certain of his ministers had and the little man in red stockingsmuch occupied in hunting for one thinglet them have their way at the risk of angering elector friedrich even dutch william anxious for it in sight of the future had not yet prevailed  the negotiation had lasted some seven years without result there is no doubt but the succession war and marlborough would have brought it to a happy issue in the mean while it is said to have succeeded at last somewhat on the sudden by a kind of accident this is the curious mythical account incorrect in some unessential particulars but in the main and singular part of it wellfounded elector friedrich according to pollnitz and others after failing in many methods had sent 100000  thalers  say 15000 pounds to give by way ofbribe we must call itto the chief opposing hofrath at vienna the money was offered accordingly and was refused by the opposing hofrath upon which the brandenburg ambassador wrote that it was all labor lost and even hurried off homewards in despair leaving a secretary in his place the brandenburg court nothing despairing orders in the mean while try another with itsome other hofrath whose name they wrote in cipher which the blundering secretary took to mean no hofrath but the kaisers confessor and chief jesuit pater wolf to him accordingly he hastened with the cash to him with the respectful electoral request who received both it is said especially the 15000 pounds with a  gloria in excelsis  and went forthwith and persuaded the kaiser pollnitz  memoiren  i 310now here is the inexactitude say modern doctors of history an error no less than threefold 1 elector friedrich was indeed advised in cipher by his agent at vienna to write in person towho is that cipher then asks elector friedrich rather puzzled at vienna that cipher was meant for the kaiser but at berlin they take it for pater wolf and write accordingly and are answered with readiness and animation 2 pater wolf was not official confessor but was a jesuit in extreme favor with the kaiser and by birth a nobleman sensible to human decorations 3 he accepted no bribe nor was any sent his bribe was the pleasure of obliging a high gentleman who condescended to ask and possibly the hope of smoothing roads for st ignatius and the black militia in time coming and thus at last and not otherwise than thus say exact doctors did pater wolf do the thing g a h stenzel

the world stood watching with swords half drawn considerably assist pater wolf done sure enough the thing was and before november ended friedrichs messenger returned with yes for answer and a treaty signed on the 16th of that month pollnitz i 318 gives the treaty date corrected by his editor ii589  to the huge joy of elector friedrich and his court almost the very nation thinking itself glad

him and a pious wish of hisbut they remained mere cut branches these two and did not after their haranguing and anointing functions take root in the country he himself put the crown on his head king

on the occasion for she cared not much about crowns or upholstery magnificences of any kind but had meditated from of old on the infinitely little and under these genuflections risings sittings shiftings grimacings on all parts and the endless droning eloquence of bishops invoking heaven her ennui not illhumored or offensively ostensible was heartfelt and transcendent at one turn of the proceedings bishop this and chancellor that droning their empty grandiloquences at discretion sophie charlotte was distinctly seen to smuggle out her snuffbox being addicted to that rakish practice and fairly solace herself with a delicate little pinch of snuff rasped tobacco  tabac rape  called by mortals  rape  or rappee there is no doubt about it and the new king himself noticed her and hurled back a look of due fulminancy which could not help the matter and was only lost in air a memorable little action and almost symbolic in the first prussian coronation yes we are kings and are
