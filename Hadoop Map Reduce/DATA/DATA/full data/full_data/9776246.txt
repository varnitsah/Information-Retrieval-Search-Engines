that i might drain the dizzy dew     from days first golden cup  illustration    in swift devouring ecstacy     each toil in turn was done   i had done lying on the lawn     three minutes after one    for me as mr wordsworth says     the duties shine like stars   i formed my uncles character     decreasing his cigars    but could my kind engross me no     stern artwhat sons escape her   soon i was drawing gladstones nose     on scraps of blotting paper  illustration    then onto play onefingered tunes     upon my aunts piano   in short i have a headlong soul     i much resemble hanno    forgive

the forming of a final sound     opinion on the strand    but when i quenched the midnight oil     and closed the referee   whose thirty volumes folio     i take to bed with me    i had a rather funny dream     intense that is and mystic   i dreamed that with one leap and yell     the world became artistic    the shopmen when their souls were still     declined to open shops  illustration    and

with which texplain its presence in     my upstairs drawingroom  illustration    the sun had read a little book     that struck him with a notion   he drowned himself and all his fires     deep in the hissing ocean    then all was dark lawless and lost     i heard great devilish wings   i knew that art had won and snapt     the covenant of things  illustration    i cried aloud and i awoke     new labours in my head   i set my teeth and manfully     began to lie in bed    toiling rejoicing sorrowing     so i my life conduct   each morning see some task begun     each evening see it chucked    but still in sudden moods of dusk     i hear those great weird wings   feel vaguely thankful to the vast     stupidity of things                                          envoy     clear was the night

cherub cried   i looked at him and only said     go on the world is wide    a tear rolled down his pinafore     yet from my life must pass   the simple love of sun and moon     the old games in the grass    now that my back is to my home     could these again be found   i looked on him and only said     go on the world is round
