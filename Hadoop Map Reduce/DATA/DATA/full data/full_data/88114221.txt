88114221	twice told tales                       a rill from the town pump                        by nathaniel hawthorne    scenethe corner of two principal streetsessex and washington streets salemthe town pump talking through its nose   noon by the north clock  noon by the east  high noon too by these hot sunbeams which  fall scarcely aslope upon my head and almost make the water bubble and smoke in the trough under  my nose  truly we public characters have a tough  time of it  and among all the town officers chosen at  march meeting where is he that sustains for a single  year the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed  in perpetuity upon the town pump  the title of  town treasurer is rightfully mine as guardian of the  best treasure that the town has the overseers of the  poor ought to make me their chairman since i provide  bountifully for the pauper without expense to him that pays taxes  i am at the head of the fire department and one of the physicians to the board of health  as a  keeper of the peace all water drinkers will confess me equal to the constable  i perform some of the duties of the town clerk by promulgating public notices when they are posted on my front  to speak within bounds i am the chief person of the municipality and exhibit moreover an admirable pattern to my brother officers by the cool steady upright downright and impartial discharge of my business and the constancy with which i stand to my post  summer or winter nobody seeks me in vain for all day long i am seen at the busiest corner just above the market stretching out my arms to rich and poor alike and at night i hold a lantern over my head both to show where i am and keep people out of the gutters  at this sultry noontide i am cupbearer to the parched populace for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist  like a dramseller on the mall at musterday i cry aloud to all and sundry in my plainest accents and at the very tiptop of my voice  here it is gentlemen here is the good liquor  walk up walk up gentlemen walk up walk up here is the superior stuff  here is the unadulterated ale of father adambetter than cognac hollands jamaica strong beer or wine of any price here it is by the hogshead or the single glass and not a cent to pay  walk up gentlemen walk up and help yourselves  it were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers  here they come  a hot day gentlemen  quaff and away again so as to keep yourselves in a nice cool sweat  you my friend will need another cupful to wash the dust out of your throat if it be as thick there as it is on your cowhide shoes  i see that you have trudged half a score of miles today and like a wise man have passed by the taverns and stopped at the running brooks and wellcurbs  otherwise betwixt heat without and fire within you would have been burned to a cinder or melted down to nothing at all in the fashion of a jellyfish  drink and make room for that other fellow who seeks my aid to quench the fiery fever of last nights potations which he drained from no cup of mine welcome most rubicund sir  you and i have been great strangers hitherto nor to confess the truth will my nose be anxious for a closer intimacy till the fumes of your breath be a little less potent  mercy on you man the water absolutely hisses down your redhot gullet and is converted quite to steam in the miniature tophet which you mistake for a stomach  fill again and tell me on the word of an honest toper did you ever in cellar tavern or any kind of a dramshop spend the price of your childrens food for a swig half so delicious  now for the first time these ten years you know the flavor of cold water  good by and whenever you are thirsty remember that i keep a constant supply at the old stand  who next  o my little friend you are let loose from school and come hither to scrub your blooming face and drown the memory of certain taps of the ferule and other schoolboy troubles in a draught from the town pump  take it pure as the current of your young life  take it and may your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst than now  there my dear child put down the cup and yield your place to this elderly gentleman who treads so tenderly over the pavingstones that i suspect he is afraid of breaking them  what he limps by without so much as thanking me as if my hospitable offers were meant only for people who have no winecellars  well well sirno harm done i hope  go draw the cork tip the decanter but when your great toe shall set you aroaring it will be no affair of mine  if gentlemen love the pleasant titillation of the gout it is all one to the town pump  this thirsty dog with his red tongue lolling out does not scorn my hospitality but stands on his hind legs and laps eagerly out of the trough  see how lightly he capers away again  jowler did your worship ever have the gout  are you all satisfied  then wipe your mouths my good friends and while my spout has a moments leisure i will delight the town with a few historical reminiscences  in far antiquity beneath a darksome shadow of venerable boughs a spring bubbled out of the leafstrewn earth in the very spot where you now behold me on the sunny pavement  the water was as bright and clear and deemed as precious as liquid diamonds  the indian sagamores drank of it from time immemorial till the fatal deluge of the firewater burst upon the red men and swept their whole race away from the cold fountains  endicott and his followers came next and often knelt down to drink dipping their long beards in the spring  the richest goblet then was of birchbark  governor winthrop after a journey afoot from boston drank here out of the hollow of his hand the elder higginson here wet his palm and laid it on the brow of the first townborn child  for many years it was the wateringplace and as it were the washbowl of the vicinitywhither all decent folks resorted to purify their visages and gaze at them afterwardsat least the pretty maidens didin the mirror which it made  on sabbath days whenever a babe was to be baptized the sexton filled his basin here and placed it on the communiontable of the humble meetinghouse which partly covered the site of yonder stately brick one  thus one generation after another was consecrated to heaven by its waters and cast their waxing and waning shadows into its glassy bosom and vanished from the earth as if mortal life were but a flitting image in a fountain  finally the fountain vanished also  cellars were dug on all sides and cartloads of gravel flung upon its source whence oozed a turbid stream forming a mudpuddle at the corner of two streets  in the hot months when its refreshment was most needed the dust flew in clouds over the forgotten birthplace of the waters now their grave but in the course of time a town pump was sunk into the source of the ancient spring and when the first decayed another took its placeand then another and still anothertill here stand i gentlemen and ladies to serve you with my iron goblet  drink and be refreshed  the water is as pure and cold as that which slaked the thirst of the red sagamore beneath the aged boughs though now the gem of the wilderness is treasured under these hot stones where no shadow falls but from the brick buildings  and be it the moral of my story that as this wasted and longlost fountain is now known and prized again so shall the virtues of cold water too little valued since your fathers days be recognized by all  your pardon good people  i must interrupt my stream of eloquence and spout forth a stream of water to replenish the trough for this teamster and his two yoke of oxen who have come from topsfield or somewhere along that way  no part of my business is pleasanter than the watering of cattle  look  how rapidly they lower the watermark on the sides of the trough till their capacious stomachs are moistened with a gallon or two apiece and they can afford time to breathe it in with sighs of calm enjoyment  now they roll their quiet eyes around the brim of their monstrous drinkingvessel  an ox is your true toper  but i perceive my dear auditors that you are impatient for the remainder of my discourse  impute it i beseech you to no defect of modesty if i insist a little longer on so fruitful a topic as my own multifarious merits  it is altogether for your good  the better you think of me the better men and women will you find yourselves  i shall say nothing of my allimportant aid on washingdays though on that account alone i might call myself the household god of a hundred families  far be it from me also to hint my respectable friends at the show of dirty faces which you would present without my pains to keep you clean  nor will i remind you how often when the midnight bells make you tremble for your combustible town you have tied to the town pump and found me always at my post firm amid the confusion and ready to drain my vital current in your behalf  neither is it worth while to lay much stress on my claims to a medical diploma as the physician whose simple rule of practice is preferable to all the nauseous lore which has found men sick or left them so since the days of hippocrates  let us take a broader view of my beneficial influence on mankind  no these are trifles compared with the merits which wise men concede to meif not in my single self yet as the representative of a classof being the grand reformer of the age  from my spout and such spouts as mine must flow the stream that shall cleanse our earth of the vast portion of its crime and anguish which has gushed from the fiery fountains of the still  in this mighty enterprise the cow shall be my great confederate  milk and water  the town pump and the cow  such is the glorious copartnership that shall tear down the distilleries and brewhouses uproot the vineyards shatter the ciderpresses ruin the tea and coffee trade and finally monopolize the whole business of quenching thirst  blessed consummation  then poverty shall pass away from the land finding no hovel so wretched where her squalid form may shelter itself  then disease for lack of other victims shall gnaw its own heart and die  then sin if she do not die shall lose half her strength  until now the frenzy of hereditary fever has raged in the human blood transmitted from sire to son and rekindled in every generation by fresh draughts of liquid flame  when that inward fire shall be extinguished the heat of passion cannot but grow cool and warthe drunkenness of nationsperhaps will cease  at least there will be no war of households  the husband and wife drinking deep of peaceful joya calm bliss of temperate affectionsshall pass hand in hand through life and lie down not reluctantly at its protracted close to them the past will be no turmoil of mad dreams nor the future an eternity of such moments as follow the delirium of the drunkard  their dead faces shall express what their spirits were and are to be by a lingering smile of memory and hope  ahem  dry work this speechifying especially to an unpractised orator i never conceived till now what toil the temperance lecturers undergo for my sake  hereafter they shall have the business to themselves  do some kind christian pump a stroke or two just to wet my whistle  thank you sir  my dear hearers when the world shall have been regenerated by my instrumentality you will collect your useless vats and liquorcasks into one great pile and make a bonfire in honor of the town pump  and when i shall have decayed like my predecessors then if you revere my memory let a marble fountain richly sculptured take my place upon this spot  such monuments should be erected everywhere and inscribed with the names of the distinguished champions of my cause  now listen for something very important is to come next  there are two or three honest friends of mineand true friends i know they arewho nevertheless by their fiery pugnacity in my behalf do put me in fearful hazard of a broken nose or even a total overthrow upon the pavement and the loss of the treasure which i guard  i pray you gentlemen let this fault be amended  is it decent think you to get tipsy with zeal for temperance and take up the honorable cause of the town pump in the style of a toper fighting for his brandybottle  or can the excellent qualities of cold water be not otherwise exemplified than by plunging slapdash into hot water and wofully scalding yourselves and other people  trust me they may  in the moral warfare which you are to wageand indeed in the whole conduct of your livesyou cannot choose a better example than myself who have never permitted the dust and sultry atmosphere the turbulence and manifold disquietudes of the world around me to reach that deep calm well of purity which may be called my soul  and whenever i pour out that soul it is to cool earths fever or cleanse its stains  one oclock  nay then if the dinnerbell begins to speak i may as well hold my peace  here comes a pretty young girl of my acquaintance with a large stone pitcher for me to fill  may she draw a husband while drawing her water as rachel did of old  hold out your vessel my dear there it is full to the brim so now run hone peeping at your sweet image in the pitcher as you go and forget not in a glass of my own liquor to drinksuccess to the town pump
