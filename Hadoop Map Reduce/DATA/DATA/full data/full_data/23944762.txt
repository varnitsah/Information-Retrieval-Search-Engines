there was a vacation at the school which he was attending at that time the vacation commenced in the latter part of august and was to continue for four or five weeks rollo had studied pretty hard at school and he complained that his eyes ached sometimes  the day before the vacation commenced his father became somewhat uneasy about his eyes and so he took him to a physician to see what should be done for them the physician asked rollo a good many questions all of which rollo endeavored to answer as correctly as he could  at length the physician told rollos father that all he needed was to let his eyes rest i think he had better not use them at all said he for reading or writing for several weeks and not to be out much in the hot sun  rollo felt very much rejoiced at hearing this prescription though still he looked very sober for he felt somewhat awed and restrained by being in the doctors office there were a good many large books in cases upon one side of the room and strange uncouthlooking pictures hanging up which so far as rollo could see did not look like any thing at all then there was an electric machine upon a stand in one corner which he was afraid might in some way shock him and some frightfullooking surgical instruments in a little case which was open upon the table in the middle of the room  in fact rollo was very glad to escape safely out of the doctors office and he was if possible still more rejoiced that he had so light and easy a prescription he had thought that perhaps the doctor would put something on his eyes and bandage them up so that he could not see at all or else give him some black and bitter medicines to take every night and morning  instead of that he said to himself as he came out at the door i have only got to keep from studying and that will be capital i can play all the time true i cant read any story books but then i am willing to give the story books up if i dont have to study  rollo had usually been obliged to read or study or write a little even in vacations for his mother said that boys could not be happy to play all the time rollo however thought that she was mistaken in this it is true that she had sometimes allowed him to try the experiment for a day or two and in such cases he had always somehow or other failed of having a pleasant time but then he himself always attributed the failure to some particular difficulty or source of trouble which happened to come up then but which would not be likely to occur again  in fact in this opinion rollo was partly correct for it was true that each day when he failed of enjoying himself there was some peculiar reason for it and exactly that reason would not be likely to exist another day but then the difficulty with playing or attempting to amuse ones self all the time is that it produces such a state of mind that almost any thing becomes a source of uneasiness or dissatisfaction and something or other is likely to occur or there will be something or other wanting which makes the time pass very heavily along  it is so with men as well as boys men sometimes are so situated that they have nothing to do but to try to amuse themselves but these men are generally a very unhappy class the poorest laborer who toils all day at the hardest labor is happier than they  so that the physicians prescription was in reality a far more disagreeable one than rollo had imagined  when rollo reached home he told his mother that he was not to have any thing more to do with books for a month  and you look as if you were glad of it said she with a smile  yes mother i am said rollo rather glad  and what do you expect to do with yourself all that time said she  o i dont know said rollo perhaps i shall help jonas a part of the time about his work  that will be a very good plan for a part of the time said his mother though he is doing pretty hard work just now  what is he doing  he is digging a little canal in the marsh beyond the brook to drain off the water  o i can dig said rollo and i mean to go now and help him  this was about the middle of the forenoon and rollo taking a piece of bread for a luncheon and a little tin dipper to get some water with to drink out of the brook walked along towards the great gate which led to the lane behind his fathers house it was a pleasant green lane and there were rows of raspberrybushes on each side of it along by the fences some years before there had been no raspberries near the house but one autumn when jonas had a good deal of ploughing to do down the lane he ploughed up the ground by the fences in this lane making one furrow every time he went up and down to his other work then in the spring he ploughed it again and by this time the turf had rotted and so the land had become mellow then jonas went away with the wagon one afternoon about two miles to a place where the raspberries were very abundant and dug up a large number of them and set them out along this lane on both sides of it and so in a year or two there was a great abundance of raspberries very near the house  rollo stopped to eat some raspberries as he walked along he thought they would do exceedingly well with his bread to give a little variety to his luncheon after he had eaten as many as he wanted he thought he would gather his dipper full for jonas as he was busy at work and could not have time to gather any for himself  he got his dipper full very quick for the raspberries were thick and large he thought it was an excellent plan for jonas to plant the raspberrybushes there but then he thought it was a great deal of trouble to bring them all from so great a distance  i wonder said he to himself as he sat upon a log thinking of the subject why it would not have been just as well to plant raspberries themselves instead of setting out the bushes the raspberries must be the seeds i mean to take some of these big ones and try i dare say theyll grow  but then he reflected that the spring was planting time and he knew very well that raspberries would not keep till spring and so he determined to ask jonas about it he accordingly rose up from the log and walked along carrying his dipper very carefully in his hand  at length he reached the brook there was a rude bridge over it made of two logs placed side by side and short boards nailed across them for a footway it was only wide enough for persons to walk across the cattle and teams always went across through the water at a shallow place just below the bridge  rollo lay down upon the bridge and looked into the water there were some skippers and some whirlabouts upon the water the skippers were longlegged insects shaped somewhat like a cricket and they stood tiptoe upon the surface of the water rollo wondered how they could keep up their feet did not sink into the water at all and every now and then they would give a sort of leap and away they would shoot over the surface as if it had been ice rollo reached his hand down and tried to catch one to examine his feet but he could not succeed they were too nimble for him he thought that if he could only catch one and have an opportunity to examine his feet he could see how it was that he could stand so upon the water rollo was considering whether it was possible or not that jonas might make something like the skippers feet for him to put upon his feet so that he might walk on the water when suddenly he heard a bubbling sound in the brook near the shore he looked there and saw some bubbles of air coming up out of the bottom and rising to the top of the water he thought this was very singular it was not strange that the air should come up through the water to the top for air is much lighter than water the wonder was how the air could ever get down there  from wondering at this extraordinary phenomenon rollo began to wonder at another quite different question that is where all the water in the brook could come from he looked at a little cascade just above the bridge where the water rushed through a narrow place between two rocks and watched it a few minutes wondering that it should continue running so all the time forever and surprised also that he had never wondered at it before  he looked into the clear transparent current which poured steadily down between the rocks and said to himself  strange there it runs and runs all the timeall day and all night all summer and all winter all this year and all last year and every year where can all the water come from  then he thought that he should like to follow the brook up and find where it came from but he concluded that it must be a great way to go through bushes and rocks and marshes and he saw at once that the expedition was out of the question for him  just then he heard another gurgling in the water near him and looking down he saw more bubbles coming up to the surface very near where they had come up before rollo thought he would get a stick and see if he could not poke up the mud and find out what there was down there to make such a bubbling he thought that perhaps it might be some sort of animal blowing  he went off of the bridge therefore and began to look about for a stick he had just found one when all at once he heard a noise in the bushes he looked up suddenly not knowing what was coming but in a moment saw jonas walking along towards him  ah jonas said rollo are you going home  yes said jonas unless you will go for me  well said rollo what do you want me to get  i want some fire to burn up some brush you can bring out the lantern  very well said rollo i will go only i wish you would tell me where these bubbles come from out of the bottom of the brook  what bubbles said jonas  so rollo took his stick and pushed the end of it down into the mud and that made more bubbles come up  they are bubbles of air said jonas  but how comes the air down there said rollo under the water  i dont know said jonas and besides i must not stay and talk here i must go back to my work i will talk to you about it when you come back so jonas returned to his work and rollo went to the house again after the lantern  when he came back to the brook he found that he could not make any more bubbles come up but instead of that his attention was attracted by some curiously colored pebbles near the shore he put his hand down into the water and took up two or three of them he thought they were beautiful then he took his dipper which had all this time been lying forgotten by the side of a log on the shore and walked alongthe dipper full of raspberries in one hand the lantern in the other and his bright and beautiful pebbles in his pocket  rollo followed the path along the banks of the brook under the trees until at length he came out to the open ground where jonas was at work there was a broad meadow or rather marsh which extended back to some distance from the brook and beyond it the land rose to a hill just at the foot of this high land at the side of the marsh farthest from the brook was a pool of water which had been standing there all summer and was half full of green slime jonas had been at work cutting a canal or drain from the bank of the brook back to this pool in order to let the water off the last time that rollo had seen the marsh it had been very wet so wet that it was impossible for him to walk over it it was then full of green moss and sedgy grass and black mire with tufts of flags brakes and cranberrybushes here and there all over it if any person stepped upon it he would immediately sink in except in some places where the surface was firm enough to bear one up and there the ground quivered and fluctuated under the tread for some distance around showing that it was all soft below  when rollo came out in view of the marsh he saw jonas at work away off in the middle of it not very far from the pool so he called out to him in a very loud voice  jonashalloa  footnote a see frontispiece  jonas who had been stooping down at his work rose up at hearing this call and replied to rollo  rollo asked him how he should get across to him  o walk right along said jonas the ground is pretty dry now go up a little farther and you will find my canal and then you can follow it directly along  so rollo walked on a little farther and found the canal where it opened into the brook he then began slowly and cautiously to walk along the side of the canal into the marsh and he was surprised to find how firm and dry the land was he thought it was owing to jonass canal  jonas said he as he came up to where jonas was at work this is an excellent canal it has made the land almost dry already  o no said jonas my canal has not done any good yet  what makes the bog so dry then said rollo  o it has been drying all summer and draining off into the brook  draining off into the brook repeated rollo  yes said jonas  but there is not any drain said rollo at least there has not been until you began to make your canal  but the water soaks off slowly through the ground and oozes out under the banks of the brook  does it said rollo  yes said jonas and the only use of my canal is to make it run off faster  ah now i know said rollo half talking to himself  know what asked jonas  why where all the water of the brook comes from at least where some of it comes from  how said jonas i dont know what you mean  why i could not think where all the water came from to keep the brook running so fast all the time but now i know that some of it has been coming all the time from this bog does it all come from bogs  illustration  yes from bogs and hills and springs and from the soakings of all the land it comes through from where it first begins  where does it first begin said rollo  o it begins in some bog or other perhaps just a little dribbling stream oozing out from among roots and mire and it continually grows as it runs  is that the way said rollo  yes said jonas that is the way  during all this time rollo had been standing with his lantern and his dipper in his hands while jonas had continued his digging rollo now put the lantern down and handed the dipper to jonas telling him that he had brought him some raspberries  jonas seemed quite pleased with his raspberries while he was eating them rollo asked him if a raspberry was a seed  no said jonas the whole raspberry is not the seeds are in the raspberry they are very small when you eat a raspberry you can feel the little seeds by biting them with your teeth  rollo determined to pick some seeds out and see how they looked but jonas told him that the way to get them out was to wash them out in water  take some of these raspberries said he in the dipper to the brook and pour in some water over them then take a stick and jam the raspberries all up and stir them about and then pour off the water but keep the seeds in next pour in some more water and wash the seeds over again and so on until the seeds are all separated from the pulp and left clean  is that the way they get raspberry seeds said rollo  yes said jonas i believe so i never tried it myself but i have heard them say that that is the way they do with raspberries and strawberries and all such fruits  rollo immediately went and washed out some seeds as jonas had directed and when he came back he spread them out upon a piece of birch bark to dry while they were there jonas let him kindle the pile of brush wood which he had been intending to burn it had been lying all summer and had got very dry in the mean time jonas continued digging his canal and was gradually approaching the pool of water when he had got pretty near the pool he stopped digging the canal and went to the pool itself he rolled a pretty large log into the edge of it for him to stand upon and with his hoe he dug a trench beginning as far in the pool as he could reach with his hoe while standing upon his log and working gradually out towards where he had left digging the canal the bottom of the pool was very soft and slimy but he contrived to get a pretty deep and wide trench out quite to the margin and a little beyond  now said he to rollo i am going to dig the canal up to the end of this trench and then the water will all run very freely  there was now a narrow neck of land between the end of the canal and the beginning of the trench and as jonas went on digging the canal along this neck grew narrower and narrower rollo began to be impatient to see the water run he wanted jonas to let him hoe a little passage so as to let it begin to run a little  no said jonas  why not said rollo  there are two good reasons he replied the first is it will spoil my work and the second is it will spoil your play  what do you mean by that said rollo  why if i let the water run a little now it will flood me here where i am digging and make all muddy and i cannot finish my canal so easily so it will spoil my work then besides we want to see the water run in a torrent but if i let you dig a little trench along across the neck so as to let it off by degrees you will not take half as much pleasure in seeing it run as you will to wait until it is all ready so it will spoil your play  rollo did not reply to this and jonas went on digging  well said rollo after a short pause i wish jonas you would tell me how the bubbles of air get down into the mud at the bottom of the brook  i dont know said jonas  it seems to me it is very extraordinary said rollo  it is somewhat extraordinary i have thought of another extraordinary phenomenon somewhat like it  what is that said rollo  the rain replied jonas  the rain said rollo how  why the rain replied jonas is water coming down out of the air and the bubbles are air coming up out of the water  then it is exactly the opposite of it said rollo  yes said jonas  but you said it was like it  well and so it is jonas replied  like it and yet exactly opposite to it jonas that is impossible  why yes said jonas the air gets down into the water and you wonder how it can when it is so much lighter than water so water gets up into the air and i wonder how it can when it is so much heavier so that the difficulty is just about the same  no said rollo it is just about opposite  very well said jonas jonas never would dispute whenever any body said any thing that he did not think was correct he would sometimes try to explain it but then if they persisted he would generally say very well and that would prevent all dispute this is an excellent way to prevent disputes or to end them when they are begun  while jonas was digging slowly along through the neck of land rollo was rambling about among the bushes and at length jonas heard a sudden scream from him jonas looked up and saw rollo scrambling away from a little thicket and then presently stopping to look back apparently frightened  what now rollo said jonas  here is a great hornets nest said rollo  jonas laid down his spade and went to where rollo was rollo pointed to a little bush where jonas saw hanging to a bough not far from the ground a small hornets nest about as big as a common snowball and as round jonas walked slowly up towards it watching it very attentively as he advanced  o jonas jonas exclaimed rollo youd better be careful jonas jonas youll get stung  jonas paid no attention to what rollo was saying but still kept moving slowly on towards the bush when he got pretty near he took his knife out of his pocket and advancing one step more he took hold of the end of the branch with one hand and cut it off close to the tree with the other rollo in the mean time had run backwards several steps to avoid the danger still however keeping his eyes fixed upon jonas  jonas brought the nest out of the thicket  jonas said rollo in a tone of strong remonstrance you are crazy  there are no hornets in it said jonas quietly  he brought out the nest and held it so that he and rollo could see it  the hornets have made it of brown paper said he  brown paper said rollo where do they get the brown paper  o they make the brown paper too  ho said rollo hornets cant make paper  think not said jonas jonas was always careful not to contradict even when he supposed that rollo was mistaken  rollo said he was sure that hornets could not make paper then jonas took off a little shred from the hornets nest and compared it with some brown paper which he had in his pocket and he explained to rollo that the hornets nest was made of little fibres adhering to each other just as the fibres of the paper did  it is the same article he said and made of the same materials only they manufacture it in a different way so i dont see why it is not proper to call it paper  i dont think it is paper said rollo nothing is paper but what men make  very well said jonas we wont dispute about the name  so jonas returned to his work and rollo said that he meant to carry the hornets nest home and show it to nathan he accordingly laid it down by the side of his fire near the dipper and the raspberry seeds  in a short time jonas reduced the neck of ground where he was digging to a very narrow wall and he called rollo to come and see him let out the water he took the shovel and he told rollo to take the hoe so that as soon as he should break down this wall they could both be at work digging out the passage way so as to get it cleared as soon as possible  he accordingly began and soon made a breach through which the water rushed with considerable force into the canal and then wandered along rapidly towards the outlet into the brook rollo pulled away with his hoe hauling out mud moss grass and water up upon the bank where he stood and jonas also kept at work clearing the passage with the spade in a short time they had got a fine free course for the water and then they stood still one on each side of the bank watching the torrent as it poured through  at length the water in the pool began to subside gradually and then it did not run so fast through the canal and pretty soon after this jonas said he thought it was time for them to go home to dinner so rollo put up his raspberry seeds in a paper and put them into his pocket and carried his hornets nest in his hand jonas took the dipper and the lantern and thus the boys walked along together     a false alarm   as rollo and jonas walked along towards home rollo told jonas that he thought he had been very successful in collecting curiosities that day  why what curiosities have you got besides your hornets nest asked jonas  why there are my raspberry seeds said rollo i think they are a curiosity and besides that i have got some very beautiful bright pebbles in my pocket  let us see them said jonas  so rollo put his hand into his pocket and drew forth several pebbles but they were by no means as beautiful as he had imagined they looked rough and dull  they were very bright when i got them said rollo  that is because they were wet said jonas pebbles always look brightest and most beautiful when they are in their own proper place in the brook and that is the reason why i think it is generally best to leave them there  rollo looked at his faded pebbles with an air of disappointment he asked jonas if there was no way of keeping them bright all the time  i think it probable that they might be oiled and the oil would not dry  ho said rollo i should not like to have them oiled  nor i said jonas i should rather leave them in the brook  but is not there any other way  they might be varnished said jonas that would bring out the colors and the varnish would dry so that you could handle them  that would do said rollo if i only had some varnish  but the best way is to polish them said jonas  how is that done asked rollo  o it is very hard to do replied jonas they grind them on stones and then they polish them on polishing wheels  i wish i could do it said rollo  it is not worth while to take so much pains with any of your curiosities said jonas because you very soon get tired of them and throw them away  o no said rollo i never throw them away  you leave them lying about the house and yard then and so other people throw them away  rollo knew that this was true and so he did not contradict jonas  its not of much use to collect curiosities said jonas unless you have a museum  a museum said rollo  yes that is a cabinet to put them in and keep them safe then when you have done looking at them yourself you put them away safely and after a time you get a great many collected and you take pleasure in looking them over from time to time and showing them to other boys that come to see you  well said rollo i should like to have a museum  o you could not keep one said jonas  why not said rollo  you have not patience and perseverance enough you would be very much pleased with it for a day or two but then you would get interested in other plays and let your museum all get into disorder  rollo was silent he knew that what jonas said was true  i dont know but that your cousin lucy might keep a museum said jonas she is more careful than you are  and cousin james could help us find the curiosities said rollo  so he could said jonas i think it might be a very good plan  but what shall we have for our cabinet to put them in said rollo  why sometimes they have something like a bookcase replied jonas with shelves and glass doors then the curiosities are all put upon the shelves and you can see them through the glass doors but this can only be done with very valuable curiosities  why asked rollo  because such a case with glass doors costs a good deal of money and it is not worth while to pay so much money only to keep common things such as your pebble stones  but we have got such a bookcase already made it is in mothers chamber said rollo  yes said jonas but it is full of books sometimes they keep a museum in the drawers of a bureau but that is not a very good plan  why not said rollo  because when you open and shut the drawers it joggles the curiosities about  does it said rollo  yes replied jonas but there is one thing you can doi did not think of it before there is a good large box in the barn and i can put some shelves into it and make the cover into a door and if you want to collect a museum you can do it in that you can keep it out in the play room and so it will not trouble any body in the house  jonas meant by the play room a pretty large room in the barn made originally for a sort of granary but which the children were accustomed to use for a play room  rollo was very much pleased with this plan he determined to collect a museum and to put his hornets nest in it for the first thing as soon as he got home as he found that dinner was not quite ready he and jonas went out into the barn to look at the box it was a large box which had been made to pack up a bureau in so that the bureau should not get injured in the wagon which it was brought home in as it happened the box was smooth inside and out and the cover of it was made of two boards which jonas had taken off carefully when he took the bureau out and had then tacked them on again thinking that he might perhaps want it some time or otherbox covers and all  now it happened as it generally does to persons who take care of things that the article which jonas thus preserved came into use exactly the box he said would be just the thing he showed rollo how he could place it so that it would make a convenient sort of cabinet  i can put it upon its end said he and then i can put on the two cover boards with hingesone pair of hinges on each side then the covers will make little doors and it will open like a book case only it will not be quite so elegant  i think it will be very elegant indeed said rollo and you can make it for us this afternoon  no said jonas not this afternoon  why not said rollo  o i must attend to my work in the meadow  o no said rollo i mean to ask my father to let you make it this afternoon  no id rather you wouldnt said jonas  why not asked rollo i know he will let you  yes i suppose he would let me if you were to ask him but that would spoil the museum  spoil it said rollo  yes said jonas the way to spoil any pleasure is to neglect duty for the sake of it work first and play afterwards thats the rule  well but jonas we want to begin our museum this afternoon  very well said jonas you may begin collecting your curiosities you know and you can put them all in a safe place and have them all ready to put in when i get the case made  rollo did not quite like this plan but he knew that jonas was always firm when it was a question of right and wrong and so he said no more only after a moments pause he asked jonas when he would make the cabinet  the first rainy day replied jonas  then i hope it will rain tomorrow said rollo and he went out of the barn to see if it was not cloudy but the sun shone bright and the sky was clear and serene                                       while rollo was looking up at the sky trying to find some appearance of rain he heard a chaise coming and looking out into the road he saw that his cousin james was in it  ah said he to himself there comes cousin james now i will have a frolic with him by means of my hornets nest  so rollo ran into the garden and slyly fixed his hornets nest up in a lilac bush and then ran out to the front of the house to find his cousin but his cousin was nowhere to be found the chaise was at the door the horse being fastened to a post but nobody was near it so rollo went into the house to see if he could find james  they told him in the house that james had gone through the house into the yard in pursuit of rollo  rollo then ran out again and at length found james and after talking with him a minute he said  come james let us go into the garden  so they walked along towards the garden rollo telling james by the way about the canal which jonas had made that day at length when they reached the lilac bush rollo looked up and started in pretended fright saying  o james look there  o exclaimed james it is a hornets nest  so tis said rollo run run  james and rollo started off at these words and away they ran down the alley rollo convulsed with laughter at the success of his stratagem at length they stopped  now how shall we get back said james for the lilac upon which rollo had put the hornets nest was close to the garden gate  i am not afraid to go said rollo  so rollo walked along boldly james following slowly and with a timid air remonstrating with rollo for his temerity  rollo said he rollo take care you had better not go  but what was his surprise and astonishment at seeing rollo go deliberately up to the bush and take down the twig that had the hornets nest attached to it and hold it out towards him  i put it up there said rollo there are no hornets in it  still james was somewhat afraid he knew of course now that there could be no hornets in it but still the association of the idea of danger was so strong with the sight of a hornets nest that he could not feel quite easy at length however he came up near to it and examined it attentively  what made you frighten me so rollo said he  o only for fun said rollo  but you deceived me said james and i dont think that that was right it is never right to deceive  o i only did it for fun said rollo  james insisted upon it that it was wrong and rollo that it was not wrong and finally they concluded to leave it to jonas so they both went to him and told him the story  wasnt it wrong asked james  it wasntwas it said rollo  it was deception added james  but it was only in fun said rollo  one or the other of you must be to blame said jonas  how asked rollo  why james seems displeased with you for frightening him so and now either you must have done wrong and given him just cause for his displeasure or else if you did right then his displeasure is unreasonable and so it is ill humor  the boys did not answer  so that the question is did rollo do wrong or is james out of humor  why i think deception is always wrong said james  did you ever play blindmansbuff asked jonas  yes replied james  and did you ever go and squeak in a corner and then creep away to make the blind man think you were there and so go groping after you  why yes said james but that is not deception  why dont you try to make the blind man think you are in the corner when in fact you have gone  yes said james  and is not that trying to deceive him  yes said james hesitating buti think that that is a very different thing  how is it different said jonas  it is probable that james would have found some difficulty in answering this question but in fact he did not have the opportunity to try for just then he heard some one calling him and he and rollo went into the house they wanted him to go and so he got into the chaise and rode away promising to come and see rollo in the afternoon if he could get permission soon after this rollo sat down with the rest of the family to dinner he determined to commence in earnest the work of collecting curiosities that afternoon     the hemlockseed   james came to play with rollo that afternoon and rollo explained to him his plan of collecting a museum of curiosities james was very much interested in it indeed and he said that he had some shells and some guinea peas at home which he would put into it  rollo went to show him the box out of which jonas was going to make the cabinet the first rainy day then the boys went out again to see if there were yet any signs of a storm but they looked in vain there were no clouds to be seen except here and there a few of those white fleecy tufts floating in the heavens which indicate fair weather rather than rain  the boys played together in the yard for some time among other things they amused themselves by collecting some flowers and pressing them in a book suddenly james said  o rollo let us go and get some bluebells to press they will be beautiful  where said rollo  among the rocks by the road beyond the bridge said james there are plenty of them among those rocks  the place which james referred to was a rocky precipice by the road side about a quarter of a mile from the house just at the entrance of a small village rollo approved of the proposal and he went in and asked his mothers permission to go  she consented and rollo when he came back through the kitchen said to dorothy who was sitting at the window sewing  dorothy we are going to get some bluebells to press  ah said dorothy where are you going for them  o out by the bridge said rollo as he passed on to go out at the door  o rollo said she calling out to him suddenly as if she recollected something stop a minute  so rollo came back to hear what she had to say  you are going pretty near the village  yes said rollo  and could you be so kind as to do an errand for me  yes said rollo what is it  then dorothy went to her worktable and began to open it saying all the time  i want you to get some medicine for sarah for she is sick  sarah was a friend of dorothys who lived at another house not far from rollos and rollo used sometimes to see her at his fathers when she came over to see dorothy she was in very feeble health and now wanted some medicines dorothy had been over at the house where she lived that day and had found that the doctor had left her a prescription but she had nobody to send for it and she was not quite able to go herself so dorothy told her that if she would let her have the money she would ask rollo or jonas to go  so sarah gave her a dollar bill and in order to keep it safe she put it in a little morocco wallet and tied it up securely with a string this wallet was what dorothy was looking for in her worktable she took it out and untied the string she opened the wallet and showed rollo the money in one of the pockets and a small piece of white paper upon which was written the names of the medicines which the doctor wished sarah to take such a writing is called a prescription  rollo looked at the prescription to see what sort of medicines it was that he was to get but he could not read it the words were short and strange and had periods at the end of themwhich rollo told dorothy was wrong as periods ought to be only at the end of a sentence then there were strange characters and marks at the ends of the lines and rollo after examining it attentively said he could not read a word of it and he did not believe that the apothecary could however he said he was willing to take it to him and let him try  he accordingly put the prescription back again carefully into the wallet and dorothy tied it up then he put it into his pocket and went out to james he found james waiting by the gate and they both walked along together  he and james had each a book to put their bluebells in they walked along talking about their flowers until at length they reached the bridge just beyond it was the rocky precipice with shrubs and evergreens growing upon the shelves and in the crevices and spaces between the rocks it towered up pretty high above the road and the declivity extended also down to the brook below the bridge forming one side of the deep ravine across which the bridge was built there was a very large old hemlocktree growing upon a small piece of level ground between the ravine and the higher part of the precipice under this hemlocktree was a large smooth flat stone where the boys used very often to come and sit when they came to play among these rocks  illustration  the boys rambled about among the rocks sometimes down in the ravine and near the brook and sometimes very high up among the rocks they were both pretty good climbers and there were no very dangerous places for there were no high perpendicular precipices they found bluebells in abundance and several other flowers they also found a variety of brakes of different forms and colors they determined to gather as many flowers as they could and then go down to the hemlocktree and there look them over and select those best to be pressed and then put them carefully into their books there then they could carry them home safely they would in fact be in press all the way  after rambling and climbing about for half an hour the boys went down to the flat rock under the hemlock with large bunches of plants and flowers in their hands here they sat another half hour looking over their specimens and putting them into their books at length rollo picked up a singularlooking thing which was lying down by the side of the stone under the tree it was about as big as his thumb and somewhat pointed at the ends it was black and rather glossy and the surface was marked regularly with little ridges james could not imagine what it was but rollo told him that he thought it must be a hemlockseed the truth was that it was a great chrysalis though rollo did not find it out till long afterwards  a hemlockseed said james  yes said rollo i have seen the cones which grow on firtrees and they are a good deal like this  but they are not so handsome said james  i know it said rollo they are not so handsome this is the most beautiful one i ever saw  we can plant it said james next spring  yes said rollo and then we can have a great hemlocktree near our house  but we shall have to wait a great many years said james  o no not a great many said rollo it is such a great seed i think it would grow pretty fast  but james did not like the idea of planting it very well he proposed that they should keep it for a curiosity in their museum rollo insisted at first upon planting it but at length reflecting that it was not then the right season to plant it he concluded to put it into the museum with his raspberryseeds until the next spring and to plant it then  so rollo put the hemlockseed into his pocket and he and james took their books under their arms with a great many flowers and plants carefully placed between the leaves and walked along towards the village when they arrived at the apothecarys rollo put his book down upon the counter and then took the wallet from his pocket and untied the string and took the prescription out and handed it to the apothecary the apothecary was talking with another man at the time but he took the prescription and rollo watched his countenance to see how perplexed and puzzled he would look when he tried to read it instead however of appearing perplexed and puzzled the apothecary only glanced his eye over it and laid it down upon the counter and immediately began to look upon his shelves to find the articles  thats strange said rollo to himself he reads it as easily as i should a guide board  while the apothecary was weighing out his medicines rollo was very much interested in looking at the little pair of scales in which he weighed them rollo never had seen so small a pair of scales the weights too were small square weights of brass with little figures stamped upon them he asked the apothecary what such scales as those would cost he answered that they were of various prices from one dollar to five rollo thought that that was too much for him to give but while he was thinking whether his father would probably be willing to let him have a dollar to buy a pair with james said that he wished he had such a pair of scales  so do i said rollo then we could play keep store we could have our store out in the play room and weigh things  so we could said james we could put a long board upon two barrels for a counter  o you must make your scales boys said the apothecary  how can we make them said rollo  why you can get a good stout knittingneedle for a beam tie a silk thread around the middle of it to hold it up by and slip it along until you get it so that the needle will exactly balance then for scales you must cut out two round pieces of thin pasteboard then take three threads for each scale and run them through the pasteboard near the edge and at equal distances from each other you must tie knots at the lower ends of the threads to keep them from drawing through then you must gather the other ends of the threads together about half a foot from the pasteboard and tie them to the ends of the knittingneedle one on each side and that will make a very respectable pair of scales for you  but what shall we do for weights asked rollo  o weightsyes you must have some weights you must make them of lead i will show you how  so the apothecary took a small piece of sheet lead rather thin and cut off a little square of it he then put it into one of his scale balances and put a thin square weight of brass similar to it into the other scale the lead weight was a little too heavy he then clipped off a very little with his scissors this made it about right then with the point of his scissors he scratched a figure 1 upon it there said he boys there is a standard for you  what is a standard said rollo taking up the weight  why it is a weight made exactly correct for you to keep and make yours by it is a onegrain weight i will give you some sheet lead and when you get home and have made your scales you can cut off another piece and weigh it by that and so you will have two onegrain weights then you can put those two into one scale and a piece of lead as big as both of them into the other scale and when you have made it exactly as heavy as both of the others you must mark a figure 2 upon it and then you will have a twograin weight in the same way you can make a fivegrain weight and a tengrain weight and a pennyweight  what is a pennyweight said rollo  it is a weight as heavy as twentyfour grains  the pennyweight will be very big then said rollo  yes said the apothecary but you can take a little strip of lead like a ribbon and then roll it up when you have made it just heavy enough and then it will not take up much room so you can make another roll for two pennyweights and another for five pennyweights and another for ten pennyweights  and another for twenty pennyweights said james  yes only twenty pennyweights make an ounce so you will call that an ounce weight but you cannot weigh more than an ounce i should think in your knittingneedle scales  by this time the apothecary had put up the medicines and he gave them to rollo there was a middlesized parcel and a very small parcel and small round box rollo put them all into the pocket of his pantaloons then he opened his wallet and took out the bill and gave it to the apothecary the apothecary handed him the change it was half a dollar and one small piece of silver besides rollo put the change back into the wallet and tied it up just as it had been before and then crowded the wallet back into his pocket by the side of the parcels which the apothecary had given him     a little law   that evening when rollos father came home he went out at the door leading to the garden yard and looked into the yard to see if rollo was there he was not to be seen  his father then took the bell which always hung in the entry and began to ring it at the door this bell was the one that was rung for breakfast dinner and supper and when rollo was out they generally called him in by ringing it at the door  while rollos father was ringing the bell dorothy opened the door which led from the kitchen into the entry and said to rollos father  are you ringing for rollo sir  yes he replied  he has gone to the village said dorothy he has gone back to look for a pocketbook which he dropped coming home or else left at the apothecarys  a pocketbook said his father with surprise  yes sir said dorothy he went to get some medicine for sarah and when he came home the pocketbook was missing  was there any money in it said he  yes sir replied dorothy  how much  i dont know sir how much  rollos father then put the bell back into its place and walked again into the parlor he was afraid that there was a good deal of money in the pocketbook and that it was all lost  he however went on attending to his own business until by and by he heard rollos voice in the kitchen he called him in rollo and james came in together  have you found the pocketbook asked mr holiday  no sir said rollo i have looked all along the road and inquired at the apothecarys but i cant find any thing of it  well now i want you to tell me the whole story and especially if you have done wrong about it in any way dont attempt to smooth and gloss it over but tell me that part more plainly and distinctly and fully than any other  well sir said rollo with a very serious air i will  we went to the apothecarys to get some medicines for sarah when i was there i put the change in the wallet and put the wallet in this pocket  it was a wallet then said his father  yes replied rollo a wallet or a small pocketbook i suppose now that it would have been better to have put it in some other pocket because that was pretty full so in that i suppose i did wrong then james and i came home only we did not walk along directly we played about a little from one side of the road to the other and then we went under the great hemlocktree to see if we could not find another hemlockseed  another hemlockseed said his father  yes sir said rollo i suppose it is a hemlockseed  what was it a sort of a cone  yes sir said rollo with ridges upon it  now it is true that pines firs and other evergreens bear a sort of cone which contains their seed and rollos father thought from rollos description that it was one of these cones which rollo had found in fact the cone was somewhat similar in shape though if he had shown it to his father he would have known immediately that it was a very different thing rollo put his hand into his pocket to show the supposed hemlockseed to his father but it was not there he had left it out in the play room  very well said his father i dont know that i ever saw the cone of the hemlock but very probably this is one of them but go on about the pocketbook  well sirwhen we got home i took out the medicines but the pocketbook was nowhere to be found and i have been back with james and we have looked all along the road and under the hemlocktree and we have inquired at the apothecarys but we cannot find it any where  how much money was there in the wallet said his father  half a dollar and a little more said rollo  rollos father felt somewhat relieved at finding that the loss was after all not very large he placed confidence in rollos account of the facts and having thus ascertained how the case stood he began to consider what was to be done  it is a case of bailment said he to rollo and the question is whether you are liable  a case of what said rollo  bailment said his father when one person intrusts another with his property for any purpose it is called bailing it to him the wallet and the money were bailed to you the law relating to such transactions is called the law of bailment and the question is whether according to the law of bailment you ought to pay for this loss  rollo seemed surprised at such a serious and legal view of the subject being taken he waited however to hear what more his father had to say  i dont suppose continued his father that sarah will commence an action against you but law is generally justice and to know what we ought to do in cases like this it is generally best to inquire what the law requires us to do  well sir said rollo and how is it  why you see said his father there are various kinds of bailments a thing may be bailed to you for your benefit as for instance if james were to lend you his knife the knife would be a bailment to you for your benefit but if he were to ask you to carry his knife somewhere to be mended and you should take it then it would be a bailment to you for his benefit  well sir i took the wallet for sarahs benefit not mine said rollo  the law requires continued his father that you should take greater care of any thing if it is bailed to you for your benefit than it does if it is for the benefit of the bailor for instance if you were to borrow jamess knife for your own benefit and were to lose it even without any special carelessness you ought to get him another for it was solely for your advantage that you took it and so it ought to be at your risk but if he asked you to take the knife to get it mended for his benefit then if you accidentally lose it without any particular carelessness you ought not to pay for it for it was placed in your hands for his advantage and so it ought to be at his risk  well said rollo the wallet was given to me for sarahs advantage not mine and so i ought not to pay for it  that depends upon whether it was lost through gross carelessness or not for when any thing is bailed to you for the benefit of the owner if it is lost or injured through gross carelessness then the law makes you liable as for instance suppose you take jamess knife to get it mended and on your way you throw it over the fence among the grass and then cannot find it you ought to pay for it for you were bound to take good ordinary care of it  well sir said rollo  well repeated his father now as this property was bailed to you solely for the advantage of the bailor the question whether you ought to pay for the loss of it depends on whether you was grossly careless or not if you took good ordinary care and it was lost by accident then you are not liable  well father i think it was accident i do truly  i rather think so myself said his father with a smile and i am inclined to think that you are not responsible if any body asks a boy like you to carry money for them gratuitously then they take themselves the ordinary risks of such a conveyance and i think that on the whole this accident comes within the ordinary risks there was not such gross carelessness as to make you liable but then i am very sorry to have sarah lose her money  so am i said rollo and the wallet is gone too  how good a wallet was it asked his father  o pretty good only it was considerably worn  havent you got one that is pretty much the same that you dont care a great deal about  yes sir said rollo it is in my desk i had as lief that she would have it as not  very well said his father you give her your wallet and i will replace the money  so rollo went to his desk and soon came back bringing his little wallet he unfastened its steel clasp and opened the wallet and took out some little pictures which he had treasured up there and some small pieces of white paper which he said were marks they were to put into his books to keep the place when he was reading he had got quite a quantity of them all prepared for use when rollo had got his wallet ready his father took out half a dollar from his pocket and also another small silver coin about as large as rollo said the one was which was lost and then sent rollo to carry it to dorothy  in a few minutes rollo came back with the money in his hand and said  she wont take it she said i must bring it back it was as much as i could do to get her to take the wallet  but she must take it replied his father you carry it to her again and tell her she has nothing to do with the business the money is for sarah and she must not refuse it but take it and give it to her the first opportunity  so rollo carried the money again to dorothy she received it this time and put it in the wallet and then deposited both in a safe place in her worktable then rollo came back to his father to ask him a little more about bailments  father said rollo when he came back if james should give me his knife or any thing for my own would that be a bailment  no said his father a bailment is only where property is intrusted to another for a certain purpose to be returned again to the possession of the owner when the purpose is accomplished for instance when jonas is sawing wood with my saw the saw is a bailment from me to him it remains my property but he is to use it for a specific purpose and then return it to my possession  he does not bring it back to you said rollo  no but he hangs it up in its place in my shed which is putting it again in my possession and so all the things which dorothy uses in the kitchen are bailments  and if she breaks them must she pay for them  no not unless she is grossly careless if she exercises good ordinary care such as prudent persons exercise about their own things then she is not liable because she is using them mainly for my benefit and of course it must be at my risk but if sarah should come and borrow a pitcher to carry some milk home in and should let it fall and break it by the way even if it was not gross carelessness she ought to pay for it that is the person that sent her ought to pay for it for it was bailed to her for her benefit alone and therefore it was at her risk  i should not think you would make her pay for it said rollo  no i certainly should not i am only telling what i should have a right to do if i chose  sometimes a thing is bailed to a person continued rollos father for the benefit of both persons the bailor and the bailee  the bailee said james  yes the bailee is the person the thing is bailed to for instance if i leave my watch at the watchmakers to be mended and i am going to pay him for it in that case you see it is for his advantage and mine too  and then if it is lost must he pay for it  yes unless he takes good care of it if it is for his benefit alone then he must take special care of it or else he is liable for the loss of it if it is for my benefit alone then he must take ordinary care of it for instance suppose i had a very superior repeater watch which the watchmaker should come and borrow of me in order to see the construction of it then suppose i should leave another watch of minea leverat his shop to be repaired suppose also i should have a third watch a ladys watch which i had just bought somewhere and i should ask him to be kind enough to keep it for me a day or two till my watch was done these would be three different kinds of bailments the repeater would be bailed to him for his benefit the lever for his and mine jointly and the ladys watch for my benefit alone  now you see continued rollos father that if these watches should get lost or injured in any way the question whether the watchmaker would have to pay for them or not would depend upon the degree of care it would have required to save them for instance if he locked them all up with special care and particularly the repeater and then the building were struck with lightning and the watches all destroyed he would not have to pay for any of them for this would be an inevitable accident which all his care could not guard against it would have been as likely to have happened to my repeater if i had kept it at home  but suppose now he should hang all three watches up at his window and a boy in the street should accidentally throw a stone and hit the window so that the stone should go through the glass and break one of the watches now if the repeater was the one that was hit i should think the man would be bound to pay for it because he was bound to take very special care of that as it was borrowed for his benefit alone but if it was the ladys watch which he had taken only as an accommodation to me then he would not be obliged to pay for by hanging it up with his other watches he took ordinary care of it and that was all that he was obliged to take  i should think said james that the boy would have to pay if he broke the watches  yes said rollos father but we have nothing to do with the boy now we are only considering the liabilities of the watchmaker  and if it had been the lever that was broken asked rollo what then  why as to the lever said his father he was bound to take good care of itsomething more than mere ordinary care and i dont know whether the law would consider hanging watches up at a window as good care or not it would depend upon that i suppose but the watches might be lost in another way suppose the watchmaker had sent the repeater home to me and then at night had put the lever and the ladys watch into a small trunk with his other watches and carried them to his house as watchmakers do sometimes now suppose that when he got home he put the trunk of watches down in a corner of the room and suppose that there was a leak in the roof of his house so that the water could come in sometimes when it rained in the night there comes up a shower and the water gets into the trunk and rusts and spoils the watches now i think it probable that he would not have to pay for the ladys watch for he took ordinary care of thatthat is the same care that he was accustomed to take of his own watches but he might have to pay for the other for he was bound to take good care of that one as it was partly for his benefit that it was bailed to him and putting them where they were at all exposed to be wet would be considered i suppose as not taking good care of them  and so he would not have to pay for the ladys watch in any case said rollo  yes he would if he did not take ordinary care of it that is if he was grossly negligent for instance if he should take all the rest of his watches home and leave that in his shop upon the counter where i had laid it down and somebody should come in the night and steal it then perhaps he would be liable  by this time rollos father began to think that his law lecture had been long enough for such young students and so he said that he would not tell them any more about it then but now said he in conclusion i want you to remember what i have said and practise according to it boys bail things to one another very often and a great many disputes arise among them because they dont understand the law of bailment it applies to boys as well as men it is founded on principles of justice and common sense and of course what is just and equitable among men is just and equitable among boys  you must remember that whenever any thing belonging to one boy is intrusted to another in any way if it is for the benefit of the bailee if any accident happens to it he must make it good unless it was some inevitable accident which could not have been prevented by the utmost care if it is for the benefit of the bailor that is the boy who intrusts it then he cant require the other to pay for it unless he was grossly negligent and if it was for the common benefit of both then if the bailee takes what may be called good care of it he is not liable to pay if he does not take good care he is  here ended the lecture on the law of bailment james soon after went home and rollo in due time went to bed the next morning when he got up and began to dress himself he thought one of the legs of his pantaloons felt somewhat heavy he put his hand down to ascertain what was there and he felt something at the bottom between the cloth and the lining it was sarahs pocketbook when rollo put it into his pocket as he thought he in reality slipped it inside of the lining and it worked itself down to the bottom as he was playing about he pulled it out and then after he had dressed himself he ran very joyfully to his father to show it to him his father was very glad that it was found and told rollo to carry it to dorothy dorothy was very glad too for she was very sorry to have rollo lose his own wallet or his father lose his money so she gave him back his wallet and he replaced it in his desk where it was before after giving his father back his money     confusion   rollo explained his plan of collecting a museum of curiosities to his cousins lucy and james and to his sister mary who was a good deal older than he was he also informed henry a playmate of his who lived not a great way from his fathers house all the children took a great deal of interest in the scheme and promised to help him collect the curiosities  at length after a few days rollo to his great joy observed one evening signs of an approaching storm the wind sighed through the trees and thick hazy clouds spread themselves over the sky  dont you think it is going to rain said rollo to his father as he came in to tea  i dont know said his father which way is the wind  ill go and see said rollo  he went out and looked at the vane which jonas had placed upon the top of the barn  when he came in he told his father that the wind was east then his father said he thought it would rain and rollo clapped his hands with delight  and it did rain the next morning when rollo awoke he heard the storm driving against the window of his chamber after breakfast he took an umbrella and went out into the barn and found jonas already at work upon the cabinet in the course of the morning he finished it he put three good shelves into it which together with the bottom of the box made four shelves he also put the two covers on with hinges so as to make doors of them and put a little hasp upon the doors outside to fasten them with he then put it up in one corner of the play room all ready for the curiosities rollo put in his hornets nest his pebble stones and his hemlockseed as he called it and then went to the barn door and began to be as eager to have it clear up as he had been before to have it rain he wanted to go out and collect some more curiosities  after a time it did clear up and rollo obtained his mothers leave to go and ask all the children who were going to have a share in the museum to come one afternoon and begin to collect the curiosities they all camelucy james and henry and when rollo saw them all collected in the garden yard with baskets in their hands all ready to go forth after curiosities he capered about full of anticipations of delight  now said henry let us go down to the hemlocktree  no said rollo it will be better to go to the brook where i found the pebbles  but i want to go and see if i cant find another hemlockseed said henry  rollo was however very unwilling to go that way and yet henry insisted upon it lucy listened to the dispute with a countenance expressive of distress and anxiety first she proposed to rollo to yield to henry and then to henry to yield to rollo but in vain henry said that rollo ought to let him decide because he was the oldest and rollo said that he himself ought to decide because it was his museum they were both wrong neither ought to have insisted upon having his own way so strenuously at length after quite a long and unpleasant altercation lucy proposed that they should draw lots for it the boys consented  ill tell you a better plan than that said a voice above them they looked up and saw mary sitting at the window of the chamber she had been reading but on hearing this dispute she had closed her book and now interposed to do what she could to aid in settling it  when rollo heard his sister marys voice he felt a little ashamed of his pertinacity lucy asked mary what the plan was  why said she in all expeditions where there are several children it is very desirable to have a regent  a regent said lucy  yes said mary a commander to take the lead and decide the thousand little questions which are likely to occur unless there is somebody to decide them there will be endless disputes  well said henry ill be regent  no said mary you must choose one ill tell you how you must choose the regent by ballot lilac leaves make good ballots each one of you must consider who you think will be best for regentthat is who will have the most discretion and judgment to decide wisely and at the same time be mild and gentle and amiable in manner so as to be a pleasant commander of course no one must vote for himself  but i dont understand said rollo what are the lilac leaves for  for ballots that is for you to write your votes upon you can write on the under side of a lilac leaf with the point of a pin  can we said lucy with a look of curiosity and pleasure  yes said mary you need not write the whole name you can write the first letterthat will be enough r stands for rollo l for lucy h for henry j for james and n for nathan  ho said rollo nathan wont do for a regent  perhaps not said mary each one of you must vote for the one you think best now get your lilac leaves and i will drop you down some pins  the children ran off very eagerly to get the leaves and then came back and mary dropped down four pins they each took one and with the point of it wrote a letter upon the back of the leaf then mary asked nathan to carry around his cap and let them all drop their leaves into it and then bring them up to her and she would see who was chosen  so nathan highly pleased with his office collected the votes in his cap and brought them up to his sister mary she looked them over as she sat at the window the children all looking up from below eagerly awaiting the result at length mary told them that there were four leaves in nathans cap and that three of them had the letter l upon it so said she you see you have chosen lucy for regent  yes i voted for lucy said rollo i thought she would be the best  and so did i said james and henry  lucy looked down and felt a little embarrassed at finding herself raised so suddenly to the dignity of regent and she asked mary what she was to do  o walk along with them just as you would if you had not been chosen only you will decide all the questions that come up such as where you shall go and how long you shall stay in the different places the others may give you their opinions if you ask them but they must let you decide and they must all submit to your decisions  well come said lucy well go down the lane first so she took hold of thannys hand and walked along the other children following they passed through the great gate and soon disappeared from marys view  they were gone two or three hours at length when the sun had nearly gone down mary heard voices in the front of the house she left her back window and went around to a front window to see she found them returning and all talking together with the greatest volubility they had their baskets full of various commodities and large bouquets of flowers and plants in their hands they did not see mary at the window and as they all seemed to be goodnatured and satisfied with their afternoons work mary did not speak to them and so they passed along into the yard undisturbed they proceeded immediately to the cabinet in the play room and then began to take out their treasures from their baskets and pockets and handkerchiefs and to spread them out upon the floor and upon the bench in a short time the floor was covered with specimens of plants and minerals with shells and pebbles and little papers of sand and nuts and birds nests which they had found deserted and all sorts of wonders the room was filled with the sound of their voices questions calls to one another expressions of delight exclamations of surprise or of disappointment or pleasure it was alljames you are treading on my flowers o lucy lucy see my toadstool o now my prettiest shell is broken move away a little rolloi have not got room for all my pebbleswheres my silk worm now wheres my silk worm o henry give me some of your birch bark doand a hundred other similar ejaculations all uttered together  they soon began one and another to put their curiosities into the cabinetand then it was as the old phrase is confusion worse confounded lucy had some discretion and forbearance and kept a little back looking however uneasy and distressed and attempting in vain to get an opportunity to put some of her things in the boys crowded around the cabinet each attempting to put his own curiosities into the most conspicuous places and arranging them over and over again according as each ones whims or fancies varied  o dear me said rollo i wish you would not keep moving these pebbles away henry  why you put them too far this way said henry i want my shells to go here  no replied rollo put your shells down on the next shelf james james take care dont touch that birds nest  yes i want room for my silver stone said james he had found a shining stone which he called a silver stone and thus they disputed and talked loudly and vociferously and contradicted interrupted pushed and crowded each other still they were all goodnatured that is they were not angry the difficulty only arose from their eagerness and their numbersand their disorganization  o dear me said rollo at length i wish we had a regent again we got along very well while lucy was a regent let me be regent now come henry and james let me be regent and i will direct and then we shall have order again  well said james  no said henry you have not been elected you cant be regent unless you are chosen regularly  lucy said nothing but stood behind the others in despair  well then let lucy be regent she was chosen  but i was only chosen regent for the walk said lucy  o never mind said rollo let her be regent now  but henry was not disposed to submit to any doubtful authority he kept at work putting things in in the way that pleased him most without any regard to rollos proposal for prolonging lucys authority as henry did not acquiesce in this proposed measure rollo and james seemed to think it was useless for them to do so and so they went much as they had begun until they had pretty well filled up jonass cabinet with a perfect medley of specimens the worthy and the worthless all together they were at length interrupted by the sound of the bell calling rollo in to tea henry then went home and james lucy and rollo went into the house     organization   james and lucy staid and took tea with rollo that evening and during tea time rollos father and mother were talking and the boys were all still at last just before they had finished their supper rollos father asked them how they had got along collecting curiosities  o we had a very good time said rollo till we came to put our curiosities away and then we should have had a good time if the boys had not pushed so and made such a noise  what made them do so asked his mother  i dont know unless it was because we did not have any regent  any what said his father  any regent said rollo we had lucy for a regent while we were walking and then we got along very well but she would not be regent any longer when we got home  rollos father and mother scarcely knew what to make of this for they had never heard before of a regent in childrens plays but as they looked towards mary and observed that she was smiling they at once understood that it was one of her plans rollos father said he thought it was an excellent idea  but why did not you have a regent when you were putting your things away just as you had before he asked  why lucy said she was only chosen for the walk  and so she would not serve any longer  no sir  that was right lucy never attempt to command without a commission  but rollo added his father i should think it would be best for you to have some sort of organization if you are going to attempt to do any thing in company men never think that they can accomplish any thing in company without organization and i should certainly think that children would not be able to  organization said rollo what is that  why some plan for investing some persons with authority there must always be authority to decide little questions without debate and for getting the opinions of all on great questions regularly  if a number of men he continued were going to form a cabinet of curiosities they would form a society they would choose one to be president and one to be secretary and one to be cabinet keeper  what does the president do asked lucy  the president decides who shall speak when several want to speak at the same time and so he prevents all confusion nobody must speak without his leave  do they have to ask him said rollo  yes in fact they ask him though not formally in words they ask him by rising in large meetings among men whoever wants to speak stands up and then the president calls their name and that is giving him permission to speak if more than one stand up at a time then he calls the name of one of them and he has leave to speak and the other must sit down  which one does he call asked rollo  the one whom he happens to notice first he must be careful not to call his friends more than he does other persons he must be impartial then besides the president puts the question  puts the question asked rollo what is putting the question  why after all has been said about the plan that they want to say the president asks all that are in favor of it to hold up their hands and he counts them then he asks all that are against it to hold up their hands he counts these too and it is decided according to the number of votes  is that the way they do said rollo  yes replied his father that is the way that men do but boys all talk together and dispute if some want to play ball and some want to play horses they all talk together and dispute it is alli say we will and i say we wontand those that make the most noise get the victory  the mens way is the best said rollo  i think so myself replied his father  and what does the secretary do asked mary  the secretary keeps the record he writes an account of every meeting  does he write all that every body says asked rollo  no said his father only the decisions  well said rollo with a tone of satisfaction and the cabinet keeper keeps the cabinet i suppose  yes said his father and so all disputings about where the things are to be placed in the cabinet are avoided for he decides the whole he must be a person of judgment and skill  jonas would be a good cabinet keeper for us said rollo  i think you had better form a regular society rollo said mary  well said rollo will you belong to it  yes said mary  and we can choose our officers by lilac ballots said james  well have the first meeting tomorrow afternoon said rollo i will go in the morning and ask henry to comeif mother will let me                                       his mother did let him and the next afternoon the children all collected in the yard intending to form their society and proceed regularly mary promised to meet with them and help them make their arrangements they were to meet in the play room  before the time of the meeting mary went in and with rollos help made some seats of boards not far from the cabinet so that all the members of the society might sit down the children played about in the yard some gathering lilac leaves for ballots and some talking about the curiosities they meant to collect until at length mary came down and told them it was time to go and have their meeting she had a great many little papers in one hand and some pencils in the other james asked her what she was going to do with those papers she said they were for ballots  o we have been getting lilac leaves for ballots said lucy  papers are better said mary when there is a good deal of balloting to be done  then the children threw down the lilac leaves they had gathered and followed mary into the play room they all came around the cabinet and began to open it and talk about the curiosities but mary told them that if they were going to have a society they must not touch the cabinet until they had appointed a cabinet keeperthey ought all to go and sit down  so they went and sat down  and now you must not talk at all until the president is chosen said mary you must all write upon these papers the name of the person you think best for president and then bring them to me you see she continued as she distributed the papers around to the other children that i am acting as president just now until we get one chosen that is the way men do i asked father about it he said that the oldest person or one of the oldest generally took charge of the proceedings until a chairman was chosen  a chairman said rollo  illustration  yes or president sometimes they call him a chairman  so the children took their papers and began to prepare for writing their ballots  what shall we put our papers on cousin mary to write said lucy  o you must write on the seat by the side of youor on this book here is a book for one  i can write on my cap said james and he placed his cap upon his knees and began to use that for a desk one of the children took the book and others leaned over to one side and put their papers upon the seat and prepared to write there some began to write very soon others looked around mysteriously considering which one of the company would make the best president henry stood up by the great work bench and made that his writingdesk keeping a sharp lookout all the time lest rollo should see what he should write and thus the children prepared their votes for president  when the votes were all ready the children brought them all together to mary who put them on the corner of the great bench near which she was standing and the children all came up around them to see who was chosen  but mary gently put her hand over the votes and told them that that was not the way to count votes you must all go and sit down again she said and appoint some one to count them and then he or she must come alone and look them over and tell you who is chosen  well said the children and so they went back to their seats  i propose that henry count them said mary  well said the children  no let james said rollo  that is not right rollo said mary because it is of very little consequence who counts the votes and in societies the best way is to let things that are of little consequence go according to the first proposal that saves time  so henry came up and began to look over the votes  they are all for mary but one and that is for lucy said henry  then cousin mary is president said james clapping his hands  yes said mary it seems you have chosen me president and i will be president for a time until i think that some of the rest of you have learned how to preside and then i shall resign and leave you to manage your society yourselves now you must write the votes for secretary so mary took her seat in the chair which she had provided for the president and which until this time had been empty  so the children began to write votes again and as fast as they had written them they brought them to mary and dropped them in her lap as soon as each one had put in his vote he went back and took his seat when the votes were all in mary looked them over and said  there are two votes for lucy and one for rollo and one for henry  then lucy is chosen secretary said james  no said mary because she has only half the person that is chosen must have more than half of all the votes lucy has two and there are two scattering  scattering said rollo looking somewhat puzzled  yes that is for other persons  what shall we do then said rollo  why you must vote again  so the children wrote votes again and brought them in to the president she smiled as she looked them over then she said  now there is a tie  a tie mary said rollo what is a tie  why there are two votes for rollo and two for lucy that makes it exactly balanced and they call that a tie  and now what shall we do with the tie said rollo  why you must vote again  just as the children were preparing to vote again they heard a noise of footsteps at the door and looking up they saw nathan coming in he had his little straw hat upon his head and his whip in his hand he was playing marketman and wanted to know if they wished to buy any potatoes  the children all laughed mary said no thanny this is a society come dont you want to belong to the society  yes said nathan and down went his whip upon the floor and he came trotting along towards mary mary told him to sit down upon the seat next to rollo  nathan took his seat and began to look around with an air of great curiosity wondering what they were going to do and by this time the votes were ready mary looked them over and counted them and then said that they were just as they were before two for rollo and two for lucy  what shall we do now said rollo  we must vote again said james  that wont do any good said henry  theres thanny said lucy let him vote  well said mary and that will break the tie  o thanny cant vote said rollo he cant write a word  he can vote without writing said mary thanny come here which do you think will make the best secretary rollo or lucy  whylucy said thanny after some hesitation  lucy he says so lucy is chosen said mary now lucy you must be secretary but i forgot to bring out some paper  rollo looked a little disappointed he had hoped to have been secretary himself so when nathan came back to his seat he began to punch him a little goodnaturedly with his thumb saying mewhy didnt you say me thanny hey thanny why did not you say me  just then mary asked rollo to go into the house and get a sheet of paper for the secretary and when he came back lucy asked her what she should write mary gave her the necessary directions and then lucy went to the bench and standing there near the presidents chair she went on writing the record while the rest of the society proceeded with their business the next thing was to choose a cabinet keeper  you may prepare your votes for cabinet keeper  i think jonas would be the best cabinet keeper said henry he made the cabinet  o jonas does not belong to the society said rollo  but we can let him in said lucy  no he cant belong to the society said rollo he has too much work to do  the fact was that rollo wanted to be cabinet keeper himself and so he was opposed to any arrangement which would be likely to result in the election of jonas but mary said that it was not necessary that any one should be a member of the society in order to be chosen cabinet keeper she said he might be chosen if the children thought best even if he was not a member but then said she you must consider all the circumstances and vote for the one who you honestly think will take the best care of the curiosities and arrange them best  the children then wrote their ballots and brought them to mary mary asked lucy to count them lucy said she had not written her vote herself yet  well write it quick then said mary  but i cant think said lucy whether i had better vote for jonas or rollo  well said mary you have only to consider whether it will be best for the museum to be in jonass hands or in rollos  but i have been thinking said lucy that it is all rollos plan and his museum and that he ought to be cabinet keeper if he wants to be  there is something in that said mary though generally in choosing officers we ought to act for the good of the society not for the good of the officers  but it is my cabinet said rollo jonas made it for me  that may be said mary that is it may have been yours at the beginning but when you invite us all to come and form a society you give up your claim to it and it comes to belong to the society at any rate the right to manage it belongs to the society and we must do what will be best for the whole  rollo did not look very much pleased at these remarks of his sisters but lucy immediately wrote her vote and put it with the others she then examined and counted them and immediately afterwards she said there were three votes for jonas and one for rollo so jonas was chosen the children did not know who wrote the vote which was given for rollo but the fact was he wrote it himself he wanted to be cabinet keeper very much indeed     caughtand gone again   rollo was sadly disappointed at not being chosen cabinet keeper older and wiser persons than he have often been greatly vexed from similar causes when the society meeting was ended mary told lucy that she must tell jonas that they had chosen him cabinet keeper for she was secretary and it was the secretarys duty to do that mary then went into the house the children gathered around the cabinet and began to look at the things which had been put in the day before rollo undertook to arrange one of the shelves differently from what it had been but henry told him he must not touch the things for jonas was cabinet keeper and nobody but the cabinet keeper had any right to touch the things  o i am only going to change them a little said rollo  but you have no right to touch them at all said henry pushing rollo back a little  yes i have said rollo standing stiffly and resisting henrys push its my cabinet and i have a right to do what i please with it  no it is not your cabinet said henry it belongs to the society  no it doesnt said rollo  it does said henry  rollo was wrongand in fact henry was wrong in disputes it almost always happens that both boys are wrong lucy stood by looking distressed she was very sorry to have any disputing about the cabinet  o never mind henry said she let him move them jonas will put them all right afterwards  no said rollo i am going to keep the cabinet myself  this was not at all like rollo to be so unreasonable and angry but henrys roughness had irritated and vexed him and that in connection with his own determination to keep the charge of his cabinet had got him into a very wrong state of mind  lucy did not know what to do she walked slowly along to the door and after standing there a moment while rollo was at work upon the cabinet she said  o here comes jonas now  james and henry ran to the door and as they saw jonas walking up the lane they ran towards him followed by lucy and they all began eagerly to tell him about the society and about his having been chosen cabinet keeper lucy came up to them before they had finished their account and as they had all turned round when they met jonas they came walking along together towards the house james and henry talked very fast and eagerly they told jonas about the society and about their having chosen mary president and lucy secretary and him cabinet keeper when they had finished their account lucy added in a desponding tone  only rollo says he means to be cabinet keeper  does he said jonas  yes replied henry he says you made the cabinet for him and he will have it  o well said jonas let him be cabinet keeper he will make a very good cabinet keeper  no said james we want you to be cabinet keeper we chose you  they saw rollo at the door of the barn looking at them but not very goodnaturedly when they came up lucy said  come rollo let jonas be cabinet keeper thats a good boy  no said rollo its my cabinet and i mean to keep it myself  then we wont help you get the curiosities said henry  i dont care said rollo  and we wont have any society added jamesthinking that that threat would compel rollo to give up  but rollo only said  i dont care i dont want any society i can make a museum myself  there is no doubt but that many of the readers of this book will wonder that rollo should have acted in this manner and yet they themselves act in just such a way when they allow themselves to get out of temper it is very dangerous to allow ourselves to become vexed and angry we then do and say the most unreasonable things without being aware ourselves of their unreasonableness and folly rollo himself did not know how his conduct appeared to the other children and how it sunk him in their good opinion  rollo would have had a miserable time in attempting to make a collection of curiosities alone he would very soon have got tired of it and have abandoned the plan altogether it happened however that some circumstances occurred to prevent the consequences that his ill humor and obstinacy came so near occasioning  henry and james finding that rollo would not give up the cabinet to jonass care considered the plan of the society abandoned and went to play in the yard lucy went into the house to find her cousin mary rollo remained at the cabinet for some time but he found it very dull amusement to work there alone besides he heard the other boys voices out in the yard and before long he began to feel a strong desire to go and see what they were doing he accordingly went to the door of the barn he saw that henry and james had got a log of wood out and had placed a board across it for a seesaw rollo slowly walked along towards them  henry saw him gradually approaching and so he whispered or rather spoke in a low tone to james saying  here comes rollo james dont lets let him get on our seesaw  but james felt in more of a forgiving mood than henry he did not like quarrelling and he knew very well that peacemakers must be prepared to yield and forbear even if they had not been themselves in the wrong so he said  o yes henry let him have a ride he may get on my end  rollo he added calling to rollo as he came up do you want to seesaw you may have my end  rollo did not quite expect this gentle treatment and it made him feel a little ashamed he however took jamess place but he did not feel quite easy there he knew it was a place that he did not deserve pretty soon he proposed that they should all go after raspberries down the lane  well said henry and ill go and get my dipper  your dipper said rollo  yes said henry i brought a dipper  henry then went to a wood pile which was lying in the yard and looking behind it among the logs he drew out a small tin dipper and showed it to rollo  o i wish i had a dipper to carry said rollo it is better than a basket  rollo went into the house and presently returned bringing two small baskets  one for me said james interrogatively holding out his hand  yes said rollo  give me the other said henry and you shall have my dipper  well said rollo  i should rather have a basket said james  no said rollo i think a dipper is better i can get some drink with it if we come to any brook  but you must give me some drink out of the dipper if i want any said henry  well said rollo i will  though i can drink without a dipper said henry  how said rollo  o i can get a piece of elder and punch out the pith and that will make a hollow reed and i can draw up the water through that into my mouth  by this time rollo and henry had exchanged the basket and the dipper and they were all walking along together rollo told the boys of several other reasons why he would rather have the dipper on such an expedition but henry preferred the basket and so all were satisfied  they went on down the lane the berries were very thick the boys ate a great many and they filled their baskets and the dipper besides when they reached the bottom of the lane rollo proposed that they should go on through the woods to the brook they liked the plan they accordingly hid their baskets under the fence heaping full of raspberries rollo said that he should take his dipper with him so as to get a drink at the brook  but you cant use it to get a drink said henry it is full of raspberries  rollo had not thought of this difficulty he walked slowly along with the other boys a few minutes looking somewhat foolish but in a moment he said he meant to eat his raspberries up and then his dipper would be empty when he should get to the brook  so he began to eat them the other boys wanted some of them and he gave them some on condition that they should help him fill up his dipper again when they returned up the lane on their way home they assented to this condition and so the boys walked along eating the raspberries together in great harmony  they rambled about in the woods for some time meeting with various adventures until they reached the brook neither of the boys were thirsty not even rollo but still he took a drink from the brook for the sake of using the dipper he then amused himself for some time in trying to scoop up skippers and roundabouts but without much success the skippers and roundabouts have both been mentioned before the latter were a sort of bugs which had a remarkable power of whirling round and round with the greatest rapidity upon the surface of the water while rollo was endeavoring to entrap some of these animals the other boys were picking up pebbles or gathering flowers until at length their attention was suddenly arrested by a loud and long exclamation of surprise and pleasure from rollo  what said henry and james looking towards rollo  they saw that he was standing at the edge of the water gazing eagerly into his dipper  what is it said the boys running towards him  i have caught a little fish said rollo  true enough rollo had caught a little fish it was very small and as it had been swimming about there rollo had probably more by accident than skill got him into his dipper and there he was safely imprisoned  o what a splendid little fellow said henry crowding his head in between rollos and jamess over the dipper see his fins  yes said rollo it is a trouta little trout  see his eyes said james how he swims about what are you going to do with him rollo  o i shall carry him home and keep him  o you cant keep him said james you have not got any pond  never mind said rollo i can keep him in a bowl in the house  what shall you give him to eat said james  eat fishes never eat they only drink i shall give him fresh water every day and that will keep him alive  they do eat too said james they eat bait off of the hooks when we fish for them  rollo had forgotten this fact when he said that fishes never ate and having nothing to say in reply to it now he was silent and only looked at his fish  o i wish i had a fish said henry if i had kept my dipper now i might have had one  i dont believe you could have caught one said rollo  yes i could and i believe i will take my dipper after all and catch me a fish  no said rollo you lent me the dipper and i lent you my basket instead and now i must keep it till we get home  no said henry it is my dipper and i only lent it to you and i have a right to it whenever i want it so you must give it to me  but rollo was very far from being convinced that he ought to give back the dipper then he had borrowed it he said for the whole expedition and he had a right to keep it till he got home besides he had a fish in it and there was nothing that he could do with him if henry took away the dipper  but henry said he did not think of catching a little fish in his dipper when he lent it to rollo if he had he should not have lent it to him he only lent it to him to get raspberries in but rollo insisted that he had lent it to him for the whole expedition and to put any thing in it he pleased  after some time spent in this discussion rollo finally yielded he was in fact somewhat ashamed of the part he had taken in the former difficulty and had secretly resolved to be more goodnatured and yielding in future so he gave the dipper back to henry  before he did this however henry said that he would be very careful not to lose rollos fish  i will only dip the dipper in again said he very carefully to catch another fish without letting yours get out then we can carry both to your house and put yours in the bowl and then i can carry mine home in the dipper  so rollo gave the dipper back to henry though very reluctantly  henry carried it carefully down to the bank of the brook he stood upon a little sloping shore of sand and pebbles and began to watch for the little minnows which were swimming about in the deep places he immersed his dipper partially in the water being very careful not to plunge it in entirely lest rollos fish should escape whenever he made an attempt however to catch a fish he was obliged to plunge it in but he did it very quick so as not to give the prisoner already taken time to escape  at last a fish larger than any he had seen came moving slowly along out from a deep place under a large log which lay imbedded in the bank henry made a sudden plunge after him he drew up his dipper again confident that he had caught him but on looking into the dipper no fish was to be seen the bird in the hand and the bird in the bush were both gone  the boys tried for a long time in vain to catch another fish rollo was sadly disappointed at the loss of the one he had caught but there was now no help for it and so they all slowly returned home together     the bailment cases   as the boys were slowly coming up the lane towards the house they saw mary and lucy in the garden they went round into the garden to see what they were doing  they found them seated upon a bench in a pleasant part of the garden it was the same bench were rollo had once undertaken to establish a hive of bees mary was teaching lucy how to draw pictures upon lilac leaves and other leaves which they gathered here and there in the garden  the boys came up and asked to see what the girls were doing the girls did not say to them as girls sometimes do in such cases it is none of your concernyou go off out of the garden we dont want you here they very politely showed them their leaf sketchesand the boys at the same time with equal politeness offered them some of their raspberries in the course of the conversation as they sat and stood there rollo said to his sister  henry lost my fish mary and ought he not to pay me  your fish asked mary  yes said rollo i caught a fish in a dipper  and how came henry to have it  o i let him have it to catch another he made me  henry had some secret feeling that he had not done quite right in the transaction though he did not know exactly how he had done wrong he did not make any reply to rollos charge but stood back looking somewhat confused  ought he not to pay me repeated rollo  it seems to be a case of bailment said mary  o yes said rollo who now recollected his fathers conversation on that subject some days before  and so you know the question continued mary whether he ought to pay or not depends upon circumstances  well said rollo who began to recall to mind the principles which his father had laid down upon the subject it was for his benefit not mine and so he ought to pay  all this conversation about bailment and about its being for his benefit not rollos was entirely unintelligible to henry who had never studied the law of bailment at all he looked first at mary and then at rollo and finally said  i dont understand what you mean  so mary explained to him what her father had said she told him first that whenever one boy intrusted his property of any kind to the hands of another boy it was a bailment and that the question whether the one who took the thing ought to pay for it if it was lost depended upon the degree of care he took of it considered in connection with the question whether the bailment was for the benefit of the bailor or the bailee  what is bailor and the bailee said henry  why rollo bailed you his fish said mary rollo was bailor and you bailee  no said henry he only gave me back my dipper and the fish was in it  mary asked for an explanation of this and the boys related all the circumstances mary said it was an intricate case  i dont understand it exactly said mary you returned him his property which you had borrowed and at the same time put into his hands some property of your own i dont know whether it ought to be considered as only giving him back his dipper or bailing him the fish  i did not want the fish said henry  no said mary it is a knotty case let us go and ask father about it  o i dont want to go said henry  yes i would said mary ill be your lawyer and manage your side of the question for you and we will get a regular decision  well said henry reluctantly and all the children followed mary and lucy towards the house  they found rollos father in his room examining some maps and plans which were spread out upon the table before him when he saw the children coming in he asked mary who was foremost what they wanted she said they had a law question which they wanted him to decide  a law question said he  yes she replied a case of bailment  o very well walk in said he  there was a sofa at one side of the room and he seated the children all there while he drew up his armchair directly before them he then told them to proceed rollo first told the whole story closing his statement by saying  and so i let him have my fish and that was a bailment and it was not for my benefit but his and so he ought to have taken very especial care of it but he did not and lost it and so he ought to pay  but we maintain said mary that the fish was not bailed to henry at all rollo only gave him back the dipper and though the fish was in it still the fish did not do henry any good and so it was not for his benefit  it seems to be rather an intricate case said her father smiling  henry looked rather sober and anxious the proceedings seemed to him to be a very serious business  however rollos father spoke to him in a very kind and goodhumored tone so that before long he began to feel at his ease after hearing a full statement of the case and all the arguments which the children had to offer on one side or the other rollos father began to give his decision as follows  i think that rollos giving henry the dipper with the fish in it was clearly a bailment of the fish that is it was an intrusting of his property to henrys care it is clear also that henry took pretty good care of it he tried to avoid losing it he took as much care of it perhaps as he would have done of a fish of his own still he did not take very extraordinary or special care of it the loss was not owing to inevitable accident if the bailment was for rollos benefit the care he took was sufficient to save him from being liable but if it was for his own benefit then all he did was at his own risk and the loss ought to be his loss and he ought to pay for it  but i dont see said mary that he was to blame in either case  o no said his father he was not to blame for losing the fish perhaps that is not the point in these cases it is not a question of who is to blame but who ought to bear a loss for which perhaps nobody is to blame  and you see he continued that it is reasonable that the loss should be borne by the person who was to have derived benefit from the risk if the risk was run for henrys benefit then he ought to bear the loss which he would do by making rollo compensation if the risk was run for rollos benefit then rollo ought to bear the loss himself  yes sir said rollo and it certainly was for henrys benefit for he was trying to catch another fish for himselfnot for me i had no advantage in it  that is not so certain replied his father it depends altogether upon the question who had a right to the dipper at that time if henry had a right to the dipper then he might have even poured out the water fish and all or he might have kept the fish in to accommodate rollo on the other hand if rollo had a right to the dipper then and he let henry have it as a favor to him then in that case the bailment was for henrys benefit  well sir said henry i had a right to the dipper for it was mine and so it was for his benefit and i ought not to pay  no sir said rollo he had let me have it and i let him have my basket  i only lent it to him said henry  but you lent it to me for the whole walk said rollo turning round to henry  you must only speak to me said his father in all debates and arguments always speak to the one who is presiding  well sir said rollo turning back to his father again he lent it to me for the whole walk and so i dont think he had any right to take it back again  that is coming to the point exactly said his father it all depends upon thatwhether henry had a right to reclaim his dipper at that time after only lending it to rollo and that you see is another bailment case henry bailed rollo the dipper this shows the truth of what i said before that a great many of the disputes among boys arise from cases of bailment this seems to be a sort of doubled and twisted case and it all hinges on the question whether henry or rollo had the right to the dipper at the time when henry took it for as i have already explained if henry had a right to it then his keeping rollos fish in it was for rollos advantage and rollo ought to bear the loss but if rollo had a right to keep the dipper longer then he bailed the fish to him in order to be able to let him have the dipper for he could not let him have the one without the other and so it was for henrys benefit and as the loss was not from inevitable accident henry ought to bear it  well sir and now please to tell us said mary who had the right to the dipper  rollo said her father  rollo exclaimed several voices  yes replied rollos father there is a principle in the law of bailment which i did not explain to you the other day it is this whenever a person bails a thing to another person for a particular purpose and receives a compensation for it the bailor has no right to take it back again from the bailee until a fair opportunity has been allowed to accomplish that purpose for instance if i go and hire a horse of a man to make a journey i have a right to keep the horse until the journey is ended if the owner of the horse meets me on the road fifty miles from home it is not reasonable you see that he should have the right to take the horse away from me there on the ground that it is his horse and that he has a right to him wherever he finds him so if one boy lends another his knife to make a whistle with he ought not to take it away again when the boy has got his whistle half done and so make him lose all his labor  why it seems to me he ought to give it back to him said rollo if it is his knife whenever he wants it  yes replied his father he ought to give it up no doubt if the owner claims it and yet perhaps the owner might do wrong in claiming it though i am not certain after all how it is in case a thing is lent gratuitously  what is gratuitously said rollo  why for nothing without any pay perhaps the bailor has a right to claim his property again at any time if it is bailed gratuitously though i am not certain i will ask some lawyer when i have an opportunity but when a thing is let for pay or bailed on contract in any way i am sure the bailor ought to leave it in the hands of the bailee until the purpose is accomplished or at least until there has been a fair opportunity to accomplish it  wherefore i decide that as henry intended to let rollo have the dipper for the whole expedition and as he took rollos basket and rollo agreed to let him have some drink as conditions therefore he ought not to have reclaimed the dipper since he did reclaim it rollo did perfectly right to give it up fish and all and as he did so it was a bailment for the benefit of the bailee that is henry and of course it was at his risk and in strict justice rollo has a right to claim compensation for the loss of his fish but then i should hope he wont insist upon it  well sir said rollo i dont care much about it now  you see henry continued rollos father i havent been talking about this all this time on account of the value of the fish but to have you understand some of the principles you ought to regard when any others property is in your possession so now you may all go  well uncle said james as the children rose from their seats havent you got some great box that we can have for our cabinet  your cabinet asked his uncle  yes sir we want to make a museum  why rollo has got a cabinet jonas made him one  yes sir but he wants his for himself and we want one for our society  you may have mine now said rollo i am not going to have one alone i have concluded to let you have mine come  so rollo moved on as if he wished to go in fact he had an instinctive feeling that his conduct in respect to the cabinet and the society would not bear examination and he wanted to go  but his father afraid that rollo had been doing some injustice to his playmates stopped the children and inquired into the case the children told him that they had formed a society and had elected jonas cabinet keeper and that rollo had afterwards said he meant to be cabinet keeper himself and so would not let the society have his cabinet to keep their curiosities in  and did he first agree that the society might have it  no sir said rollo decidedly i did not agree to any thing about it he thought that this would exonerate him from all blame  was not there a tacit agreement asked his father  a tacit agreement repeated rollo he did not know what a tacit agreement was  yes said his father tacit means silent a tacit or implied agreement is one which is made without being formally expressed in words if it is only understood by both parties it is just as binding as if it were fully expressed for instance if i go into a bookstore and ask the bookseller to put me up certain books and take them and carry them home and then he charges them to me in his books i must pay for them for though i did not say any thing about paying for them yet my actions constituted an implied agreement to pay by going in and getting them under those circumstances i in fact tacitly promise that i will pay for them when the bookseller sends in his bill a very large portion of the agreements made among men are tacit agreements  the children all listened very attentively and they understood very well what rollos father was saying rollo was considering whether there had been a tacit agreement that the society should have the cabinet but he did not speak  now rollo did you consent to the formation of the society  yes sir said henry eagerly he asked us all to form the society  and was it the understanding that the museum was to be kept in the cabinet that jonas made  yes sir said rollo rather faintly  then it seems to me that there was a tacit agreement on your part that if the children would form the society and help you make the collection you would submit to whatever arrangements they might make about the officers and the charge of the cabinet you in fact bailed the cabinet to the society  yes sir said the children  and as the bailment was for your advantage as well as theirs you ought not to have taken possession of the property again until a fair opportunity had been afforded to accomplish the purpose of the bailment that is the collection of a cabinet by the society so you see you fell into the same fault in respect to the society that henry did in regard to you in the case of the dipper  the children were silent but they all perceived the justice of what rollos father had said  and the society have a claim upon you rollo for compensation for the disappointment and trouble you have caused them by taking away the cabinet  rollo looked rather serious  o we dont care about it said lucy  well said his father if the society release their claim upon you as you did yours upon henry very well i hope at all events you will all go on pleasantly after this  the children then went out and rollo followed by the other boys went to find jonas to tell him he might be cabinet keeper they tried to tell jonas the whole story and about rollos giving the fish to henry and its being a bailment but they could not make jonas understand it very well he said he did not know any thing about bailment except bailing out boatshe had never heard of bailing fishes     the curiosities   jonas accepted the office of cabinet keeper he inquired particularly of the children about the meeting of the society and as they stated to him the facts he perceived that rollo had been a good deal disappointed at not having been chosen to any office jonas was sorry himself that rollo could not have had some special charge as it was his plan at the beginning and the others had only joined it at his invitation when he observed also how goodnaturedly rollo acquiescedfor he did at last acquiesce very goodnaturedly indeedhe was the more sorry and so he proposed to rollo that he should be assistant cabinet keeper  i shall want an assistant said jonas for i have not time to attend to the business much i can give you directions and then you can arrange the curiosities accordingly and you can help me when i am at work there  rollo liked this plan very much and so jonas said that he might act as assistant cabinet keeper until the next meeting of the society and then he would propose to them to choose him regularly he told mary of this plan and she liked it very much indeed  the children had various plans for collecting curiosities they had meetings of the society once a week when they all came into the play room bringing in with them the articles which they had found or prepared these articles were there exhibited and admired by all the members and then were put upon the great workbench under the care of the assistant cabinet keeper they remained there until jonas had time to look them over and determine how to arrange them then he and rollo put them up in the cabinet in good order  mary did not collect many articles herself but she used to tell the children what they could get or prepare they made some very pretty collections of dried plants at her suggestion they would come to her as she sat in the house at her work and there she would explain to them in detail what to do and then they would go away and do it bringing their work to her frequently as they went on in respect to collections of plants she told them that botanists generally pressed them and then fastened them into great books between the leaves arranged according to the kinds  but you said she dont know enough of plants to arrange them in that wayand besides it would be too great an undertaking for you to attempt to prepare a large collection but you might make a small collection and select and arrange the flowers in it according to their beauty  lucy said she should like to do this very much and so mary recommended to her to go and get as many flowers as she could find and press them between the leaves of some old book which would not be injured by them lucy did so she was a week or two in getting them ready then she brought them to mary mary looked them over and said that many of them were very pretty indeed and that she could make a very fine collection from them  now said she you must have a book to keep them in  so mary went and got two sheets of large lightcolored wrapping paper and folded them again and again until the leaves were of the right size then she cut the edges  now said mary i must make some false leaves  false leaves said lucy what are they  o you shall see replied mary  she then cut one of the leaves which she had made into narrow strips and put these strips between the true leaves at the back where they were folded in such a manner that when she sewed the book the false leaves would be sewed in with the true but the false leaves being narrow strips only made the back thicker they did not extend out into the body of the book between the leaves but mary showed lucy that when she came to put in her flowers between the true leaves it would make the body of the book as thick as the back they would make it thicker were it not for these false leaves  yes said lucy i have seen false leaves in scrap books made to paste pictures in i always thought that they made the leaves whole first and then cut them out  no said mary that would be a great waste of paper it is very easy to make them by sewing in narrow strips  mary then asked lucy to sit up at the table and select some of her prettiest flowerssome large and some smallenough to fill up one page of her book and then to arrange them on the page in such a way as to produce the best effect and lucy did so then she gummed each one down upon the page by touching the under side here and there with some gum arabic dissolved in water but made very thick when she had done one page she turned the leaf over very carefully and laid a book upon it and then proceeded to make selections of flowers for the second page in this manner she went on through the book and it made a very beautiful book indeed mary put a cover and a titlepage to it and on the titlepage she wrote the title thus                                 a                            collection                                of                          common flowers                                by                               lucy  when it was all ready it was presented to the society and put into the cabinet where it was long known by the name of lucys collection she wrote the name of each plant under it as fast as she could find out the names and whenever visitors came to see the museum she would ask them the name of any of the flowers in her collection which she did not know and then wrote the name down thus after a time nearly all the names were entered and so whenever the children found any flower which they did not know they would sometimes go and look over lucys collection and there perhaps they would find the very flower with its name under it  this museum lasted several years and the next spring rollo made his collection of flowers which was larger than lucys mary helped him about it at first he was going to have it in a larger book but mary thought it would be better to have all the books of a size and then they would lie together very compactly in a pile which would not be the case if they had several books of different sizes she said if any one wanted to make a larger collection he had better have several volumes rollo made volume after volume until at last his collection consisted of six  there was one collection of leaves henry made it his object was to see how many differentshaped leaves he could get he did not regard the little differences which exist between the leaves of the same tree but only the essential differences of shape such as between the leaf of the oak and of the maple two or three pages were devoted to leaves of foresttrees and they looked very beautiful indeed leaves being naturally flat can be pressed very easily and they generally preserve their colors pretty well one page was devoted to the leaves of evergreens such as the pine fir spruce hemlock and they made a singular appearance they were so small and slender a little sprig of pine leaves was put in the centre and the others around then there were the leaves of fruittrees and plants such as the apple pear peach plum raspberry strawberry currant gooseberry c arranged by themselves and there were half a dozen pages devoted to brightcolored leaves gathered in the autumn after the frost had come these pages looked very splendidly the names of the plants to which all these leaves belonged were written under them and also the name given by botanists to indicate the particular shape of the leaf these names the children found in books of botany such for instance as serrated which means notched all around the edge with teeth like a saw like the strawberry leaf and cordate which means shaped like a heart as the lilac leaf is and many others  there was also a collection of brakes that rollo made which the children liked to look over very much there is a great variety in the forms of brakes or ferns and yet they are all regular and beautiful and are so flat that they are easily pressed and preserved but of all the botanical collections which were formed and deposited in this museum one of the prettiest was a little collection of petals which rollos mother made petals are the colored leaves of flowersthose which form the flower itself sometimes the flower cannot be pressed very well whole and yet if you take off one of its petals you find that that will press very easily and preserve its color finely so rollos mother every day when she saw a flower would put one of the leaves into a book and after a time she had a large collectionred and white and blue and yellow and brown in fact of almost every color then she made a little book of white paper because she thought the colors and forms of these delicate petals would appear to better advantage on a smooth white ground she then made a selection from all which she had preserved and arranged them upon the pages of her little book so as to bring a great variety both of form and color upon a page and yet forms and colors so selected that all that was upon one page should be in keeping and harmony  but it was not merely the botanical collections in the museum which interested the children they had some philosophical apparatus there was what the boys called a sucker which consisted of a round piece of sole leather about as big as a dollar with a string put through the middle and a stopknot in the end of it to keep the string from coming entirely through then when the leather was wet the boys could just pat it down upon a smooth stone and then lift the stone by the string the sucker appearing to stick to the stone very closely rollo did not understand how the sucker could lift so well his father said it was by the pressure of the atmosphere but in a way that rollo was not old enough to understand  then there was what the boys called a circular saw made of a flat circular piece of lead as large as the top of a tea cup jonas had hammered it out of a bullet there were sawteeth cut all around the circumference and two holes bored through the lead at a little distance from the centre one on each side there was a string passed through these holes and then the ends were tied together and to put the circular saw in motion this string was held over the two hands as the string is held when you first begin to play catscradle then by a peculiar motion this saw could be made to whirl very swiftly by pulling the two hands apart and then letting them come together againthe string twisting and untwisting alternately all the time there were various other articles of apparatus for performing philosophical experiments such as a prism a magnet pipes for blowing soap bubbles a syringe or squirtgun as the boys called it made of a reed which may be said to be a philosophical instrument  jonas made a collection of specimens of wood which was on the whole very curious as well as somewhat useful as he was at work sawing wood from day to day he laid aside small specimens of the different kinds as oak maple beech ash fir cedar c he generally chose small round pieces about as large round as a boys arm and sawed off a short piece about three inches long this he split into quarters and reserved one quarter for his specimen throwing the others away this quarter had of course three sides one was covered with bark and the other two were the split sides as fast as jonas got these specimens split out in this manner he put them in the barn upon a shelf near the bench and then one day he took them one by one and planed one of the split sides of each and then smoothed it perfectly with sand paper  rollo who was standing by at the time asked him why he did not plane them all around  o because said jonas they are for specimens and so we want them to show the bark on one side and the wood on the other side in its natural state and the third side is enough to show its appearance when it is manufactured  manufactured said rollo  yes said jonas planed and varnished as it is when it is made into furniture  are you going to varnish the sides that you plane  jonas said he was and he did so he planed one side and one end he varnished the planed side and pasted a neat little label on the planed end on the label he wrote the name of the wood and some very brief account of its qualities and uses when he knew what they were for instance on the end of the specimen of walnut was written in a very close but plain hand       walnut very tough and hard used for handles  after jonas had got as many specimens as he could from the wood pile he used to cut others in the woods when he happened to be there of kinds which are not commonly cut for fuel in this way he got after a time more than twenty different kinds and when they were all neatly varnished and labelled it made a very curious collection and it was very useful too sometimes for whenever the boys found any kind of a tree in the woods which they did not know all they had to do was to cut a branch of it off and bring it to the museum and compare it with jonass specimens in this way before long they learned the names of nearly all the trees which grew in the woods about there  there was a curious circumstance which happened in respect to rollos hemlockseed it has already been said that this supposed hemlockseed was really a chrysalis now a chrysalis is that form which all caterpillars assume before they change into butterflies and the animal remains within generally for some time in a dormant stateall the time however making a slow progress towards its development now rollos great chrysalis remained in a conspicuous position upon the middle shelf in the cabinet for some weeks rollo always insisted when he showed it to visitors that it was a hemlockseed jonas said he knew it was not and he did not believe it was any kind of seed but then he confessed that he did not know what it was and rollo considered that he had his fathers authority for believing it to be a hemlockseed because his father had said he thought it might be so judging however only by rollos description without having seen it at all rollo always asserted very confidently that it was a hemlockseed and that he was going to plant it the next spring  in the mean time the humble caterpillar within unconscious of the conspicuous position to which he had been elevated and the distinguished marks of attention he received from many visitors went slowly on in his progress towards a new stage of being when the time was fully come he very coolly gnawed a hole in one end of his glossy shell and laboriously pushed himself through his broad and beautiful wings folded up compactly by his side when he was fairly liberated he stood for two hours perfectly silent and motionless upon the shelf while his wings gradually expanded and assumed their proper form and dimensions it was rather dark for the doors were closed and yet sufficient light came through the crevices of jonass cabinet to enable him to see the various objects around him though he took very little notice of them it was a strange thing for him to be shut up in such a place with no green trees or grass or flowers around but having never turned into a butterfly before he did not know that there was any thing unusual in his situation  he began however in the course of six hours to feel decidedly hungry so he thought he would creep along in search of something to eat he tried his proboscis upon one curiosity after another in vain the magnet the sucker pebbles shells books every thing was hard dry and tasteless and at length discouraged and in despair he clambered up upon jonass specimen of maple poised his broad black leopardlike wings over his back and hung his head in mute despair he would have given all his newborn glories for one single supper from the leaf which he used to feed upon when he was a worm  it was just about this time that rollo lucy and jonas happened to come together to the cabinet to put in some new curiosity which they had found as soon as rollo opened the doors he perceived the hole in the end of the chrysalis which lay directly before him he seized it hastily  there now said he in a tone of sad disappointment somebody has been boring a hole in my hemlockseed  he took up the empty shell and looked at the hole  why jonas said he how light it is  jonas took the chrysalis weighed it in his hand looked into the hole and then said quickly  it is a chrysalis i verily believe and that is where the butterfly came out  what said rollo in a tone of utter amazement  that hole is where a butterfly came out said jonas i have no doubtand if we look about here a little we shall find him  they immediately began to look about and the butterfly as if he understood their conversation and perceived the necessity of a movement on his part just at that instant expanded his wings and floated off through the air into the middle of the room towards the bright sunshine which came in at the door he alighted upon the edge of a barrel which stood there rollo was after him in a moment with his cap in the air the butterfly however was too hungry to wait he was again upon the wing he soared away across the yard towards the garden and disappeared over the tops of the trees rollo and lucy looked for him for some time among the plants and flowers but in vain  never mind said jonas when they returned the butterfly had rather be free but he has left you the chrysalis shell and that notwithstanding the hole is a greater curiosity now than it was before     the seashore   rollos father and mother were very much pleased with the childrens plan of collecting a cabinet they often went out at rollos request to look at the curiosities  one evening about sunset when they were walking in the garden rollo proposed that before they went into the house they should go out and look at the museum they accordingly walked along rollo and mary taking hold of hands before and their father and mother walking arm in arm after them nathan was behind riding a stick for a horse and blowing a trumpet which rollo had made for him out of the stem of a pumpkin vine  i am a trooper said nathan to himself blowing a bugle then he would whip his horse sound his trumpet and gallop along  when they reached the door of the barn which led into the place where their museum was kept rollo turned round and said sharply  thanny be quiet dont make such a noise  speak pleasantly rollo said mary  well thanny said rollo taking hold of his arm and gently turning him away from the door go and blow your bugle somewhere else because we want to see our curiosities  thanny made no reply but being spoken to pleasantly he turned around and went galloping off and seeing the cat upon the fence he ran up and began trumpeting at her to frighten her away  in the mean time rollos father and mother looked over the curiosities as they had done many a time before rollo explained the wonders and his parents looked and listened with great satisfaction though they had been called upon to admire the same things for the same reasons twenty times before  but rollo said his father at length it appears to me that your cabinet has not increased much lately  why father we cant find any more curiosities i wish we could go to some new place  what new place can we go to said he  i dont know said rollo some place where there are some curiosities  we might go to the seashore and get some shells said mary  so we could said her father that would give you a fine addition  well father said rollo looking up very eagerly i wish you would let us go  i will think of it said his father  rollo knew that when his father said this he meant as he said and that he would really think of itand consequently that he himself ought not to say any thing more about it he accordingly soon began to talk to mary about other things and by and by they went into the house  the next day rollos father told him that they had concluded to make a party to go to the seashore there was a shore and a beach about twelve miles from where they lived and he said that they were going the next day in the carryall rollos father and mother with mary and her cousin lucy were to ride in the carryall and rollo and jonas in the wagon behind  we want cousin lucy to go with us said mr holiday in explaining the plan and so there will not be quite room for us all in the carryall besides we shall want jonass help probably in the expedition and then the wagon will be a good thing to bring back our treasures in  o father said rollo we shall not get more than a carryall full  no i suppose not said his father but the wagon will be better to bring stones and sand and shells you must put baskets in behind to pack them in  the next afternoon all was in readiness at the appointed hour the carryall was at the door waiting to receive its portion of the party and the wagon was fastened to a post behind jonas stood at the head of the carryall horse to hold him still while the people should be getting in rollo was near the wagon horse  shall i unfasten him jonas  you cant unfasten him said he  o yes i can if you will only let me try  rollo approached the horse and cautiously reached out his hands to unhook the chain from the ring at the horses mouth standing a good way back and leaning forward on tiptoe as if he thought the horse would bite him  what are you afraid of rollo said jonas  nothing said rollo only i cant reach very well  stand up nearer  but perhaps he might bite me  poh he never bites said jonas there is only one danger to guard against in unfastening such a horse as that  what danger said rollo  danger that he may step and tread on your foot  rollo looked down at his feet and began to consider this danger but just then his father and mother came out followed by the two girls and took their seats in the carryall jonas then came to the wagon and after helping rollo in he got in himself and away the whole party went very happily  after riding for some time rollos mother upon looking back towards the wagon saw that rollo was making signs as if he wanted them to stop she told mr holiday and he accordingly stopped his horse and waited until the wagon came up rollo had a plan to propose  father said he i wish you would let jonas come into the carryall and drive you and mother and let mary and cousin lucy come and ride with me  but who will drive said his father  ill drive replied rollo  o no said his mother he cant drive he will overturn the wagon  why mother i can drive said rollo i have been driving some time  i rather think there will be no danger said mr holiday to his wife turning towards her as she sat upon the back seat the road is pretty level and retired and he will keep close along behind the carryall  rollos mother looked rather doubtfully and yet she could not help feeling a certain degree of pleasure at thinking that rollo was old enough to drive alone she accordingly consented and the change was at once made rollos father and mother sat on the back seat of the carryall and jonas before to drive them while rollo mary and lucy took possession of the wagon  rollo drove very well he kept near the carryall and was so attentive to his business as a driver and so successful in avoiding stones and jolts and in turning out for the various vehicles they met upon the road that his father let him drive so all the rest of the way  they gradually approached the seashore the country grew wild and hilly and great ledges of rocks were seen in the fields and by the road side at length upon the summit of a long ascent the broad sea burst into view stretching along the horizon before them smooth and glassy with here and there a small white sail almost motionless in the distance below them was a long sandy beach the surf was breaking against it a swell of the sea of the whole length of the beach would rise and advance growing higher and more distinct as it approached and then it would break over upon the shore in one long line of foam white and beautiful and gracefully curved to adapt itself to the curvature of the shore at the extremities of the beach points and promontories of ragged rocks extended out into the water white with the breakers which foamed and struggled around them from the whole there arose a continued and solemn roar like the sound of a great waterfall  mr holiday stopped his horse by the side of the road and rollo when he reached the place stopped also  here we are said rollo thats the sea  wheres the beach said lucy  mary was silent  come said rollo lets drive on  o no said mary wait here a few minutes  jonas what are you waiting for said rollo  i wished him to stop here a few minutes said rollos father to let us look at the prospect  rollo said no more though he could not understand what his father was waiting for they all sat still looking at the view and saying very little rollo was impatient and restless in a short time however jonas drove on and rollo followed him they went down into a sort of valley where they lost sight of the water again and then after winding around for some time among the rocks and sand hills they came at length to a high ridge of pebble stones which ran along the shore and surmounting this they found the white beach spread out close before them while a long line of wave was just curling over and dashing into foam upon the sand they fastened the horses to some heavy pieces of timber the remains of a wreck which lay up high upon the sand  o what a wide beach said rollo the truth is that when he saw the beach from the hill it looked like a mere line of sand extending along the shore but now he found it was a broad and smooth area gently descending towards the water it was firm so that the children could run about upon it rollo went down pretty near to the waters edge and amused himself by watching the surf each wave would recede after it broke and run off leaving a broad piece of the beach dry until in a moment more another wave would come curling on and break over the retreating water of the former and then it would rush up the sand in a broad and rapid stream all along the shore almost to rollos feet  rollo asked his father to let him take off his shoes and stockings and he did so rollo put each stocking into its shoe to keep them dry and then laid them down upon the sand beyond the reach of the waves then he would watch the waves and whenever the water retreated he would follow it down until he met the new wave coming curling up at him when he would turn and run the wave after him to the shore and when the wave broke it would throw the water all around his feet  lucy and mary walked along the other shore at a greater distance looking for shells they found a great many rollo could hear their exclamations of delight at every new shell they found and they were continually calling upon him to come and get some too but he was too much occupied with the surf  at length rollos attention was excited by hearing lucy call out  o mary mary i have found a piece of sponge  rollo turned around to look he had just run up from the water and was standing beyond the reach of the surf though the water which each wave as it broke sent up upon the shore played around his feet  how big is it said rollo  about as big as my finger  ho said rollo that is not very big  just at this instant a wave larger than usual burst just behind rollo and it sent up a torrent of water all around him which rose almost up to his knees rollo was frightened he started to run but so much water confused and embarrassed him he staggered  stand still rollo said his father  rollo then stood still but by this time the water was receding and his eyes fell upon his two shoes which had been taken up by the wave and were now running rapidly down from the shore each loaded with its stocking rollo ran to seize them and had just time to get them before the next wave advanced and was ready to dash over them he ran up upon the sand and put his shoes several yards from the highest place that the water had come to  there said he looking back at the waves now get my shoes if you can the waves said nothing but went on breaking and then retreating just as before  rollo then went to where mary and lucy were and began to collect shells they found quite a number of different kinds all along the shore some were large and coarsebroken and worn by the water some were so thin and delicate that he had to wrap them up carefully in a paper and put them into his waistcoat pocket in order to get them home safely the children found several other curiosities besides shells they collected pebbles and specimens of sand of different colors mary found an old iron spike perhaps part of a vessel with the sand and gravel concreted around it it looked like stone growing upon iron rollo also found a small piece of wood battered and worn by the longcontinued action of the waves and he thought it was very curious indeed in fine the children filled their baskets with wonders and after about three quarters of an hour they set out on their return home when rollo went to get his shoes he found the water almost up to them if he had staid away a little longer they would have been washed away again the truth was the tide was rising     the cliffs   as the party slowly rode away from the beach rollos mother asked if it was too late to go to the cliffs there was a splendid prospect from the cliffs they were rocky precipices overhanging the sea at the extremity of a point of land about a mile from the beach where they had been the two girls wanted to go very much but rollo did not care so much about it he was in haste to get home and arrange his curiosities  his father however after looking at his watch said that he thought there would be time to go so he turned his horses head in the right direction and they went to the cliffs  the precipices were very high and the swell of the sea dashed and roared against them at their foot and yet the water looked very smooth at a little distance from the land rollo wondered why there should be waves along the beach and against the rocks when there were none out in the open sea  i should think father said he that it would be calmer near the shore and more windy out upon the water  it is said his father  then why are not the waves bigger  they are full as big  why father said rollo there are no waves at all out from the land  you cant see them very well said his father because we look down upon them when we are upon a mountain the small hills below almost disappear besides the waves out in the open sea in such a still time as this are in the form of broad swells but these swells are broken when they roll against the shore and so this makes the surf  i mean to look over and see said rollo and he walked cautiously along towards the precipice  o rollo exclaimed mary dont go so near  why there is no danger said rollo  rollo rollo exclaimed mary again as rollo went nearer and nearer  his father had turned away just as he had finished what he said above and so had not observed what rollo was doing in fact he did not go near enough to the brink to be in any danger though mary was afraid to have him so near  his mother hearing marys call turned to see what was the matter and she too felt afraid at seeing rollo so near she called him to come away but rollo told her that he was not near enough to fall  but i had rather that you would come away said his mother and she looked very anxious and uneasy and began to hurry along towards him  you see that large island off to the right said rollos father directing her attention in the right quarter  yes i see itrollo  well that is georges island there is a rock lying just about south of it  yes said rollos mother i believe i see it beckoning at the same time to rollo  her mind was evidently occupied with watching rollo she looked first at the rock and island where mr holiday was pointing and then back at rollo until at length mr holiday perceiving that her mind was disturbed by rollos motions said to him  rollo keep outside of us  outside father said rollo how do you mean  why farther back from the brink than we are  so rollo walked reluctantly back until he was at about the same distance from the brink with his father and then began to take up some little stones and throw them over his father and mother went on talking though rollos stones disturbed them a little at length rollo came and stood near his father to hear what he was saying about a large ship which was just coming into view behind the island  as he stood there he kept pressing forward to get as near to the brink as he could without actually going before his father and mother she instinctively put out her hand to hold him back and was evidently so uneasy that mr holiday looked to see what was the matter rollo had pressed forward so as to be a very little in advance of his father though it was only very little indeed  rollo said his father go and sit in the carryall until we come  rollo looked up surprised and was just going to ask what for but he perceived at once that he was in advance of his parents and that he had consequently disobeyed his fathers orders he went away rather sullenly  i was not more than an inch in advance of where they were said he to himself and besides it was far enough from the brink i dont see why i need be sent away  however he knew that he must obey and he went and took his seat in the carryall it was turned away from the sea and he had nothing before him but the inland prospect  what dismallooking rocks and hills said he to himself they had appeared wild and picturesque when he first came in view of them but now they had a very gloomy expression he who is dissatisfied with himself is generally dissatisfied with all around him  rollo waited until he was tired and then he had to wait some time longer at length his father and mother appeared and rollo jumped out and asked his father if he might ride in the wagon and drive the girls again  no replied his father i have made another arrangement jonas he continued you may get into the wagon and drive on alone  rollos father then helped mrs holiday and mary into the back seat while he put lucy and rollo on before and he took a seat between them when they had rode on a little way he said  i was very sorry to have to send you away rollo  why father i was not more than an inch before you  thats true said his father  and i dont think i was in any danger  i dont think you were myself said his father  then why did you send me back  for two reasons first you disobeyed me  but i dont think i came before you more than an inch  nor i said his father very likely it was not more than half an inch  and was that enough to do any harm  it was enough to constitute disobedience i told you to keep back outside of us and by coming up even as near as we were you showed a disposition not to obey  but i forgot said rollo i did not observe that i was so near  but when i give you a direction like that it is your duty to observe  rollo was silent after a short pause he added  well father you said that there were two reasons why you sent me away  yes the other was that you were spoiling all the pleasure of the party you kept mary and mother continually uneasy and anxious  but i dont think i went into any danger  perhaps not that is not what i charge you with i did not send you away for going into danger but for making other persons anxious and uneasy  but father if there was not any danger why need they be uneasy  do you suppose that persons are never made uneasy and anxious except by actual danger  whyi dont know sir  if you observe persons carefully you will see that they are  then they must be unreasonable said rollo  not altogether said his father if you were lying down upon the ground and i were to come up to you with an axe and make believe cut your head off it would make you very uneasy though there would be really no danger  but this is very different said rollo that would have been as if i had made believe push mother off  that would have been more like it i confess but i only meant to show you that it does not always require real danger to make any one uneasy and anxious when we see persons in situations which strongly suggest the idea of danger to our minds it makes us uneasy though we may know that there is no actual danger in the case thus it is painful to most persons to see a carpenter upon a very lofty spire or to go very near a precipice or see any body else go even when there is a strong railing and so in all other cases therefore our rule ought always to be when we are in company with others not only not to go into actual danger but not to go so near as strongly to bring up the idea to their minds and thus distress them  i never thought of that before said rollo  no i presume not and i had not time to explain it to you when we were upon the cliffs and so i simply directed you to keep back of us that would have prevented all trouble if you had only obeyed  rollo was silent and thoughtful he was sorry that he had disobeyed  however continued his father i am very glad i have had this opportunity to explain this subject to you now i want you to remember after this that the best way in all such cases is to consider not what the actual danger is but what the feelings and fears of those who are with you may be it is not your own safety but the comfort of others that you have to look out for  yes sir said rollo i will  once there were two young men continued his father taking a ride in chaises each had his sister with him they came to an old bridge that was somewhat decayed and it led across a very deep ravine which looked very frightful though in reality the bridge was perfectly strong and safe now when the first chaise came near the girl who was in it cried out  o brother what a bridge o i must get out and walk over it i dont dare to ride over such a bridge  poh nonsense said henry her brothers name was henry the bridge is strong enough for a fourox team i have been over it a dozen times so he drove on his sister looked very much terrified when they came upon the bridge but they went over safely  there said henry when they had got over i told you it was safe  when the other chaise came down the young lady said the same thing to her brother whose name was charles she said she was afraid to ride over  very well said charles the bridge is safe enough but i think perhaps it may be pleasanter for you to walk over it will rest you to walk a little and besides you can stop to look at the pleasant prospect up and down the river from the middle of the bridge  so his sister got out and he drove the chaise over carefully while she walked behind now which do you think took the best course charles or henry  idont know said rollo  the way to determine said his father is to apply the saviors rule do unto others as you would have others do unto you  well i think said rollo that i should rather get out and walk  i am sure i should said lucy                                       the whole party after this got safely home though it was too late that night to arrange their curiosities they however looked them all over the next day and they made a very large and valuable addition to their cabinet the specimens of sand of different colors they arranged in little square pasteboard boxes which mary made covering them neatly with blue paper upon the outside and with white paper within     the three northmen   the summer and autumn passed away and the winter came on rollo was having a new greatcoat made he had grown too big for the old one and so his mother had laid it aside waiting for nathan to grow up to it  when rollos coat was done he went out to show it to jonas it was thick and warm with large cuffs and there was a good warm collar to come up about his ears  and see said rollo throwing the coat back and slipping one of his arms out see how easy it comes off and on  yes said jonas and that is a great convenience in a greatcoat it is a very fine greatcoat indeed i think with that on you will be able to make your stand against all three of the northmen  all three of the northmen repeated rollo who are the northmen  dont you know who the three famous northmen are said jonas who do so much mischief  no said rollo i never heard of them before  well said jonas i will tell you some time but now i must go away with the cart  jonas had been harnessing the horse into the cart in the yard while rollo had been talking with him and now was about ready to go away rollo determined to ask his mother to let him go with him  where are you going jonas said he  down into the woods said jonas  wait a minute for me  so away rollo ran to ask his mother she said yes and he accordingly came out and took his seat by the side of jonas upon a board which was placed across the cart from one side to the other  jonas was going down into the woods to bring up a load of wood which he had obtained from the trimmings of the trees it was a cold frosty morning and the winter was near and jonas wished to get the wood in before the snow should come and cover it up rollo was so much interested in driving the cart down and then in loading it with wood that he forgot to ask jonas about the three famous northmen  about a month after this there were a few very cold mornings the ice froze very hard in a tub of water before the pump and jonas had to cut a hole in it with the axe for the horse to drink  rollo saw him through the kitchen window and he opened the door and ran out a moment to see him jonas was cutting away very carefully all around the sides of the tub so as to get the whole mass of ice out together rollo stood looking on shivering he had no hat on and only slippers upon his feet he stood leaning a little forward his arms hanging off from his sides as if they were driven off by electric repulsion  ant you cold said rollo to jonas  no said jonas not at all  i am and i cant stay out here any longer i am so cold  you are not prepared for it that is the difficulty go and put on your boots and your cap and your mittens and button up your jacket and come out here and go to work with me and you wont be cold  rollo ran in and got his boots and after warming them by the kitchen fire he put them on he also buttoned his jacket up to his chin and drew on his mittens and put on his cap he then went out again to find jonas  he found him in the barn pitching down hay  now said rollo as he came up the stairs what shall i do  ah you have come out to work have you said jonas well take this pitchfork and mount up upon the loft there and pitch me down some hay  rollo found it very hard to get up upon the loft there were only some pegs driven into a post to climb up by however with jonass help he got up and then clambered over upon the hay and jonas threw the pitchfork up after him  now work moderately said jonas and ill insure that the northmen cant touch you  o there said rollo you have never told me about the northmen  well said jonas i will tell you now when you come down  after pitching the hay down a little while rollo descended though it was not necessary for jonas to help him for he jumped down upon the heap of hay which he had made they then went together attending to jonass work about the barn while rollo stopped occasionally to look out the open door or window where the sun was shining in very pleasantly rollo began to think it was a warm pleasant morning  there is one of the northmen said jonas that you are somewhat acquainted with already  what is his name said rollo  captain jack frost replied jonas  o yes said rollo with a smile i have heard of that gentleman before  yes said jonas he is pretty well known he is a great mischiefmaker he lives in an ice castle at the north and in the fall of the year he comes creeping along in the still nights and early in the mornings he builds bridges over the ponds and brooks and plants little gardens of hoar frost and where he sees a stone in the ground he stamps his foot upon it and crowds it down a little way then it is his great delight to go about pinching boys toes and noses he is a sly rogue  and who are the other northmen said rollo  the next is general boreas said jonas  general boreas repeated rollo and who is he  o he is a terrible fellow replied jonas he comes roaring and thundering along the tops of the forests at midnight in snowstorms and hail he buries up the whole country he breaks down the trees and sometimes unroofs the houses then if he finds any poor traveller out he whistles and roars about his ears and tries to frighten him and he throws snow into his face and heaps it up all about him in order to bury him up if he can  then besides continued jonas the old stormer has another way of making mischief after he has got the valleys and streams covered and filled with ice and snow he brings on a tempest of wind and rain and fills the land with torrents which raise the streams and tear up the ice and carry it down in vast broken and jamming blocks which break down the bridges and carry away dams and spread all over the meadows frightening a good many families out of their beds at midnight  is that the way that general boreas acts said rollo  yes replied jonas thats the way  and who is the third northman said rollo  his name is old zero replied jonas he is more than threescore years and ten a great deal his head is hoary and his beard is long and gray he creeps softly along after general boreas has worked himself out of breath and gone away he curtains over all the windows with frost work in the night he likes the night when it is calm and still and the stars are shining bright and cold all over the sky and he kills more people than boreas does  kills them said rollo  yes replied jonas he makes no blustering but he stings bitterly and the poor traveller has his ears and hands and feet frozen before he knows what a cruel enemy is around him captain jack frost you may laugh atbut as to old zero you had better beware of him  rollo laughed a good deal at jonass account of the three northmen and jonas told him that they sometimes made some splendid curiosities which would be beautiful for a shelf in his museum if they would only keep  what are the curiosities said rollo  o all kinds of stars and spangles and snowflakes of a great many beautiful formsand icicles and frost work but they will not keep very long unless you make a cabinet expressly for them  i cant make a cabinet said rollo  o yes you cana frostcabinet said jonas  how asked rollo  why you must go down near the brook in the middle of the winter and make a little room of snow then you must get a large piece of thin clear ice from a still place in the brook and fix it in for a window you must also get some sheets of white ice or snow crust for shelves and put your frost curiosities upon them if you make it in a cold place they will keep for some time  i will make a frost museum said rollo i mean to go down today and look out a place  yes said jonas and you can keep it a secret until it is done and then take your father and mother down to see it and surprise them  yes said rollo clapping his hands so i will  illustration     rollo books  by jacob abbott    rollo at work                   rollo at school  rollo at play                   rollos vacation  rollo learning to read          rollo learning to talk                      bound in uniform style  the publishers request the attention of the friends of the young to this popular series of books which have been pronounced by competent and judicious persons the best works for children published not even excepting the best english writers mr abbotts style is peculiarly interesting to children being natural and simple and portraying the trials and temptations of childhood just as they occur in every day life and giving them clear and distinct ideas of the right and wrong in their actions                      from the christian examiner  as a whole they make the most important series of juvenile books that have appeared to our knowledge since miss edgeworth they are very unlike those and yet they resemble them in some prominent features especially in making it their chief object to be pleasing and thus gently and imperceptibly opening a way for instruction to the mind and morals without obtruding or forcing it in the least for this the books before us are remarkable they are entertaining throughout the interest never flags and yet there is no seeming attempt to sustain it there is little continuous story and no plot or romance or grownup folly such as fills half of the young novels now made for children here is a little boy who is first induced to learn to talk and in order to do this he is made to see objects for himself and think about them and ask questions next he is taught to read to effect this he is candidly told that learning to read is not play but work and at first dry and hard work it soon becomes easy however because it is undertaken in earnest and then it becomes pleasant and parents may take a hint from this when they are afraid to allow letters and learning to wear any form but that of playthings and pastime to their children in the third volume rollo is at work in the fourth at play and the morals of both play and work are as easily and pleasantly insinuated as we have often seen there is constant occupation in both and constant natural opportunities of learning the duty and the advantage of feeling and doing right and thus seeing the evil of feeling and doing wrong for mr abbott fully carries out in these books the great principle which we rejoice to see advanced in the preface to one of them namely that it is generally better in dealing with children to allure them to what is right by agreeable pictures of it than to attempt to drive them to it by repulsive delineations of what is wrong the fifth volume presents rollo at school and the last his vacation they keep up the interest and advance in maturity of thought and illustration as the boy advances       from the mothers magazine edited by mrs whittlesey  mr abbott possesses in a very high degree the faculty of awakening the interest of children his writings have that absolute requisite for securing permanent popularitytruth to nature his boys and girls talk and act like boys and girls not like miniature men and women  there are a thousand minute touches in his descriptions which are evidently drawn from the life and which betoken a habit of close and accurate observation of the ways and manners of children in reading his books you hardly believe that it is not your own little charles or henry whose doings and sayings he is reporting it is this truth and freshness in minute touches that constitutes picturesqueness in writing a quality which renders miss edgeworth and mr abbott attractive not only to little readers but to some older persons that we know we have spoken of these books as interesting we can also recommend them as adapted to be exceedingly usefuland for the very same reason instead of general exhortations to certain things and dehortations from others children here find vivid pictures of the very faults they are to strive against and are shown how to striveof the good habits they are to acquire and how they may be acquired parents will find them a valuable aid in the instruction and amendment of their children                      in press                      rollos
