78357856	the outcry  by henry james  1911   book first     i  no my lord banks had replied no stranger has yet arrived but ill see if any one has come inor who has as he spoke however he observed lady sandgates approach to the hall by the entrance giving upon the great terrace and addressed her on her passing the threshold lord john my lady with which his duty majestically performed he retired to the quarterthat of the main access to the spacious centre of the housefrom which he had ushered the visitor  this personage facing lady sandgate as she paused there a moment framed by the large doorway to the outer expanses the small pinkish paper of a folded telegram in her hand had partly before him as an immediate effect the high wide interior still breathing the quiet air and the fair pannelled security of the couple of hushed and stored centuries in which certain of the reputed treasures of dedborough place beautifully disposed themselves and then through ample apertures and beyond the stately stone outworks of the great seated and supported houseuplifting terrace balanced balustraded steps and containing basins where splash and spray were at restall the rich composed extension of garden and lawn and park an ancient an assured elegance seemed to reign pictures and preserved pieces cabinets and tapestries spoke each for itself of fine selection and high distinction while the originals of the old portraits in more or less deserved salience hung over the happy scene as the sworn members of a great guild might have sat on the beautiful april day at one of their annual feasts  such was the setting confirmed by generous time but the handsome woman of considerably more than forty whose entrance had all but coincided with that of lord john either belonged for the eye to no such complacent company or enjoyed a relation to it in which the odd twists and turns of history must have been more frequent than any dull avenue or easy sequence lady sandgate was shiningly modern and perhaps at no point more so than by the effect of her express repudiation of a mundane future certain to be more and more offensive to women of real quality and of formed taste clearly at any rate in her hands the clue to the antique confidence had lost itself and repose however founded had given way to curiositythat is to speculationhowever disguised she might have consented or even attained to being but gracefully stupid but she would presumably have confessed if put on her trial for restlessness or for intelligence that she was after all almost clever enough to be vulgar unmistakably moreover she had still with her fine stature her disciplined figure her cherished complexion her bright important hair her kind bold eyes and her large constant smile the degree of beauty that might pretend to put every other question by  lord john addressed her as with a significant manner that he might have hadthat of a lack of need or even of interest for any explanation about herself it would have been clear that he was apt to discriminate with sharpness among possible claims on his attention i luckily find you at least lady sandgatethey tell me theigns off somewhere  she replied as with the general habit on her side of bland reassurance it mostly had easier consequencesfor herselfthan the perhaps more showy creation of alarm only off in the parkopen today for a schoolfeast from dedborough as you may have made out from the avenue giving good advice at the top of his lungs to four hundred and fifty children  it was such a scene and such an aspect of the personage so accounted for as lord john could easily take in and his recognition familiarly smiled oh hes so great on such occasions that im sorry to be missing it  ive had to miss it lady sandgate sighedthat is to miss the peroration ive just left them but he had even then been going on for twenty minutes and i dare say that if you care to take a look youll find him poor dear victim of duty still at it  ill warrantfor as i often tell him he makes the idea of ones duty an awful thing to his friends by the extravagance with which he always overdoes it and the image itself appeared in some degree to prompt this particular edified friend to look at his watch and consider i should like to come in for the grand finale but i rattled over in a great measure to meet a party as he calls himselfand calls if you please even mewhos motoring down by appointment and whom i think i should be here to receive as well as a little i confess in the hope of a glimpse of lady grace if you can perhaps imagine that  i can imagine it perfectly said lady sandgate whom evidently no perceptions of that general order ever cost a strain it quite sticks out of you and every one moreover has for some time past been waiting to see but you havent then she added come from town  no im for three days at chanter with my mother whom as she kindly lent me her car i should have rather liked to bring  lady sandgate left the unsaid in this connection languish no longer than was decent but whom you doubtless had to leave by her preference just settling down to bridge  oh to sit down would imply that my mother at some moment of the day gets up  which the duchess never doeslady sandgate only asked to be allowed to show how she saw it she fights to the last invincible gathering in the spoils and only routing her friends she abounded genially in her privileged vision ah yeswe know something of that  lord john who was a young man of a rambling but not of an idle eye fixed her an instant with a surprise that was yet not steeped in compassion you too then  she wouldnt however too meanly narrow it down well in this house generally where im so often made welcome you see and where  where he broke in at once your jolly good footing quite sticks out of you perhaps youll let me say  she clearly didnt mind his seeing her ask herself how she should deal with so much rather juvenile intelligence and indeed she could only decide to deal quite simply you cant say more than i feeland am proud to feelat being of comfort when theyre worried  this but fed the light flame of his easy perceptionwhich lighted for him if she would all the facts equally and theyre worried now you imply because my terrible mother is capable of heavy gains and of making a great noise if she isnt paid i ought to mind speaking of that truth he went on as with a practised glance in the direction of delicacy but i think i should like you to know that i myself am not a bit ignorant of why it has made such an impression here  lady sandgate forestalled his knowledge because poor kitty imberwho should either never touch a card or else learn to suffer in silence as ive had to goodness knowshas thrown herself with her impossible big debt upon her father whom she thinks herself entitled to look to even more as a lovely young widow with a good jointure than she formerly did as the mere most beautiful daughter at home  she had put the picture a shade interrogatively but this was as nothing to the note of free inquiry in lord johns reply you mean that our lovely young widowsto say nothing of lovely young wivesought by this time to have made out in predicaments how to turn round  his temporary hostess even with his eyes on her appeared to decide after a moment not wholly to disown his thought but she smiled for it well in that set  my mothers set however if she could smile he could laugh im much obliged  oh she qualified i dont criticise her grace but the ways and traditions and tone of this house  make ithe took her sense straight from herthe house in england where one feels most the false note of a dishevelled and bankrupt elder daughter breaking in with a list of her gaming debtsto say nothing of othersand wishing to have at least those wiped out in the interest of her reputation exactly so he went on before she could meet it with a diplomatic ambiguity and just that i assure you is a large part of the reason i like to come heresince i personally dont come with any such associations  not the association of bankruptcyno as you represent the payee  the young man appeared to regard this imputation for a moment almost as a liberty taken how do you know so well lady sandgate what i represent  she bethought herselfbut briefly and bravely well dont you represent by your own admission certain fond aspirations dont you represent the beliefvery natural i grantthat more than one perverse and extravagant flower will be unlikely on such a fine healthy old stem and consistently with that the hope of arranging with our admirable host here that he shall lend a helpful hand to your commending yourself to dear grace  lord john might in the light of these words have felt any latent infirmity in such a pretension exposed but as he stood there facing his chances he would have struck a spectator as resting firmly enough on some felt residuum of advantage whether this were cleverness or luck the strength of his backing or that of his sincerity even with the young woman to whom our friends reference thus broadened still a vague quantity for us you would have taken his sincerity as quite possibleand this despite an odd element in him that you might have described as a certain delicacy of brutality this younger son of a noble matron recognised even by himself as terrible enjoyed in no immediate or aggressive manner any imputable private heritage or privilege of arrogance he would on the contrary have irradiated fineness if his lustre hadnt been a little prematurely dimmed active yet insubstantial he was slight and short and a trifle too punctually though not yet quite lamentably bald delicacy was in the arch of his eyebrow the finish of his facial line the economy of treatment by which his negative nose had been enabled to look important and his meagre mouth to smile its spareness away  he had pleasant but hard little eyesthey glittered handsomely without promiseand a neatness a coolness and an ease a clear instinct for making point take on his behalf the place of weight and immunity that of capacity which represented somehow the art of living at a high pitch and yet at a low cost there was that in his satisfied air which still suggested sharp wantsand this was withal the ambiguity for the temper of these appetites or views was certainly you would have concluded not such as always to sacrifice to form if he really for instance wanted lady grace the passion or the sense of his interest in it would scarce have been considerately irritable  may i ask what you mean he inquired of lady sandgate by the question of my arranging  i mean that youre the very clever son of a very clever mother  oh im less clever than you think he repliedif you really think it of me at all and mammas a good sight cleverer  than i think lady sandgate echoed why shes the person in all our world i would gladly most resemblefor her general ability to put what she wants through but she at once added that is if pausing on it with a smile  if what then  well if i could be absolutely certain to have all in her kinds of cleverness without exceptionand to have them said lady sandgate to the very end  he definitely he almost contemptuously declined to follow her the very end of what  she took her choice as amid all the wonderful directions there might be and then seemed both to risk and to reserve something say of her so wonderfully successful general career  it doubtless however warranted him in appearing to cut insinuations short when youre as clever as she youll be as good to which he subjoined you dont begin to have the opportunity of knowing how good she is this pronouncement to whatever comparative obscurity it might appear to relegate her his interlocutress had to takehe was so prompt with a more explicit challenge what is it exactly that you suppose yourself to know  lady sandgate had after a moment in her supreme good humour decided to take everything i always proceed on the assumption that i know everything because that makes people tell me  it wouldnt make we he quite rang out if i didnt want to but as it happens he allowed theres a question it would be convenient to me to put to you you must be with your charming unconventional relation with him extremely in theigns confidence  she waited a little as for more is that your questionwhether i am  no but if you are youll the better answer it  she had no objection then to answering it beautifully were the best friends in the world he has been really my providence as a lone woman with almost nobody and nothing of her own and i feel my footing here as so frequent and yet so discreet a visitor simply perfect but im happy to say thatfor my pleasure when im really curiousthis doesnt close to me the sweet resource of occasionally guessing things  then i hope youve ground for believing that if i go the right way about it hes likely to listen to me  lady sandgate measured her groundwhich scarce seemed extensive the person he most listens to just nowand in fact at any time as you must have seen for yourselfis that archtormentor or at least beautiful wheedler his elder daughter  lady imbers here lord john alertly asked  she arrived last night andas weve other visitorsseems to have set up a sideshow in the garden  then shell draw of course immensely as she always does but her sister wont be in that case with her the young man supposed  because grace feels herself naturally an independent show so she well may said lady sandgate but i must tell you that when i last noticed them there kitty was in the very act of leading her away  lord john figured it a moment lady imberhe ironically enlarged the figurecan lead people away  oh dear grace his companion returned happens fortunately to be firm  this seemed to strike him for a moment as equivocal not against me howeveryou dont mean you dont think she has a beastly prejudice  surely you can judge about it as knowing best what mayor what maynthave happened between you  well i try to judgeand such candour as was possible to lord john seemed to sit for a moment on his brow but im in fear of seeing her too much as i want to see her  there was an appeal in it that lady sandgate might have been moved to meet are you absolutely in earnest about her  of course i amwhy shouldnt i be but he said with impatience i want help  very well then thats what lady imbers giving you and as it appeared to take him time to read into these words their full sense she produced others and so far did help himthough the effort was in a degree that of her exhibiting with some complacency her own unassisted control of stray signs and shy lights by telling her by bringing it home to her that if shell make up her mind to accept you the duchess will do the handsome thing handsome i mean by kitty  lord john appropriating for his convenience the truth in this yet regarded it as open to a becoming an improving touch from himself well and by me to which he added with more of a challenge in it but you really know what my mother will do  by my system lady sandgate smiled you see ive guessed what your mother will do is what brought you over  well its that he allowedand something else  something else she derisively echoed i should think that for an ardent lover would have been enough  ah but its all one job i mean its one idea he hastened to explainif you think lady imbers really acting on her  mightnt you go and see  i would in a moment if i hadnt to look out for another matter too and he renewed his attention to his watch i mean getting straight at my american the party i just mentioned  but she had already taken him up you too have an american and a party and yours also motors down  mr breckenridge bender lord john named him with a shade of elation  she gaped at the fuller light you know my breckenridgewho i hoped was coming for me  lord john as freely but more gaily wondered had he told you so  she held out opened the telegram she had kept folded in her hand since her entrance he has sent me thatwhich delivered to me ten minutes ago out there has brought me in to receive him  the young man read out this missive failing to find you in bruton street start in pursuit and hope to overtake you about four it did involve an ambiguity why he has been engaged these three days to coincide with myself and not to fail of him has been part of my business  lady sandgate in her demonstrative way appealed to the general rich scene then why does he say its me hes pursuing  he seemed to recognise promptly enough in her the sense of a menaced monopoly my dear lady hes pursuing expensive works of art  by which you imply that im one she might have been wound up by her disappointment to almost any irony  i implyor rather i affirmthat every handsome woman is but what he arranged with me about lord john explained was that he should see the dedborough pictures in general and the great sir joshua in particularof which he had heard so much and to which ive been thus glad to assist him  this news however with its lively interest but deepened the listeners mystification then whythis whole week that ive been in the househasnt our good friend here mentioned to me his coming  because our good friend here has had no reasonlord john could treat it now as simple enough good as he is in all ways hes so best of all about showing the house and its contents that i havent even thought necessary to write him that im introducing breckenridge  i should have been happy to introduce him lady sandgate just quaveredif i had at all known he wanted it  her companion weighed the difference between them and appeared to pronounce it a trifle he didnt care a fig for i surrender you that privilege thenof presenting him to his hostif ive seemed to you to snatch it from you to which lord john added as with liberality unrestricted but ive been taking him about to see whats worth whileas only last week to lady lappingtons longhi  this revelation though so casual in its form fairly drew from lady sandgate as she took it in an interrogative wail her longhi  why dont you know her great venetian family group the whatdoyoucallemsseven fulllength figures each one a gem for which he paid her her price before he left the house  she could but make it more richly resoundalmost stricken lost in her wistful thought seven fulllength figures her price  eight thousandslap down bender knows said lord john what he wants  and does he want onlyher wonder grew and grew  whatdoyoucallems  he most usually wants what he cant have lord john made scarce more of it than that but awfully hard up as i fancy her lady lappington went at him  it determined in his friend a boldly critical attitude how horribleat the rate things are leaving us but this was far from the end of her interest and is that the way he pays  before he leaves the house lord john lived it amusedly over well she took care of that  how incredibly vulgar it all had however for lady sandgate still other connectionswhich might have attenuated lady lappingtons case though she didnt glance at this he makes the most scandalous eyesthe ruffianat my greatgrandmother and then as richly to enlighten any blankness my tremendous lawrence dont you knowin her weddingdress down to her knees with such extraordinarily speaking eyes such lovely arms and hands such wonderful fleshtints universally considered the masterpiece of the artist  lord john seemed to look a moment not so much at the image evoked in which he wasnt interested as at certain possibilities lurking behind it and are you going to sell the masterpiece of the artist  she held her head high ive indignantly refusedfor all his pressing me so hard  yet thats what he nevertheless pursues you today to keep up  the question had a little the ring of those of which the occupant of a witnessbox is mostly the subject but lady sandgate was so far as this went an imperturbable witness i need hardly fear it perhaps ifin the light of what you tell me of your arrangement with himhis pursuit becomes where i am concerned a figure of speech  oh lord john returned he kills two birds with one stonehe sees both sir joshua and you  this version of the case had its effect for the moment on his fair associate does he want to buy their pride and glory  the young man however struck on his own side became at first but the bright reflector of her thought is that wonder for sale  she closed her eyes as with the shudder of hearing such words not surely by any monstrous chance fancy dear proud theign  i cant fancy himno and lord john appeared to renounce the effort but a cat may look at a king and a sharp funny yankee at anything  these things might be lady sandgates face and gesture apparently signified but another question diverted her youre clearly a wonderful showman but do you mind my asking you whether youre on such an occasion awell a closely interested one  interested he echoed though it wasnt to gain time he showed for he would in that case have taken more to the extent you mean of my little percentage and then as in silence she but kept a slightly grim smile on him why do you ask ifwith your high delicacy about your greatgrandmotheryouve nothing to place  it took her a minute to say while her fine eye only rolled but when she spoke that organ boldly rested and the truth vividly appeared i ask because people like you lord john strike me as dangerous to thehow shall i name itthe common weal and because of my general strong feeling that we dont want any more of our national treasures for i regard my greatgrandmother as national to be scattered about the world  theres much in this country and age he replied in an offhand manner to be said about that the present however was not the time to say it all so he said something else instead accompanying it with a smile that signified sufficiency to my friends i need scarcely remark to you im all the friend  she had meanwhile seen the butler reappear by the door that opened to the terrace and though the high bleak impersonal approach of this functionary was ever and more and more at every step a process to defy interpretation long practice evidently now enabled her to suggest as she turned again to her fellowvisitor a reading of it its the friend then clearly whos wanted in the park  she might by the way banks looked at her have snatched from his hand a missive addressed to another though while he addressed himself to her companion he allowed for her indecorum sufficiently to take it up where she had left it by her ladyship my lord who sends to hope youll join them below the terrace  ah grace hopes said lady sandgate for the young mans encouragement there you are  lord john took up the motorcap he had lain down on coming in i rush to lady grace but dont demoralise bender and he went forth to the terrace and the gardens  banks looked about as for some further exercise of his high function will you have tea my lady  this appeared to strike her as premature oh thankswhen they all come in  theyll scarcely all my ladyhe indicated respectfully that he knew what he was talking about theres tea in her ladyships tent but he qualified it has also been ordered for the saloon  ah then she said cheerfully mr bender will be glad and she became with this aware of the approach of another visitor banks considered up and down the gentleman ushered in at the left by the footman who had received him at the main entrance to the house here he must be my lady with which he retired to the spacious opposite quarter where he vanished while the footman his own office performed retreated as he had come and lady sandgate all hospitality received the manysided author of her specious telegram of lord johns irritating confidence and of lady lappingtons massive cheque     ii  having greeted him with an explicitly gracious welcome and both hands out she had at once gone on youll of course have teain the saloon  but his mechanism seemed of the type that has to expand and revolve before sounding why the very first thing  she only desired as her laugh showed to accommodate ah have it the last if you like  you see your english teas he pleaded as he looked about him so immediately and frankly interested in the place and its contents that his friend could only have taken this for the very glance with which he must have swept lady lappingtons inferior scene  theyre too much for you  well theyre too many i think ive had two or three on the roadat any rate my man did i like to do business before but his sequence dropped as his eye caught some object across the wealth of space  she divertedly picked it up before tea mr bender  before everything lady sandgate he was immensely genial but a queer quaint roughedged distinctness somehow kept it safefor himself  then youve come to do business her appeal and her emphasis melted as into a caresswhich however spent itself on his large high person as he consented with less of demonstration but more of attention to look down upon her she could therefore but reinforce it by an intenser note to tell me you will treat  mr bender had six feet of stature and an air as of having received benefits at the hands of fortune substantial powerful easy he shone as with a glorious cleanness a supplied and equipped and appointed sanity and security aids to action that might have figured a pair of very ample wingswide pinions for the present conveniently folded but that he would certainly on occasion agitate for great efforts and spread for great flights these things would have made him quite an admirable even a worshipful image of fullblown life and character had not the affirmation and the emphasis halted in one important particular fortune felicity nature the perverse or interfering old fairy at his cradlesidewhatever the ministering power might have beenhad simply overlooked and neglected his vast whollyshaven face which thus showed not so much for perfunctorily scamped as for not treated as for neither formed nor fondled nor finished at all nothing seemed to have been done for it but what the razor and the sponge the toothbrush and the lookingglass could officiously do it had in short resisted any possibly finer attrition at the hands of fifty years of offered experience it had developed on the lines if lines they could be called of the mere scoured and polished and initialled mug rather than to any effect of a composed physiognomy though we must at the same time add that its wearer carried this featureless disk as with the warranted confidence that might have attended a warning headlight or a glaring motorlamp the object however one named it showed you at least where he was and most often that he was straight upon you it was fearlessly and resistingly across the path of his advance that lady sandgate had thrown herself and indeed with such success that he soon connected her demonstration with a particular motive for your grandmother lady sandgate he then returned  for my grandmothers mother mr benderthe most beautiful woman of her time and the greatest of all lawrences no matter whose as you quite acknowledged you know in our talk in bruton street  mr bender bethought himself furtheryet drawing it out as if the familiar fact of his being made up to had never had such special softness and warmth of pressure do you want very very much  she had already caught him up very very much for her well mr bender she smilingly replied i think i should like her full value  i meanhe kindly discriminateddo you want so badly to work her off  it would be an intense convenience to meso much so that your telegram made me at once fondly hope youd be arriving to conclude  such measure of response as he had goodnaturedly given her was the mere frayed edge of a mastering detachment the copious impatient range elsewhere of his true attention somehow however he still seemed kind even while turning his back upon her he moved off to look at one of the several the famous dedborough picturesstray specimens by every presumption lost a little in the whole bright bigness conclude he echoed as he approached a significantly small canvas you ladies want to get there before the roads so much as laid or the countrys safe do you know what this here is he at once went on  oh you cant have that she cried as with full authorityand you must really understand that you cant have everything you mustnt expect to ravage dedborough  he had his nose meanwhile close to the picture i guess its a bogus cuypbut i know lord theign has things he wont do business  hes not in the least and can never be in my tight place lady sandgate replied but hes as proud as hes kind dear man and as solid as hes proud so that if you came down under a different impression well she could only exhale the folly of his error with an unction that represented whatever he might think of it all her competence to answer for their host  he scarce thought of it enough on any side however to be diverted from prior dispositions i came on an understanding that i should find my friend lord john and that lord theign would on his introduction kindly let me look round but being before lunch in bruton street i knocked at your door  for another look she quickly interposed at my lawrence  for another look at you lady sandgateyour greatgrandmother wasnt required informed you were here and struck with the coincidence of my being myself presently due he went on i despatched you my wire on coming away just to keep up your spirits  you dont keep them up you depress them to anguish she almost passionately protested when you dont tell me youll treat  he paused in his preoccupation his perambulation conscious evidently of no reluctance that was worth a scene with so charming and so hungry a woman well if its a question of your otherwise suffering torments may i have another interview with the old lady  dear mr bender shes in the flower of her youth she only yearns for interviews and you may have lady sandgate earnestly declared as many as you like  oh you must be there to protect me  then as soon as i return  wellit clearly cost him little to sayill come right round  she joyously registered the vow only meanwhile then please never a word  never a word certainly but where all this time mr bender asked is lord john  lady sandgate as he spoke found her eyes meeting those of a young woman who presenting herself from without stood framed in the doorway to the terrace a slight fair grave young woman of middle stature and simply dressed whose brow showed clear even under the heavy shade of a large hat surmounted with big black bows and feathers her eyes had vaguely questioned those of her elder who at once replied to the gentleman forming the subject of their inquiry lady grace must know at this the young woman came forward and lady sandgate introduced the visitor my dear grace this is mr breckenridge bender  the younger daughter of the house might have arrived in preoccupation but she had urbanity to spare of whom lord john has told me she returned and whom im glad to see lord john she explained to his waiting friend is detained a moment in the park open today to a big temperance schoolfeast where our party is mostly gathered so that if you care to go out she gave him in fine his choice  but this was clearly a thing that in the conditions mr bender wasnt the man to take precipitately though his big useful smile disguised his prudence are there any pictures in the park  lady graces facial response represented less humour perhaps but more play we find our park itself rather a picture  mr benders own levity at any rate persisted with a big temperance schoolfeast  mr benders a great judge of pictures lady sandgate said as to forestall any impression of excessive freedom  will there be more tea he pursued almost presuming on this  it showed lady grace for comparatively candid and literal oh therell be plenty of tea  this appeared to determine mr bender well lady grace im after pictures but i take them neat may i go right round here  perhaps love lady sandgate at once said youll let me show him  a moment dearlady grace gently demurred do go round she conformably added to mr bender take your ease and your time everythings open and visible and with our whole company dispersed youll have the place to yourself  he rose in his genial mass to the opportunity ill be in cloversure but present to him was the richest corner of the pasture which he could fluently enough name and ill find the beautiful duchess of waterbridge  she indicated off to the right where a stately perspective opened the quarter of the saloon to which we have seen mr banks retire at the very end of those rooms  he had wide eyes for the vista about thirty in a row hey and he was already off ill work right through     iii  left with her friend lady grace had a prompt question lord john warned me he was funnybut you already know him  there might have been a sense of embarrassment in the way in which as to gain time lady sandgate pointed instead of answering to the small picture pronounced upon by mr bender he thinks your little cuyp a fraud  that one lady grace could but stare the wretch however she made without alarm no more of it she returned to her previous question youve met him before  just a littlein town being after pictures lady sandgate explained he has been after my greatgrandmother  she said lady grace with amusement must have found him funny but he can clearly take care of himself while kitty takes care of lord john and while you if youll be so good go back to support fatherin the hour of his triumph which he wants you so much to witness that he complains of your desertion and goes so far as to speak of you as sneaking away  lady sandgate with a slight flush turned it over i delight in his triumph and whatever i do is at least above board but if its a question of support arent you yourself failing him quite as much  this had however no effect on the girls confidence ah my dear im not at all the same thing and as im the person in the world he least misses well such a fact spoke for itself  youve been free to return and wait for lord johnthat was the sense in which the elder woman appeared to prefer to understand it as speaking  the tone of it none the less led her companion immediately though very quietly to correct her ive not come back to wait for lord john  then he hasnt told youif youve talkedwith what idea he has come  lady grace had for a further correction the same shade of detachment kitty has told mewhat it suits her to pretend to suppose  and kittys pretensions and suppositions always go with what happensat the moment among all her wonderful happeningsto suit her  lady grace let that question answer itselfshe took the case up further on what i cant make out is why this should so suit her  and what i cant said lady sandgate without gross honesty and turning away after having watched the girl a moment she nevertheless presently faced her again to follow this speculation up do you like him enough to risk the chance of kittys being for once right  lady grace gave it a thoughtwith which she moved away i dont know how much i like him  nor how little cried her friend who evidently found amusement in the tone of it and youre not disposed to take the time to find out hes at least better than the others  the otherslady grace was blank for them  the others of his set  oh his set that wouldnt be difficultby what i imagine of some of them but he means well enough the girl added hes very charming and does me great honour  it determined in her companion about to leave her another brief arrest then may i tell your father  this in turn brought about in lady grace an immediate drop of the subject tell my father please that im expecting mr crimble of whom ive spoken to him even if he doesnt remember and who bicycles this afternoon ten miles over from where hes stayingwith some people we dont knowto look at the pictures about which hes awfully keen  lady sandgate took it in ah like mr bender  no not at all i think like mr bender  this appeared to move in the elder woman some deeper thought may i ask thenif ones to meet himwho he is  oh father knowsor ought tothat i sat next him in london a month ago at dinner and that he then told me he was working tooth and nail at what he called the wonderful modern science of connoisseurshipwhich is upsetting as perhaps youre not aware all the oldfashioned canons of artcriticism everything weve stupidly thought right and held dear that he was to spend easter in these parts and that he should like greatly to be allowed some day to come over and make acquaintance with our things i told him lady grace wound up that nothing would be easier a note from him arrived before dinner  lady sandgate jumped the rest and its for him youve come in  its for him ive come in the girl assented with serenity  very goodthough he sounds most detrimental but will you first just tell me thiswhether when you sent in ten minutes ago for lord john to come out to you it was wholly of your own movement and she followed it up as her young friend appeared to hesitate was it because you knew why he had arrived  the young friend hesitated still why   so particularly to speak to you  since he was expected and mightnt know where i was lady grace said after an instant i wanted naturally to be civil to him  and had he time there to tell you lady sandgate asked how very civil he wants to be to you  no only to tell me that his friendwhos off therewas coming for kitty at once appropriated him and was still in possession when i came away then as deciding at last on perfect frankness lady grace went on if you want to know i sent for news of him because kitty insisted on my doing so saying so very oddly and quite in her own way that she herself didnt wish to appear in it she had done nothing but say to me for an hour rather worryingly what youve just saidthat its me hes what like mr bender she calls after but as soon as he appeared she pounced on him and i left himi assure you quite resignedlyin her hands  she wantsit was easy for lady sandgate to remarkto talk of you to him  i dont know what she wants the girl replied as with rather a tired patience kitty wants so many things at once she always wants money in quantities to begin withand all to throw so horribly away so that whenever i see her in so very deep with any one i always imagine her appealing for some new tip as to how its to be come by  kittys an abyss i grant you and with my disinterested devotion to your fatherin requital of all his kindness to me since lord sandgates death and since your mothersi can never be too grateful to you my dear for your being so different a creature but what is she going to gain financially lady sandgate pursued with a strong emphasis on her adverb by working up our friends confidence in your listening to himif you are to listen  i havent in the least engaged to listen said lady graceit will depend on the music he makes but she added with light cynicism perhaps shes to gain a commission  on his fairly getting you and then as the girl assented by silence is he in a position to pay her one lady sandgate asked  i dare say the duchess is  but do you see the duchess producing moneywith all that kitty as were not ignorant owes her hundreds and hundreds and hundredslady sandgate piled them up  her young friends gesture checked it ah dont tell me how manyits too sad and too ugly and too wrong to which however lady grace added but perhaps that will be just her way and then as her companion seemed for the moment not quite to follow by letting kitty off her debt  you mean that kitty goes free if lord john wins your promise  kitty goes free  she has her creditors release  for every shilling  and if he only fails  why then of course said now quite lucid lady grace she throws herself more than ever on poor father  poor father indeedlady sandgate richly sighed it  it appeared even to create in the younger woman a sense of excess yesbut he after all and in spite of everything adores her  to the point you meanfor lady sandgate could clearly but wonderof really sacrificing you  the weight of lady graces charming deep eyes on her face made her pause while at some length she gave back this look and the interchange determined in the girl a grave appeal you think i should be sacrificed if i married him  lady sandgate replied though with an equal emphasis indirectly could you marry him  lady grace waited a moment do you mean for kitty  for himself evenif they should convince you among them that he cares for you  lady grace had another delay well hes his awful mothers son  yesbut you wouldnt marry his mother  nobut i should only be the more uncomfortably and intimately conscious of her  even when lady sandgate optimistically put it she so markedly likes you  this determined in the girl a fine impatience she doesnt like me she only wants mewhich is a very different thing wants me for my fathers so particularly beautiful position and my mothers so supremely great people and for everything we have been and have done and still are and still have except of course poor notatallmodel kitty  to this luminous account of the matter lady sandgate turned as to a genial sunburst i see indeedfor the general immaculate connection  the words had no note of irony but lady grace in her great seriousness glanced with deprecation at the possibility well we havent had false notes weve scarcely even had bad moments  yes youve been beatificlady sandgate enviously quite ruefully felt it but any further treatment of the question was checked by the reentrance of the footmana demonstration explained by the concomitant appearance of a young man in eyeglasses and with the ends of his trousers clipped together as for cycling this must be your friend she had only time to say to the daughter of the house with which alert and reminded of how she was awaited elsewhere she retreated before her companions visitor who had come in with his guide from the vestibule she passed away to the terrace and the gardens mr hugh crimbles announced name ringing in her earsto some effect that we are as yet not qualified to discern     iv  lady grace had turned to meet mr hugh crimble whose pleasure in at once finding her lighted his keen countenance and broke into easy words so awfully kind of youin the midst of the great doings i noticedto have found a beautiful minute for me  i left the great doings which are almost over to every ones relief i think the girl returned so that your precious time shouldnt be taken to hunt for me  it was clearly for him on this bright answer as if her white hand were holding out the perfect flower of felicity you came in from your revels on purposewith the same charity you showed me from that first moment they stood smiling at each other as in an exchange of sympathy already confessedand even as if finding that their relation had grown during the lapse of contact she recognising the effect of what they had originally felt as bravely as he might name it what the fine slightly long oval of her essentially quiet facequiet in spite of certain vague depths of reference to forces of the strong high order forces involved and implanted yet also rather spent in the processkept in range from under her redundant black hat was the strength of expression the directness of communication that her guest appeared to borrow from the unframed and unattached nippers unceasingly perched by their mere groundglass rims as she remembered on the bony bridge of his indescribably authoritative since it was at the same time decidedly inquisitive young nose she must however also have embraced in this contemplation she must more or less again have interpreted his main physiognomic mark the degree to which his clean jaw was underhung and his lower lip protruded a lapse of regularity made evident by a suppression of beard and moustache as complete as that practised by mr benderthough without the appearance consequent in the latters case that of the flagrantly vain appeal in the countenance for some other exhibition of a history of a process of production than this so superficial one with the interested and interesting girl sufficiently under our attention while we thus try to evoke her we may even make out some wonder in her as to why the so perceptibly protrusive lower lip of this acquaintance of an hour or two should positively have contributed to his being handsome instead of much more logically interfering with it we might in fact in such a case even have followed her into another and no less refined a speculationthe question of whether the surest seat of his good looks mightnt after all be his high fair if somewhat narrow forehead crowned with short crisp brown hair and which after a fashion of its own predominated without overhanging he spoke after they had stood just face to face almost long enough for awkwardness i havent forgotten one item of your kindness to me on that rather bleak occasion  bleak do you call it she laughed why i found it rather tropicallush my neighbour on the other side wanted to talk to me of the white city  then you made it doubtless bleak for him let us say i couldnt let you alone i remember about thisit was like a shipwrecked signal to a sail on the horizon this obviously meant for the young man exactly what surrounded him he had begun like mr bender to be conscious of a thick solicitation of the eyeand much more than he doubtless of a tug at the imagination and he brokecharacteristically you would have been sureinto a great free gaiety of recognition  oh weve nothing particular in the hall lady grace amiably objected  nothing i see but claudes and cuyps im an ogre he saidbefore a new and rare feast  she happily took up his figure then wont you beginas a first coursewith tea after your ride if the other that isfor there has been an ogre before youhas left any  some tea with pleasurehe looked all his longing though when you talk of a fellowfeaster i should have supposed that on such a day as this especially youd find yourselves running a continuous table dhôte  ah we cant work sports in our gallery and saloonthe banging or whacking and shoving amusements that are all most people care for unless perhaps lady grace went on your own peculiar one as i understand you of playing football with the old benighted traditions and attributions you everywhere meet in fact i think you said the old idiotic superstitions  hugh crimble went more than halfway to meet this description of his fondest activity he indeed even beckoned it on the names and stories and stylesthe so often vain legend not to be too invidiousof author or subject or school but he had a drop no less as from the sense of a cause sometimes lost ah thats a game at which we all can play  though scarcely lady grace suggested at which we all can score  the words appeared indeed to take meaning from his growing impression of the place and its charmof the number of objects treasures of art that pressed for appreciation of their importance certainly he said no one can ever have scored much on sacred spots of this orderwhich express so the grand impunity of their pride their claims their assurance  weve had great luck she grantedas ive just been reminded but ever since those terrible things you told me in townabout the tremendous tricks of the whirligig of time and the aesthetic fools paradise in which so many of us liveive gone about with my heart in my mouth who knows that while i talk mr bender maynt be pulling us to pieces  hugh crimble had a shudder of remembrance mr bender  the rich american whos going round  it gave him a sharper shock the wretch who bagged lady lappingtons longhi  lady grace showed surprise is he a wretch  her visitor but asked to be extravagant ratherthe scoundrel he offered his infernal eight thousand down  oh i thought you meant he had played some trick  i wish he hadhe could then have been collared  well lady grace peacefully smiled its no use his offering us eight thousandor eighteen or even eighty  hugh crimble stared as at the odd superfluity of this reassurance almost crude on exquisite lips and contradicting an imputation no one would have indecently made gracious goodness i hope not the man surely doesnt suppose youd traffic  she might while she still smiled at him have been fairly enjoying the friendly horror she produced i dont quite know what he supposes but people have trafficked people do people are trafficking all round  ah hugh crimble cried thats what deprives me of my rest and as a lover of our vast and beneficent artwealth poisons my waking hours that artwealth is at the mercy of a leak there appears no means of stopping she had tapped a spring in him clearly and the consequent flood might almost at any moment become copious precious things are going out of our distracted country at a quicker rate than the very quickesta century and more agoof their ever coming in  she was sharply struck but was also unmistakably a person in whom stirred thought soon found connections and relations well i suppose our artwealth came insave for those awkward elgin marblesmainly by purchase too didnt it we ourselves largely took it away from somewhere didnt we we didnt grow it all  we grew some of the loveliest flowersand on the whole today the most exposed he had been pulled up but for an instant great gainsboroughs and sir joshuas and romneys and sargents great turners and constables and old cromes and brabazons form youll recognise a vast garden in themselves what have we ever for instance more successfully grown than your splendid duchess of waterbridge  the girl showed herself ready at once to recognise under his eloquence anything he would yesits our sir joshua i believe that mr bender has proclaimed himself particularly after  it brought a cloud to her friends face then hell be capable of anything  of anything no doubt but of making my father capable and you havent at any rate she said so much as seen the picture  i beg your pardoni saw it at the guildhall three years ago and am almost afraid of getting again with a fresh sense of its beauty a livelier sense of its danger  lady grace however was so far from fear that she could even afford pity poor baffled mr bender  oh rich and confident mr bender crimble cried once given his money his confidence is a horrid engine in itselftheres the rub i dare saythe young man saw it allhe has brought his poisonous cheque  she gave it her less exasperated wonder one has heard of that but only in the case of some particularly pushing dealer  and mr bender to do him justice isnt a particularly pushing dealer  no lady grace judiciously returned i think hes not a dealer at all but just what you a moment ago spoke of yourself as being  he gave a glance at his possibly wild recent past a fond true lover  as we all were in our lucky timewhen we rumaged italy and spain  he appeared to recognise this complicationof benders voracious integrity but only to push it away well i dont know whether the best lovers are or ever were the best buyersbut i feel today that theyre the best keepers  the breath of his emphasis blew as her eyes showed on the girls dimmer fire its as if it were suddenly in the air that youve brought us some light or some helpthat you may do something really good for us  do you mean mark down as they say at the shops all your greatest claims  his chord of sensibility had trembled all gratefully into derision and not to seem to swagger he had put his possible virtue at its lowest this she beautifully showed that she beautifully saw i dare say that if you did even that we should have to take it from you  then it may very well be he laughed back the reason why i feel under my delightful wonderful impression a bit anxious and nervous and afraid  that shows she returned that you suspect us of horrors hiding from justice and that your natural kindness yet shrinks from handing us over  well clearly she might put it as she likedit all came back to his being more charmed heaven knows ive wanted a chance at you but what should you say if having then at last just taken you in in your so apparent perfection i should feel it the better part of valour simply to mount my bike again and spin away  i should be sure that at the end of the avenue youd turn right round and come back youd think again of mr bender  whom i dont however you seeif hes prowling off therein the least want to meet crimble made the point with gaiety i dont know what i mightnt do to himand yet its not of my temptation to violence after all that im most afraid its of the brutal mistake of ones breakingwith ones priggish precious modernity and ones possibly futile discriminationsinto a general situation or composition as we say so serene and sound and right what should one do here out of respect for that felicity but hold ones breath and walk on tiptoe the very celebrations and consecrations as you tell me instinctively stay outside i saw that all the young man went on with more weight in his ardour i saw it while we talked in london as your natural setting and your native airand now ten minutes on the spot have made it sink into my spirit youre a case all together of enchanted harmony of perfect equilibriumtheres nothing to be done or said  his friend listened to this eloquence with her eyes lowered then raising them to meet with a vague insistence his own after which something she had seen there appeared to determine in her another motion she indicated the small landscape that mr bender had by lady sandgates report rapidly studied and denounced for what do you take that little picture  hugh crimble went over and looked why dont you know its a jolly little vandermeer of delft  its not a base imitation  he looked again but appeared at a loss an imitation of vandermeer  mr bender thinks of cuyp  it made the young man ring out then mr benders doubly dangerous  singly is enough lady grace laughed but you see you have to speak  oh to him rather after thatif youll just take me to him  yes then she said but even while she spoke lord john who had returned by the terrace from his quarter of an hour passed with lady imber was there practically between them a fact that she had to notice for her other visitor to whom she was hastily reduced to naming him  his lordship eagerly made the most of this tribute of her attention which had reached his ear he treated ither oh lord johnas a direct greeting ah lady grace i came back particularly to find you  she could but explain her predicament i was taking mr crimble to see the pictures and then more pointedly as her manner had been virtually an introduction of that gentleman an introduction which lord johns mere noncommittal stare was as little as possible a response to mr crimbles one of the quite new connoisseurs  oh im at the very lowest round of the ladder but i aspire hugh laughed  youll mount said lady grace with friendly confidence  he took it again with gay deprecation ah if by that time theres anything left here to mount on  let us hope there will be at least what mr bender poor man wont have been able to carry off to which lady grace added as to strike a helpful spark from the personage who had just joined them but who had the air of wishing to preserve his detachment its to lord john that we owe mr benders acquaintance  hugh looked at the gentleman to whom they were so indebted then do you happen to know sir what your friend means to do with his spoil  the question got itself but dryly treated as if it might be a commercially calculating or interested one oh not sell it again  then ship it to new york the inquirer pursued defining himself somehow as not snubbed and from this point not snubbable  that appearance failed none the less to deprive lord john of a betrayed relish for being able to displease lady graces odd guest by large assent as fast as ever he canand you can land things there now cant you in three or four days  i dare say but cant he be induced to have a little mercy hugh sturdily pursued  lord john pushed out his lips a little how much do you want  well one wants to be able somehow to stay his hand  i doubt if you can any more stay mr benders hand than you can empty his purse  ah the despoilers said crimble with strong expression but its we he added who are base  baseand lord johns surprise was apparently genuine  to want only to do business i mean with our treasures with our glories  hughs words exhaled such a sense of peril as to draw at once lady grace ah but if were above that here as you know  he stood smilingly corrected and contrite of course i knowbut you must forgive me if i have it on the brain and show me first of all wont you the moretto of brescia  you know then about the moretto of brescia  why didnt you tell me yourself it went on between them for the moment quite as if there had been no lord john  probably yes she recalled so how i must have swaggered after which she turned to the other visitor with a kindness strained clear of urgency will you also come  he confessed to a difficultywhich his whole face begged her also to take account of i hoped youd be at leisurefor something ive so at heart  this had its effect she took a rapid decision and turned persuasively to crimblefor whom in like manner there must have been something in her face let mr bender himself then show you and there are things in the library too  oh yes there are things in the library lord john happy in his gained advantage and addressing hugh from the strong ground of an initiation already complete quite sped him on the way  hugh clearly made no attempt to veil the penetration with which he was moved to look from one of these counsellors to the other though with a ready thankyou for lady grace he the next instant started in pursuit of mr bender     v  your friend seems remarkably hot lord john remarked to his young hostess as soon as they had been left together  he has cycled twenty miles and indeed she smiled he does appear to care for what he cares for  her companion then during a moments silence might have been noting the emphasis of her assent have you known him long  nonot long  nor seen him often  only oncetill now  oh said lord john with another pause but he soon proceeded let us leave him then to cool i havent cycled twenty miles but ive motored forty very much in the hope of this lady gracethe chance of being able to assure you that i too care very much for what i care for to which he added on an easier note as to carry off a slight awkwardness while she only waited you certainly mustnt let yourselfbetween us allbe worked to death  oh such days as thisi she made light enough of her burden  they dont come often to me at least lady grace i hadnt grasped in advance the scale of your fête he went on but since ive the great luck to find you alone he paused for breath however before the full sequence  she helped him out as through common kindness but it was a trifle colourless alone or in company lord john im always very glad to see you  then that assurance helps me to wonder if you dont perhaps gently guess what it is i want to say this time indeed she left him to his wonder so that he had to support himself ive tried all consideratelythese three monthsto let you see for yourself how i feel i feel very strongly lady grace so that at lastand his impatient sincerity took after another instant the jumpwell i regularly worship you youre my absolute ideal i think of you the whole time  she measured out consideration as if it had been a yard of pretty ribbon are you sure you know me enough  i think i know a perfect woman when i see one nothing now at least could have been more prompt and while a decent pity for such a mistake showed in her smile he followed it up isnt what you rather mean that you havent cared sufficiently to know me if so that can be little by little mended lady grace he was in fact altogether gallant about it im aware of the limits of what i have to show or to offer but i defy you to find a limit to my possible devotion  she deferred to that but taking it in a lower key i believe youd be very good to me  well isnt that something to start withhe fairly pounced on it ill do any blest thing in life you like ill accept any condition you impose if youll only tell me you see your way  shouldnt i have a little more first to see yours she asked when you say youll do anything in life i like isnt there anything you yourself want strongly enough to do  he cast a stare about on the suggestions of the scene anything that will make money you mean  make money or make reputationor even just make the time pass  oh what i have to look to in the way of a career if that was her meaning he could show after an instant that he didnt fear it well your father dear delightful man has been so good as to give me to understand that he backs me for a decent deserving creature and ive noticed as you doubtless yourself have that when lord theign backs a fellow  he left the obvious moral for her to take upwhich she did but all interrogatively the fellow at once comes in for something awfully good  i dont in the least mind your laughing at me lord john returned for when i put him the question of the lift hed give me by speaking to you first he bade me simply remember the complete personal liberty in which he leaves you and yet which doesnt cometake my word said the young man sagelyfrom his being at all indifferent  no she answeredfather isnt indifferent but fathers great  great indeedher friend took it as with full comprehension this appeared not to prevent however a second and more anxious thought too great for you  well he makes me feeleven as his daughtermy extreme comparative smallness  it was easy lord john indicated to see what she meant hes a grand seigneur and a serious onethats what he is the very type and model of it down to the ground so you can imagine the young man said what he makes me feelmost of all when hes so awfully goodnatured to me his being as great as you say and yet backing mesuch as i amdoesnt that strike you as a good note for me the best you could possibly require for he really would like what i propose to you  she might have been noting while she thought that he had risen to ingenuity to fineness on the wings of his argument under the effect of which her reply had the air of a concession yeshe would like it  then he has spoken to you her suitor eagerly asked  he hasnt neededhe has ways of letting one know  yes yes he has ways all his ownlike everything else he has hes wonderful  she fully agreed hes wonderful  the tone of it appeared somehow to shorten at once for lord john the rest of his approach to a conclusion so you do see your way  ah she said with a quick sad shrinkage  i mean her visitor hastened to explain if he does put it to you as the very best idea he has for you when he does thatas i believe him ready to dowill you really and fairly listen to him im certain honestly that when you know me better his confidence in short donned a bravery  ive been feeling this quarter of an hour the girl returned that i do know you better  then isnt that all i wantunless indeed i ought perhaps to ask rather if it isnt all you do at any rate said lord john i may see you again here  she waited a moment you must have patience with me  i am having it but after your fathers appeal  well she said that must come first  then you wont dodge it  she looked at him straight i dont dodge lord john  he admired the manner of it you look awfully handsome as you say soand you see what that does to me as to attentuate a little the freedom of which he went on may i fondly hope that if lady imber too should wish to put in another word for me  will i listen to herit brought lady grace straight down no lord john let me tell you at once that ill do nothing of the sort kittys quite another affair and i never listen to her a bit more than i can help  lord john appeared to feel on this that he mustnt too easily in honour abandon a person who had presented herself to him as an ally ah you strike me as a little hard on her your father himselfin his looser momentstakes pleasure in what she says  our young womans eyes as they rested on him after this remark had no mercy for its extreme feebleness if you mean that shes the most reckless rattle one knows and that she never looks so beautiful as when shes at her worst and that always clever for where she makes out her interest she has learnt to get round him till he only sees through her eyesif you mean that i understand you perfectly but even if you think me horrid for reflecting so on my nearest and dearest its not on the side on which he has most confidence in his elder daughter that his youngest is moved to have most confidence in him  lord john stared as if she had shaken some odd bright fluttering object in his face but then recovering himself he hasnt perhaps an absolutely boundless confidence  in any one in the world but himselfshe had taken him straight up he hasnt indeed and thats what we must come to so that even if he likes you as much as you doubtless very justly feel it wont be because you are right about your being nice but because he is  you mean that if i were wrong about it he would still insist that he isnt  lady grace was indeed sure absolutelyif he had begun so he began so with kittythat is with allowing her everything  lord john appeared struck yesand he still allows her two thousand  im glad to hear itshe has never told me how much the girl undisguisedly smiled  then perhaps i oughtnthe glowed with the light of contrition  well you cant help it now his companion remarked with amusement  you mean that he ought to allow you as much lord john inquired im sure youre right and that he will he continued quite as in good faith but i want you to understand that i dont care in the least what it may be  the subject of his suit took the longest look at him she had taken yet youre very good to say so  if this was ironic the touch fell short thanks to his perception that they had practically just ceased to be alone they were in presence of a third figure who had arrived from the terrace but whose approach to them was not so immediate as to deprive lord john of time for another question will you let him tell you at all events how good he thinks meand then let me come back and have it from you again  lady graces answer to this was to turn as he drew nearer to the person by whom they were now joined lord john desires you should tell me father how good you think him  good my deargood for what said lord theign a trifle absurdly but looking from one of them to the other  i feel i must ask him to tell you  then i shall give him a chanceas i should particularly like you to go back and deal with those overwhelming children  ah they dont overwhelm you fatherthe girl put it with some point  if you mean to say i overwhelmed them i dare say i did he repliedfrom my view of that vast collective gape of six hundred painfully plain and perfectly expressionless faces but that was only for the time i pumped adviceoh such adviceand they held the large bucket as still as my pet pointer when i scratch him holds his back the bucket under the stream  was bound to overflow lady grace suggested  well the strong recoil of the wave of intelligence has been not unnaturally followed by the formidable break you must really lord theign insisted go and deal with it  his daughters smile for all this was perceptibly cold you work people up father and then leave others to let them down  the two things he promptly replied require different natures to which he simply added as with the habit of authority though not of harshness go  it was absolute and she yielded only pausing an instant to look as with a certain gathered meaning from one of the men to the other faintly and resignedly sighing she passed away to the terrace and disappeared  the nature that can let you downi rather like it you know lord john threw off which for an airy elegance in them were perhaps just slightly rash wordshis companion gave him so sharp a look as the two were left together     vi  face to face with his visitor the master of dedborough betrayed the impression his daughter appeared to have given him she didnt want to go and then before lord john could reply what the deuce is the matter with her  lord john took his time i think perhaps a little mr crimble  and who the deuce is a little mr crimble  a young man who was just with herand whom she appears to have invited  where is he then lord theign demanded  off there among the pictureswhich he seems partly to have come for  ohit made his lordship easier then hes all righton such a day  his companion could none the less just wonder hadnt lady grace told you  that he was coming not that i remember but lord theign perceptibly preoccupied made nothing of this weve had other fish to fry and you know the freedom i allow her  his friend had a vivid gesture my dear man i only ask to profit by it with which there might well have been in lord johns face a light of comment on the pretension in such a quarter to allow freedom  yet it was a pretension that lord theign sustainedas to show himself far from all bourgeois narrowness she has her friends by the scoreat this time of day there was clearly a claim here alsoto know the time of day but in the matter of friends where by the way is your ownof whom ive but just heard  oh off there among the pictures too so theyll have met and taken care of each other accounting for this inquirer would be clearly the least of lord johns difficulties i mustnt appear to bender to have failed him but i must at once let you know before i join him that seizing my opportunity i have just very definitely in fact very pressingly spoken to lady grace it hasnt been perhaps he continued quite the pick of a chance but that seemed never to come and if im not too fondly mistaken at any rate she listened to me without abhorrence only ive led her to expectfor our casethat youll be so good without loss of time as to say the clinching word to her yourself  without loss you mean ofamy daughters time lord theign confessedly and amiably interested had accepted these intimationsyet with the very blandness that was not accessible to hustling and was never forgetful of its standing privilege of criticism he had come in from his public duty a few minutes before somewhat flushed and blown but that had presently droppedto the effect we should have guessed of his appearing to lord john at least as cool as the occasion required his appearance we ourselves certainly should have felt was in all respects charmingwith the great note of it the beautiful restless almost suspicious challenge to you on the part of deep and mixed things in him his pride and his shyness his conscience his taste and his temper to deny that he was admirably simple obviously at this rate he had a passion for simplicitysimplicity above all of relation with you and would show you with the last subtlety of displeasure his impatience of your attempting anything more with himself with such an ideal of decent ease he would confound you sink a hundred other attributesor the recognition at least and the formulation of themthat you might abjectly have taken for granted in him just to show you that in a beastly vulgar age you had and small wonder a beastly vulgar imagination he sank thus surely in defiance of insistent vulgarity half his consciousness of his advantages flattering himself that mere facility and amiability a true effective a positively ideal suppression of reference in any one to anything that might complicate alone floated above this would be quite his religion you might inferto cause his hands to ignore in whatever contact any opportunity however convenient for an unfair pull which habit it was that must have produced in him a sort of ripe and radiant fairness if it be allowed us that is to figure in so shining an air a nobleman of fiftythree of an undecided rather than a certified frame or outline of a head thinly though neatly covered and not measureably massive of an almost trivial freshness of a face marked but by a fine inwrought line or two and lighted by a merely charming expression you might somehow have traced back the whole character so presented to an ideal privately invokedthat of his establishing in the formal garden of his suffered greatness such easy seats and short perspectives such winding paths and naturallooking waters as would mercifully break up the scale you would perhaps indeed have reflected at the same time that the thought of so much mercy was almost more than anything else the thought of a great option and a great marginin fine of fifty alternatives which remarks of ours however leave his lordship with his last immediate question on his hands  well yesthat of course in all propriety his companion has meanwhile replied to it but i was thinking a little you understand of the importance of our own time  divinably lord theign put himself out less as we may say for the comparatively matterofcourse haunters of his garden than for interlopers even but slightly accredited he seemed thus not at all to strain to understand in this particular connectionit would be his familiarly amusing friend lord john clearly who must do most of the work for him our own in the sense of yours and mine  of yours and mine and lady imbers yesand a good bit last not least in that of my watching and waiting mothers this struck no prompt spark of apprehension from his listener so that lord john went on the last thing she did this morning was to remind me with her fine old frankness that she would like to learn without more delay where on the whole question she is dont you know what she put to methe younger man felt his ground a little but proceeded furtherwhat she put to me with her rather grand way of looking all questions straight in the face you see was do we or dont we decidedly take up practically her very handsome offervery handsome being i mean what she calls it though it strikes even me too you know as rather decent  lord theign at this point resigned himself to know kitty has of course rubbed into me how decent she herself finds it she hurls herself again on mesuccessfullyfor everything and it suits her down to the ground she pays her beastly debtthat is i mean to say and he took himself up though it was scarce more than perfunctory discharges her obligationsby her sisters fair hand not to mention a few other trifles for which i naturally provide  lord john a little unexpectedly to himself on the defensive was yet but briefly at a loss of course we take into account dont we not only the fact of my mothers desire intended i assure you to be most flattering that lady grace shall enter our family with all honours but her expressed readiness to facilitate the thing by an understanding over and above  over and above kittys release from her damnable paymentlord theign reached out to what his guest had left rather in the air of course we take everything into accountor i shouldnt my dear fellow be discussing with you at all a business one or two of whose aspects so little appeal to me especially as theres nothing you easily conceive that a daughter of mine can come in for by entering even your family or any other as a family that she wouldnt be quite as sure of by just staying in her own the duchesss idea at any rate if ive followed you is that if grace does accept you she settles on you twelve thousand with the condition  lord john was already all there definitely yes of your settling the equivalent on lady grace  and what do you call the equivalent of twelve thousand  why tacked on to a value so great and so charming as lady grace herself i dare say such a sum as nine or ten would serve  and where the mischief if you please at this highly inconvenient time am i to pick up nine or ten thousand  lord john declined with a smiling a fairly irritating eye for his friends general resources to consider that question seriously surely you can have no difficulty whatever  why notwhen you can see for yourself that ive had this year to let poor dear old hill street do you call it the moment for me to have liked to see myself all but cajoled into planking down even such a matter as the very much lower figure of kittys horrid incubus  ah but the inducement and the quid pro quo lord john brightly indicated are here much greater in the case you speak of you will only have removed the incubuswhich i grant you she must and you must feel as horrid in this other you pacify lady imber and marry lady grace marry her to a man who has set his heart on her and of whom she has just expressedto himselfa very kind and very high opinion  she has expressed a very high opinion of youlord theign scarce glowed with credulity  but the younger man held his ground she has told me she thoroughly likes me and thatthough a fellow feels an ass repeating such thingsshe thinks me perfectly charming  a tremendous creature eh all round then said lord theign what does she want more  she very possibly wants nothingbut im to that beastly degree you see his visitor patiently explained in the cleft stick of my fearfully positive mothers wants those are her terms and i dont mind saying that theyre most disagreeable to mei quite hate em there only i think it makes a jolly difference that i wouldnt touch em with a long pole if my personal feelingin respect to lady gracewasnt so immensely enlisted  i assure you id chuck em out of window my boy if i didnt believe youd be really good to her lord theign returned with the properest spirit  it only encouraged his companion you will just tell her then now and here how good you honestly believe i shall be  this appeal required a momenta longer look at him you truly hold that that friendly guarantee backed by my parental weight will do your job  thats the conviction i entertain  lord theign thought again well even if your convictions just that still doesnt tell me into which of my very empty pockets it will be of the least use for me to fumble  oh lord john laughed when a man has such a tremendous assortment of breeches he pulled up however as in his motion his eye caught the great vista of the open rooms if its a question of pocketsand whats in emhere precisely is my man this personage had come back from his tour of observation and was now on the threshold of the hall exhibited to lord theign as well lord johns welcome was warm ive had awfully to fail you mr bender but i was on the point of joining you let me however still better introduce you to our host     vii  mr bender indeed formidably advancing scarce had use for this assistance happy to meet youespecially in your beautiful home lord theign to which he added while the master of dedborough stood goodhumouredly passive to his approach ive been round by your kind permission and the light of nature and havent required support though if i had theres a gentleman there who seemed prepared to allow me any amount mr bender out of his abundance evoked as by a suggestive hand this contributory figure a young spare nervous gentleman with eyeglassesi guess hes an author a friend of yours too he asked of lord john  the answer was prompt and emphatic no the gentleman is no friend at all of mine mr bender  a friend of my daughters lord theign easily explained i hope theyre looking after him  oh they took care he had tea and bread and butter to any extent and were so good as to move something mr bender conscientiously added so that he could get up on a chair and see straight into the moretto  this was a touch however that appeared to affect lord john unfavourably up on a chair i say  mr bender took another view why i got right up myselfa little more and id almost have begun to paw it he got me quite interestedthe proprietor of the picture would perhaps care to knowin that moretto and it was on these lines that mr bender continued to advance i take it that your biggest value however lord theign is your splendid sir joshua our friend there has a great deal to say about that toobut it didnt lead to our moving any more furniture on which he paused as to enjoy with a show of his fine teeth his hosts reassurance it has yet my impression of that picture sir led to something else are you prepared lord theign to entertain a proposition  lord theign met mr benders eyes while this inquirer left these few portentous words to speak for themselves to the effect that i part to you with the beautiful duchess of waterbridge no mr bender such a proposition would leave me intensely cold  lord john had meanwhile had a more headlong cry my dear bender i envy you  i guess you dont envy me his friend serenely replied as much as i envy lord theign and then while mr bender and the latter continued to face each other searchingly and firmly what i allude to is an overture of a strong and simple stampsuch as perhaps would shed a softer light on the difficulties raised by association and attachment ive had some experience of first shocks and id be glad to meet you as man to man  mr bender was quite clearly all genial and all sincere he intended no irony and used consciously no great freedom lord theign not less evidently saw this and it permitted him amusement as rich man to poor man is how im to understand it for me to meet you he added i should have to be temptedand im not even temptable so there we are he blandly smiled  his blandness appeared even for a moment to set an example to lord john the beautiful duchess of waterbridge mr bender is a golden apple of one of those great family trees of which respectable people dont lop off the branches whose venerable shade in this garish and denuded age they so much enjoy  mr bender looked at him as if he had cut some irrelevant caper then if they dont sell their ancestors where in the world are all the ancestors bought  doesnt it for the moment sufficiently answer your question lord theign asked that theyre definitely not bought at dedborough  why said mr bender with a wealthy patience you talk as if it were my interest to be reasonablewhich shows how little you understand id be ashamedwith the lovely ideas i haveif i didnt make you kick and his sturdy smile for it all fairly proclaimed his faith well i guess i can wait  this again in turn visibly affected lord john marking the moment from which he in spite of his cultivated levity allowed an intenser and more sustained look to keep straying toward their host mr benders bound to have something  it was even as if after a minute lord theign had been reached by his friends mute pressure something  something mr bender lord john insisted  it made their visitor rather sharply fix him why have you an interest lord john  this personage though undisturbed by the challenge if such it was referred it to lord theign do you authorise me to speaka littleas if i have an interest  lord theign gave the appealand the speakera certain attention and then appeared rather sharply to turn away from them my dear fellow you may amuse yourself at my expense as you like  oh i dont mean at your expense lord john laughedi mean at mr benders  well go ahead lord john said that gentleman always easy but always too as you would have felt aware of everythinggo ahead but dont sweetly hope to create me in any desire that doesnt already exist in the germ the attempt has often been made over herehas in fact been organised on a considerable scale but i guess ive got some peculiarity for it doesnt seem as if the thing could be done if the germ is there on the other hand mr bender conceded it develops independently of all encouragement  lord john communicated again as in a particular sense with lord theign he thinks i really mean to offer him something  lord theign who seemed to wish to advertise a degree of detachment from the issue or from any other such strolled off in his restlessness toward the door that opened to the terrace only stopping on his way to light a cigarette from a matchbox on a small table it was but after doing so that he made the remark ah mr bender may easily be too much for you  that makes me the more sorry sir said his visitor not to have been enough for you  i risk it at any rate lord john went oni put you bender the question of whether you wouldnt move as you say to acquire that moretto  mr benders large face had a commensurate gaze as i say i havent said anything of the sort  but you do love you know lord john slightly overgrimaced  i dont when i dont want to im different from most peoplei can love or not as i like the trouble with that moretto mr bender continued is that it aint what im after  his after had somehow for the ear the vividness of a sharp whack on the resisting surface of things and was concerned doubtless in lord johns speaking again across to their host the worst he can do for me you see is to refuse it  lord theign who practically had his back turned and was fairly dandling about in his impatience tossed out to the terrace the cigarette he had but just lighted yet he faced round to reply its the very first time in the history of this house a long one mr bender that a picture or anything else in it has been offered  it was not imperceptible that even if he hadnt dropped mr bender mightnt have been markedly impressed then it must be the very first time such an offer has failed  oh it isnt that we in the least press it lord theign quite naturally laughed  ah i beg your pardoni press it very hard and lord john as taking from his face and manner a cue for further humorous license went so far as to emulate though sympathetically enough their companions native form you dont mean to say you dont feel the interest of that moretto  mr bender quietly confident took his time to reply well if you had seen me up on that chair youd have thought i did  then you must have stepped down from the chair properly impressed  i stepped down quite impressed with that young man  mr crimbleit came after an instant to lord john with his opinion really then i hope hes aware of the pictures value  you had better ask him mr bender observed  oh we dont depend here on the mr crimbles lord john returned  mr bender took a longer look at him are you aware of the value yourself  his friend resorted again as for the amusement of the thing to their entertainer am i aware of the value of the moretto  lord theign who had meanwhile lighted another cigarette appeared a bit extravagantly smoking to wish to put an end to his effect of hovering aloof  that question neednt trouble uswhen i see how much mr bender himself knows about it  well lord theign i only know what that young man puts it at and then as the others waited ten thousand said mr bender  ten thousand the owner of the work showed no emotion  well said lord john again in mr benders style whats the matter with ten thousand  the subject of his gay tribute considered theres nothing the matter with ten thousand  then lord theign asked is there anything the matter with the picture  yes siri guess there is  it gave an upward push to his lordships eyebrows but what in the world  well thats just the question  the eyebrows continued to rise does he pretend theres a question of whether it is a moretto  thats what he was up there trying to find out  but if the values according to himself ten thousand  why of course said mr bender its a fine work anyway  then lord theign brought goodnaturedly out whats the matter with you mr bender  that gentleman was perfectly clear the matter with me lord theign is that ive no use for a ten thousand picture  no usethe expression had an oddity but whats it your idea to do with such things  i mean mr bender explained that a picture of that rank is not what im after  the figure said his noble hostspeaking thus under pressure commerciallyis beyond what you see your way to  but lord john had jumped at the truth the matter with mr bender is that he sees his way much further  further their companion echoed  the matter with mr bender is that he wants to give millions  lord theign sounded this abyss with a smile well there would be no difficulty about that i think  ah said his guest you know the basis sir on which im ready to pay  on the basis then of the sir joshua lord john inquired how far would you go  mr bender indicated by a gesture that on a question reduced to a moiety by its conditional form he could give but semisatisfaction well id go all the way  he wants you see lord john elucidated an ideally expensive thing  lord theign appeared to decide after a moment to enter into the pleasant spirit of this which he did by addressing his younger friend then why shouldnt i make even the moretto as expensive as he desires  because you cant do violence to that masters natural modesty mr bender declared before lord john had time to speak and conscious at this moment of the reappearance of his fellowexplorer he at once supplied a further light i guess this gentleman at any rate can tell you     viii  hugh crimble had come back from his voyage of discovery and it was visible as he stood there flushed and quite radiant that he had caught in his approach lord theigns last inquiry and mr benders reply to it you would have imputed to him on the spot the lively possession of a new idea the sustaining sense of a message important enough to justify his irruption he looked from one to the other of the three men scattered a little by the sight of him but attached eyes of recognition then to lord theigns whom he remained an instant longer communicatively smiling at after which as you might have gathered he all confidently plunged taking up the talk where the others had left it i should say lord theign if youll allow me in regard to what you appear to have been discussing that it depends a good deal on just that questionof what your moretto at any rate may be presumed or proved to be let me thank you he cheerfully went on for your kind leave to go over your treasures  the personage he so addressed was as we know nothing if not generally affable yet if that was just then apparent it was through a shade of coolness for the slightly heated familiarity of so plain or at least so free a young man in eyeglasses now for the first time definitely apprehended oh ive scarcely treasuresbut ive some things of interest  hugh however entering the opulent circle as it were clearly took account of no breath of a chill i think possible my lord that youve a great treasureif youve really so high a rarity as a splendid mantovano  a mantovano you wouldnt have been sure that his lordship didnt pronounce the word for the first time in his life  there have been supposed to be only seven real examples about the world so that if by an extraordinary chance you find yourself the possessor of a magnificent eighth  but lord john had already broken in why there you are mr bender  oh mr bender with whom ive made acquaintance hugh returned was there as it began to work in me  that your moretto lord theignmr bender took their informant upisnt after all a moretto at all and he continued amusedly to hugh it began to work in you sir like very strong drink  do i understand you to suggest lord theign asked of the startling young man that my precious picture isnt genuine  well hugh knew exactly what he suggested as a picture lord theign as a great portrait one of the most genuine things in europe but it strikes me as probable that from far backfor reasonsthere has been a wrong attribution that the work has been in other words traditionally obstinately miscalled it has passed for a moretto and at first i quite took it for one but i suddenly as i looked and looked and saw and saw began to doubt and now i know why i doubted  lord theign had during this speech kept his eyes on the ground but he raised them to mr crimbles almost palpitating presence for the remark im bound to say that i hope youve some very good grounds  ive three or four lord theign they seem to me of the bestas yet they made me wonder and wonderand then light splendidly broke  his lordship didnt stint his attention reflected you mean from other mantovanosthat i dont know  i mean from those i know myself said hugh and i mean from fine analogies with one in particular  analogies that in all these years these centuries have so remarkably not been noticed  well hugh competently explained theyre a sort of thing the very sense of the value and meaning of are a highly modernin fact a quite recent growth  lord john at this professed with cordiality that he at least quite understood oh we know a lot more about our pictures and things than ever our ancestors did  well i guess its enough for me mr bender contributed that your ancestors knew enough to get em  ah that doesnt go so far cried hugh unless we ourselves know enough to keep em  the words appeared to quicken in a manner lord theigns view of the speaker were your ancestors mr crimble great collectors  arrested it might be in his general assurance hugh wondered and smiled minecollectors oh im afraid i havent anyto speak of only it has seemed to me for a long time he added that on that head we should all feel together  lord theign looked for a moment as if these were rather large presumptions then he put them in their place a little curtly its one thing to keep our possessions for ourselvesits another to keep them for other people  well hugh goodhumouredly returned im perhaps not so absolutely sure of myself if you press me as that i shant be glad of a higher and wiser opinioni mean than my own it would be awfully interesting if youll allow me to say so to have the judgment of one or two of the great men  youre not yourself mr crimble one of the great men his host asked with tempered irony  well i guess hes going to be anyhow mr bender cordially struck in and this remarkable exhibition of intelligence may just let him loose on the world maynt it  thank you mr benderand hugh obviously tried to look neither elated nor snubbed ive too much still to learn but im learning every day and i shall have learnt immensely this afternoon  pretty well at my expense however lord theign laughed if you demolish a name weve held for generations so dear  you may have held the name dear my lord his young critic answered but my whole point is that if im right youve held the picture itself cheap  because a mantovano said lord john is so much greater a value  hugh met his eyes a moment are you talking of values pecuniary  what values are not pecuniary  hugh might during his hesitation have been imagined to stand off a little from the question well some things have in a higher degree that one and some have the associational or the factitious and some the clear artistic  and some mr bender opined have them allin the highest degree but what you mean he went on is that a mantovano would come higher under the hammer than a moretto  why sir the young man returned there arent any as ive just stated to come i accountor i easily canfor every one of the very small number  then do you consider that you account for this one  i believe i shall if youll give me time  oh time mr bender impatiently sighed but well give you all weve gotonly i guess it isnt much and he appeared freely to invite their companions to join in this estimate they listened to him however they watched him for the moment but in silence and with the next he had gone on how much higherif your idea is correct about itwould lord theigns picture come  hugh turned to that nobleman does mr bender mean come to him my lord  lord theign looked again hard at hugh and then harder than he had done yet at his other invader i dont know what mr bender means with which he turned off  well i guess i mean that it would come higher to me than to any one but how much higher the american continued to hugh  how much higher to you  oh i can size that how much higher as a mantovano  unmistakablyfor us at leastour young man was gaining time he had the instinct of circumspection and delay to any one  to any one  than as a moretto hugh continued  it even acted on lord johns nerves thats what were talking aboutreally  but hugh still took his ease as if with his eyes first on bender and then on lord theign whose back was practically presented he were covertly studying signs well he presently said in view of the very great interest combined with the very great rarity more thanah more than can be estimated offhand  it made lord theign turn round but a fine moretto has a very great rarity and a very great interest  yesbut not on the whole the same amount of either  no not on the whole the same amount of eithermr bender judiciously echoed it but how he freely pursued are you going to find out  have i your permission lord theign hugh brightly asked to attempt to find out  the question produced on his lordships part a visible a natural anxiety what would it be your idea then to do with my property  nothing at all hereit could all be done i think at verona what besets what quite haunts me hugh explained is the vivid image of a mantovanoone of the glories of the short listin a private collection in that place the conviction grows in me that the two portraits must be of the same original in fact ill bet my head the young man quite ardently wound up that the wonderful subject of the verona picture a very great person clearly is none other than the very great person of yours  lord theign had listened with interest maynt he be that and yet from another hand  it isnt another handoh hugh was quite positive its the hand of the very same painter  how can you prove its the same  only by the most intimate internal evidence i admitand evidence that of course has to be estimated  then who lord theign asked is to estimate it  wellhugh was all readywill you let pappendick one of the first authorities in europe a good friend of mine in fact more or less my master and who is generally to be found at brussels i happen to know he knows your picturehe once spoke to me of it and hell go and look again at the verona one hell go and judge our issue if i apply to him in the light of certain new tips that i shall be able to give him  lord theign appeared to wonder if you apply to him  like a shot i believe if i ask it of himas a service  a service to you hell be very obliging his lordship smiled  well ive obliged him hugh readily retorted  the obligation will be to welord theign spoke more formally  well the satisfaction said hugh will be to all of us the things pappendick has seen he intensely ineffaceably keeps in mind to every detail so that hell tell meas no one else really canif the verona man is your man  but then asked mr bender weve got to believe anyway what he says  the market said lord john with emphasis would have to believe itthats the point  oh hugh returned lightly the market will have nothing to do with it i hope but i think youll feel when he has spoken that you really know where you are  mr bender couldnt doubt of that oh if he gives us a bigger thing we wont complain only how long will it take him to get there i want him to start right away  well as im sure hell be deeply interested  we maymr bender took it straight upget news next week  hugh addressed his reply to lord theign it was already a little too much as if he and the american between them were snatching the case from that possessors hands the day i hear from pappendick you shall have a full report and he conscientiously added if im proved to have been unfortunately wrong  his lordship easily pointed the moral youll have caused me some inconvenience  of course i shall the young man unreservedly agreedlike a wanton meddling ass his candour his freedom had decidedly a note of their own but my conviction after those moments with your picture was too strong for me not to speakand since you allow it i face the danger and risk the test  i allow it of course in the form of business this produced in hugh a certain blankness business if i consent to the inquiry i pay for the inquiry hugh demurred even if i turn out mistaken you make me in any event your proper charge the young man thought again and then as for vague accommodation oh my charge wont be high  ah mr bender protested it ought to be handsome if the things marked up after which he looked at his watch but i guess ive got to go lord theign though your lovely old duchessfor its to her ive lost my heartdoes cry out for me again  youll find her then still there lord john observed with emphasis but with his eyes for the time on lord theign and if you want another look at her ill presently come and take one too  ill order your car to the gardenfront lord theign added to this youll reach it from the saloon but ill see you again first  mr bender glared as with the round full force of his pair of motor lamps well if youre ready to talk about anything i am goodbye mr crimble  goodbye mr bender but hugh addressing their host while his fellowguest returned to the saloon broke into the familiarity of confidence as if you could be ready to talk  this produced on the part of the others present a mute exchange that could only have denoted surprise at all the irrepressible young outsider thus projected upon them took for granted ive an idea said lord john to his friend that youre quite ready to talk with me  hugh then with his appetite so richly quickened could but rejoice lady grace spoke to me of things in the library  youll find it that waylord theign gave the indication  thanks said hugh elatedly and hastened away  lord john when he had gone found relief in a quick comment very sharp no doubtbut he wants taking down  the master of dedborough wouldnt have put it so crudely but the young expert did bring certain things home the people my daughters in the exercise of a wild freedom do pick up  well dont you see that all youve got to doon the question were dealing withis to claim your very own wild freedom surely im right in feeling you lord john further remarked to have jumped at once to my idea that bender is heavensentand at what they call the psychologic moment dont theyto point that moral why look anywhere else for a sum of money thatsmaller or greateryou can find with perfect ease in that extraordinarily bulging pocket  lord theign slowly pacing the hall again threw up his hands ah with perfect ease can scarcely be said  why notwhen he absolutely thrusts his dirty dollars down your throat  oh im not talking of ease to him lord theign returnedim talking of ease to myself i shall have to make a sacrifice  why not thenfor so great a conveniencegallantly make it  ah my dear chap if you want me to sell my sir joshua  but the horror in the words said enough and lord john felt its chill i dont make a point of thatgod forbid but there are other things to which the objection wouldnt apply  you see how it appliesin the case of the morettofor him a mere moretto said lord theign is too cheapfor a yankee on the spend  then the mantovano wouldnt be  it remains to be proved that it is a mantovano  well said lord john go into it  hanged if i wont his friend broke out after a moment it would suit me i meanthe explanation came after a brief intensity of thoughtthe possible size of his cheque would  oh said lord john gaily i guess theres no limit to the possible size of his cheque  yes it would suit me it would suit me the elder man standing there audibly mused but his air changed and a lighter question came up to him as he saw his daughter reappear at the door from the terrace well the infant horde he immediately put to her  lady grace came in dutifully accounting for them theyve marched offin a huge procession  thank goodness and our friends  all playing tennis she saidsave those who are sitting it out to which she added as to explain her return mr crimble has gone  lord john took upon him to say hes in the library to which you addressed himmaking discoveries  not then i hope she smiled to our disadvantage  to your very great honour and glory lord john clearly valued the effect he might produce  your moretto of bresciado you know what it really and spendidly is and then as the girl in her surprise but wondered a mantovano neither more nor less ever so much more swagger  a mantovano lady grace echoed why how tremendously jolly  her father was struck do you know the artistof whom i had never heard  yes something of the little that is known and she rejoiced as her knowledge came to her hes a tremendous swell because great as he was there are but seven proved examples  with this of yours lord john broke in there are eight  then why havent i known about him lord theign put it as if so many other people were guilty for this  his daughter was the first to plead for the vague body why i suppose in order that you should have exactly this pleasure father  oh pleasures not desired are like acquaintances not soughtthey rather bore one lord theign sighed with which he moved away from her  her eyes followed him an instantthen she smiled at their guest is he bored at having the higher prizeif youre sure it is the higher  mr crimble is surebecause if he isnt lord john added hes a wretch  well she returned as hes certainly not a wretch it must be true and fancy she exclaimed further though as more particularly for herself our having suddenly incurred this immense debt to him  oh i shall pay mr crimble said her father who had turned round  the whole question appeared to have provoked in lord john a rise of spirits and a flush of humour dont you let him stick it on  his host however bethinking himself checked him go you to mr bender straight  lord john saw the point yestill he leaves but i shall find you here shant i he asked with all earnestness of lady grace  she had an hesitation but after a look at her father she assented ill wait for you  then à tantôt it made him show for happy as waving his hand at her he proceeded to seek mr bender in presence of the object that most excited that gentlemans appetiteto say nothing of the effect involved on lord johns own     ix  lord theign when he had gone revolvedit might have been nervouslyabout the place a little but soon broke ground hell have told you i understand that ive promised to speak to you for him but i understand also that he has found something to say for himself  yes we talkeda while since the girl said at least he did  then if you listened i hope you listened with a good grace  oh he speaks very welland ive never disliked him  it pulled her father up is that allwhen i think so much of him  she seemed to say that she had to her own mind been liberal and gone far but she waited a little do you think very very much  surely ive made my good opinion clear to you  again she had a pause oh yes ive seen you like him and believe in himand ive found him pleasant and clever  he has never had lord theign more or less ingeniously explained what i call a real show but the character under discussion could after all be summed up without searching analysis i consider nevertheless that theres plenty in him  it was a moderate claim to which lady grace might assent he strikes me as naturally quick andwell nice but i agree with you than he hasnt had a chance  then if you can see your way by sympathy and confidence to help him to one i dare say youll find your reward  for a third time she considered as if a certain curtness in her companions manner rather hindered in such a question than helped didnt he simplify too much you would have felt her ask and wasnt his visible wish for brevity of debate a sign of his uncomfortable and indeed rather irritated sense of his not making a figure in it do you desire it very particularly was however all she at last brought out  i should like it exceedinglyif you act from conviction then of course only but of one thing im myself convincedof what he thinks of yourself and feels for you  then would you mind my waiting a little she asked i mean to be absolutely sure of myself after which on his delaying to agree she added frankly as to help her case upon my word father i should like to do what would please you  but it determined in him a sharper impatience ah what would please me dont put it off on me judge absolutely for yourselfhe slightly took himself upin the light of my having consented to do for him what i always hate to do deviate from my normal practice of never intermeddling if ive deviated now you can judge but to do so all round of course takein reasonyour time  may i ask then she said for still a little more  he looked for this verily as if it was not in reason you know he then returned what hell feel that a sign of  well ill tell him what i mean  then ill send him to you  he glanced at his watch and was going but after a thanks father she had stopped him theres one thing more an embarrassment showed in her manner but at the cost of some effect of earnest abruptness she surmounted it what does your americanmr benderwant  lord theign plainly felt the challenge my american hes none of mine  well then lord johns  hes none of his eithermore i mean than any one elses hes every ones american literallyto all appearance and ive not to tell you surely with the freedom of your own visitors how people stalk in and out here  no fathercertainly she said youre splendidly generous  his eyes seemed rather sharply to ask her then how he could improve on that but he added as if it were enough what the man must by this time want more than anything else is his car  not then anything of ours she still insisted  of ours he echoed with a frown are you afraid he has an eye to something of yours  why if weve a new treasurewhich we certainly have if we possess a mantovanohavent we all even i an immense interest in it and before he could answer is that exposed she asked  lord theign a little unready cast about at his storied halls any illusion to the exposure of the objects they so solidly sheltered was obviously unpleasant to him but then it was as if he found at a stroke both his own reassurance and his daughters how can there be a question of it when he only wants sir joshuas  he wants ours the girl gasped  at absolutely any price  but youre not she cried discussing it  he hesitated as between chiding and contenting herthen he handsomely chose my dear child for what do you take me with which he impatiently started through the long and stately perspective for the saloon  she sank into a chair when he had gone she sat there some moments in a visible tension of thought her hands clasped in her lap and her dropped eyes fixed and unperceiving but she sprang up as hugh crimble in search of her again stood before her he presented himself as with winged sandals  what luck to find you i must take my spin back  youve seen everything as you wished  oh he smiled ive seen wonders  she showed her pleasure yes weve got some things  so mr bender says he laughed youve got five or six  only five or six she cried in bright alarm  only he continued to laugh why thats enormous five or six things of the first importance but i think i ought to mention to you he added a most barefaced rubens there in the library  it isnt a rubens  no more than im a ruskin  then youll brand usexpose us for it  no ill let you offill be quiet if youre good if you go straight ill only hold it in terrorem one cant be sure in these dreadful daysthats always to remember so that if youre not good ill come down on you with it but to balance against that threat he went on ive made the very grandest find at least i believe i have  she was all there for this news of the mantovanohidden in the other thing  hugh wonderedalmost as if she had been before him you dont mean to say youve had the idea of that  no but my father has told me  and is your father he eagerly asked really gratified  with her conscious eyes on himher eyes could clearly be very conscious about her fathershe considered a moment he always prefers old associations and appearances to new but im sure hell resign himself if you see your way to a certainty  well it will be a question of the weight of expert opinion that i shall invoke but im not afraid he resolutely said and i shall make the thing from its splendid rarity the crown and flower of your glory  her serious face shone at him with a charmed gratitude its awfully beautiful then your having come to us so its awfully beautiful your having brought us this way in a flashas dropping out of a chariot of firemore light and what you apparently feel with myself as more honour  ah the beautys in your having yourself done it he returned he gave way to the positive joy of it if ive brought the light and the restthats to say the very useful informationwho in the world was it brought me  she had a gesture of protest youd have come in some other way  im not so sure im beastly shylittle as i may seem to show it save in great causes when im horridly bold and hideously offensive now at any rate i only know what has been she turned off for it moving away from him as with a sense of mingled things that made for unrest and he had the next moment grown graver under the impression but does anything in it all he asked trouble you  she faced about across the wider space and there was a different note in what she brought out i dont know what forces me so to tell you things  tell me he stared why youve told me nothing more monstrous than that ive been welcome  well however that may be what did you mean just now by the chance of our not going straight when you said youd expose our bador is it our falserubens in the event of a certain danger  oh in the event of your ever being bribedhe laughed again as with relief and then as her face seemed to challenge the word why to let anythingof your bestever leave dedborough by which i mean really of course leave the country she turned again on this and something in her air made him wonder i hope you dont feel there is such a danger i understood from you half an hour ago that it was unthinkable  well it was to me half an hour ago she said as she came nearer but if it has since come up  if it has but has it in the form of that monster what mr bender wants is the great duchess he recalled  and my father wont sell her no he wont sell the great duchessthere i feel safe but he greatly needs a certain sum of moneyor he thinks he doesand ive just had a talk with him  in which he has told you that  he has told me nothing lady grace saidor else told me quite other things but the more i think of them the more it comes to me that he feels urged or tempted  to despoil and denude these walls hugh broke in looking about in his sharper apprehension  yes to satisfy to save my sister now do you think our state so ideal she askedbut without elation for her hint of triumph  he had no answer for this save ah but you terribly interest me may i ask whats the matter with your sister  oh she wanted to go on straight now the matter isin the first placethat shes too dazzlingly dreadfully beautiful  more beautiful than you his sincerity easily risked  millions of times sad almost sombre she hadnt a shade of coquetry kitty has debtsgreat heapedup gaming debts  but to such amounts  incredible amounts it appears and mountains of others too she throws herself all on our father  and he has to pay them theres no one else hugh asked  she waited as if he might answer himself and then as he apparently didnt hes only afraid there may be some elsethats how she makes him do it she said and now do you think she pursued that i dont tell you things  he turned them over in his young perception and pity the things she told him oh oh oh and then in the great place while as just spent by the effort of her disclosure she moved from him again he took them all in thats the situation that as you say may force his hand  it absolutely i feel does force it and the renewal of her appeal brought her round isnt it too lovely  his frank disgust answered its too damnable  and its you she quite terribly smiled whoby the irony of fatehave given him help  he smote his head in the light of it by the mantovano  by the possible mantovanoas a substitute for the impossible sir joshua youve made him aware of a value  ah but the values to be fixed  then mr bender will fix it  oh butas he himself would sayill fix mr bender hugh declared and he wont buy a pig in a poke  this cleared the air while they looked at each other yet she had already asked what in the world can you do and how in the world can you do it  well he was too excited for decision i dont quite see now but give me time and he took out his watch as already to measure it oughtnt i before i go to say a word to lord theign  is it your idea to become a lion in his path  well say a cubas thats what im afraid hell call me but i think i should speak to him  she drew a conclusion momentarily dark hell have to learn in that case that ive told you of my fear  and is there any good reason why he shouldnt  she kept her eyes on him and the darkness seemed to clear no she at last replied and having gone to touch an electric bell was with him again but i think im rather sorry for you  does that represent a reason why i should be so for you  for a little she said nothing but after that none whatever  then is the sister of whom you speak lady imber  lady grace at this raised her hand in caution the butler had arrived with due gravity in answer to her ring to whom she made known her desire please say to his lordshipin the saloon or whereverthat mr crimble must go when banks had departed however accepting the responsibility of this mission she answered her friends question the sister of whom i speak is lady imber  she loses then so heavily at bridge  she loses more than she wins  hugh gazed as with interest at these oddities of the great and yet she still plays  what else in her set should she do  this he was quite unable to say but he could after a moments exhibition of the extent to which he was out of it put a question instead so youre not in her set  im not in her set  then decidedly he said i dont want to save her i only want  he was going on but she broke in i know what you want  he kept his eyes on her till he had made sureand this deep exchange between them had a beauty so youre now with me  im now with you  then said hugh shake hands on it  he offered her his hand she took it and their grasp became as you would have seen in their fine young faces a pledge in which they stood a minute locked lord theign came upon them from the saloon in the midst of the process on which they separated as with an air of its having consisted but of hughs leavetaking with some such form of mere civility at any rate he appeared by the manner in which he addressed himself to hugh to have supposed them occupied  im sorry my daughter cant keep you but i must at least thank you for your interesting view of my picture  hugh indulged in a brief and mute though very grave acknowledgment of this expression presently speaking however as on a resolve taken with a sense of possibly awkward consequences may ibefore youre sure of your indebtednessput you rather a straight question lord theign it sounded doubtless and of a sudden a little portentousas was in fact testified to by his lordships quick stiff stare full of wonder at so free a note but hugh had the courage of his undertaking if i contribute in ny modest degree to establishing the true authorship of the work you speak of may i have from you an assurance that my success isnt to serve as a basis for any perilor possibilityof its leaving the country  lord theign was visibly astonished but had also independently of this turned a shade pale you ask of me an assurance  hugh had now with his firmness and his strained smile quite the look of having counted the cost of his step im afraid i must you see  it pressed at once in his host the spring of a very grand manner and pray by what right here do you do anything of the sort  by the right of a person from whom you on your side are accepting a service  hugh had clearly determined in his opponent a rise of what is called spirit a service that you half an hour ago thrust on me sirand with which you may take it from me that im already quite prepared to dispense  im sorry to appear indiscreet our young man returned im sorry to have upset you in any way but i cant overcome my anxiety  lord theign took the words from his lips and you therefore invite meat the end of half an hour in this houseto account to you for my personal intentions and my private affairs and make over my freedom to your hands  hugh stood there with his eyes on the black and white pavement that stretched about himthe great lozenged marble floor that might have figured that ground of his own vision which he had made up his mind to stand i can only see the matter as i see it and i should be ashamed not to have seized any chance to appeal to you whatever difficulty he had had shyly to face didnt exist for him now i entreat you to think again to think well before you deprive us of such a source of just envy  and you regard your entreaty as helped lord theign asked by the beautiful threat you are so good as to attach to it then as his monitor arrested exchanged a searching look with lady grace who showing in her face all the pain of the business stood off at the distance to which a woman instinctively retreats when a scene turns to violence as precipitately as this one appeared to strike her as having turned i ask you that not less than i should like to know whom you speak of as deprived of property that happensfor reasons that i dont suppose you also quarrel withto be mine  well i know nothing about threats lord theign hugh said but i speak of all of usof all the people of england who would deeply deplore such an act of alienation and whom for the interest they bear you i beseech you mercifully to consider  the interest they bear methe master of dedborough fairly bristled with wonder pray how the devil do they show it  i think they show it in all sorts of waysand hughs critical smile at almost any moment hovering played over the question in a manner seeming to convey that he meant many things  understand then please said lord theign with every inch of his authority that theyll show it best by minding their own business while i very particularly mind mine  you simply do in other words hugh explicitly concluded what happens to be convenient to you  in very distinct preference to what happens to be convenient to you so that i need no longer detain you lord theign added with the last dryness and as if to wind up their brief and thankless connection  the young man took his dismissal being able to do no less while unsatisfied and unhappy he looked about mechanically for the cyclingcap he had laid down somewhere in the hall on his arrival i apologise my lord if i seem to you to have ill repaid your hospitality but he went on with his uncommended cheer my interest in your picture remains  lady grace who had stopped and strayed and stopped again as a mere watchful witness drew nearer hereupon breaking her silence for the first time and please let me say father that mine also grows and grows  it was obvious that this parent surprised and disconcerted by her tone judged her contribution superfluous im happy to hear it gracebut yours is another affair  i think on the contrary that its quite the same one she returnedsince its on my hint to him that mr crimble has said to you what he has the resolution she had gathered while she awaited her chance sat in her charming eyes which met as she spoke the straighter paternal glare i let him know that i supposed you to think of profiting by the importance of mr benders visit  then you might have spared my dear youri suppose and hope wellmeantinterpretation of my mind lord theign showed himself at this point master of the beautiful art of righting himself as without having been in the wrong mr benders visit will terminateas soon as he has released lord johnwithout my having profited in the smallest particular  hugh meanwhile evidently but wanted to speak for his friend it was lady graces anxious inference she will doubtless let me say for her that my idea about the moretto would add to your powerwell he pushed on not without awkwardness of realising advantageously on such a prospective rise  lord theign glanced at him as for positively the last time but spoke to lady grace understand then please that as i detach myself from any association with this gentlemans ideaswhether about the moretto or about anything elsehis further application of them ceases from this moment to concern us  the girls rejoinder was to address herself directly to hugh across their companion will you make your inquiry for me then  the light again kindled in him with all the pleasure in life he had found his cap and taking them together bowed to the two for departure with high emphasis of form then he marched off in the direction from which he had entered  lord theign scarce waited for his disappearance to turn in wrath to lady grace i denounce the indecency wretched child of your public defiance of me  they were separated by a wide interval now and though at her distance she met his reproof so unshrinkingly as perhaps to justify the terms into which it had broken she became aware of a reason for his not following it up she pronounced in quick warning lord johnfor their friend released from among the pictures was rejoining them was already there  he spoke straight to his host on coming into sight benders at last off buthe indicated the direction of the garden frontyou may still find him out yonder prolonging the agony with lady sandgate  lord theign remained a moment and the heat of his resentment remained he looked with a divided discretion the pain of his indecision from his daughters suitor and his approved candidate to that contumacious young woman and back again then choosing his course in silence he had a gesture of almost desperate indifference and passed quickly out by the door to the terrace  it had left lord john gaping what on earths the matter with your father  what on earth indeed lady grace unaidingly asked is he discussing with that awful man  old bender do you think him so awful lord john showed surprisewhich might indeed have passed for harmless amusement but he shook everything off in view of a nearer interest he quite waved old bender away my dear girl what do we care  i care immensely i assure you she interrupted and i ask of you please to tell me  her perversity coming straight and which he had so little expected threw him back so that he looked at her with sombre eyes ah its not for such a matter im here lady graceim here with that fond question of my own and then as she turned away leaving him with a vehement motion of protest ive come for your kind answerthe answer your father instructed me to count on  ive no kind answer to give youshe raised forbidding hands i entreat you to leave me alone  there was so high a spirit and so strong a force in it that he stared as if stricken by violence in gods name then what has happenedwhen you almost gave me your word  what has happened is that ive found it impossible to listen to you and she moved as if fleeing she scarce knew whither before him  he had already hastened around another way however as to meet her in her quick circuit of the hall thats all youve got to say to me after what has passed between us  he had stopped her thus but she had also stopped him and her passionate denial set him a limit ive got to saysorry as i amthat if you must have an answer its this that never lord john never can there be anything more between us and her gesture cleared her path permitting her to achieve her flight never no never she repeated as she wentnever never never she got off by the door at which she had been aiming to some retreat of her own while aghast and defeated left to make the best of it he sank after a moment into a chair and remained quite pitiably staring before him appealing to the great blank splendour     book second     i  lady sandgate on a morning late in may entered her drawingroom by the door that opened at the right of that charming retreat as a person coming in faced bruton street and she met there at this moment mr gotch her butler who had just appeared in the much wider doorway forming opposite the bruton street windows an apartment not less ample lighted from the back of the house and having its independent connection with the upper floors and the lower she showed surprise at not immediately finding the visitor to whom she had been called  but mr crimble  here he is my lady and he made way for that gentleman who emerged from the back room gotch observing the propriety of a prompt withdrawal  i went in for a minute with your servants permission hugh explained to see your famous lawrencewhich is splendid he was so good as to arrange the light the young mans dress was of a form less relaxed than on the occasion of his visit to dedborough yet the soft felt hat that he rather restlessly crumpled as he talked marked the limit of his sacrifice to vain appearances  lady sandgate was at once interested in the punctuality of his reported act gotch thinks as much of my grandmother as i doand even seems to have ended by taking her for his very own  one sees unmistakably from her beauty that you at any rate are of her line hugh allowed himself not without confidence the amusement of replying and i must make sure of another look at her when ive a good deal more time  his hostess heard him as with a lapse of hope you hadnt then come for the poor dear and then as he obviously hadnt but for something quite else i thought from so prompt an interest that she might be coveted it dropped with a yearning sigh  you imagined me sent by some prowling collector hugh asked ah i shall never do their workunless to betray them that i shouldnt in the least mindand im here frankly at this early hour to ask your consent to my seeing lady grace a moment on a particular business if she can kindly give me time  youve known then of her being with me  ive known of her coming to you straight on leaving dedborough he explained of her wishing not to go to her sisters and of lord theigns having proceeded as they say or being on the point of proceeding to some foreign part  and youve learnt it from having seen herthese three or four weeks  ive met herbut just barelytwo or three times at a private view at the opera in the lobby and that sort of thing but she hasnt told you  lady sandgate neither affirmed nor denied she only turned on him her thick lustre i wanted to see how much youd tell she waited even as for more but this not coming she helped herself once again at dinner  yes but alas not near her  once then at a private viewwhen with the squash they usually are you might have been very near her indeed  the young man his hilarity quickened took but a moment for the truth yesit was a squash  and once his hostess pursued in the lobby of the opera  after tristanyes but with some awful grand people i didnt know  she recognised she estimated the grandeur oh the pennimans are nobody but now she asked youve come you say on business  very important pleasewhich accounts for the hour ive ventured and the appearance i present  i dont ask you too much to account lady sandgate kindly said but i cant not wonder if she hasnt told you what things have happened  he cast about she has had no chance to tell me anythingbeyond the fact of her being here  without the reason  the reason he echoed  she gave it up going straighter shes with me then as an old firm friend under my care and protection  i seehe took it with more penetration than enthusiasm as a hint in respect to himself she puts you on your guard  lady sandgate expressed it more graciously she puts me on my honouror at least her father does  as to her seeing me  as to my seeing at leastwhat may happen to her  becauseyou saythings have happened  his companion fairly sounded him youve only talkedwhen youve metof art  well he smiled art is long  then i hope it may see you through but you should know first that lord theign is presently due  here back already from abroadhe was all alert  he has not yet gonehe comes up this morning to start  and stops here on his way  to take the train de luxe this afternoon to his annual salsomaggiore but with so little time to spare she went on reassuringly that to simplifyas he wired me an hour ago from dedboroughhe has given rendezvous here to mr bender who is particularly to wait for him  and who may therefore arrive at any moment  she looked at her bracelet watch scarcely before noon so youll just have your chance  thank the powers thenhugh grasped at it i shall have it best if youll be so good as to tell me firstwell he faltered what it is that to my great disquiet youve further alluded to what it is that has occurred  lady sandgate took her time but her goodnature and other sentiments pronounced havent you at least guessed that she has fallen under her fathers extreme reprobation  yes so much as thatthat she must have greatly annoyed himi have been supposing but isnt it by her having asked me to act for her i mean about the mantovanowhich i have done  lady sandgate wondered youve acted  its what ive come to tell her at lastand im all impatience  i see i seeshe had caught a clue he hated thatyes but you havent really made out she put to him the other effect of your hour at dedborough she recognised however while she spoke that his divination had failed and she didnt trouble him to confess it directly you had gone she turned down lord john declined i mean the offer of his hand in marriage  hugh was clearly as much mystified as anything else he proposed there  he had spoken that day beforebefore your talk with lord theign who had every confidence in her accepting him but you came mr crimble you went and when her suitor reappeared just after you had gone for his answer  she wouldnt have him hugh asked with a precipitation of interest  but lady sandgate could humour almost any curiosity she wouldnt look at him  he bethought himself but had she said she would  so her father indignantly considers  thats the ground of his indignation  he had his reasons for counting on her and it has determined a painful crisis  hugh crimble turned this overfeeling apparently for something he didnt find im sorry to hear such things but wheres the connection with me  ah you know best yourself and if you dont see any in that case lady sandgates motion implied she washed her hands of it  hugh had for a moment the air of a young man treated to the sweet chance to guess a conundrumwhich he gave up i really dont see any lady sandgate but he a little inconsistently said im greatly obliged to you for telling me  dont mention itthough i think it is good of me she smiled on so short an acquaintance to which she added more gravely i leave you the situationbut im willing to let you know that im all on graces side  so am i ratherplease let me frankly say  he clearly refreshed he even almost charmed her its the very least you can saythough im not sure whether you say it as the simplest or as the very subtlest of men but in case you dont know as i do how little the particular candidate ive named  had a right or a claim to succeed with her he broke inall quick intelligence here at least no i dont perhaps know as well as you dobut i think i know as well as i just yet require  there you are then and if you did prevent his hostess maturely pursued what wouldnt have beenwell good or nice im quite on your side too  our young man seemed to feel the shade of ambiguity but he reached at a meaning youre with me in my plea for our defending at any cost of effort or ingenuity  the precious picture lord theign exposesshe took his presumed sense faster than he had taken hers but she hung fire a moment with her reply to it well will you keep the secret of everything ive said or say  to the death to the stake lady sandgate  then she momentously returned i only want too to make bender impossible if you ask me she pursued how i arrange that with my deep loyalty to lord theign  i dont ask you anything of the sort he interruptedi wouldnt ask you for the world and my own bright plan for achieving the coup you mention  youll have time at the most she said consulting afresh her bracelet watch to explain to lady grace she reached an electric bell which she touchedfacing then her visitor again with an abrupt and slightly embarrassed change of tone you do think my great portrait splendid  he had strayed far from it and all too languidly came back your lawrence there as i said magnificent  but the butler had come in interrupting straight from the lobby of whom she made her request let her ladyship knowmr crimble  gotch looked hard at hugh and the crumpled hatalmost as if having an option but he resigned himself to repeating with a distinctness that scarce fell short of the invidious mr crimble and departed on his errand  lady sandgates fair flush of diplomacy had meanwhile not faded couldnt you with your immense cleverness and power get the government to do something  about your picture hugh betrayed on this head a graceless detachment you too then want to sell  oh she righted herself never to a private party  mr benders not after it he askedthough scarce lighting his reluctant interest with a forced smile  most intensely after it but never cried the proprietress to a bloated alien  then i applaud your patriotism only why not he asked carrying that magnanimity a little further set us all an example as splendid as the object itself  give it you for nothing she threw up shocked hands because im an aged female pauper and cant make every sacrifice  hugh pretendednone too convincinglyto think will you let them have it very cheap  yesfor less than such a bribe as benders  ah he said expressively that might be and still  well she had a flare of fond confidence ill find out what hell offerif youll on your side do what you canand then ask them a third less and she followed it upas if suddenly conceiving him a prig see here mr crimble ive beenand this very first time icharming to you  you have indeed he returned but you throw back on it a lurid light if it has all been for that  it has beenwell to keep things as i want them and if ive given you precious information mightnt you on your side  estimate its value in cashhugh sharply took her up ah lady sandgate i am in your debt but if you really bargain for your precious information id rather we assume that i havent enjoyed it  she made him however in reply a sign for silence she had heard lady grace enter the other room from the back landing and reaching the nearer door she disposed of the question with high gay bravery i wont bargain with the treasuryshe had passed out by the time lady grace arrived     ii  as hugh recognised in this friends entrance and face the light of welcome he went full of his subject straight to their main affair i havent been able to wait ive wanted so much to tell youi mean how ive just come back from brussels where i saw pappendick who was free and ready by the happiest chance to start for verona which he must have reached some time yesterday  the girls responsive interest fairly broke into rapture ah the dear sweet thing  yes hes a brickbut the question now hangs in the balance allowing him time to have got into relation with the picture ive begun to expect his wire which will probably come to my club but my fidget while i wait has driven mehe threw out and dropped his arms in expression of his soft surrenderwell just to do this to come to you here in my fever at an unnatural hour and uninvited and at least let you know ive acted  oh but i simply rejoice lady grace declared to be acting with you  then if you are if you are the young man cried why everythings beautiful and right  its all i care for and think of now she went on in her bright devotion and ive only wondered and hoped  well hugh found for it all a rapid abundant lucidity he was away from home at first and i had to waitbut i crossed last week found him and settled incoming home by paris where i had a grand four days jaw with the fellows there and saw their great specimen of our master all of which has given him time  and now his times up the girl eagerly asked  it must beand we shall see but hugh postponed that question to a matter of more moment still the thing is that at last im able to tell you how i feel the trouble ive brought you  it made her quickly colouring rest grave eyes on him what do you knowwhen i havent told youabout my trouble  cant i have guessed with a ray of intelligencehe had his answer ready youve sought asylum with this good friend from the effects of your fathers resentment  sought asylum is perhaps excessive lady grace returnedthough it wasnt pleasant with him after that hour no she allowed and i couldnt go you see to kitty  no indeed you couldnt go to kitty he smiled at her hard as he added i should have liked to see you go to kitty therefore exactly is it that ive set you adriftthat ive darkened and poisoned your days youre paying with your comfort with your peace for having joined so gallantly in my grand remonstrance  she shook her head turning from him but then turned back againas if accepting as if even relieved by this version of the prime cause of her state why do you talk of it as payingif its all to come back to my being paid i mean by your blest successif you really do what you want  i have your word for it he searchingly said that our really pulling it off together will make up to you  i should be ashamed if it didnt for everythingshe took the question from his mouth i believe in such a cause exactly as you doand found a lesson at dedborough in your frankness and your faith  then youll help me no end he said all simply and sincerely  youve helped me alreadythat she gave him straight back and on it they stayed a moment their strenuous faces more intensely communing  youre very wonderfulfor a girl hugh brought out  one has to be a girl naturally to be a daughter of ones house she laughed and thats all i am of oursbut a true and a right and a straight one  he glowed with his admiration youre splendid  that might be or not her light shrug intimated she gave it at any rate the goby and more exactly stated her case i see our situation  so do i lady grace he cried with the strongest emphasis and your father only doesnt  yes she said for intelligent correctionhe sees it theres nothing in life he sees so much but unfortunately he sees it all wrong  hugh seized her point of view as if there had been nothing of her that he wouldnt have seized he sees it all wrong then my appeal the other day he took as a rude protest and any protest  any protest she quickly and fully agreed he takes as an offence yes its his theory that he still has rights she smiled though he is a miserable peer  how should he not have rights said hugh when he has really everything on earth  ah he doesnt even know thathe takes it so much for granted and she sought though as rather sadly and despairingly to explain he lives all in his own world  he lives all in his own yes but he does business all in oursquite as much as the people who come up to the city in the tube with which hugh had a still sharper recall of the stiff actual and he must be here to do business today  you know lady grace asked that hes to meet mr bender  lady sandgate kindly warned me and her companion saw as he glanced at the clock on the chimney ive only ten minutes at best the journal wont have been good for him he addedyou doubtless have seen the journal  noshe was vague we live by the morning post  thats why our friend here didnt speak then hugh said with a better lightwhich out of a dim consideration for her i didnt do either but theyve a leader this morning about lady lappington and her longhi and on bender and his hauls and on the certaintyif we dont do something energeticof more and more benders to come such a conquering horde as invaded the old civilisation only armed now with huge chequebooks instead of with spears and battleaxes they refer to the rumour currentas too horrific to believeof lord theigns putting up his moretto with the question of how properly to qualify any such sad purpose in him should the further report prove true of a new and momentous opinion about the picture entertained by several eminent authorities  of whom said the girl intensely attached to this recital youre of course seen as not the least  of whom of course lady grace im as yethowever im seenthe whole collection but weve timehe rested on that the fat if youll allow me the expression is on the firewhich as i see the matter is where this particular fat should be  is the article then his companion appealed very severe  i prefer to call it very enlightened and very intelligentand the great thing is that it immensely marks as they say it will have made a big public differencefrom this day though its of course aimed not so much at persons as at conditions which it calls upon us all somehow to tackle  exactlyshe was full of the saving vision but as the conditions are directly embodied in persons  oh of course it here and there bells the cat which means that it bells three or four  yes she richly broodedlady lappington is a cat  she will have been belled at any rate with your father hugh amusedly went on to the certainty of a row and a row can only be good for usi mean for us in particular yet he had to bethink himself the case depends a good deal of course on how your father takes such a resounding rap  oh i know how hell take ither perception went all the way  in the very highest and properest spirit  well youll see she was as brave as she was clear or at least i shall  struck with all this in her he renewed his homage you are yes splendid  i even she laughed surprise myself  but he was already back at his calculations how early do the papers get to you  at dedborough oh quite for breakfastwhich isnt however very early  then thats what has caused his wire to bender  but how will such talk strike him the girl asked  hugh meanwhile visibly had not only followed his train of thought he had let it lead him to certainty it will have moved mr bender to absolute rapture  rather lady grace wondered than have put him off  it will have put him prodigiously on mr benderas he said to me at dedborough of his noble host there hugh pursuedis a very nice man but hes a product of the world of advertisment and advertisement is all he sees and aims at he lives in it as a saint in glory or a fish in water  she took it from him as half doubting but maynt advertisement in so special a case turn on the whole against him  hugh shook a negative forefinger with an expression he might have caught from foreign comrades he rides the biggest whirlwindhe has got it saddled and bitted  she faced the image but cast about then where does our success come in  in our making the beast all the same bolt with him and throw him and hugh further pointed the moral if in such proceedings all he knows is publicity the thing is to give him publicity and its only a question of giving him enough by the time he has enough for himself you see hell have too much for every one elseso that we shall up in a body and slay him  the girls eyebrows in her wondering face rose to a question but if he has meanwhile got the picture  well slay him before he gets it he revelled in the breadth of his view our own policy must be to organise to that end the inevitable outcry organise bender himselforganise him to scandal hugh had already even pity to spare for their victim he wont know it from a boom  though carried along however lady grace could still measure but that will be only if he wants and decides for the picture  we must make him then want and decide for itdecide that is for ours to save it we must work him uphell in that case want it so indecently much then we shall have to want it more  well she anxiously felt it her duty to remind him you can take a horse to water  oh trust me to make him drink  there appeared a note in this that convinced her its you mr crimble who are splendid  well i shall bewith my jolly wire and all on that scent again may i come back to you from the club with pappendicks news he asked  why rather of course come back  only not he debated till your father has left  lady grace considered too but sharply decided come when you have it but tell me first she added one thing she hung fire a little while he waited but she brought it out was it you who got the journal to speak  ah one scarcely gets the journal  who then gave them their tip  about the mantovano and its peril well he took a momentbut only not to say in addition to which the butler had reappeared entering from the lobby ill tell you he laughed when i come back  gotch had his manner of announcement while the visitor was mounting the stairs mr breckenridge bender  ah then i go said lady grace at once  ill stay three minutes hugh turned with her alertly to the easier issue signalling hope and cheer from that threshold as he watched her disappear after which he faced about with as brave a smile and as ready for immediate action as if she had there within kissed her hand to him mr bender emerged at the same instant gotch withdrawing and closing the door behind him and the former personage recognising his young friend threw up his hands for friendly pleasure     iii  ah mr crimble he cordially inquired youve come with your great news  hugh caught the allusion it would have seemed but after a moment news of the moretto no mr bender i havent news yet but he added as with high candour for the visitors motion of disappointment i think i warned you you know that it would take three or four weeks  well in my country mr bender returned with disgust it would take three or four minutes cant you make em step more lively  im expecting sir said hugh goodhumouredly a report from hour to hour  then will you let me have it right off  hugh indulged in a pause after which very frankly ah its scarcely for you mr bender that im acting  the great collector was but briefly checked well cant you just act for art  oh youre doing that yourself so powerfully hugh laughed that i think i had best leave it to you  his friend looked at him as some inspector on circuit might look at a new improvement dont you want to go round acting with me  go on tour as it were oh frankly mr bender hugh said if i had any weight  youd add it to your end of the beam why what have i done that you should go back on meafter working me up so down there the worst ive done mr bender continued is to refuse that moretto  has it deplorably been offered you our young man cried unmistakably and sincerely affected after which he went on as his fellowvisitor only eyed him hard not on second thoughts giving the owner of the great work away then why are youas if you were a banished romeoso keen for news from verona to this odd mixture of business and literature mr bender made no reply contenting himself with but a large vague blandness that wore in him somehow the mark of tested utility so that hugh put him another question arent you here sir on the chance of the mantovano  im here he then imperturbably said because lord theign has wired me to meet him aint you here for that yourself  hugh betrayed for a moment his enjoyment of a big choice of answers dear no ive but been in by lady sandgates leave to see that grand lawrence  ah yes shes very kind about itone does go in after which mr bender had even in the atmosphere of his danger a throb of curiosity is any one after that grand lawrence  oh i hope not hugh laughed unless you again dreadfully are wonderful thing as it is and so just in its right place there  you call it mr bender impartially inquired a very wonderful thing  well as a lawrence it has quite bowled me overhugh spoke as for the strictly aesthetic awkwardness of that but you know i take my pictures hard he gave a punch to his hat pressed for time in this connection as he was glad truly to appear to his friend i must make my little rapport yet before it he did seek briefly to explain were a band of young men who careand we watch the great things alsofor i must give you the real truth about myselfwe watch the great people  well i guess im used to being watchedif thats the worst you can do to which mr bender added in his homely way but you know mr crimble what im really after  hughs strategy on this would again have peeped out for us the man in this mornings journal appears at least to have discovered  yes the man in this mornings journal has discovered three or four weeksas it appears to take you here for everythingafter my beginning to talk why they knew i was talking that time ago on the other side  oh they know things in the states hugh cheerfully agreed so independently of their happening but you must have talked loud  well i havent so much talked as raved mr bender concededfor im afraid that when i do want a thing i rave till i get it you heard me at dedborough and your enterprising daily press has at last caught the echo  then theyll make up for lost time but have you done it hugh asked to prepare an alibi  an alibi  by raving as you say the saddle on the wrong horse i dont think you at all believe youll get the sir joshuabut meanwhile we shall have cleared up the question of the moretto  mr bender imperturbable didnt speak till he had done justice to this picture of his subtlety then why on earth do you want to boom the moretto  you ask that said hugh because its the boomed thing thats most in peril  well its the big the bigger the biggest things and if you drag their value to the light why shouldnt we want to grab them and carry them offthe same as all of you originally did  ah not quite the same hugh smiledthat i will say for you  yes you stick it on nowyou have got an eye for the rise in values but i grant you your unearned increment and you ought to be mighty glad that to such a time ill pay it you  our young man kept during a moments thought his eyes on his companion and then resumed with all intensity and candour you may easily mr bender be too much for meas you appear too much for far greater people but may i ask you very earnestly for your word on this as to any case in which that happensthat when precious things things we are to lose here are knocked down to you youll let us at least take leave of them let us have a sight of them in london before theyre borne off  mr benders big face fell almost with a crash hand them over you mean to the sandwich men on bond street  to one or other of the placard and poster meni dont insist on the inserted human slice let the great values as a compensation to us be on view for three or four weeks  you ask me mr bender returned for a general assurance to that effect  well a particular oneso it be particular enough hugh saidwill do just for now let me put in my plea for the issuewell of the value thats actually in the scales  the mantovanomoretto  the morettomantovano  mr bender carnivorously smiled hadnt we better know which it is first  hugh had a motion of practical indifference for this the public interestplaying so straight on the questionmay help to settle it by which i mean that it will profit enormouslythe question of probability of identity itself willby the discussion it will create the discussion will promote certainty  and certainty mr bender massively mused will kick up a row  of course it will kick up a rowhugh thoroughly guaranteed that youll be for the month the bestabused man in englandif you venture to remain here at all except naturally poor lord theign  whom it wont be my interest at the same time to worry into backing down  but whom it will be exceedingly mine to practise onand hugh laughed as at the fun before themif i may entertain the sweet hope of success the only thing isfrom my point of view he went onthat backing down before what he will call vulgar clamour isnt in the least in his traditions nothing less so and that if there should be really too much of it for his taste or his nerves hell set his handsome face as a stone and never budge an inch but at least again what i appeal to you for will have taken placethe picture will have been seen by a lot of people wholl care  it will have been seen mr bender amendedon the mere contingency of my acquisition of itonly if its present owner consents  consents hugh almost derisively echoed why hell propose it himself hell insist on it hell put it through once hes angry enoughas angry i mean as almost any public criticism of a personal act of his will be sure to make him and im afraid the striking criticism or at least animadversion of this morning will have blown on his flame of bravado  inevitably a student of character mr bender rose to the occasion yes i guess hes pretty mad  theyve imputed to himhugh but wanted to abound in that sensean intention of which after all he isnt guilty  so thathis listener glowed with interested optimismif they dont look out if they impute it to him again i guess hell just go and be guilty  hugh might at this moment have shown to an initiated eye as fairly elated by the sense of producing something of the effect he had hoped you entertain the fond vision of lashing them up to that mistake oh fisher in troubled waters and then with a finer art as his companion expansively bright but crudely acute eyed him in turn as if to sound him the strongest thing in such a typeone does make outis his resentment of a liberty taken and the most natural furthermore is quite that he should feel almost anything you do take uninvited from the groaning board of his banquet of life to be such a liberty  mr bender participated thus at his perceptive ease in the exposed aristocratic illusion yes i guess he has always lived as he likes the way those of you who have got things fixed for them do over here and to have to quit it on account of unpleasant remark  but he gave up thoughtfully trying to express what this must be reduced to the mere synthetic interjection my  thats it mr bender hugh said for the consecration of such a moral he wont quit it without a hard struggle  mr bender hereupon at last gave himself quite gaily away as to his high calculation of impunity well i guess he wont struggle too hard for me to hold on to him if i want to  in the thick of the conflict then however that may be hugh returned dont forget what ive urged on youthe claim of our desolate country  but his friend had an answer to this my natural interest mr crimbleconsidering what i do for itis in the claim of ours but i wish you were on my side  not so much hugh hungrily and truthfully laughed as i wish you were on mine decidedly none the less he had to go goodbyefor another look here  he reached the doorway of the second room where however his companion freshly alert at this stayed him by a gesture how much is she really worth  she hugh staring a moment was miles at sea lady sandgate  her greatgrandmother  a responsible answer was preventedthe butler was again with them he had opened wide the other door and he named to mr bender the personage under his convoy lord john  hugh caught this from the inner threshold and it gave him his escape oh ask that friend with which he sought the further passage to the staircase and street while lord john arrived in charge of mr gotch who having remarked to the two occupants of the front drawingroom that her ladyship would come left them together     iv  then theigns not yet here lord john had to resign himself as he greeted his american ally but he told me i should find you  he has kept me waiting that gentleman returnedbut whats the matter with him anyway  the matter with himlord john treated such ignorance as irritatingmust of course be this beastly thing in the journal  mr bender proclaimed on the other hand his incapacity to seize such connections whats the matter with the beastly thing  why arent you aware that the stiffest bit of it is a regular dig at you  if you call that a regular dig you cant have had much experience of the papers ive known them to dig much deeper  ive had no experience of such horrid attacks thank goodness but do you mean to say asked lord john with the surprise of his own delicacy that you dont unpleasantly feel it  feel it where my dear sir  why god bless me such impertinence everywhere  all over me at oncemr bender took refuge in easy humour well im a large manso when i want to feel so much i look out for something good but what if he suffers from the blot on his ermineaint that what you weardoes our friend propose to do about it  lord john had a demur which was immediately followed by the apprehension of support in his uncertainty lady sandgate was before them having reached them through the other room and to her he at once referred the question what will theign propose do you think lady sandgate to do about it  she breathed both her hospitality and her vagueness to do  dont you know about the thing in the journalawfully offensive all round  thered be even a little pinch for you in it mr bender said to herif you were bent on fitting the shoe  well she met it all as gaily as was compatible with a firm look at her elder guest while she took her place with them oh the shoes of such monsters as that are much too big for poor me but she was more specific for lord john i know only what grace has just told me but since its a question of footgear dear theign will certainlywhat you may calltake his stand  lord john welcomed this assurance if i know him hell take it splendidly  mr benders attention was genial though rather more detached and whatwhile hes about itwill he take it particularly on  oh weve plenty of things thank heaven said lady sandgate for a man in theigns position to hold fast by  lord john freely confirmed it scores and scoresrather and i will say for us that with the rotten way things seem going the fact may soon become a real convenience  mr bender seemed struckand not unsympathetic i see that your system would be rather a fraud if you hadnt pretty well fixed that  lady sandgate spoke as one at present none the less substantially warned and convinced it doesnt however alter the fact that weve thus in our ears the first growl of an outcry  ah lord john concurred weve unmistakably the first growl of an outcry  mr benders judgment on the matter paused at sight of lord theign introduced and announced as lord john spoke by gotch but with the result of his addressing directly the person so presenting himself why they tell me that what this means lord theign is the first growl of an outcry  the appearance of the most eminent figure in the group might have been held in itself to testify to some such truth in the sense at least that a certain conscious radiance a gathered light of battle in his lordships aspect would have been explained by his having taken the full measurean inner success with which he glowedof some high provocation he was flushed but he bore it as the ensign of his house he was so admirably vividly dressed for the morning hour and for his journey that he shone as with the armour of a knight and the whole effect of him from head to foot with every jerk of his unconcern and every flash of his ease was to call attention to his being utterly unshaken and knowing perfectly what he was about it was at this happy pitch that he replied to the prime upsetter of his peace  im afraid i dont know what anything means to you mr benderbut its exactly to find out that ive asked you with our friend john kindly to meet me here for a very brief conference dear lady by your good leave he went on to lady sandgate at which im only too pleased that you yourself should assist the first growl of any outcry i may mention to you all affects me no more than the last will  so im delighted to gatherlady sandgate took him straight upthat you dont let go your inestimable cure  he at first quite stared superiorlet gobut then treated it with a lighter touch upon my honour i might you knowthat dose of the daily press has made me feel so fit i arrive at any rate he pursued to the others and in particular to mr bender i arrive with my decision takenwhich ive thought may perhaps interest you if that tuppeny rot is an attempt at an outcry i simply nip it in the bud  lord john rejoicingly approved absolutely the only waywith the least selfrespectto treat it  lady sandgate on the other hand sounded a sceptical note but are you sure its so easy theign to hush up a real noise  it aint what id call a real one lady sandgate mr bender said you can generally distinguish a real one from the squeak of two or three mice but granted mice do affect you lord theign it will interest me to hear what sort of a trapby what you sayyou propose to set for them  you must allow me to measure myself mr bender his lordship replied the importance of a gross freedom publicly used with my absolutely personal proceedings and affairs to the cause and origin of any definite report of whichin such circlesim afraid i rather wonder if you yourself cant give me a clue  it took mr bender a minute to do justice to these stately remarks you rather wonder if ive talked of how i feel about your detaining in your hands my beautiful duchess  oh if youve already published her as yourswith your power of publication lord theign coldly laughedof course i trace the connection  mr benders acceptance of responsibility clearly cost him no shade of a pang why i havent for quite a while talked of a blessed other thingand im capable of growing more profane over my not getting her than i guess any one would dare to be if i did  well youll certainly not get her mr bender lady sandgate as for reasons of her own bravely trumpeted and even if there were a chance of it dont you see that your way wouldnt be publicly to abuse our noble friend  mr bender but beamed in reply upon that personage oh i guess our noble friend knows i have to talk big about big things you understand sir the scream of the eagle  ill forgive you lord theign civilly returned all the big talk you like if youll now understand me my retort to that hireling pack shall be at once to dispose of a picture  mr bender rather failed to follow but thats what you wanted to do before  pardon me said his lordshipi make a difference its what you wanted me to do  the mystification however continued and you were notas you seemed thenwilling  lord theign waived crossquestions well im willing nowthats all that need concern us only once more and for the last time he added with all authority you cant have our duchess  you cant have our duchessand lord john as before the altar of patriotism wrapped it in sacrificial sighs  you cant have our duchess lady sandgate repeated but with a grace that took the sting from her triumph and she seemed still all sweet sociability as she added i wish hed tell you too you dreadful rich thing that you cant have anything at all  lord theign however in the interest of harmony deprecated that rigour ah what then would become of my happy retort  and whatas it is mr bender askedbecomes of my unhappy grievance  wouldnt a really great capture make up to you for that  well i take more interest in what i want than in what i haveand it depends dont you see on how you measure the size  lord john had at once in this connection a bright idea shouldnt you like to go back there and take the measure yourself  mr bender considered him as through narrowed eyelids look again at that tottering moretto  well its sizeas you sayisnt in any light a negligible quantity  you mean thatbig as it isit hasnt yet stopped growing  the question however as he immediately showed resided in what lord theign himself meant its more to the purpose he said to mr bender that i should mention to you the leading feature or in other words the very essence of my plan of campaignwhich is to put the picture at once on view he marked his idea with a broad but elegant gesture on view as a thing definitely disposed of  i say i say i say cried lord john moved by this bold stroke to high admiration  lady sandgates approval was more qualified but on view dear theign how  with one of those pushing people in bond street and then as for the crushing climax of his policy as a mantovano pure and simple  but my dear man she quavered if it isnt one  mr bender at once anticipated the wind had suddenly risen for him and he let out sail lady sandgate its going by all thatswell interesting to be one  lord theign took him up with pleasure you seize me we treat it as one  lord john eagerly borrowed the emphasis we treat it as one  mr bender meanwhile fed with an opened appetite on the thoughthe even gave it back larger as the longlost number eight  lord theign happily seized him that will be itto a charm  it will make them mr bender asked madder than anything  his patronif not his clientput it more nobly it will markedly affirm my attitude  which will in turn the more markedly create discussion  it may create all it will  well if you dont mind it i dont mr bender concluded but though bathed in this high serenity he was all for the rapid application of it elsewhere youll put the thing on view right off  as soon as the proper arrangement  you put off your journey to make it lady sandgate at once broke in  lord theign bethought himselfwith the effect of a gracious confidence in the others not if these friends will act  oh i guess well act mr bender declared  ah wont we though lord john reechoed  you understand then i have an interest mr bender went on to lord theign  his lordships irony met it i accept that complicationwhich so much simplifies  and yet also have a liberty  where else would be those youve taken the point is said lord theign that i have a show  it settled mr bender then ill fix your show he snatched up his hat lord john come right round  lord john had of himself reached the door which he opened to let the whirlwind tremendously figured by his friend pass out first taking leave of the others he gave it even his applause the fellow can do anything anywhere and he hastily followed     v  lady sandgate left alone with lord theign drew the line at their companions enthusiasm that may be true of mr benderfor its dreadful how he bears one down but i simply find him a terror  well said her friend who seemed disposed not to fatigue the question i dare say a terror will help me he had other business to which he at once gave himself and now if you please for that girl  ill send her to you she replied if you cant stay to luncheon  ive three or four things to do he pleaded and i lunch with kitty at one  she submitted in that casebut disappointedly with berkeley square then youve time but i confess i dont quite grasp the so odd inspiration that youve set those men to carry out  he showed surprise and regret but even greater decision then it neednt trouble you dearits enough that i myself go straight  are you so very convinced its straightshe wouldnt be a bore to him but she couldnt not be a blessing  what in the world else is it he asked when having good reasons one acts on em  you must have an immense array she sighed to fly so in the face of opinion  opinion he commentedi fly in its face why the vulgar thing as im taking my quiet walk flies in mine i give it a whack with my umbrella and send it about its business to which he added with more reproach its enough to have been dished by gracewithout your falling away  sadly and sweetly she defended herself its only my great affectionand all that these years have been for us they it is that make me wish you werent so proud  ive a perfect sense my dear of what these years have been for usa very charming matter but proud is it you find me of the daughter who does her best to ruin me or of the one who does her best to humiliate  lady sandgate not undiscernibly took her choice of ignoring the point of this your surrenders to kitty are your own affairbut are you sure you can really bear to see grace  i seem expected indeed to bear much he said with more and more of his parental bitterness but i dont know that im yet in a funk before my child doesnt she want to see me with any contrition after the trick she has played me and then as his companions answer failed in spite of which trick you suggest that i should leave the country with no sign of her explaining  his hostess raised her head she does want to see you i know but you must recall the sequel to that bad hour at dedboroughwhen it was you who declined to see her  before she left the house with you the next day for thishe was entirely reminiscent what i recall is that even if i had condonedthat eveningher deception of me in my folly i still loathed for my friends sake her practical joke on poor john  lady sandgate indulged in the shrug conciliatory it was your very complaint that your own appeal to her became an appeal from herself  yes he returned so well he remembered she was about as civil to me thenpicking a quarrel with me on such a trumpedup groundas that devil of a fellow in the newspaper the taste of whose elegant remarks for that matter she must now altogether enjoy  his good friend showily balanced and might have been about to reply with weight but what she in fact brought out was only i see youre right about it i must let her speak for herself  that i shall greatly prefer to her speakingas she did so extraordinarily out of the blue at dedborough upon my honourfor the wonderful friends she picks up the pictureman introduced by her what was his name who regularly cheeked me as i suppose hed call it in my own house and whom i hope by the way that under this roof shes not able to be quite so thick with  if lady sandgate winced at that vain dream she managed not to betray it and she had in any embarrassment on this matter the support as we know of her own tried policy she leads her life under this roof very much as under yours and shes not of an age remember for me to pretend either to watch her movements or to control her contacts leaving him however thus to perform his pleasure the charming woman had before she went an abrupt change of tone whatever your relations with others dear friend dont forget that im still here  lord theign accepted the reminder though the circumstances being such it scarce moved him to ecstasy that youre here thank heaven is of course a comfortor would be if you understood  ah she submissively sighed if i dont always understand a spirit so much higher than mine and a situation so much more complicated certainly i at least always defer i at least alwayswell what can i say but worship and then as he remained not other than finely passive the old altar theign she went onand a spark of the old fire  he had not looked at her on thisit was as if he shrank with his preoccupations from a tender passage but he let her take his left hand so i feel he was however kind enough to answer  do feel she returned with much concentration she raised the hand to her pressed lips dropped it and with a rich goodbye reached the threshold of the other room  may i smoke he asked before she had disappeared  dear yes  he had meanwhile taken out his cigarette case and was looking about for a match but something else occurred to him you must come to victoria  rather she said with intensity and with that she passed away     vi  left alone he had a moments meditation where he stood it found issue in an articulate poor dear thingan exclamation marked at once with patience and impatience with resignation and ridicule after which waiting for his daughter lord theign slowly and absently roamed finding matches at last and lighting his cigaretteall with an air of concern that had settled on him more heavily from the moment of his finding himself alone his luxury of gloomif gloom it wasdropped however on his taking heed of lady grace who arriving on the scene through the other room had had just time to stand and watch him in silence  oh he jerked out at sight of herwhich she had to content herself with as a parental greeting after separation his next words doing little to qualify its dryness i take it for granted that you know im within a couple of hours of leaving england under a necessity of health and then as drawing nearer she signified without speaking her possession of this fact ive thought accordingly that before i go i shouldon this first possible occasion since that odious occurrence at dedboroughlike to leave you a little more food for meditation in my absence on the painfully false position in which you there placed me he carried himself restlessly even perhaps with a shade of awkwardness to which her stillness was a contrast she just waited wholly passivepossibly indeed a trifle portentous if you had plotted and planned it in advance he none the less firmly pursued if you had acted from some uncanny or malignant motive you couldnt have arranged more perfectly to incommode to disconcert and to all intents and purposes make light of me and insult me even before this charge she made no sign with her eyes now attached to the ground she let him proceed i had practically guaranteed to our excellent our charming friend your favourable view of his appealwhich you yourself too remember had left him in so little doubt ofso that having by your performance so egregiously failed him i have the pleasure of their coming down on me for explanations for compensations and for god knows what besides  lady grace looking up at last left him in no doubt of the rigour of her attention im sorry indeed father to have done you any wrong but may i ask whom in such a connection you refer to as they  they he echoed in the manner of a man who has had handed back to his more careful eye across the counter some questionable coin that he has tried to pass why your own sister to begin withwhose interest in what may make for your happiness i suppose you decently recognise and his people one and all the delightful old duchess in particular who only wanted to be charming to you and who are as good people and as pleasant and as clever damn it when alls said and done as any others that are likely to come your way it clearly did his lordship good to work out thus his case which grew more and more coherent to him and glowed with irresistible colour letting alone gallant john himself most amiable of men about whose merits and whose claims you appear to have pretended to agree with me just that you might when he presumed poor chap ardently to urge them deal him with the more cruel effect that calculated blow on the mouth  it was clear that in the girls great gravity embarrassment had no share they so come down on you i understand then father that youre obliged to come down on me  assuredlyfor some better satisfaction than your just moping here without a sign  but a sign of what father she askedas helpless as a lone islander scanning the horizon for a sail  of your appreciating of your in some degree dutifully considering the predicament into which youve put me  hasnt it occurred to you in the least that youve rather put me into one  he threw back his head as from exasperated nerves i put you certainly in the predicament of your receiving by my care a handsome settlement in lifewhich all the elements that would make for your enjoying it had every appearance of successfully commending to you the perfect readiness of which on his lips had like a higher wave the virtue of lifting and dropping him to still more tangible ground and if i understand you aright as wishing to know whether i apologise for that zeal why you take a most preposterous view of our relation as father and daughter  you understand me no better than i fear i understand you lady grace returned if what you expect of me is really to take back my words to lord john and then as he didnt answer while their breach gaped like a jostled wound have you seriously come to proposeand from him again she addedthat i shall reconsider my resolute act and lend myself to your beautiful arrangement  it had so the sound of unmixed ridicule that he could only for his dignity not give way to passion ive come above all for this i may say grace to remind you of whom youre addressing when you jibe at me and to make of you assuredly a plain demandexactly as to whether you judged us to have actively incurred your treatment of our unhappy friend to have brought it upon us he and i by my refusal to discuss with you at such a crisis the question of my disposition of a particular item of my property ive only to look at you for that matter lord theign continuedalways with a finer point and a higher consistency as his rehearsal of his wrongs broadenedto have my inquiry as it seems to me eloquently answered you flounced away from poor john you took as he tells me his head off just to repay me for what you chose to regard as my snub on the score of your challenging my entertainment of a possible purchaser a rebuke launched at me practically in the presence of a most inferior person a stranger and an intruder from whom you had all the air of taking your cue for naming me the great condition on which youd gratify my hope am i to understand in other wordsand his lordship mounted to a climaxthat you sent us about our business because i failed to gratify your hope that of my knocking under to your sudden monstrous pretension to lay down the law for my choice of ways and means of raising to my best convenience a considerable sum of money youll be so good as to understand once for all that i recognise there no right of interference from any quarterand also to let that knowledge govern your behaviour in my absence  lady grace had thus for some minutes waited on his wordswaited even as almost with anxiety for the safe conduct he might look to from some of the more extravagant of them but he at least felt at the endif it was an endall he owed them so that there was nothing for her but to accept as achieved his dreadful felicity youre very angry with me and i hope you wont feel me simply aggravating if i say that thinking everything over ive done my best to allow for that but i can answer your question if i do answer it by saying that my discovery of your possible sacrifice of one of our most beautiful things didnt predispose me to decide in favour of a personhowever backed by youfor whose benefit the sacrifice was to take place frankly the girl pushed on i did quite hate for the moment everything that might make for such a mistake and took the darkest view let me also confess of every one without exception connected with it i interceded with you earnestly for our precious picture and you wouldnt on any terms have my intercession on top of that lord john blundered in without timeliness or tactand im afraid that as i hadnt been the least in love with him even before he did have to take the consequence  lord theign with an elated swing of his person greeted this as all he could possibly want you recognise then that your reception of him was purely vindictivethe meaning of which is that unless my conduct of my private interests of which you know nothing whatever happens to square with your superior wisdom youll put me under boycott all round while you chatter about mistakes and blunders and about our charming friends lack of the discretion of which you yourself set so grand an example what account have you to offer of the scene you made me there before that fellowyour confederate as he had all the air of beingby giving it me with such effrontery that if i had eminently done with him after his remarkable display you at least were but the more determined to see him keep it up  the girls justification clearly was very present to her and not less obviously the truth that to make it strong she must avoiding every sideissue keep it very simple the only account i can give you i think is that i could but speak at such a moment as i felt and that i feltwell how can i say how deeply if you can really bear to know i feel so still i care in fact more than ever that we shouldnt do such things i care if you like to indiscretioni care if you like to offence to arrogance to folly but even as my last word to you before you leave england on the conclusion of such a step im ready to cry out to you that you oughtnt you oughtnt you oughtnt  her father with wondermoved elevated brows and high commanding hand checked her as in an act really of violencesave that like an inflamed young priestess she had already in essence delivered her message hallo hallo hallo my distracted daughterno crying out if you please after which while arrested but unabashed she still kept her lighted eyes on him he gave back her conscious stare for a minute inwardly and rapidly turning things over making connections taking as after some long and lamentable lapse of observation a new strange measure of her all to the upshot of his then speaking with a difference of tone a recognition of still more of the odious than he had supposed so that the case might really call for some coolness you keep bad company graceit pays the devil with your sense of proportion if you make this row when i sell a picture what will be left to you when i forge a cheque  if you had arrived at the necessity of forging a cheque she answered i should then resign myself to that of your selling a picture  but not short of that  not short of that not one of ours  but i couldnt said his lordship with his best and coldest amusement sell one of somebody elses  she was however not disconcerted other people do other thingsthey appear to have done them and to be doing them all about us but we have been so decently differentalways and ever weve never done anything disloyal  disloyalhe was more largely amazed and even interested now  lady grace stuck to her word thats what it seems to me  it seems to youand his sarcasm here was easymore disloyal to sell a picture than to buy one because we didnt paint em all ourselves you know  she threw up impatient hands i dont ask you either to paint or to buy  oh thats a mercy he interrupted riding his irony hard and im glad to hear you at least let me off such efforts however if it strikes you as gracefully filial to apply to your fathers conduct so invidious a word he went on less scathingly you must take from him in your turn his quite other view of what makes disloyaltyunderstanding distinctly by the same token that he enjoins on you not to give an odious illustration of it while hes away by discussing and deploring with any one of your extraordinary friends any aspect or feature whatever of his walk and conversation thatpressed as i am for time he went on with a glance at his watch while she remained silentis the main sense of what i have to say to you so that i count on your perfect conformity when you have told me that i may so countand casting about for his hat he espied it and went to take it upi shall more cordially bid you goodbye  his daughter looked as if she had been for some time expecting the law thus imposed upon herhad been seeing where he must come out but in spite of this preparation she made him wait for his reply in such tension as he had himself created to kitty ive practically said nothingand she herself can tell you why ive in fact scarcely seen her this fortnight putting aside then amy sandgate the only person to whom ive spokenof your sacrifice as i suppose youll let me call itis mr hugh crimble whom you talk of as my confederate at dedborough  lord theign recovered the name with relief mr hugh crimblethats itwhom you so amazingly caused to be present and apparently invited to be active at a business that so little concerned him  he certainly took upon himself to be interested as i had hoped he would but it was because i had taken upon my self  to act yes lord theign broke in with the grossest want of delicacy well its from that exactly that youll now forbear and interested as he may befor which im deucedly obliged to himyoull not speak to mr crimble again  never againthe girl put it as for full certitude  never of the question that i thus exclude you may chatter your fill said his lordship curtly about any others  why the particular question you forbid grace returned with great force but as if saying something very reasonablethat question is the question we care about its our very ground of conversation  then her father decreed your conversation will please to dispense with a ground or youll perhaps better stillif thats the only waydispense with your conversation  lady grace took a moment as if to examine this more closely you require of me not to communicate with mr crimble at all  most assuredly i require itsince its to that you insist on reducing me he didnt look reduced the master of dedborough as he spokewhich was doubtless precisely because he held his head so high to affirm what he suffered is it so essential to your comfort he demanded to hear him or to make him abuse me  abusing you father dear has nothing whatever to do with ithis daughter had fairly lapsed with a despairing gesture to the tenderness involved in her compassion for his perversity we look at the thing in a much larger way she pursued not heeding that she drew from him a sound of scorn for her larger its of our treasure itself we talkand of what can be done in such cases though with a close application i admit to the case that you embody  ah lord theign asked as with absurd curiosity i embody a case  wonderfully fatheras you do everything and its the fact of its being exceptional she explained that makes it so difficult to deal with  his lordship had a gape for it to deal with youre undertaking to deal with me  she smiled more frankly now as for a rift in the gloom well how can we help it if you will be a case and then as her tone but visibly darkened his wonder what weve set our hearts on is saving the picture  what youve set your hearts on in other words is working straight against me  but she persisted without heat what weve set our hearts on is working for england  and pray who in the worlds england he cried in his stupefaction unless i am  dear dear father she pleaded thats all we want you to be i meanshe didnt fear firmly to force it homein the real the right the grand sense the sense that you see is so intensely ours  ourshe couldnt but again throw back her word at her isnt it damn you just in ours  no no she interruptednot in ours she smiled at him still though it was strained as if he really ought to perceive  but he glared as at a senseless juggle what and who the devil are you talking about what are we the whole blest lot of us pray but the best and most english thing in the country people walkingand ridingstraight doing disinterestedly most of the difficult and all the thankless jobs minding their own business above all and expecting others to mind theirs so he let her have the stout sound truth as it wereand so the direct force of it clearly might by his view have made her reel you and i my lady and your two decent brothers god be thanked for them and mine into the bargain and all the rest the jolly lot of us take us togethermake us numerous enough without any foreign aid or mixture if thats what i understand you to mean  you dont understand me at allevidently and above all i see you dont want to she had the bravery to add by our sense of whats due to the nation in such a case i mean mr crimbles and mineand nobodys else at all since as i tell you its only with him ive talked  it gave him then every inch of him showed the full the grotesque measure of the scandal he faced so that you and mr crimble represent the standard for me in your opinion of the proprieties and duties of our house  well she was too earnestas she clearly wished to let him seeto mind his perversion of it i express to you the way we feel  its most striking to hear certainly what you expresshe had positively to laugh for it and you speak of him with your insufferable we as if you were presenting him as yourgod knows what youve enjoyed a large exchange of ideas i gather to have arrived at such unanimity and then as if to fall into no trap he might somehow be laying for her she dropped all eagerness and rebutted nothing you must see a great deal of your fellowcritic not to be able to speak of yourself without him  yes were fellowcritics fathershe accepted this opening i perfectly adopt your term but it took her a minute to go further i saw mr crimble here half an hour ago  saw him here lord theign amazedly asked he comes to you hereand amy sandgate has been silent  it wasnt her business to tell yousince you see she could leave it to me and i quite expect lady grace then produced that hell come again  it brought down with a bang all her fathers authority then i simply exact of you that you dont see him  the pause of which she paid it the deference was charged like a brimming cup is that what you really meant by your condition just nowthat when i do see him i shall not speak to him  what i really meant is what i really meanthat you bow to the law i lay upon you and drop the man altogether  have nothing to do with him at all  have nothing to do with him at all  in factshe took it ingive him wholly up  he had an impatient gesture you sound as if i asked you to give up a fortune and then though she had phrased his idea without consternationverily as if it had been in the balance for herhe might have been moved by something that gathered in her eyes youre so wrapped up in him that the precious sacrifice is like that sort of thing  lady grace took her timebut showed as her eyes continued to hold him what had gathered i like mr crimble exceedingly fatheri think him clever intelligent good i want what he wantsi want it i think really as much and i dont at all deny that he has helped to make me so want it but that doesnt matter ill wholly cease to see him ill give him up forever ifif she faltered however she hung fire with a smile that anxiously intensely appealed then she began and stopped again ifif while her father caught her up with irritation  if my lady if what please  if youll withdraw the offer of our picture to mr benderand never make another to any one else  he stood staring as at the size of itthen translated it into his own terms if ill obligingly announce to the world that ive made an ass of myself youll kindly forbear from your united effortthe charming pair of youto show me up for one  lady grace as if consciously not caring or attempting to answer this simply gave the first flare of his criticism time to drop it wasnt till a minute passed that she said you dont agree to my compromise  ah the question but fatally sharpened at a stroke the stiffness of his spirit good god im to compromise on top of everythingim to let you browbeat me haggle and bargain with me over a thing that im entitled to settle with you as things have ever been settled among us by uttering to you my last parental word  you dont care enough then for what you nameshe took it up as scarce heeding now what he said  for putting an end to your odious commerce i give you the measure on the contrary said lord theign of how much i care as you give me very strangely indeed it strikes me that of what it costs you but his other words were lost in the hard long look at her from which he broke off in turn as for disgust  it was with an effect of decently shielding herselfthe unuttered meaning came so straightthat she substituted words of her own of what it costs me to redeem the picture  to lose your tenthrate friendhe spoke without scruple now  she instantly broke into ardent deprecation pleading at once and warning father father oh you hold the thing in your hands  he pulled up before her again as to thrust the responsibility straight back my orders then are so much rubbish to you  lady grace held her ground and they remained face to face in opposition and accusation neither making the other the sign of peace but the girl at least had in her way held out the olivebranch while lord theign had but reaffirmed his will it was for her acceptance of this that he searched her her last word not having yet come before it had done so however the door from the lobby opened and mr gotch had regained their presence this appeared to determine in lady grace a view of the importance of delay which she signified to her companion in a welli must think for the butler positively resounded and hugh was there  mr crimble mr gotch proclaimedwith the further extravagance of projecting the visitor straight upon his lordship     vii  our young man showed another face than the face his friend had lately seen him carry off and he now turned it distressfully from that source of inspiration to lord theign who was flagrantly even from this first moment no such source at all and then from his noble adversary back again under pressure of difficulty and effort to lady grace whom he directly addressed here i am again you seeand ive got my news worse luck but his manner to her father was the next instant more brisk i learned you were here my lord but as the case is important i told them it was all right and came up ive been to my club he added for the girl and found the tiresome thing but he broke down breathless  and it isnt good she cried with the highest concern  ruefully yet not abjectly he confessed not so good as i hoped for i assure you my lord i counted  its the report from pappendick about the picture at verona lady grace interruptingly explained  hugh took it up but as we should well have seen under embarrassment dismally deeper the ugly particular defeat he had to announce showing thus in his thought for a more awkward force than any reviving possibilities that he might have begun to balance against them the man i told you about also he said to his formidable patron whom i went to brussels to talk with and who most kindly has gone for us to verona he has been able to get straight at their mantovano but the brute horribly wires me that he doesnt quite see the thing see i meanand he gathered his two hearers together now in his overflow of chagrin conscious with his break of the ice more exclusively of thatmy vivid vital point the absolute screaming identity of the two persons represented i still hold he persuasively went on that our man is their man but pappendick decides that he isntand as pappendick has so much to be reckoned with of course im awfully abashed  lord theign had remained what he had begun by being immeasurably and inaccessibly detachedonly with his curiosity more moved than he could help and as on second thought to see what sort of a still more offensive fool the heated youth would really make of himself yesyou seem indeed remarkably abashed  hugh clearly was thrown again by the cold cut of this colder than any mere social ignoring upon a sense of the damnably poor figure he did offer so that while he straightened himself and kept a mastery of his manner and a control of his reply we should yet have felt his cheek tingle i backed my own judgment strongly i knowand ive got my snub but i dont in the least knock under  only the first authority in europe doesnt care i suppose whether you do or not  he isnt the first authority in europe thank god the young man returnedthough he is i admit one of the three or four first and i mean to appealive another shot in my locker he went on with his rather painfully forced smile to lady grace i had already written you see to dear old bardi  bardi of milanshe recognised it was admirably manifest the appeal of his directness to her generosity awkward as their predicament was also for her herself and spoke to him as she might have spoken without her fathers presence  it would have shown for beautiful on the spot had there been any one to perceive it that he devoutly recorded her intelligence you know of himhow delightful of you for the italians i now feel he quickly explained he must have most the instinctand it has come over me since that hed have been more our man besides of course his so knowing the verona picture  she had fairly hung on his lips but does he know ours  nonot ours yet that ishe consciously and quickly took himself upnot yours but as pappendick went to verona for us ive asked bardi to do us the great favour to come hereif lord theign will be so good he said bethinking himself with a turn as to let him examine the moretto he faced again to the personage he mentioned who simply standing off and watching in concentrated interest as well as detachment this interview of his cool daughter and her still cooler guest had plainly elected as it were to give them rope to hang themselves staring very hard at hugh he met his appeal but in a silence clearly calculated against which however the young man bearing up made such head as he could he offered his next word that is equally to the two companions its not at all impossiblefor such curious effects have beenthat the dedborough picture seen after the verona will point a different moral from the verona seen after the dedborough  and so awfully long afterwasnt it lady grace asked  awfully long afterit was years ago that pappendick being in this country for such purposes was kindly admitted to your house when none of you were there or at least visible  oh of course we dont see every oneshe heroically kept it up  you dont see every one hugh bravely laughed and that makes it all the more charming that you did and that you still do see me i shall really get bardi he pursued to go again to verona  the last thing before coming hereshe had guessed before he could say it and still she sustained it so that he could shine at her for assent how happy they should like so to work for you  ah were a band of brothers he returnedwe few we happy fewfrom country to country to which he added gaining more ease for an eye at lord theign though we do have our little rubs and disputes like pappendick and me now the thing you see is the ripping interest of it all since he developed and explained for his elder friends benefit with pertinacious cheer and an assurance superficially at least recovered when were really hit over a case well do almost anything in life  lady grace recklessly throbbing in the breath of it all immediately appropriated what her father let alone it must be so lovely to feel so hit  it does spoil one hugh laughed for milder joys of course what i have to consider is the chanceputting it at the merest chanceof bardis own wet blanket but thats again so very smallthough he pulled up with a drop to the comparative dismal which he offered as an almost familiar tribute to lord theign youll retort upon me naturally that i promised you the possibility of pappendicks veto would be all on the poor dear old basis youll claim of the wish father to the thought well i do wish to be right as much as i believe i am only give me time he sublimely insisted  how can we prevent your using it lady grace again interrupted or the fact either that if the worst comes to the worst  the thinghe at once pursuedwill always be at the least the greatest of morettos ah he cried so cheerily that there was still a freedom in it toward any it might concern the worst shant come to the worst but the best to the best my conviction of which it is that supports me in the deep regret i have to expressand he faced lord theign againfor any inconvenience i may have caused you by my abortive undertaking that i vow here before lady grace i will yet more than make up  lord theign after the longest but the blankest contemplation of him broke hereupon for the first time that attitude of completely sustained and separate silence which he had yet made compatible with his air of having deeply noted every element of the sceneso that it was of this full view his participation had effectively consisted i havent the least idea sir what youre talking about and he squarely turned his back strolling toward the other room the threshold of which he the next moment had passed remaining scantily within however and in sight of the others not to say of ourselves even though averted and ostensibly lost in some scrutiny that might have had for its object the great enshrined lawrence  there ensued upon his words and movement a vivid mute passage the richest of commentaries between his companions who deeply divided by the width of the ample room followed him with their eyes and then used for their own interchange these organs of remark eloquent now over hughs unmistakable dismissal at short order on which obviously he must at once act lady graces young arms conveyed to him by a despairing contrite motion of surrender that she had done for him all she could do in his presence and that however sharply doubtful the result he was to leave the rest to herself they communicated thus the strenuous pair for their full moment without speaking only with the prolonged the charged give and take of their gaze and it might well have been imagined of their passion hugh had for an instant a show of hesitationof the arrested impulse while he kept her father within range to launch at that personage before going some final remonstrance it was the girls raised hand and gesture of warning that waved away for him such a mistake he decided under her pressure and after a last searching and answering look at her reached the door and let himself out the stillness was then prolonged a minute by the further wait of the two others lord theign where he had been standing and his daughter on the spot from which she had not moved it presently ended in his lordships turn about as if inferring by the silence that the intruder had withdrawn  is that young man your lover he said as he drew again near  lady grace waited a little but spoke as quietly as if she had been prepared has the question a bearing on the promise you a short time ago demanded of me  it has a bearing on the so extraordinary appearance of your intimacy with him  you mean that if he should bewhat you ask me aboutyour exaction would then be modified  my request that you break it short off that request would on the contrary lord theign pronounced rest on an immense new ground therefore i insist on your telling me the truth  wont the truth be before you father if youll think a momentwithout extravagance after which while as stiffly as everand it probably seemed to her impatience as stupidlyhe didnt rise to it she went on if i offered you not again to see him does that make for you the appearance  if you offered it you mean on your conditionmy promising not to sell i promised said lord theign absolutely nothing at all  she took him up with all expression so i promised as little but that i should have been able to say what i did sufficiently meets your curiosity  she might wronged as she held herself have felt him stupid not to see how wronged but he was in any case acute for an evasion you risked your offer for the great equivalent over which youve so wildly worked yourself up  yes ive worked myselfthat i grant you and dont blush for but hardly so much as to renounce my loverif she prodigiously smiled i were so fortunate as to have one  you renounced poor john mightily easilywhom you were so fortunate as to have  her brows rose as high as his own had ever done do you call lord john my lover  he was your suitor most assuredly lord theign inimitably said though without looking at her and as strikingly encouraged as he was respectfully ardent  encouraged by you dear father beyond doubt  encouragederby every one because you were yes you were encouraging and what i ask of you now is a word of common candour as to whether you didnt on your honour turn him off because of your just then so stimulated views on the person who has been with us  grace replied but after an instant as moved by more things than she could saymoved above all in her trouble and her pity for him by other things than harshness oh father father father  he searched her through all the compassion of her cry but appeared to give way to her sincerity well then if i have your denial i take it as answering my whole questionin a manner that satisfies me if theres nothing on your word of that sort between you you can all the more drop him  but you said a moment ago that i should all the more in the other casethat of there being something  he brushed away her logicchopping if youre so keen then for past remarks i take up your own wordsi accept your own terms for your putting an end to mr crimble to which while turning pale she said nothing he added you recognise that you profess yourself ready  not again to see him she now answered if you tell me the pictures safe yes i recognise that i was readyas well as how scornfully little you then were  never mind what i then wasthe questions of what i actually am since i close with you on it the pictures therefore as safe as you please lord theign pursued if youll do what you just now engaged to  i engaged to do nothing she replied after a pause and the face she turned to him had grown suddenly tragic ive no word to take back for none passed between us but i wont do what i mentioned and what you at once laughed at because she finished the case is different  different he almost shoutedhow different  she didnt look at him for it but she was none the less strongly distinct he has been hereand that has done it he knows she admirably emphasised  knows what i think of him no doubtfor a brazen young prevaricator but what else  she still kept her eyes on a faroff point what he will have seenthat i feel were too good friends  then your denial of its false her father fairly thunderedand you are infatuated  it made her the more quiet i like him very much  so that your row about the picture he demanded with passion has been all a blind and then as her quietness still held her and his a blind as muchto help him to get at you  she looked at him again now he must speak for himself ive said what i mean  but what the devil do you mean lord theign taking in the hour had reached the door as in supremely baffled conclusion and with a sense of time lamentably lost  their eyes met upon it all dreadfully across the wide space and hurried and incommoded as she saw him she yet made him still stand a minute then she let everything go do what you like with the picture  he jerked up his arm and guarding hand as before a levelled blow at his face and with the other hand flung open the door having done with her now and immediately lost to sight left alone she stood a moment looking before her then with a vague advance held apparently by a quickly growing sense of the implication of her act reached a table where she remained a little deep afresh in thoughtonly the next thing to fall into a chair close to it and there with her elbows on it yield to the impulse of covering her flushed face with her hands      book third     i  hugh crimble waited again in the bruton street drawingroomthis time at the afternoon hour he restlessly shifted his place looked at things about him without seeing them all he saw all he outwardly studied was his own face and figure as he stopped an instant before a long glass suspended between two windows just as he turned from that brief and perhaps not wholly gratified inspection lady gracethat he had sent up his name to whom was immediately apparentpresented herself at the entrance from the other room these young persons had hereupon no instant exchange of words their exchange was mutethey but paused where they were while the silence of each evidently tested the other for full confidence a measure of this comfort came first it would have appeared to hugh though he then at once asked for confirmation of it  am i right lady grace am i rightto have come i mean after so many days of not hearing not knowing and perhaps all too stupidly not trying and he went on as still with her eyes on him she didnt speak though only we should have guessed from her stress of emotion even if im wrong let me tell you i dont caresimply because whatever new difficulty i may have brought about for you here a fortnight ago theres something that today adds to my doubt and my fear too great a pang and that has made me feel i can scarce bear the suspense of them as they are  the girl came nearer and if her grave face expressed a pity it yet declined a dread of what suspense do you speak your still being without the other opinion  ah that worries me yes and all the more at this hour as i say that he dropped it however ill tell you in a moment my real torment all the while has been not to know from day to day what situation what complication that last scene of ours with your father here has let you in for and yet at the same timehaving no sign nor sound from youto see the importance of not making anything possibly worse by approaching you again however discreetly ive been in the dark he pursued and feeling that i must leave you there so that nowjust brutally turning up once more under personal need and at any costi dont know whether i most want or most fear what i may learn from you  lady grace listening and watching appeared to choose between different ways of meeting this appeal she had a pacifying postponing gesture marked with a beautiful authority a sign of the value for her of what she gave precedence to and which waved off everything else have you hadfirst of allany news yet of bardi  that i have is what has driven me straight at you againsince ive shown you before how i turn to you at a crisis he has come as i hoped and like a regular good un hugh was able to state ive just met him at the station but i pick him up again at his hotel in clifford street at five he stopped on his way from dover this morning to my extreme exasperation to sample canterbury and i leave him to a bath and a change and tea then swooping down i whirl him round to bond street where his very first apprehension of the thing an apprehension oh i guarantee you so quick and clean and fine and wise will be the flashlight projectedwell said the young man to wind up handsomely but briefly and reasonably over the whole field of our question  she panted with comprehension that of the two portraits being but the one sitter  that of the two portraits being but the one sitter with everything so to the good more and more that bangs in up to the head the golden nail of authenticity andhe quite glowed through his gloom for itwe take our stand in glory on the last mantovano in the world  it was a presumption his friend visibly yearned forbut over which too with her eyes away from him she still distinguished the shadow of a cloud that is if the flashlight comes  that is if it comes indeed confound ithe had to enlarge a little under the recall of past experience so now at any rate you see my tension  she looked at him again as with a vision too full for a waste of words while you on your side of course keep well in view mr benders  yes while i keep well in view mr benders though he doesnt know you see of bardis being at hand  still said the girl always all lucid for the case if the flashlight does presently break  it will first take him in the eye hugh had jumped to her idea but he adopted it only to provide it might if he didnt now wear goggles so to sayclapped on him too hard by pappendicks so damnably perverse opinion with which however he quickly bethought himself ah of course these wretched days you havent known of pappendicks personal visit after that wire from verona i wired him back defiance  and that brought him she cried  to do the honest thing yesi will say for him to renew for full assurance his early memory of our picture  she hung upon it but only to stick then to what he had telegraphed  to declare that for him lackaday our things a pure morettoand to declare as much moreover with all the weight of his authority to bender himself who of course made a point of seeing him  so that bendershe followed and wonderedis as a consequence wholly off  it made her friends humour play up in his acuteness bender lady grace is by the law of his being never wholly offor onanything he lives like the moon in midair shedding his silver light on earth never quite gone yet never all theresave for inappreciable moments he would be in eclipse as a peril i grant hugh went onif the question had struck him as really closed but luckily the blessed presswhich is a pure heavenly joy and now quite immense on itkeeps it open as wide as piccadilly  which makes however lady grace discriminated for the danger of a grab  ah but all the more for the shame of a surrender of course i admit that when its a question of a life spent like his in waiting acquisitively for the cat to jump the only thing for one at a given moment as against that signal is to be found ones self by the animal in the line of its trajectory thats exactly he laughed where we are  she cast about as intelligently to note the place your great idea you mean has so workedwith the uproar truly as loud as it has seemed to come to us here  all beyond my wildest hope hugh returned since the sight of the picture flocked to every day by thousands so beautifully tells that we must at any cost keep it that the nation must and hang on to it tight is the cry that fills the airto the tune of ten letters a day in the papers with every three days a gorgeous leader to say nothing of more and more passionate talk all over the place some of it awfully wild but all of it wind in our sails  i suppose it was that wind then that blew me round there to see the thing in its new light lady grace said but i couldnt stayfor tears  ah hugh insisted on his side for comfort well crow loudest yet and dont meanwhile just dont those splendid strange eyes of the fellow seem consciously to plead the women bless them adore him cling to him and theres talk of a ladies league of protestall of which keeps up the pitch  poor amy and i are a ladies league the girl joylessly jokedas we now take in the journal regardless of expense  oh then you practically have it allsince hugh added after a brief hesitation i suppose lord theign himself doesnt languish uninformed  at faroff salsomaggioreby the papers no doubt indeed he isnt spared even the worst said lady graceand no doubt too its a drag on his cure  her companion seemed struck with her lack of assurance then you dontif i may askhear from him  i never a word  he doesnt write hugh allowed himself to insist  he doesnt write and i dont write either  and lady sandgate hugh once more ventured  doesnt she write  doesnt she hear said the young man treating the other form of the question as a shade evasive  ive asked her not to tell me his friend repliedthat is if he simply holds out  so that as she doesnt tell youhugh was clear for the inferencehe of course does hold out to which he added almost accusingly while his eyes searched her but your case is really bad  she confessed to it after a moment but as if vaguely enjoying it my case is really bad  he had a vividness of impatience and contrition 197  and its i whoall too blunderinglyhave made it so  ive made it so myself she said with a high headshake and you on the contrary but here she checked her emphasis  ah ive so wanted through our horrid silence to help you and he pressed to get more at the truth youve so quite fatally displeased him  to the last pointas i tell you but its not to that i refer she explained its to the ground of complaint ive given you and then as this but left him blank its timeit was at once timethat you should know she pursued and yet if its hard for me to speak as you see it was impossible for me to write but there it is she made her sad and beautiful effort the last thing before he left us i let the picture go  you mean but he could only wondertill however it glimmered upon him you gave up your protest  i gave up my protest i told him thatso far as im concernedhe might do as he liked  her poor friend turned pale at the sharp little shock of it but if his face thus showed the pang of too great a surprise he yet wreathed the convulsion in a gay grimace you leave me to struggle alone  i leave you to struggle alone  he took it in bewilderingly but tried again even to the heroic for optimism ah well you decided i suppose on some new personal ground  yes a reason came up a reason i hadnt to that extent looked for and which of a suddenquickly before he wenti had somehow to deal with so to give him my word in the dismal sense i mention was my only way to meet the strain she paused hugh waited for something further and i gave him my word i wouldnt help you she wound up  he turned it over to act in the matteri see  to act in the mattershe went through with itafter the high stand i had taken  still he studied it i seei see its between you and your father  its between him and meyes an engagement not again to trouble him  hugh from his face might have feared a still greater complication so he made as he would probably have said a jolly lot of this ah that was nice of you and natural thats all right  noshe spoke from a deeper depthits altogether wrong for whatever happens i must now accept it  well say you musthe really declined not to treat it almost as rather a larkif we can at least go on talking  ah we can at least go on talking she perversely sighed i can say anything i like so long as i dont say it to him she almost wailed but she added with more firmness i can still hopeand i can still pray  he set free again with a joyous gesture all his confidence well what more could you do anyhow so isnt that enough  it took her a moment to say and even then she didnt is it enough for you mr crimble  what is enough for mehe could for his part readily name itis the harm done you at our last meeting by my irruption so that if you got his consent to see me  i didnt get his consentshe had turned away from the searching eyes but she faced them again to rectify i see you against his express command  ah then thank god i cameit was like a bland breath on a feu de joie he flamed so much higher  thank god youve come yesfor my deplorable exposure and to justify her name for it before he could protest i offered him here not to see you she rigorously explained  offered himhugh did drop for it not to see meever again  she didnt falter never again  ah then he understood but he wouldnt let that serve  not for the price i put on it  his yielding on the picture  his yielding on the picture  hugh lingered before it all your proposal wasnt good enough  it wasnt good enough  i see he repeatedi see but he was in that light again mystified then why are you therefore not free  becausejust afteryou came back and i did see you again  ah it was all present you found you were too sorry for me  i found i was too sorry for youas he himself found i was  hugh had got hold of it now and that you mean he couldnt stomach  so little that when you had gone and how you had to go you remember he at once proposed rather than that i should deceive you in a way so different from his own  to do all we want of him  to do all i did at least  and it was then he took in that you wouldnt deal  welltry though she might to keep the colour out it all came straighter and straighter nowthose moments had brought you home to me as they had also brought him making such a difference i felt for what he veered round to agree to  the differencehugh wanted it so adorably definitethat you didnt see your way to accepting  no not to accepting the condition he named  which was that hed keep the picture for you if youd treat me as too low  if id treat you said lady grace with her eyes on his fine young face as impossible  he kept her eyeshe clearly liked so to make her repeat it and not even for the sake of the picture after he had given her time however her silence with her beautiful look in it seemed to admonish him not to force her for his pleasure as if what she had already told him didnt make him throb enough for the wonder of it he had it and let her see by his high flush how he made it his ownwhile the next thing as it was but part of her avowal the rest of that illumination called for a different intelligence your fathers reprobation of me personally is on the ground that youre all such great people  she spared him the invidious answer to this as a moment before his eagerness had spared her reserve she flung over the ground that his question laid bare the light veil of an evasion great people ive learned to see mustntto remain greatdo what my fathers doing  its indeed on the theory of their not so behaving hugh returned that we see themall the inferior rest of usin the grand glamour of their greatness  if he had spoken to meet her admirable frankness halfway that beauty in her almost brushed him aside to make at a single step the rest of the journey you wont see them in it for longif they dont now under such tests and with such opportunities begin to take care  this had given him at a stroke he clearly felt all freedom for the closer criticism lord theign perhaps recognises some such canny truth but takes care with the least trouble to himself and the finest short cutdoes it if youll let me say so rather on the cheapby finding the likes of me as his daughters trusted friend out of the question  well you wont mind that will you lady grace asked if he finds his daughter herself in any such relation to you quite as much so  different enough from position to position and person to person he brightly brooded is the view that gets itself most comfortably taken of the implications of honour  yes the girl returned my father in the act of despoiling us all all who are interested without apparently the least unpleasant consciousness keeps the balance showily even to his mostly so fine so delicate sense by suddenly discovering that hes scandalised at my caring for your friendship  hugh looked at her on this as with the gladness verily of possession promised and only waitingor as if from that moment forth he had her assurance of everything that most concerned him and that might most inspire well isnt the moral of it all simply that what his perversity of pride as we can only hold it will have most done for us is to bring usand to keep usblessedly together  she seemed for a moment to question his simply do you regard us as so much together when you remember where in spite of everything ive put myself  by telling him to do what he likes he recalled without embarrassment oh that wasnt in spite of everythingit was only in spite of the mantovano  only she flushedwhen ive given the picture up  ah hugh cried i dont care a hang for the picture and then as she let him closer close to her with this possess himself of her hands we both only care dont we that were given to each other thus we both only care dont we that nothing can keep us apart  oh if youve forgiven me she sighed into his fond face  why since you gave the thing up for me he pleadingly laughed it isnt as if you had given me up  for anything anything ah never never she breathed  then why arent we all right  well if you will  oh for ever and ever and everand with this ardent cry of his devotion his arms closed in their strength and she was clasped to his breast and to his lips  the next moment however she had checked him with the warning amy sandgateas if she had heard their hostess enter the other room lady sandgate was in fact almost already upon themtheir disjunction had scarce been effected and she had reached the nearer threshold they had at once put the widest space possible between thema little of the flurry of which transaction agitated doubtless their clutch at composure they gave back a shade awkwardly and consciously on one side and the other the speculative though gracious attention she for a few moments made them and their recent intimate relation the subject of from all of which indeed lady grace sought and found cover in a prompt and responsible address to hugh mustnt you go without more delay to clifford street  he came back to it all alert at once he had recovered his hat and reached the other door whence he gesticulated farewell to the elder lady please pardon meand he disappeared  lady sandgate hereupon stood for a little silently confronted with the girl have you freedom of mind for the fact that your fathers suddenly at hand  he has come backlady grace was sharply struck  he arrives this afternoon and appears to go straight to kittyaccording to a wire that i find downstairs on coming back late from my luncheon he has returned with a rushas said his correspondent in the elation of triumph i was sure he would  her young friend was more at sea brought back you mean by the outcryeven though he so hates it  but she was more and more all luciditysave in so far as she was now almost all authority ah hating still more to seem afraid he has come back to face the music  lady grace turning away as in vague despair for the manner in which the music might affect him yet wheeled about again after thought to a positive recognition and even to quite an inconsequent pride yesthats dear old father  and what was lady sandgate moreover but mistress now of the subject at the point the row has reached he couldnt stand it another day so he has thrown up his cure andlest we should oppose himnot even announced his start  well her companion returned now that ive done it all i shall never oppose him again  lady sandgate appeared to show herself as still under the impression she might have received on entering hell only oppose you  if he does said lady grace were at present two to bear it  heaven save us thenthe elder woman was quick was even cordial for the sense of thisyour good friend is clever  lady grace honoured the remark mr crimbles remarkably clever  and youve arranged  we havent arrangedbut weve understood so that dear amy if you understand lady grace paused for gotch had come in from the hall  his lordship has arrived his mistress immediately put to him  no my lady but lord john hasto know if hes expected here and in that case by your ladyships leave to come up  her ladyship turned to the girl may lord johnas we do await your fathercome up  as suits you please  he may come up said lady sandgate to gotch his lordships expected she had a pause till they were alone again when she went on to her companion you asked me just now if i understood welli do understand  lady grace with gotchs withdrawal which left the door open had reached the passage to the other room then youll excuse meshe made her escape     ii  lord john reannounced the next instant from the nearest quarter and quite waiving salutations left no doubt of the high pitch of his eagerness and tension as soon as the door had closed behind him what on earth then do you suppose he has come back to do to which he added while his hostesss gesture impatiently disclaimed conjecture because when a fellow really finds himself the centre of a cyclone  isnt it just at the centre she interrupted that you keep remarkably still and only in the suburbs that you feel the rage i count on dear theigns doing nothing in the least foolish  ah but he cant have chucked everything for nothing lord john sharply returned and wherever you place him in the rumpus he cant not meet somehow hang it such an assault on his character as a great nobleman and good citizen  its his luck to have become with the public of the newspapers the scapegoatinchief for the sins socalled of a lot of people lady sandgate inconclusively sighed  yes lord john concluded for her the mercenary millions on whose traffic in their trumpery valueswhen theyre so lucky as to have anythis isnt a patch  oh there are cases and cases situations and responsibilities so intensely differthat appeared on the whole for her ladyship the moral to be gathered  of course everything differs all round from everything lord john went on and who in the world knows anything of his own case but the victim of circumstances exposing himself for the highest and purest motives to be literally torn to pieces  well said lady sandgate as in her strained suspense she freshly consulted her bracelet watch i hope he isnt already tornif you tell me youve been to kittys  oh he was all right so far he had arrived and gone out again the young man explained as lady imber hadnt been at home  ah cool kitty his hostess sighed againbut diverted as she spoke by the reappearance of her butler this time positively preceding lord theign whom she met when he presently stood before her his garb of travel exchanged for consummate afternoon dress with yearning tenderness and compassionate curiosity at last dearest friendwhat a joy but with kitty not at home to receive you  that young womans parent made light of it for the indulged creatures sake oh i knew my kitty i dressed and i find her at fivethirty to which he added as he only took in further without expression lord john but bender who came there before my arrivalhe hasnt tried for me here  it was a point on which lord john himself could at least be expressive i met him at the club at luncheon he had had your letterbut for which chance my dear man i should have known nothing youll see him all right at this house but im glad if i may say so theign the speaker pursued with some emphasisim glad you know to get hold of you first  lord theign seemed about to ask for the meaning of this remark but his other companions apprehension had already overflowed you havent come back have youto whatever it may befor trouble of any sort with breckenridge  his lordship transferred his penetration to this fair friend have you become so intensely absorbedthese remarkable daysin breckenridge  she felt the shadow you would have seen of his claimed right or at least privilege of searchyet easily after an instant emerged clear ive thought and dreamt but of yoususpicious manin proportion as the clamour has spread and mr bender meanwhile if you want to know hasnt been near me once  lord john came in a manner and however unconsciously to her aid youd have seen if he had been whats the matter with him i thinkand what perhaps theign has seen from his own letter since he went on to his fellowvisitor i understood him a week ago to have been much taken up with writing you  lord theign received this without comment only again with an air of expertly sounding the speaker after which he gave himself afresh for a moment to lady sandgate ive not come home for any clamour as you surely know me well enough to believe or to notice for a minute the cheapest insolence and aggressionwhich frankly scarce reached me out there or which so far as it did i was daily washed clean of by those blest waters i returned on mr benders letter he then vouchsafed to lord johnthree extraordinarily vulgar pages about the egregious pappendick  about his having suddenly turned up in person yes and as breckenridge says marked the picture downthe young man was clearly allknowing that has of course weighed on benderbeing confirmed apparently on the whole by the drift of public opinion  lord theign took on this with a frank show of reaction from some of his friends terms a sharp turn off he even ironically indicated the babbler or at least the blunderer in question to lady sandgate he too has known me so long and he comes here to talk to me of the drift of public opinion after which he quite charged at his vain informant am i to tell you again that i snap my fingers at the drift of public opinionwhich is but another name for the chatter of all the fools one doesnt know in addition to all those and plenty of em one damnably does  lady sandgate by a turn of the hand dropped oil from her golden cruse ah you did that in your own grand way before you went abroad  i dont speak of the matter my dear man in the light of its effect on you lord john importantly explainedbut in the light of its effect on bender who so consumedly wants the picture if he is to have it to be a mantovano but seems unable to get it taken at last for anything but the fine old moretto that of course it has always been  lord theign in growing disgust at the whole beastly complication betrayed more and more the odd pitch of the temper that had abruptly restored him with such incalculable weight to the scene of action well isnt a fine old moretto good enough for him confound him  it pulled up not a little lord john who yet made his point a fine old moretto you know was exactly what he declined at dedboroughfor its comparative strictly comparative insignificance and he only thought of the picture when the wind began to rise for the enormous rarity  that that mendacious young cad who has bamboozled grace lord theign broke in tried to befool us for his beggarly reasons into claiming for it  lady sandgate renewed her mild influence ah the knowing people havent had their last wordthe possible mantovano isnt exploded yet her noble friend however declined the offered spell ive had enough of the knowing peoplethe knowing people are serpents my pictures to take or to leaveand its what ive come back if you please john to say to your man to his face  this declaration had a report as sharp and almost as multiplied as the successive cracks of a discharged revolver yet when the light smoke cleared lady sandgate at least was still left standing and smiling yes why in mercys name cant he choose whichand why does he write him dreadful breckenridge such tiresome argumentative letters  lord john took up her idea as with the air of something that had been working in him rather vehemently though under due caution too as a consequence of this exchange during which he had apprehensively watched his elder i dont think i quite see how my dear theign the poor chaps letter was so offensive  in that case his dear theign could tell him because it was a tissue of expressions that may pass currentover counters and in awful newspapersin his extraordinary world or country but that i decline to take time to puzzle out here  if he didnt make himself understood lord john took leave to laugh it must indeed have been an unusual production for bender  oh i often with the wild beauty if you will of so many of his turns havent a notion lady sandgate confessed with an equal gaiety of what hes talking about  i think i never miss his weird sense her younger guest again loyally contendedand in fact as a general thing i rather like it  i happen to like nothing that i dont enjoy lord theign rejoined with some asperityand so far as i do follow the fellow he assumes on my part an interest in his expenditure of purchasemoney that i neither feel nor pretend to he doesnt wantby what i spell outthe picture he refused at dedborough he may possibly wantif one reads it sothe picture on view in bond street and he yet appears to make with great emphasis the stupid ambiguous point that these two articles the greatest of morettos an article havent been by now proved different as if i engaged with him that i myself would so prove them  lord john indulged in a pausebut also in a suggestion he must allude to your hopingwhen you allowed us to place the picture with mackintoshthat it would show to all london in the most precious light conceivable  well if it hasnt so shownand lord theign stared as if mystifiedwhat in the worlds the meaning of this preposterous racket  the racket is largely his young friend explained the vociferation of the people who contradict each other about it  on which their hostess sought to enliven the gravity of the question someyesshouting on the housetops thats a mantovano of the mantovanos and others shrieking back at them that theyre donkeys if not criminals  he may take it for whatever he likes said lord theign heedless of these contributions he may father it on michael angelo himself if hell but clear out with it and let me alone  what hed like to take it for lord john at this point saw his way to remark is something in the nature of a hundred thousand  a hundred thousand cried his astonished friend  quite i dare say a hundred thousandthe young man enjoyed clearly handling even by the lips so round a sum  lady sandgate disclaimed however with agility any appearance of having gaped why havent you yet realised theign that those are the american figures  his lordship looked at her fixedly and then did the same by lord john after which he waited a little ive nothing to do with the american figureswhich seem to me if you press me you know quite intolerably vulgar  well id be as vulgar as anybody for a hundred thousand lady sandgate hastened to proclaim  didnt he let us know at dedborough lord john asked of the master of that seat that he had no use as he said for lower values  ive heard him remark myself said their companion rising to the monstrous memory that he wouldnt take a cheap pictureeven though a handsome oneas a present  and does he call the thing round the corner a cheap picture the proprietor of the work demanded  lord john threw up his arms with a grin of impatience all he wants to do dont you see is to prevent your making it one  lord theign glared at this imputation to him of a low ductility i offered the thing as it was at an estimate worthy of itand of me  my dear reckless friend his young adviser protested you named no figure at all when it came to the point  it didnt come to the point nothing came to the point but that i put a moretto on view as a thing yes perfectlylord theign accepted the reminding gestureon which a rich american had an eye and in which he had so to speak an interest that was what i wanted and so we left itparting each of us ready but neither of us bound  ah mr benders bound as hed say lady sandgate interposedbound to make you swallow the enormous luscious plum that your appetite so morbidly rejects  my appetite as morbid as you likeher old friend had shrewdly turned on heris my own affair and if the fellow must deal in enormities i warn him to carry them elsewhere  lord john plainly by this time was quite exasperated at the absurdity of him but how cant you see that its only a plum as she says for a plum and an eye for an eyesince the picture itself with this huge ventilation is now quite a different affair  how the deuce a different affair when just what the man himself confesses is that in spite of all the chatter of the prigs and pedants theres no really established ground for treating it as anything but the same on which as having so unanswerably spoken lord theign shook himself free again in his high petulance and moved restlessly to where the passage to the other room appeared to offer his nerves an issue all moreover to the effect of suggesting to us that something still other than what he had said might meanwhile work in him behind and beneath that quantity the spectators of his trouble watched him for the time in uncertainty and with a mute but associated comment on the perversity and oddity he had so suddenly developed lord john giving a shrug of almost bored despair and lady sandgate signalling caution and tact for their action by a finger flourished to her lips and in fact at once proceeding to apply these arts the subject of her attention had still remained as in worried thought he had even mechanically taken up a book from a tablewhich he then after an absent glance at it tossed down  youre so detached from reality you adorable dreamer she beganand unless you stick to that you might as well have done nothing what you call the pedantry and priggishness and all the rest of it is exactly what poor breckenridge asked almost on his knees wonderful man to be allowed to pay you for since even if the meddlers and chatterers havent settled anything for those who knowthough which of the elect themselves after all does seem to knowits a great service rendered him to have started such a hare to run  lord john took freedom to throw off very much the same idea certainly his connection with the whole question and agitation makes no end for his glory  it didnt that remark bring their friend back to him but it at least made his indifference flash with derision his glorymr benders glory why they quite universally loathe himjudging by the stuff they print  oh hereas a corrupter of our morals and a promoter of our decay even though so many are flat on their faces to himyes but its another affair over there where the eagle screams like a thousand steamwhistles and the newspapers flap like the leaves of the forest there hell be if youll only let him the biggest thing going since sound in that air seems to mean size and size to be all that counts if he said of the thing as you recognise lord john went on its going to be a mantovano why you can bet your life that it isthat it has got to be some kind of a one  his fellowguest at this drew nearer again irritated you would have been sure by the unconscious infelicity of the pairworked up to something quite openly wilful and passionate no kind of a furious flaunting one under my patronage that i can prevent my boy the dedborough picture in the marketowing to horrid little circumstances that regard myself aloneis the dedborough picture at a decent sufficient civilised dedborough price and nothing else whatever which i beg you will take as my last word on the subject  lord john trying whether he could take it momentarily mingled his hushed state with that of their hostess to whom he addressed a helpless look after which however he appeared to find that he could only reassert himself may i nevertheless reply that i think youll not be able to prevent anythingsince the discussed object will completely escape your control in new york  and almost any discussed objectlady sandgate rose to the occasion alsois in new york by what one hears easily worth a hundred thousand  lord theign looked from one of them to the other i sell the man a hundred thousand worth of swagger and advertisement and of fraudulent swagger and objectionable advertisement at that  welllord john was but briefly baffledwhen the pictures his you cant help its doing what it can and what it will for him anywhere  then it isnt his yet the elder man retortedand i promise you never will be if he has sent you to me with his big drum  lady sandgate turned sadly on this to her associate in patience as if the case were now really beyond them yes how indeed can it ever become his if theign simply wont let him pay for it  her question was unanswerable its the first time in all my life ive known a man feel insulted in such a piece of business by happening not to be in the usual way more or less swindled  theign is unable to take it in her ladyship explained thatas ive heard it said of all these moneymonsters of the new typebender simply cant afford not to be cited and celebrated as the biggest buyer who ever lived  ah cited and celebrated at my expensesay it at once and have it over that i may enjoy what you all want to do to me  the dear mans inimitableat his expense it was more than lord john could bear as he fairly flung himself off in his derisive impotence and addressed his wail to lady sandgate  yes at my expense is exactly what i mean lord theign asseveratedat the expense of my modest claim to regulate my behaviour by my own standards there you perfectly are about the man and its precisely what i saythat hes to hustle and harry me because hes a moneymonster which i never for a moment dreamed of please understand when i let you john thrust him at me as a pecuniary resource at dedborough i didnt put my property on view that he might blow about it  no if you like it lady sandgate returned but you certainly didnt so arrangeshe seemed to think her point somehow would helpthat you might blow about it yourself  nobody wants to blow lord john more stoutly interposed either hot or cold i take it but i really dont see the harm of benders liking to be known for the scale of his transactionsactual or merely imputed even if you will since that scale is really so magnificent  lady sandgate half accepted half qualified this plea the only question perhaps is why he doesnt try for some precious work that somebodyless delicious than dear theigncan be persuaded on bended knees to accept a hundred thousand for  try for oneher younger visitor took it up while her elder more attentively watched him that was exactly what he did try for when he pressed you so hard in vain for the great sir joshua  oh well he mustnt come back to thatmust he theign her ladyship cooed  that personage failed to reply so that lord john went on unconscious apparently of the still more suspicious study to which he exposed himself besides which there are no things of that magnitude knocking about dont you knowtheyve got to be worked up first if theyre to reach the grand publicity of the figure would you mind he continued to his noble monitor an agreement on some such basis as thisthat you shall resign yourself to the biggest equivalent youll squeamishly consent to take if its at the same time the smallest hell squeamishly consent to offer but that that done you shall leave him free  lady sandgate took it up straight rounding it off as their companion only waited leave him free to talk about the sum offered and the sum taken as practically one and the same  ah you know lord john discriminated he doesnt talk so much himselftheres really nothing blatant or crude about poor bender its the rate at whichby the very way hes fixed an awful way indeed i grant youa perfect army of reporterwretches close at his heels are always talking for him and of him  lord theign spoke hereupon at last with the air as of an impulse that had been slowly gathering force you talk for him my dear chap pretty well you urge his case my honour quite as if you were assured of a commission on the jobon a fine ascending scale has he put you up to that proposition eh do you get a handsome percentage and are you to make a good thing of it  the young man coloured under this stinging pleasantrywhether from a good conscience affronted or from a bad one made worse but he otherwise showed a bold front only bending his eyes a moment on his watch as hes to come to you himselfand i dont know why the mischief he doesnt comehe will answer you that graceful question  will he answer it lord theign asked with the veracity that the suggestion youve just made on his behalf represents him as so beautifully adhering to on which he again quite fiercely turned his back and recovered his detachment the others giving way behind him to a blanker dismay  lord john in spite of this however pumped up a tone i dont see why you should speak as if i were urging some abomination  then ill tell you whyand lord theign was upon him again for the purpose because i had rather give the cursed thing away outright and for good and all than that it should hang out there another day in the interest of such equivocations  lady sandgates dismay yielded to her wonder and her wonder apparently in turn to her amusement give it away my dear friend to a man who only longs to smother you in gold  her dear friend however had lost patience with her levity give it awayjust for a luxury of protest and a stoppage of chatterto some cause as unlike as possible that of mr benders power of sound and his splendid reputation to the public to the authorities to the thingumbob to the nation  lady sandgate broke into horror while lord john stood sombre and stupefied ah my dear creature youve flights of extravagance  one things very certain lord theign quite heedlessly pursuedthat the thought of my property on view there does give intolerably on my nerves more and more every minute that im conscious of it so that hang it if one thinks of it why shouldnt i for my relief do again damme what i likethat is bang the door in their faces have the show immediately stopped he turned with the attraction of this idea from one of his listeners to the other its my showit isnt benders surelyand i can do just as i choose with it  ah but isnt that the very pointand lady sandgate put it to lord john isnt it benders show much more than his  her invoked authority however in answer to this made but a motion of disappointment and disgust at so much rank follywhile lord theign on the other hand followed up his happy thought then if its benders show or if he claims it is theres all the more reason and it took his lordships inspiration no longer to flower see here johndo this go right round there this moment please and tell them from me to shut straight down  shut straight down the young man abhorrently echoed  stop it tonightwind it up and end it see the more the entertainer of that vision held it there the more charm it clearly took on for him have the picture removed from view and the incident closed  you seriously ask that of me poor lord john quavered  why in the world shouldnt i its a jolly lot less than you asked of me a month ago at dedborough  what then am i to say to them lord john spoke but after a long moment during which he had only looked hard andan observer might even then have feltominously at his taskmaster  that personage replied as if wholly to have done with the matter say anything that comes into your clever head i dont really see that theres anything else for you lady sandgate sighed to the messenger who gave no sign save of positive stiffness  the latter seemed still to weigh his displeasing obligation then he eyed his friend significantlyalmost portentously those are absolutely your sentiments  those are absolutely my sentimentsand lord theign brought this out as with the force of a physical push  very well then but the young man indulging in a final a fairly sinister study of such a dealer in the arbitrary made sure of the extent whatever it was of his own wrong not one more day  lord theign only waved him away not one more hour  he paused at the door this reluctant spokesman as if for some supreme protest but after another prolonged and decisive engagement with the two pairs of eyes that waited though differently on his performance he clapped on his hat as in the rage of his resentment and departed on his mission     iii  he cant bear to do it poor man lady sandgate ruefully remarked to her remaining guest after lord john had under extreme pressure dashed out to bond street  i dare say notlord theign flushed with the felicity of selfexpression made little of that but he goes too far you see and it clears the airpouah now thereforeand he glanced at the clocki must go to kitty  kittywith what kitty wants lady sandgate opinedwont thank you for that  she never thanks me for anythingand the fact of his resignation clearly added here to his bitterness so its no great loss  wont you at any rate his hostess asked wait for bender  his lordship cast it to the winds what have i to do with him now  why surely if hell accept your own price  lord theign thoughthe wondered and then as if fairly amused at himself hanged if i know what is my own price after which he went for his hat but theres one thing he remembered as he came back with it wheres my too too unnatural daughter  if you mean grace and really want her ill send and find out  not nowhe bethought himself but does she see that chatterbox  mr crimble yes she sees him  he kept his eyes on her then how far has it gone  lady sandgate overcame an embarrassment well not even yet i think so far as theyd like  theyd likeheaven save the markto marry  i suspect them of it what line if it should come to that she asked would you then take  he was perfectly prompt the line that for grace its simply ignoble  the force of her deprecation of such language was qualified by tact ah darling as dreadful as that  he could but view the possibility with dark resentment it lets us so downfrom what weve always been and done so down down down that im amazed you dont feel it  oh i feel theres still plenty to keep you up she soothingly laughed  he seemed to consider this vague amountwhich he apparently judged however not so vast as to provide for the whole yearning of his nature well my dear he thus more blandly professed i shall need all the extra agrément that your affection can supply  if nothing could have been on this richer response nothing could at the same time have bee more pleasing than her modesty ah my affectionate theign is as i think you know a fountain always in flood but in any more worldly element than thatas youve ever seen for yourselfa poor strand with my own sad affairs a broken reed not great as they used so finely to call it you arewith the natural sense of greatness and for supreme support the instinctive grand man doing and taking things  he sighed none the less he groaned with his thoughts of trouble for the strain he foresaw on these resolutions if you mean that i hold up my head on higher grounds i grant that i always have but how much longer possible when my children commit such vulgarities why in the name of goodness are such children what the devil has got into them and is it really the case that when grace offers as a proof of her license and a specimen of her taste a soninlaw as you tell me im in danger of helplessly to swallow the dose  do you find mr crimble lady sandgate as if there might really be something to say so utterly out of the question  i found him on the two occasions before i went away in the last degree offensive and outrageous but even if he charged one and ones poor dear decent old defences with less rabid a fury everything about him would forbid that kind of relation  what kind of relation if any hughs deficiencies might still render thinkable lord theign was kept from going on to mention by the voice of mr gotch who had thrown open the door to the not altogether assured sound of mr breckenridge bender the guest in possession gave a cry of impatience but lady sandgate said coming up  if his lordship will see him  oh hes beyond his time his lordship pronouncedi cant see him now  ah but mustnt youand maynt i then she waited however for no response to signify to her servant let him come and her companion could but exhale a groan of reluctant accommodation as if he wondered at the point she made of it it enlightened him indeed perhaps a little that she went on while gotch did her bidding does the kind of relation youd be condemned to with mr crimble let you down down down as you say more than the relation youve been having with mr bender  lord theign had for it the most uninforming of stares do you mean dont i hate em equally both  she cut his further reply short however by a hush of warningmr bender was there and his introducer had left them  lord theign full of his purpose of departure sacrificed hereupon little to ceremony ive but a moment to my regret to give you mr bender and if youve been unavoidably detained as you great bustling people are so apt to be it will perhaps still be soon enough for your comfort to hear from me that ive just given order to close our exhibition from the present hour on sirhe put it with the firmness required to settle the futility of an appeal  mr benders large surprise lost itself however promptly enough in mr benders larger ease why do you really mean it lord theignremoving already from view a work that gives innocent gratification to thousands  well said his lordship curtly if thousands have seen it ive done what i wanted and if theyve been gratified im contentand invite you to be  mr bender showed more keenness for this richer implication in other words its i who may remove the picture  wellif youll take it on my estimate  but what lord theign all this time mr bender almost pathetically pleaded is your estimate  the parting guest had another pause which prolonged itself after he had reached the door in a deep solicitation of their hostesss conscious eyes this brief passage apparently inspired his answer lady sandgate will tell you the door closed behind him  the charming woman smiled then at her other friend whose comprehensive presence appeared now to demand of her some account of these strange proceedings he means that your own valuation is much too shockingly high  but how can i know how much unless i find out what hell take the great collectors spirit had in spite of its volume clearly not reached its limit of expansion is he crazily waiting for the thing to be proved not what mr crimble claims  no hes waiting for nothingsince he holds that claim demolished by pappendicks tremendous negative which you wrote to tell him of  vast undeveloped and suddenly grave mr benders countenance showed like a barren tract under a black cloud i wrote to report fair and square on pappendick but to tell him id take the picture just the same negative and all  ah but take it in that way not for what it is but for what it isnt  we know nothing about what it isnt said mr bender after all that has happenedweve only learned a little better every day what it is  you mean his companion asked the biggest bone of artistic contention  yeshe took it from herthe biggest that has been thrown into the arena for quite a while i guess i can do with it for that  lady sandgate on this after a moment renewed her personal advance it was as if she had now made sure of the soundness of her main bridge well if its the biggest bone i wont touch it ill leave it to be mauled by my betters but since his lordship has asked me to name a price dear mr bender ill name oneand as you prefer big prices ill try to make it suit you only it wont be for the portrait of a person nobody is agreed about the whole world is agreed you know about my greatgrandmother  oh shucks lady sandgateand her visitor turned from her with the hunch of overcharged shoulders  but she apparently felt that she held him or at least that even if such a conviction might be fatuous she must now put it to the touch youve been delivered into my handstoo charmingly and you wont really pretend that you dont recognise that and in fact rather like it  he faced about to her again as to a case of coolness unparalleledthough indeed with a quick lapse of real interest in the question of whether he had been artfully practised upon an indifference to bad debts or peculation like that of some huge hotel or other business involving a margin for waste he could afford he could work waste too clearlyand what was it that term you might have felt him ask but a mean measure anyway quite as the artful opposed to his larger game would be the hiding and pouncing of children at play do i gather that those uncanny words of his were just meant to put me off he inquired and then as she but boldly and smilingly shrugged repudiating responsibility look here lady sandgate aint you honestly going to help me he pursued  this engaged her sincerity without affecting her gaiety mr bender mr bender ill help you if youll help me  youll really get me something from him to go on with  ill get you something from him to go on with  thats all i askto get that then i can move the way i want but without it im held up  you shall have it she replied if i in turn may look to you for a trifle on account  well he dryly gloomed at her what do you call a trifle  i meanshe waited but an instantwhat you would feel as one  that wont do you havent the least idea lady sandgate he earnestly said how i feel at these foolish times ive never got used to them yet  ah dont you understand she pressed that if i give you an advantage im completely at your mercy  well what mercy he groaned do you deserve  she waited a little brightly composedthen she indicated her inner shrine the whereabouts of her precious picture go and look at her again and youll see  his protest was large but so after a moment was his compliancehis heavy advance upon the other room from just within the doorway of which the great lawrence was serenely visible mr bender gave it his eyes once morethough after the fashion verily of a man for whom it had now no freshness of a glamour no shade of a secret then he came back to his hostess do you call giving me an advantage squeezing me by your sweet modesty for less than i may possibly bear  how can i say fairer she returned than that with my backing about the other picture which ive passed you my word for thrown in ill resign myself to whatever you may be disposedcharacteristicallyto give for this one  if its a question of resignation said mr bender you mean of course what i may be disposedcharacteristicallynot to give  she played on him for an instant all her radiance yes then you dear sharp rich thing  and you take in i assume he pursued that im just going to lean on you for what i want with the full weight of a determined man  well she laughed i promise you ill thoroughly obey the direction of your pressure  all right then and he stopped before her in his unrest monumentally pledged yet still more massively immeasurable howll you have it  she bristled as with all the possible beautiful choices then she shed her selection as a heaving fruittree might have dropped some round ripeness it was for her friend to pick up his plum and his privilege will you write a cheque  yes if you want it right away to which however he added clapping vainly a breastpocket but my chequebooks down in my car  at the door she scarce required his assent to touch a bell i can easily send for it and she threw off while they waited its so sweet your flying round with your chequebook  he put it with promptitude another way it flies round pretty well with mr  mr benders chequebookin his car she went on to gotch who had answered her summons  the owner of the interesting object further instructed him youll find in the pocket a large red morocco case  very good sir said gotchbut with another word for his mistress lord john would like to know  lord johns there she interrupted  gotch turned to the open door here he is my lady  she accommodated herself at once under mr benders eye to the complication involved in his lordships presence its he who went round to bond street  mr bender stared but saw the connection to stop the show and then as the young man was already there youve stopped the show  its on more than ever lord john responded while gotch retired a hurried flurried breathless lord john strikingly different from the backward messenger she had lately seen despatched but theign should be herehe addressed her excitedly i announce you a call from the prince  the princeshe gasped as for the burden of the honour he follows you  mr bender with an eagerness and a candour there was no mistaking recognised on behalf of his ampler action a world of associational advantage and auspicious possibility is the prince after the thing  lord john remained in spite of this challenge conscious of nothing but his message he was there with mackintoshto see and admire the picture which he thinks by the way a mantovano pure and simpleand did me the honour to remember me when he heard me report to mackintosh in his presence the sentiments expressed to me here by our noble friend and of which embarrassed though i doubtless was the young man pursued to lady sandgate i gave as clear an account as i could he was so delighted with it that he declared they mustnt think then of taking the thing off but must on the contrary keep putting it forward for all its worth and he would come round and congratulate and thank theign and explain him his reasons  their hostess cast about for a sign why theign is at kittys worse luck the prince calls on him here  he calls you see on you my ladyat fivefortyfive and graciously desired me so to put it you  hes very kind butshe took in her conditionim not even dressed  youll have timethe young man was a comfortwhile i rush to berkeley square and pardon me benderthough its so nearif i just bag your car  thats thats it take his carlady sandgate almost swept him away  you may use my car all right mr bender contributedbut what i want to know is what the mans after  the man what man his friend scarce paused to ask  the prince thenif you allow he is a man is he after my picture  lord john vividly disclaimed authority if youll wait my dear fellow youll see  oh why should he wait burst from their cautious companiononly to be caught up however in the next breath so swift her gracious revolution wait wait indeed mr benderi wont give you up for any prince with which she appealed again to lord john he wants to congratulate  on theigns decision as ive told youwhich i announced to mackintosh by theigns extraordinary order under his highnesss nose and which his highness by the same token took up like a shot  her face as she bethought herself was convulsed as by some quick perception of what her informant must have done and what therefore the princes interest rested on all however to the effect given their actual company of her at once dodging and covering that issue the decision to remove the picture  lord john also observed a discretion he wouldnt hear of such a thingsays it must stay stock still so there you are  this determined in mr bender a not unnatural in fact quite a clamorous series of questions but where are we and what has the prince to do with lord theigns decision when thats all im here for what in thunder is lord theigns decisionwhat was his extraordinary order  lord john too long detained and his hand now on the door put off this solicitor as he had already been put off lady sandgate you tell him i rush  mr bender saw him vanish but all to a greater bewilderment what the h then i beg your pardon is he talking about and what sentiments did he report round there that lord theign had been expressing  his hostess faced it not otherwise than if she had resolved not to recognise the subject of his curiosityfor fear of other recognitions they put everything on me my dear manbut i havent the least idea  he looked at her askance then why does the fellow say you have  much at a loss for the moment she yet found her way because the fellows so agog that he doesnt know what he says in addition to which she was relieved by the reappearance of gotch who bore on a salver the object he had been sent for and to which he duly called attention  the large red morocco case  lady sandgate fairly jumped at it your blessed chequebook lay it on my desk she said to gotch though waiting till he had departed again before she resumed to her visitor mightnt we conclude before he comes  the prince mr benders imagination had strayed from the ground to which she sought to lead it back and it but vaguely retraced its steps will he want your greatgrandmother  well he may when he sees her lady sandgate laughed and theign when he comes will give you on his own question i feel sure every information shall i fish it out for you she encouragingly asked beside him by her secretarydesk at which he had arrived under her persuasive guidance and where she sought solidly to establish him opening out the gilded crimson case for his employ so that he had but to help himself what enormous cheques you can never draw one for twopoundten  thats exactly what you deserve i should do he remained after this solemnly still however like some highpriest circled with ceremonies in consonance with which the next moment both her hands held out to him the open and immaculate page of the oblong series much as they might have presented a royal infant at the christeningfont  he failed in his preoccupation to receive it so she placed it before him on the table coming away with a brave gay well i leave it to you she had not restlessly revolving kept her discreet distance for many minutes before she found herself almost face to face with the recurrent gotch upright at the door with a fresh announcement  mr crimble pleasefor lady grace  mr crimble againshe took it discomposedly  it reached mr bender at the secretary but to a different effect mr crimble why hes just the man i want to see  gotch turning to the lobby had only to make way for him here he is my lady  then tell her ladyship  she has come down said gotch while hugh arrived and his companion withdrew and while lady grace reaching the scene from the other quarter emerged in bright equipmentin her hat scarf and gloves     iv  these young persons were thus at once confronted across the room and the girl explained her preparation i was listening hardfor your knock and your voice  then know that thank god its all righthugh was breathless jubilant radiant  a mantovano she delightedly cried  a mantovano he proudly gave back  a mantovanoit carried even lady sandgate away  a mantovanoa sure thing mr bender jumped up from his business all gaping attention to hugh  ive just left our blest bardi said that young manwho hasnt the shadow of a doubt and is delighted to publish it everywhere  will he publish it right here to me mr bender hungrily asked  well hugh smiled you can try him  but try him how where the great collector straining to instant action cast about for his hat where is he hey  dont you wish id tell you hugh in his personal elation almost cynically answered  wont you wait for the prince lady sandgate had meanwhile asked of her friend but had turned more inspectingly to lady grace before he could reply my dear childthough youre lovelyare you sure youre ready for him  for the princethe girl was vague is he coming  at fivefortyfive with which she consulted her bracelet watch but only at once to wail for alarm ah it is that and im not dressed she hurried off through the other room  mr bender quite accepting her retreat addressed himself again unabashed to hugh its your blest bardi i want firstill take the prince after  the young man clearly could afford indulgence now then i left him at longs hotel  why right near ill come back and mr benders flight was on the wings of optimism  but it all gave hugh a quick question for lady grace why does the prince come and what in the worlds happening  my father has suddenly returnedit may have to do with that  the shadow of his surprise darkened visibly to that of his fear maynt it be more than anything else to give you and me his final curse  i dont knowand i think i dont care i dont care she said so long as youre right and as the greatest light of all declares you are  he is the greatesthugh was vividly of that opinion now i could see it as soon as i got there with him the charming creature there before the holy thing and with the place by good luck for those great moments practically to ourselveswithout macintosh to take in what was happening or any one else at all to speak ofit was but a matter of ten minutes he had come he had seen and i had conquered  naturally you hadthe girl hung on him for it and what was happening beyond everything else was that for your original dear divination one of the divinations of geniuswith every creature all these ages so stupidyou were being baptized on the spot a great man  well he did let poor pappendick have it at leasthe doesnt think hes one that that eminent judge couldnt even with such a leg up rise to my level or seize my point and if you really want to know hugh went on in his gladness what for us has most particularly and preciously taken place it is that in his opinion for my career  your reputation she cried blazes out and your fortunes made  he did a happy violence to his modesty well bardi adores intelligence and takes off his hat to me  then you need take off yours to nobodysuch was lady graces proud opinion but i should like to take off mine to him she added which i seem to have put onto get out and away with youexpressly for that  hugh as he looked her over took it up in bliss ah well go forth together to him thenthanks to your happy splendid impulseand youll back him gorgeously up in the good he thinks of me  his friend yet had on this a sombre second thought the only thing is that our awful american  but he warned her with a raised hand not to speak of our awful briton  for the door had opened from the lobby admitting lord theign unattended who at sight of his daughter and her companion pulled up and held them a minute in reprehensive viewall at least till hugh undauntedly indeed quite cheerfully greeted him  since you find me again in your path my lord its because ive a small but precious document to deliver you if youll allow me to do so which i feel it important myself to place in your hand he drew from his breast a pocketbook and extracted thence a small unsealed envelope retaining the latter a trifle helplessly in his hand while lord theign only opposed to this demonstration an unmitigated blankness he went none the less bravely on i mentioned to you the last time we somewhat infelicitously met that i intended to appeal to another and probably more closely qualified artistic authority on the subject of your socalled moretto and i in fact saw the picture half an hour ago with bardi of milan who there in presence of it did absolute did ideal justice as i had hoped to the claim ive been making i then went with him to his hotel close at hand where he dashed me off this brief and rapid but quite conclusive declaration which if youll be so good as to read it will enable you perhaps to join us in regarding the vexed question as settled  his lordship having faced this speech without a sign rested on the speaker a somewhat more confessed intelligence then looked hard at the offered note and hard at the floorall to avert himself actively afterward and with his head a good deal elevated add to his distance as it were from every one and everything so indelicately thrust on his attention this movement had an ambiguous makeshift air yet his companions under the impression of it exchanged a hopeless look his daughter none the less lifted her voice if you wont take what he has for you from mr crimble father will you take it from me and then as after some apparent debate he appeared to decide to heed her it may be so long again she said before youve a chance to do a thing i ask  the chance will depend on yourself he returned with high dry emphasis but he held out his hand for the note hugh had given her and with which she approached him and though face to face they seemed more separated than brought near by this contact without commerce she turned away on one side when he had taken the missive as hugh had turned away on the other lord theign drew forth the contents of the envelope and broodingly and inexpressively read the few lines after which as having done justice to their sense he thrust the paper forth again till his daughter became aware and received it she restored it to her friend while her father dandled off anew but coming round this time almost as by a circuit of the room and meeting hugh who took advantage of it to repeat by a frank gesture his offer of bardis attestation lord theign passed with the young man on this a couple of mute minutes of the same order as those he had passed with lady grace in the same connection their eyes dealt deeply with their eyesbut to the effect of his lordships accepting the gift which after another minute he had slipped into his breastpocket it was not till then that he brought out a curt but resonant thank you while the others awaited his further pleasure he again bethought himselfthen he addressed lady grace i must let mr bender know  mr bender hugh interposed does know hes at the present moment with the author of that note at longs hotel  then i must now write himand his lordship while he spoke and from where he stood looked in refined disconnectedness out of the window  will you write thereand his daughter indicated lady sandgates desk at which we have seen mr bender so importantly seated  lord theign had a start at her again speaking to him but he bent his view on the convenience awaiting him and then as to have done with so tiresome a matter took advantage of it he went and placed himself and had reached for paper and a pen when struck apparently with the display of some incongruous object he uttered a sharp hallo  you dont find things lady grace askedas remote from him in one quarter of the room as hugh was in another  on the contrary he oddly replied but plainly suppressing any further surprise he committed a few words to paper and put them into an envelope which he addressed and brought away  if you like said hugh urbanely ill carry him that myself  but how do you know what it consists of  i dont know but i risk it  his lordship weighed the proposition in a high impersonal mannerhe even nervously weighed his letter shaking it with one hand upon the fingertips of the other after which as finally to acquit himself of any measurable obligation he allowed hugh by a surrender of the interesting object to redeem his offer of service then youll learn he simply said  and may i learn asked lady grace  you the tone made so light of her that it was barely interrogative  may i go with him  her father looked at the question as at some cup of supreme bitternessa nasty and now quite regular dose with which his lips were familiar but before which their first movement was always tightly to close with me my lord said hugh at last thoroughly determined they should open and intensifying the emphasis  he had his effect and lord theigns answer addressed to lady grace made indifference very comprehensive you may do what ever you dreadfully like  at this then the girl with an air that seemed to present her choice as absolutely taken reached the door which hugh had come across to open for her  here she paused as for another a last look at her father and her expression seemed to say to him unaidedly that much as she would have preferred to proceed to her act without this gross disorder she could yet find inspiration too in the very difficulty and the old faiths themselves that he left her to struggle with all this made for depth and beauty in her serious young faceas it had indeed a force that not indistinguishably after an instant his lordship lost any wish for longer exposure to his shift of his attitude before she went out was fairly an evasion if the extent of the levity of one of his daughters made him afraid what might have been his present strange sense but a fear of the other from the extent of her gravity lady grace passes from us at any rate in her laced and pearled and plumed slimness and her pale concentrationleaving her friend a moment however with his hand on the door  you thanked me just now for bardis opinion after all hugh said with a smile and it seems to me thatafter all as wellive grounds for thanking you on which he left his benefactor alone  tit for tat there broke from lord theign in his solitude with the young man out of earshot that vague ironic comment which only served his turn none the less till bethinking himself he had gone back to the piece of furniture used for his late scribble and come away from it again the next minute delicately holding a fair slip that we naturally recognise as mr benders forgotten cheque this apparently surprising value he now studied at his ease and to the point of its even drawing from him an articulate what in damnation his speculation dropped before the return of his hostess whose approach through the other room fell upon his ear and whom he awaited after a quick thrust of the cheque into his waistcoat  lady sandgate appeared now in duethat is in the most happily adjustedsplendour she had changed her dress for something smarter and more appropriate to the entertainment of princes tea will be downstairs she said but youre alone  ive just parted her friend replied with grace and mr crimble  parted with themthe ambiguity struck her  well theyve gone out together to flaunt their monstrous connection  you speak she laughed as if it were too grossi theyre surely coming back  back to you if you likebut not to me  ah what are you and i she tenderly argued but one and the same quantity and though you may not as yet absolutely rejoice inwell whatever theyre doing she cheerfully added youll get beautifully used to it  thats just what im afraid ofwhat such horrid matters make of one  at the worst then you seeshe maintained her optimismthe recipient of royal attentions  oh said her companion whom his honour seemed to leave comparatively cold its simply as if the gracious personage were coming to condole  impatient of the lapse of time in any case she assured herself again of the hour well if he only does come  johnthe wretch lord theign returnedwill take care of that he has nailed him and will bring him  what was it then his friend found occasion in the particular tone of this reference to demand what was it that when you sent him off john spoke of you in bond street as specifically intending  oh he saw it now all lucidlyif not rather luridlyand thereby the more tragically he described me in his nasty rage as consistentlywell heroic  his rageshe pieced it sympathetically outat your destroying his cherished credit with bender  lord theign was more and more possessed of this view of the manner of it i had come between him and some profit that he doesnt confess to but that made him viciously and vindictively serve me up there as he caught the chance to the princeand the people  she cast about in her intimate interest as for some closer conception of it by saying that you had remarked here that you offered the people the picture  as a sacrificeyesto morbid though respectable scruples to which he sharply added as if struck with her easy grasp of the scene but i hope youve nothing to call a memory for any such extravagance  lady sandgate waitedthen boldly took her line none whatever you had reacted against benderbut you hadnt gone so far as that  he had it now all vividly before him i had reactedlike a gentleman but it didnt thereby follow that i actedor spokelike a demagogue and my minds a complete blank on the subject of my having done so  so that there only flushes through your conscience she suggested the fact that he has forced your hand  fevered with the sore sense of it his lordship wiped his brow he has played me for spite his damned impertinent trick  she found but after a minutefor it wasnt easythe right word or the least wrong for the situation well even if he did so diabolically commit you you still dont wantdo youto back out  resenting the suggestion which restored all his nobler form lord theign fairly drew himself up when did i ever in all my life back out  never never in all your life of courseshe dashed a bucketful at the flare and the picture after all  the picture after allhe took her up in cold grim gallant despairhas just been pronounced definitely priceless and then to meet her gaping ignorance by mr crimbles latest and apparently greatest adviser who strongly stamps it a mantovano and whose practical affidavit i now possess  poor lady sandgate gaped but the moreshe wondered and yearned definitely priceless  definitely priceless after which he took from its place of lurking considerately unfolding it the goodly slip he had removed from her blottingbook worth even more therefore than what bender so blatantly offers  her attention fell with interest from the distance at which she stood on this confirmatory document her recognition of which was not immediate and is that the affidavit  this is a cheque to your order my lady for ten thousand pounds  ten thousandshe echoed it with a shout  drawn by some hand unknown he went on quietly  unknownagain in her muffled joy she let it sound out  which i found there at your desk a moment ago and thought best in your interest to rescue from accident or neglect even though it be save for the single stroke of a name begun he wound up with his look like a playing searchlight unhappily unsigned  unsignedthe exhibition of her design of her defeat kept shaking her then it isnt good  its a barmecide feast my dearhe had still her kind friend his note of grimness and also his penetration of eye but who is it writes you colossal cheques  and then leaves them lying about her case was so bad that you would have seen how she felt she must do somethingsomething quite splendid she recovered herself she faced the situation with all her bright bravery of expression and aspect conscious you might have guessed that she had never more strikingly embodied on such lines the elegant the beautiful and the true why who can it have been but poor breckenridge too  breckenridge lord theign had his smart echoes what in the world does he owe you money for  it took her but an instant moreshe performed the great repudiation quite as she might be prepared to sweep in the presence impending her grandest curtsey not you sweet suspicious thing for my greatgrandmother and then as his glare didnt fade bender makes my life a burdenfor the love of my precious lawrence  which youre weakly letting him grabnothing could have been finer with this than lord theigns reprobation unless it had been his surprise  she shook her head as in bland compassion for such an idea it isnt a payment you gooseits a bribe ive withstood him these trying weeks as a rock the tempest but he wrote that and left it there the fiend to tempt meto corrupt me  without putting his nameher companion again turned over the cheque  she bethought herself clearly with all her genius as to this anomaly and the light of reality broke he must have been interrupted in the artful acthe sprang up with such a bound at mr crimbles news at once thenfor his interest in ithe hurried off leaving the cheque forgotten and unfinished she smiled more intensely her eyes attached as from fascination to the morsel of paper still handled by her friend but of course on his next visit hell add his great signature  the devil he willand lord theign with the highest spirit tore the crisp token into several pieces which fluttered as worthless now as pure snowflakes to the floor  ay ay ayit drew from her a wail of which the character for its sharp inconsequence was yet comic  this renewed his stare at her do you want to back out i mean from your noble stand  as quickly however she had saved herself id rather do even what youre doingoffer my treasure to the thingumbob  he was touched by this even to sympathy will you then join me in setting the example of a great donation  to the whatdoyoucallit she extravagantly smiled  i call it he said with dignity the national gallery  she closed her eyes as with a failure of breath ah my dear friend  it would convince me he went on insistent and persuasive  of the sincerity of my affectionshe drew nearer to him  it would comfort mehe was satisfied with his own expression yet in a moment when she had come all rustlingly and fragrantly close it would captivate me he handsomely added  it would captivate you it was for her we should have seen to be satisfied with his expression and with our more informed observation of all it was a question of her giving up she would have struck us as subtly bargaining  he gallantly amplified it would peculiarlyby which i mean it would so naturallyunite us  well that was all she wanted then for a complete union with youof fact as well as of fond fancy she smiledtheres nothing even to my one ewe lamb im not ready to surrender  ah we dont surrender he urgedwe enjoy  yes she understood with the glory of our grand gift thrown in  we quite swagger he gravely observedthough even swaggering would after this be dull without you  oh ill swagger with you she cried as if it quite settled and made up for everything and then impatiently as she beheld lord john whom the door had burst open to admit the prince  the princethe young man launched it as a call to arms  they had fallen apart on the irruption the pair discovered but she flashed straight at her lover then we can swagger now  lord theign had reached the open door i meet him below  demurring debating however she stayed him a moment but oughtnt iin my own house  his lordship caught her meaning you mean he may think but he as easily pronounced he shall think the truth and with a kiss of his hand to her he was gone  lord john who had gazed in some wonder at these demonstrations was quickly about to follow but she checked him with an authority she had never before used and which was clearly the next moment to prove irresistible lord john be so good as to stop looking about at the condition of a room on the point of receiving so august a character she observed on the floor the fragments of the torn cheque to which she sharply pointed and please pick up that litter  the end
