scots     preface   the history of the life of every individual who has for any reason attracted extensively the attention of mankind has been written in a great variety of ways by a multitude of authors and persons sometimes wonder why we should have so many different accounts of the same thing the reason is that each one of these accounts is intended for a different set of readers who read with ideas and purposes widely dissimilar from each other among the twenty millions of people in the united states there are perhaps two millions between the ages of fifteen and twentyfive who wish to become acquainted in general with the leading events in the history of the old world and of ancient times but who coming upon the stage in this land and at this period have ideas and conceptions so widely different from those of other nations and of other times that a mere republication of existing accounts is not what they require the story must be told expressly for them the things that are to be explained the points that are to be brought out the comparative degree of prominence to be given to the various particulars will all be different on account of the difference in the situation the ideas and the objects of these new readers compared with those of the various other classes of readers which former authors have had in view it is for this reason and with this view that the present series of historical narratives is presented to the public the author having had some opportunity to become acquainted with the position the ideas and the intellectual wants of those whom he addresses presents the result of his labors to them with the hope that it may be found successful in accomplishing its design     contents    chapter                                                    page

castlerock of dumbartonjourney to dumbartonthe four mariesdeparture from scotland   travelers who go into scotland take a great interest in visiting among other places a certain room in the ruins of an old palace where queen mary was born queen mary was very beautiful but she was very unfortunate and unhappy every body takes a strong interest in her story and this interest attaches in some degree to the room where her sad and sorrowful life was begun  the palace is near a little village called linlithgow the village has but one long street which consists of ancient stone houses north of it is a little lake or rather pond they call it in scotland a loch the palace is between the village and the loch it is upon a beautiful swell of land which projects out into the water there is a very small island in the middle of the loch and the shores are bordered with fertile fields the palace when entire was square with an open space or court in the center there was a beautiful stone fountain in the center of this court and an arched gateway through which horsemen and carriages could ride in the doors of entrance into the palace were on the inside of the court  the palace is now in ruins a troop of soldiers came to it one day in time of war after mary and her mother had left it and spent the night there they spread straw over the floors to sleep upon in the morning when they went away they wantonly set the straw on fire and left it burning and thus the palace was destroyed some of the lower floors were of stone but all the upper floors and the roof were burned and all the woodwork of the rooms and the doors and windowframes since then the palace has never been repaired but remains a melancholy pile of ruins  the room where mary was born had a stone floor the rubbish which has fallen from above has covered it with a sort of soil and grass and weeds grow up all over it it is a very melancholy sight to see the visitors who go into the room walk mournfully about trying to imagine how queen mary looked as an infant in her mothers arms and reflecting on the recklessness of the soldiers in wantonly destroying so beautiful a palace then they go to the window or rather to the crumbling opening in the wall where the window once was and look out upon the loch now so deserted and lonely over their heads it is all open to the sky  marys father was king of scotland at the time that mary was born he was away from home engaged in war with the king of england who had invaded scotland in the battles marys father was defeated and he thought that the generals and nobles who commanded his army allowed the english to conquer them on purpose to betray him this thought overwhelmed him with vexation and anguish he pined away under the acuteness of his sufferings and just after the news came to him that his daughter mary was born he died thus mary became an orphan and her troubles commenced at the very beginning of her days she never saw her father and her father never saw her her mother was a french lady her name was mary of guise her own name was mary stuart but she is commonly called mary queen of scots  as mary was her fathers only child of course when he died she became queen of scotland although she was only a few days old it is customary in such a case to appoint some distinguished person to govern the kingdom in the name of the young queen until she grows up such a person is called a regent marys mother wished to be the regent until mary became of age  it happened that in those days as now the government and people of france were of the catholic religion england on the other hand was protestant there is a great difference between the catholic and the protestant systems the catholic church though it extends nearly all over the world is banded together as the reader is aware under one manthe popewho is the great head of the church and who lives in state at rome the catholics have in all countries many large and splendid churches which are ornamented with paintings and images of the virgin mary and of christ they perform great ceremonies in these churches the priests being dressed in magnificent costumes and walking in processions with censers of incense burning as they go the protestants on the other hand do not like these ceremonies they regard such outward acts of worship as mere useless parade and the images as idols they themselves have smaller and plainer churches and call the people together in them to hear sermons and to offer up simple prayers  in the time of mary england was protestant and france was catholic while scotland was divided though most of the people were protestants the two parties were very much excited against each other and often persecuted each other with extreme cruelty sometimes the protestants would break into the catholic churches and tear down and destroy the paintings and the images and the other symbols of worship all which the catholics regarded with extreme veneration this exasperated the catholics and when they became powerful in their turn they would seize the protestants and imprison them and sometimes burn them to death by tying them to a stake and piling fagots of wood about them and then setting the heap on fire  queen marys mother was a catholic and for that reason the people of scotland were not willing that she should be regent there were one or two other persons moreover who claimed the office one was a certain nobleman called the earl of arran he was a protestant the earl of arran was the next heir to the crown so that if mary had died in her infancy he would have been king he thought that this was a reason why he should be regent and govern the kingdom until mary became old enough to govern it herself many other persons however considered this rather a reason why he should not be regent for they thought he would be naturally interested in wishing that mary should not live since if she died he would himself become king and that therefore he would not be a safe protector for her however as the earl of arran was a protestant and as marys mother was a catholic and as the protestant interest was the strongest it was at length decided that arran should be the regent and govern the country until mary should be of age  it is a curious circumstance that marys birth put an end to the war between england and scotland and that in a very singular way the king of england had been fighting against marys father james for a long time in order to conquer the country and annex it to england and now that james was dead and mary had become queen with arran for the regent it devolved on arran to carry on the war but the king of england and his government now that the young queen was born conceived of a new plan the king had a little son named edward about four years old who of course would become king of england in his place when he should himself die now he thought it would be best for him to conclude a peace with scotland and agree with the scottish government that as soon as mary was old enough she should become edwards wife and the two kingdoms be united in that way  the name of this king of england was henry the eighth he was a very headstrong and determined man this his plan might have been a very good one it was certainly much better than an attempt to get possession of scotland by fighting for it but he was very far from being as moderate and just as he should have been in the execution of his design the first thing was to ascertain whether mary was a strong and healthy child for if he should make a treaty of peace and give up all his plans of conquest and then if mary after living feebly a few years should die all his plans would fail to satisfy him on this point they actually had some of the infants clothes removed in the presence of his embassador in order that the embassador might see that her form was perfect and her limbs vigorous and strong the nurse did this with great pride and pleasure marys mother standing by the nurses name was janet sinclair the embassador wrote back to henry the king of england that little mary was as goodly a child as he ever saw so king henry viii was confirmed in his design of having her for the wife of his son  king henry viii accordingly changed all his plans he made a peace with the earl of arran he dismissed the prisoners that he had taken and sent them home kindly if he had been contented with kind and gentle measures like these he might have succeeded in them although there was of course a strong party in scotland opposed to them marys mother was opposed to them for she was a catholic and a french lady and she wished to have her daughter become a catholic as she grew up and marry a french prince all the catholics in scotland took her side still henrys plans might have been accomplished perhaps if he had been moderate and conciliating in the efforts which he made to carry them into effect  but henry viii was headstrong and obstinate he demanded that mary since she was to be his sons wife should be given up to him to be taken into england and educated there under the care of persons whom he should appoint he also demanded that the parliament of scotland should let him have a large share in the government of scotland because he was going to be the fatherinlaw of the young queen the parliament would not agree to either of these plans they were entirely unwilling to allow their little queen to be carried off to another country and put under the charge of so rough and rude a man then they were unwilling too to give him any share of the government during marys minority both these measures were entirely inadmissible they would if adopted have put both the infant queen of scotland and the kingdom itself completely in the power of one who had always been their greatest enemy  henry finding that he could not induce the scotch government to accede to these plans gave them up at last and made a treaty of marriage between his son and mary with the agreement that she might remain in scotland until she was ten years old and that then she should come to england and be under his care  all this time while these grand negotiations were pending between two mighty nations about her marriage little mary was unconscious of it all sometimes reposing quietly in janet sinclairs arms sometimes looking out of the windows of the castle of linlithgow to see the swans swim upon the lake and sometimes perhaps creeping about upon the palace floor where the earls and barons who came to visit her mother clad in armor of steel looked upon her with pride and pleasure the palace where she lived was beautifully situated as has been before remarked on the borders of a lake it was arranged somewhat in the following manner  illustration plan of the palace of linlithgow  a room where mary was born b entrance through great gates c bowwindow projecting toward the water d den where they kept a lion tt trees  there was a beautiful fountain in the center of the courtyard where water spouted out from the mouths of carved images and fell into marble basins below the ruins of this fountain and of the images remain there still the den at d was a round pit like a well which you could look down into from above it was about ten feet deep they used to keep lions in such dens near the palaces and castles in those days a lion in a den was a sort of plaything in former times as a parrot or a pet lamb is now this was in keeping with the fierce and warlike spirit of the age if they had a lion there in marys time janet often doubtless took her little charge out to see it and let her throw down food to it from above the den is there now you approach it upon the top of a broad embankment which is as high as the depth of the den so that the bottom of the den is level with the surface of the ground which makes it always dry there is a hole too at the bottom through the wall where they used to put the lion in  the foregoing plan of the buildings and grounds of linlithgow is drawn as maps and plans usually are the upper part toward the north of course the room a where mary was born is on the western side the adjoining engraving represents a view of the palace on this western side the church is seen at the right and the lawn where janet used to take mary out to breathe the air is in the foreground the shore of the lake is very near and winds beautifully around the margin of the promontory on which the palace stands of course the lions den and the ancient avenue of approach to the palace are round upon the other side and out of sight in this view the approach to the palace at the present day is on the southern side between the church and the trees on the right of the picture  illustration palace of linlithgowqueen marys birthplace  mary remained here at linlithgow for a year or two but when she was about nine months old they concluded to have the great ceremony of the coronation performed as she was by that time old enough to bear the journey to stirling castle where the scottish kings and queens were generally crowned the coronation of a queen is an event which always excites a very deep and universal interest among all persons in the realm and there is a peculiar interest felt when as was the case in this instance the queen to be crowned is an infant just old enough to bear the journey there was a very great interest felt in marys coronation the different courts and monarchs of europe sent embassadors to be present at the ceremony and to pay their respects to the infant queen and stirling became for the time being the center of universal attraction  stirling is in the very heart of scotland it is a castle built upon a rock or rather upon a rocky hill which rises like an island out of the midst of a vast region of beautiful and fertile country rich and verdant beyond description beyond the confines of this region of beauty dark mountains rise on all sides and wherever you are whether riding along the roads in the plain or climbing the declivities of the mountains you see stirling castle from every point capping its rocky hill the center and ornament of the broad expanse of beauty which surrounds it  stirling castle is north of linlithgow and is distant about fifteen or twenty miles from it the road to it lies not far from the shores of the frith of forth a broad and beautiful sheet of water the castle as has been before remarked was on the summit of a rocky hill there are precipitous crags on three sides of the hill and a gradual approach by a long ascent on the fourth side at the top of this ascent you enter the great gates of the castle crossing a broad and deep ditch by means of a drawbridge you enter then a series of paved courts with towers and walls around them and finally come to the more interior edifices where the private apartments are situated and where the little queen was crowned  it was an occasion of great pomp and ceremony though mary of course was unconscious of the meaning of it all she was surrounded by barons and earls by embassadors and princes from foreign courts and by the principal lords and ladies of the scottish nobility all dressed in magnificent costumes they held little mary up and a cardinal that is a great dignitary of the roman catholic church placed the crown upon her head half pleased with the glittering show and half frightened at the strange faces which she saw every where around her she gazed unconsciously upon the scene while her mother who could better understand its import was elated with pride and joy  linlithgow and stirling are in the open and cultivated part of scotland all the northern and western part of the country consists of vast masses of mountains with dark and somber glens among them which are occupied solely by shepherds and herdsmen with their flocks and herds this mountainous region was called the highlands and the inhabitants of it were the highlanders they were a wild and warlike class of men and their country was seldom visited by either friend or foe at the present time there are beautiful roads all through the highlands and stagecoaches and private carriages roll over them every summer to take tourists to see and admire the picturesque and beautiful scenery but in the days of mary the whole region was gloomy and desolate and almost inaccessible  mary remained in linlithgow and stirling for about two years and then as the country was becoming more and more disturbed by the struggles of the great contending partiesthose who were in favor of the catholic religion and alliance with france on the one hand and of those in favor of the protestant religion and alliance with england on the other handthey concluded to send her into the highlands for safety  it was not far into the country of the highlands that they concluded to send her but only into the borders of it there was a small lake on the southern margin of the wild and mountainous country called the lake of menteith in this lake was an island named inchmahome the word inch being the name for island in the language spoken by the highlanders this island which was situated in a very secluded and solitary region was selected as marys place of residence she was about four years old when they sent her to this place several persons went with her to take care of her and to teach her in fact every thing was provided for her which could secure her improvement and happiness her mother did not forget that she would need playmates and so she selected four little girls of about the same age with the little queen herself and invited them to accompany her they were daughters of the noblemen and high officers about the court it is very singular that these girls were all named mary their names in full were as follows       mary beaton      mary fleming      mary livingstone      mary seaton  these with mary stuart which was queen marys name made five girls of four or five years of age all named mary  mary lived two years in this solitary island she had however all the comforts and conveniences of life and enjoyed herself with her four maries very much of course she knew nothing and thought nothing of the schemes and plans of the great governments for having her married when she grew up to the young english prince who was then a little boy of about her own age nor of the angry disputes in scotland to which this subject gave rise it did give rise to very serious disputes marys mother did not like the plan at all as she was herself a french lady and a catholic she did not wish to have her daughter marry a prince who was of the english royal family and a protestant all the catholics in scotland took her side at length the earl of arran who was the regent changed to that side and finally the government being thus brought over gave notice to king henry viii that the plan must be given up as they had concluded on the whole that mary should not marry his son  king henry was very much incensed he declared that mary should marry his son and he raised an army and sent it into scotland to make war upon the scotch again and compel them to consent to the execution of the plan he was at this time beginning to be sick but his sickness instead of softening his temper only made him the more ferocious and cruel he turned against his best friends he grew worse and was evidently about to die but he was so irritable and angry that for a long time no one dared to tell him of his approaching dissolution and he lay restless and wretched and agitated with political animosities upon his dying bed at length some one ventured to tell him that his end was near when he found that he must die he resigned himself to his fate he sent for an archbishop to come and see him but he was speechless when the prelate came and soon afterward expired  the english government however after his death adhered to his plan of compelling the scotch to make mary the wife of his son they sent an army into scotland a great battle was fought and the scotch were defeated the battle was fought at a place not far from edinburgh and near the sea it was so near the sea that the english fired upon the scotch army from their ships and thus assisted their troops upon the shore the armies had remained several days near each other before coming to battle and during all this time the city of edinburgh was in a state of great anxiety and suspense as they expected that their city would be attacked by the english if they should conquer in the battle the english army did in fact advance toward edinburgh after the battle was over and would have got possession of it had it not been for the castle there is a very strong castle in the very heart of edinburgh upon the summit of a rocky hilla  footnote a see the view of edinburgh page 179  these attempts of the english to force the scotch government to consent to marys marriage only made them the more determined to prevent it a great many who were not opposed to it before became opposed to it now when they saw foreign armies in the country destroying the towns and murdering the people they said they had no great objection to the match but that they did not like the mode of wooing they sent to france to ask the french king to send over an army to aid them and promised him that if he would do so they would agree that mary should marry his son his sons name was francis  the french king was very much pleased with this plan he sent an army of six thousand men into scotland to assist the scotch against their english enemies it was arranged also as little mary was now hardly safe among all these commotions even in her retreat in the island of inchmahome to send her to france to be educated there and to live there until she was old enough to be married the same ships which brought the army from france to scotland were to carry mary and her retinue from scotland to france the four maries went with her  they bade their lonely island farewell and traveled south till they came to a strong castle on a high rocky hill on the banks of the river clyde the name of this fortress is dumbarton castle almost all the castles of those times were built upon precipitous hills to increase the difficulties of the enemies in approaching them the rock of dumbarton is a very remarkable one it stands close to the bank of the river there are a great many ships and steamboats continually passing up and down the clyde to and from the great city of glasgow and all the passengers on board gaze with great interest as they sail by on the rock of dumbarton with the castle walls on the sides and the towers and battlements crowning the summit in marys time there was comparatively very little shipping on the river but the french fleet was there waiting opposite the castle to receive mary and the numerous persons who were to go in her trainb  footnote b travelers who visit scotland from this country at the present day usually land first at the close of the voyage across the atlantic at liverpool and there take a glasgow steamer glasgow which is the great commercial city of scotland is on the river clyde this river flows northward to the sea the steamer in ascending the river makes its way with difficulty along the narrow channel which besides being narrow and tortuous is obstructed by boats ships steamers and every other variety of watercraft such as are always going to and fro in the neighborhood of any great commercial emporium  the tourists who stand upon the deck gazing at this exciting scene of life and motion have their attention strongly attracted about half way up the river by this castle of dumbarton which crowns a rocky hill rising abruptly from the waters edge on the north side of the stream it attracts sometimes the more attention from american travelers on account of its being the first ancient castle they see this it likely to be the case if they proceed to scotland immediately on landing at liverpool  mary was escorted from the island where she had been living across the country to dumbarton castle with a strong retinue she was now between five and six years of age she was of course too young to know any thing about the contentions and wars which had distracted her country on her account or to feel much interest in the subject of her approaching departure from her native land she enjoyed the novelty of the scenes through which she passed on her journey she was pleased with the dresses and the arms of the soldiers who accompanied her and with the ships which were floating in the river beneath the walls of the castle of dumbarton when she arrived there she was pleased too to think that wherever she was to go her four maries were to go with her she bade her mother farewell embarked on board the ship which was to receive her and sailed away from her native land not to return to it again for many years     chapter ii  her education in

great event both for scotland and for france in those days kings and queens were even of greater relative importance than they are now and all scotland was interested in the young queens going away from them and all france in expecting her arrival she sailed down the clyde and then passed along the seas and channels which lie between england and ireland these seas though they look small upon the map are really spacious and wide and are often greatly agitated by winds and storms this was the case at the time mary made her voyage the days and nights were tempestuous and wild and the ships had difficulty in keeping in each others company there was danger of being blown upon the coasts or upon the rocks or islands which lie in the way mary was too young to give much heed to these dangers but the lords and commissioners and the great ladies who went to attend her were heartily glad when the voyage was over it ended safely at last after several days of tossing upon the stormy billows by their arrival upon the northern coast of france they landed at a town called brest  the king of france had made great preparations for receiving the young queen immediately upon her landing carriages and horses had been provided to convey herself and the company of her attendants by easy journeys to paris they received her with great pomp and ceremony at every town which she passed through one mark of respect which they showed her was very singular the king ordered that every prison which she passed in her route should be thrown open and the prisoners set free this fact is a striking illustration of the different ideas which prevailed in those days compared with those which are entertained now in respect to crime and punishment crime is now considered as an offense against the community and it would be considered no favor to the community but the reverse to let imprisoned criminals go free in those days on the other hand crimes were considered rather as injuries committed by the community and against the king so that if the monarch wished to show the community a favor he would do it by releasing such of them as had been imprisoned by his officers for their crimes it was just so in the time of our savior when the jews had a custom of having some criminal released to them once a year at the passover by the roman government as an act of favor that is the government was accustomed to furnish by way of contributing its share toward the general festivities of the occasion the setting of a robber and a murderer at liberty  the king of france has several palaces in the neighborhood of paris mary was taken to one of them named st germain this palace which still stands is about twelve miles from paris toward the northwest it is a very magnificent residence and has been for many centuries a favorite resort of the french kings many of them were born in it there are extensive parks and gardens connected with it and a great artificial forest in which the trees were all planted and cultivated like the trees of an orchard mary was received at this palace with great pomp and parade and many spectacles and festivities were arranged to amuse her and the four maries who accompanied her and to impress her strongly with an idea of the wealth and power and splendor of the great country to which she had come  she remained here but a short time and then it was arranged for her to go to a convent to be educated convents were in those days as in fact they are now quite famous as places of education they were situated sometimes in large towns and sometimes in secluded places in the country but whether in town or country the inmates of them were shut up very strictly from all intercourse with the world they were under the care of nuns who had devoted themselves for life to the service these nuns were some of them unhappy persons who were weary of the sorrows and sufferings of the world and who were glad to retire from it to such a retreat as they fancied the convent would be others became nuns from conscientious principles of duty thinking that they should commend themselves to the favor of god by devoting their lives to works of benevolence and to the exercises of religion of course there were all varieties of character among the nuns some of them were selfish and disagreeable others were benevolent and kind  at the convent where mary was sent there were some nuns of very excellent and amiable character and they took a great interest in mary both because she was a queen and because she was beautiful and of a kind and affectionate disposition mary became very strongly attached to these nuns and began to entertain the idea of becoming a nun herself and spending her life with them in the convent it seemed pleasant to her to live there in such a peaceful seclusion in company with those who loved her and whom she herself loved but the king of france and the scottish nobles who had come with her from scotland would of course be opposed to any such plan they intended her to be married to the young prince and to become one of the great ladies of the court and to lead a life of magnificence and splendor they became alarmed therefore when they found that she was imbibing a taste for the life of seclusion and solitude which is led by a nun they decided to take her immediately away  mary bade farewell to the convent and its inmates with much regret and many tears but notwithstanding her reluctance she was obliged to submit if she had not been a queen she might perhaps have had her own way as it was however she was obliged to leave the convent and the nuns whom she loved and to go back to the palaces of the king in which she afterward continued to live sometimes in one and sometimes in another for many years wherever she went she was surrounded with scenes of great gayety and splendor they wished to obliterate from her mind all recollections of the convent and all love of solitude and seclusion they did not neglect her studies but they filled up the intervals of study with all possible schemes of enjoyment and pleasure to amuse and occupy her mind and the minds of her companions her companions were her own four maries and the two daughters of the french king  when mary was about seven years of age that is after she had been two years in france her mother formed a plan to come from scotland to see her her mother had remained behind when mary left scotland as she had an important part to perform in public affairs and in the administration of the government of scotland while mary was away she wanted however to come and see her france too was her own native land and all her relations and friends resided there she wished to see them as well as mary and to revisit once more the palaces and cities where her own early life had been spent in speaking of marys mother we shall call her sometimes the queen dowager the expression queen dowager is the one usually applied to the widow of a king as queen consort is used to denote the wife of a king  this visit of the queen dowager of scotland to her little daughter in france was an event of great consequence and all the arrangements for carrying it into effect were conducted with great pomp and ceremony a large company attended her with many of the scottish lords and ladies among them the king of france too went from paris toward the french coast to meet the party of visitors taking little mary and a large company of attendants with him they went to rouen a large city not far from the coast where they awaited the arrival of marys mother and where they received her with great ceremonies of parade and rejoicing the queen regent was very much delighted to see her little daughter again she had grown two years older and had improved greatly in every respect and tears of joy came into her mothers eyes as she clasped her in her arms the two parties journeyed in company to paris and entered the city with great rejoicings the two queens mother and daughter were the objects of universal interest and attention feasts and celebrations without end were arranged for them and every possible means of amusement and rejoicing were contrived in the palaces of paris of st germains and of fontainebleau marys mother remained in france about a year she then bade mary farewell leaving her at fontainebleau this proved to be a final farewell for she never saw her again  after taking leave of her daughter the queen dowager went before leaving france to see her own mother who was a widow and who was living at a considerable distance from paris in seclusion and in a state of austere and melancholy grief on account of the loss of her husband instead of forgetting her sorrows as she ought to have done and returning calmly and peacefully to the duties and enjoyments of life she had given herself up to inconsolable grief and was doing all she could to perpetuate the mournful influence of her sorrows she lived in an ancient and gloomy mansion of vast size and she had hung all the apartments in black to make it still more desolate and gloomy and to continue the influence of grief upon her mind here the queen dowager found her spending her time in prayers and austerities of every kind making herself and all her family perfectly miserable many persons at the present day act under such circumstances on the same principle and with the same spirit though they do not do it perhaps in precisely the same way  one would suppose that marys mother would have preferred to remain in france with her daughter and her mother and all her family friends instead of going back to scotland where she was as it were a foreigner and a stranger the reason why she desired to go back was that she wished to be made queen regent and thus have the government of scotland in her own hands she would rather be queen regent in scotland than a simple queen mother in france while she was in france she urged the king to use all his influence to have arran resign his regency into her hands and finally obtained writings from him and from queen mary to this effect she then left france and went to scotland going through england on the way the young king of england to whom mary had been engaged by the government when she was an infant in janet sinclairs arms renewed his proposals to the queen dowager to let her daughter become his wife but she told him that it was all settled that she was to be married to the french prince and that it was now too late to change the plan  there was a young gentleman about nineteen or twenty years of age who came from scotland also not far from this time to wait upon mary as her page of honor a page is an attendant above the rank of an ordinary servant whose business it is to wait upon his mistress to read to her sometimes to convey her letters and notes and to carry her commands to the other attendants who are beneath him in rank and whose business it is actually to perform the services which the lady requires a page of honor is a young gentleman who sustains this office in a nominal and temporary manner for a princess or a queen  the name of marys page of honor who came to her now from scotland was sir james melville the only reason for mentioning him thus particularly rather than the many other officers and attendants by whom mary was surrounded was that the service which he thus commenced was continued in various ways through the whole period of marys life we shall often hear of him in the subsequent parts of this narrative he followed mary to scotland when she returned to that country and became afterward her secretary and also her embassador on many occasions he was now quite young and when he landed at brest he traveled slowly to paris in the care of two scotchmen to whose charge he had been intrusted he was a young man of uncommon talents and of great accomplishments and it was a mark of high distinction for him to be appointed page of honor to the queen although he was about nineteen years of age and she was but seven  after the queen regents return to scotland mary went on improving in every respect more and more she was diligent industrious and tractable she took a great interest in her studies she was not only beautiful in person and amiable and affectionate in heart but she possessed a very intelligent and active mind and she entered with a sort of quiet but earnest enthusiasm into all the studies to which her attention was called she paid a great deal of attention to music to poetry and to drawing she used to invent little devices for seals with french and latin mottoes and after drawing them again and again with great care until she was satisfied with the design she would give them to the gemengravers to be cut upon stone seals so that she could seal her letters with them these mottoes and devices can not well be represented in english as the force and beauty of them depended generally upon a double meaning in some word of french or latin which can not be preserved in the translation we shall however give one of these seals which she made just before she left france to return to scotland when we come to that period of her history  the king of france and the lords and ladies who came with mary from scotland contrived a great many festivals and celebrations in the parks and forests and palaces to amuse the queen and the four maries who were with her the daughters of the french king joined also in these pleasures they would have little balls and parties and picnics sometimes in the open air sometimes in the little summerhouses built upon the grounds attached to the palaces the scenes of these festivities were in many cases made unusually joyous and gay by bonfires and illuminations they had water parties on the little lakes and hunting parties through the parks and forests mary was a very graceful and beautiful rider and full of courage sometimes she met with accidents which were attended with some danger once while hunting the stag and riding at full speed with a great company of ladies and gentlemen behind her and before her her dress got caught by the bough of a tree and she was pulled to the ground the horse went on several other riders drove by her without seeing her as she had too much composure and fortitude to attract their attention by outcries and lamentations they saw her however at last and came to her assistance they brought back her horse and smoothing down her hair which had fallen into confusion she mounted again and rode on after the stag as before  notwithstanding all these means of enjoyment and diversion mary was subjected to a great deal of restraint the rules of etiquette are very precise and very strictly enforced in royal households and they were still more strict in those days than they are now the king was very ceremonious in all his arrangements and was surrounded by a multitude of officers who performed every thing by rule as mary grew older she was subjected to greater and greater restraint she used to spend a considerable portion of every day in the apartments of queen catharine the wife of the king of france and the mother of the little francis to whom she was to be married mary and queen catharine did not however like each other very well catharine was a woman of strong mind and of an imperious disposition and it is supposed by some that she was jealous of mary because she was more beautiful and accomplished and more generally beloved than her own daughters the princesses of france at any rate she treated mary in rather a stern and haughty manner and it was thought that she would finally oppose her marriage to francis her son  and yet mary was at first very much pleased with queen catharine and was accustomed to look up to her with great admiration and to feel for her a very sincere regard she often went into the queens apartments where they sat together and talked or worked upon their embroidery which was a famous amusement for ladies of exalted rank in those days mary herself at one time worked a large piece which she sent as a present to the nuns in the convent where she had resided and afterward in scotland she worked a great many things some of which still remain and may be seen in her ancient rooms in the palace of holyrood house she learned this art by working with queen catharine in her apartments when she first became acquainted with catharine on these occasions she used to love her society she admired her talents and her conversational powers and she liked very much to be in her room she listened to all she said watched her movements and endeavored in all things to follow her example  catharine however thought that this was all a pretense and that mary did not really like her but only wished to make her believe that she did so in order to get favor or to accomplish some other selfish end one day she asked her why she seemed to prefer her society to that of her youthful and more suitable companions mary replied in substance the reason was that though with them she might enjoy much she could learn nothing while she always learned from queen catharines conversation something which would be of use to her as a guide in future life one would have thought that this answer would have pleased the queen but it did not she did not believe that it was sincere  on one occasion mary seriously offended the queen by a remark which she made and which was at least incautious kings and queens and in fact all great people in europe pride themselves very much upon the antiquity of the line from which they have descended now the family of queen catharine had risen to rank and distinction within a moderate period and though she was as queen of france on the very pinnacle of human greatness she would naturally be vexed at any remark which would remind her of the recentness of her elevation now mary at one time said in conversation in the presence of queen catharine that she herself was the descendant of a hundred kings this was perhaps true but it brought her into direct comparison with catharine in a point in which the latter was greatly her inferior and it vexed and mortified catharine very much to have such a thing said to her by such a child  mary associated thus during all this time not only with the queen and the princesses but also with the little prince whom she was destined to marry his name was francis but he was commonly called the dauphin which was the name by which the oldest son of the king of france was then and has been since designated the origin of this custom was this about a hundred years before the time of which we are speaking a certain nobleman of high rank who possessed estates in an ancient province of france called dauphiny lost his son and heir he was overwhelmed with affliction at the loss and finally bequeathed all his estates to the king and his successors on condition that the oldest son should bear the title of dauphin the grant was accepted and the oldest son was accordingly so styled from that time forward from generation to generation  the dauphin francis was a weak and feeble child but he was amiable and gentle in his manners and mary liked him she met him often in their walks and rides and she danced with him at the balls and parties given for her amusement she knew that he was to be her husband as soon as she was old enough to be married and he knew that she was to be his wife it was all decided and nothing which either of them could say or do would have any influence on the result neither of them however seem to have had any desire to change the result mary pitied francis on account of his feeble health and liked his amiable and gentle disposition and francis could not help loving mary both on account of the traits of her character and her personal charms  as mary advanced in years she grew very beautiful in some of the great processions and ceremonies the ladies were accustomed to walk magnificently dressed and carrying torches in their hands in one of these processions mary was moving along with the rest through a crowd of spectators and the light from her torch fell upon her features and upon her hair in such a manner as to make her appear more beautiful than usual a woman standing there pressed up nearer to her to view her more closely and seeing how beautiful she was asked her if she was not an angel in those days however people believed in what is miraculous and supernatural more easily than now so that it was not very surprising that one should think in such a case that an angel from heaven had come down to join in the procession  mary grew up a catholic of course all were catholics around her the king and all the royal family were devoted to catholic observances the convent the ceremonies the daily religious observances enjoined upon her the splendid churches which she frequented all tended in their influence to lead her mind away from the protestant religion which prevailed in her native land and to make her a catholic she remained so throughout her life there is no doubt that she was conscientious in her attachment to the forms and to the spirit of the roman church at any rate she was faithful to the ties which her early education imposed upon her and this fidelity became afterward the source of some of her heaviest calamities and woes     chapter iii  the great wedding  1558  hastening the weddingreasons for itattempt to poison marythe guisescatharines jealousycommissioners from

years of age the king of france began to think that it was time for her to be married it is true that she was still very young but there were strong reasons for having the marriage take place at the earliest possible period for fear that something might occur to prevent its consummation at all in fact there were very strong parties opposed to it altogether the whole protestant interest in scotland were opposed to it and were continually contriving plans to defeat it they thought that if mary married a french prince who was of course a catholic she would become wedded to the catholic interest hopelessly and forever this made them feel a most bitter and determined opposition to the plan  in fact so bitter and relentless were the animosities that grew out of this question that an attempt was actually made to poison mary the man who committed this crime was an archer in the kings guard he was a scotch man and his name was stewart his attempt was discovered in time to prevent the accomplishment of his purpose he was tried and condemned they made every effort to induce him to explain the reason which led him to such an act or if he was employed by others to reveal their names but he would reveal nothing he was executed for his crime leaving mankind to conjecture that his motive or that of the persons who instigated him to the deed was a desperate determination to save scotland at all hazards from falling under the influence of papal power  marys mother the queen dowager of scotland was of a celebrated french family called the family of guise she is often herself called in history mary of guise there were other great families in france who were very jealous of the guises and envious of their influence and power they opposed queen marys marriage to the dauphin and were ready to do all in their power to thwart and defeat it queen catharine too who seemed to feel a greater and greater degree of envy and jealousy against mary as she saw her increasing in grace beauty and influence with her advancing years was supposed to be averse to the marriage mary was in some sense her rival and she could not bear to have her become the wife of her son  king henry finding all these opposing influences at work thought that the safest plan would be to have the marriage carried into effect at the earliest possible period when therefore mary was about fifteen years of age which was in 1557 he sent to scotland asking the government there to appoint some commissioners to come to france to assent to the marriage contracts and to witness the ceremonies of the betrothment and the wedding the marriage contracts in the case of the union of a queen of one country with a prince of another are documents of very high importance it is considered necessary not only to make very formal provision for the personal welfare and comfort of the wife during her married life and during her widowhood in case of the death of her husband but also to settle beforehand the questions of succession which might arise out of the marriage and to define precisely the rights and powers both of the husband and the wife in the two countries to which they respectively belong  the parliament of scotland appointed a number of commissioners of the highest rank and station to proceed to france and to act there as the representatives of scotland in every thing which pertained to the marriage they charged them to guard well the rights and powers of mary to see that these rights and all the interests of scotland were well protected in the marriage contracts and to secure proper provision for the personal comfort and happiness of the queen the number of these commissioners was eight their departure from scotland was an event of great public importance they were accompanied by a large number of attendants and followers who were eager to be present in paris at the marriage festivities the whole company arrived safely at paris and were received with every possible mark of distinction and honor  the marriage contracts were drawn up and executed with great formality king henry made no objection to any of the stipulations and provisions which the commissioners required for he had a secret plan for evading them all very ample provision was made for mary herself she was to have a very large income in case the dauphin died while he was dauphin leaving mary a widow she was still to have a large income paid to her by the french government as long as she lived whether she remained in france or went back to scotland if her husband outlived his father so as to become king of france and then died leaving mary his widow her income for the rest of her life was to be double what it would have been if he had died while dauphin francis was in the mean time to share with her the government of scotland if they had a son he was to be after their deaths king of france and of scotland too thus the two crowns would have been united if on the other hand they had only daughters the oldest one was to be queen of scotland only as the laws of france did not allow a female to inherit the throne in case they had no children the crown of scotland was not to come into the french family at all but to descend regularly to the next scotch heir  henry was not satisfied with this entirely for he wanted to secure the union of the scotch and french crowns at all events whether mary had children or not and he persuaded mary to sign some papers with him privately which he thought would secure his purposes charging her not to let the commissioners know that she had signed them he thought it possible that he should never have occasion to produce them one of these papers conveyed the crown of scotland to the king of france absolutely and forever in case mary should die without children another provided that the scotch government should repay him for the enormous sums he had expended upon mary during her residence in france for her education her attendants the celebrations and galas which he had provided for her and all the splendid journeys processions and parades his motive in all this expense had been to unite the crown of scotland to that of france and he wished to provide that if any thing should occur to prevent the execution of his plan he could have all this money reimbursed to him again he estimated the amount at a million of pieces of gold this was an enormous sum it shows on how magnificent a scale marys reception and entertainment in france were managed  these preliminary proceedings being settled all paris and in fact all france began to prepare for the marriage celebrations there were to be two great ceremonies connected with the occasion the first was the betrothment the second was the marriage at the betrothment francis and mary were to meet in a great public hall and there in the presence of a small and select assemblage of the lords and ladies of the court and persons of distinction connected with the royal family they were formally and solemnly to engage themselves to each other then in about a week afterward they were to be married in the most public manner in the great cathedral church of notre dame  the ceremony of the betrothal was celebrated in the palace the palace then occupied by the royal family was the louvre it still stands but is no longer a royal dwelling another palace more modern in its structure and called the tuilleries has since been built a little farther from the heart of the city and in a more pleasant situation the louvre is square with an open court in the center this open court or area is very large and is paved like the streets in fact two great carriage ways pass through it crossing each other at right angles in the center and passing out under great archways in the four sides of the building there is a large hall within the palace and in this hall the ceremony of the betrothal took place francis and mary pledged their faith to each other with appropriate ceremonies only a select circle of relations and intimate friends were present on this occasion the ceremony was concluded in the evening with a ball  in the mean time all paris was busy with preparations for the marriage the louvre is upon one side of the river seine its principal front being toward the river with a broad street between there are no buildings but only a parapet wall on the river side of the street so that there is a fine view of the river and of the bridges which cross it from the palace windows nearly opposite the louvre is an island covered with edifices and connected by means of bridges with either shore the great church of notre dame where the marriage ceremony was to be performed is upon this island it has two enormous square towers in front which may be seen rising above all the roofs of the city at a great distance in every direction before the church is a large open area where vast crowds assemble on any great occasion the interior of the church impresses the mind with the sublimest emotions two rows of enormous columns rise to a great height on either hand supporting the lofty arches of the roof the floor is paved with great flat stones and resounds continually with the footsteps of visitors who walk to and fro up and down the aisles looking at the chapels the monuments the sculptures the paintings and the antique and grotesque images and carvings colored light streams through the stained glass of the enormous windows and the tones of the organ and the voices of the priests chanting the service of the mass are almost always resounding and echoing from the vaulted roof above  the words notre dame mean our lady an expression by which the roman catholics denote mary the mother of jesus the church of notre dame had been for many centuries the vast cathedral church of paris where all great ceremonies of state were performed on this occasion they erected a great amphitheater in the area before the church which would accommodate many thousands of the spectators who were to assemble and enable them to see the procession the bride and bridegroom and their friends were to assemble in the bishops palace which was near the cathedral and a covered gallery was erected leading from this palace to the church through which the bridal party were to enter they lined this gallery throughout with purple velvet and ornamented it in other ways so as to make the approach to the church through it inconceivably splendid  crowds began to collect in the great amphitheater early in the morning the streets leading to notre dame were thronged every window in all the lofty buildings around and every balcony was full from ten to twelve the military bands began to arrive and the long procession was formed the different parties being dressed in various picturesque costumes the embassadors of various foreign potentates were present each bearing their appropriate insignia the legate of the pope magnificently dressed had an attendant bearing before him a cross of massive gold the bridegroom francis the dauphin followed this legate and soon afterward came mary accompanied by the king she was dressed in white her robe was embroidered with the figure of the lily and it glittered with diamonds and ornaments of silver as was the custom in those days her dress formed a long train which was borne by two young girls who walked behind her she wore a diamond necklace with a ring of immense value suspended from it and upon her head was a golden coronet enriched with diamonds and gems of inestimable value  but the dress and the diamonds which mary wore were not the chief points of attraction to the spectators all who were present on the occasion agree in saying that she looked inexpressibly beautiful and that there was an indescribable grace and charm in all her movements and manner which filled all who saw her with an intoxication of delight she was artless and unaffected in her manners and her countenance the expression of which was generally placid and calm was lighted up with the animation and interest of the occasion so as to make every body envy the dauphin the possession of so beautiful a bride queen catharine and a long train of the ladies of the court followed in the procession after mary every body thought that she felt envious and ill at ease  the essential thing in the marriage ceremony was to be the putting of the wedding ring upon marys finger and the pronouncing of the nuptial benediction which was immediately to follow it this ceremony was to be performed by the archbishop of rouen who was at that time the greatest ecclesiastical dignitary in france in order that as many persons as possible might witness this it was arranged that it should be performed at the great door of the church so as to be in view of the immense throng which had assembled in the amphitheater erected in the area and of the multitudes which had taken their positions at the windows and balconies and on the housetops around the procession accordingly having entered the church through the covered gallery moved along the aisles and came to the great door here a royal pavilion had been erected where the bridal party could stand in view of the whole assembled multitude king henry had the ring he gave it to the archbishop the archbishop placed it upon marys finger and pronounced the benediction in a loud voice the usual congratulations followed and mary greeted her husband under the name of his majesty the king of scotland then the whole mighty crowd rent the air with shouts and acclamations  it was the custom in those days on such great public occasions as this to scatter money among the crowd that they might scramble for it this was called the kings largess and the largess was pompously proclaimed by heralds before the money was thrown the throwing of the money among this immense throng produced a scene of indescribable confusion the people precipitated themselves upon each other in their eagerness to seize the silver and the gold some were trampled under foot some were stripped of their hats and cloaks or had their clothes torn from them some fainted and were borne out of the scene with infinite difficulty and danger at last the people clamorously begged the officers to desist from throwing any more money for fear that the most serious and fatal consequences might ensue  in the mean time the bridal procession returned into the church and advancing up the center between the lofty columns they came to a place called the choir which is in the heart of the church and is inclosed by screens of carved and sculptured work it is in the choir that congregations assemble to be present at mass and other religious ceremonies movable seats are placed here on ordinary occasions but at the time of this wedding the place was fitted up with great splendor here mass was performed in the presence of the bridal party mass is a solemn ceremony conducted by the priests in which they renew or think they renew the sacrifice of christ accompanied with offerings of incense and other acts of adoration and the chanting of solemn hymns of praise  at the close of these services the procession moved again down the church and issuing forth at the great entrance it passed around upon a spacious platform where it could be seen to advantage by all the spectators mary was the center to which all eyes were turned she moved along the very picture of grace and beauty the two young girls who followed her bearing her train the procession after completing its circuit returned to the church and thence through the covered gallery it moved back to the bishops palace here the company partook of a grand collation after the collation there was a ball but the ladies were too much embarrassed with their magnificent dresses to be able to dance and at five oclock the royal family returned to their home mary and queen catharine went together in a sort of palanquin borne by men high officers of state walking on each side the king and the dauphin followed on horseback with a large company in their train but the streets were every where so crowded with eager spectators that it was with extreme difficulty that they were able to make their way  the palace to which the party went to spend the evening was fitted up and illuminated in the most splendid manner and a variety of most curious entertainments had been contrived for the amusement of the company there were twelve artificial horses made to move by internal mechanism and splendidly caparisoned the children of the company the little princes and dukes mounted these horses and rode around the arena then came in a company of men dressed like pilgrims each of whom recited a poem written in honor of the occasion after this was an exhibition of galleys or boats upon a little sea these boats were large enough to bear up two persons there were two seats in each one of which was occupied by a young gentleman as the boats advanced one by one each gentleman leaped to the shore or to what represented the shore and going among the company selected a lady and bore her off to his boat and then seating her in the vacant chair took his place by her side and continued his voyage francis was in one of the boats and he on coming to the shore took mary for his companion  the celebrations and festivities of this famous wedding continued for fifteen days they closed with a grand tournament a tournament was a very magnificent spectacle in those days a field was inclosed in which kings and princes and knights fully armed and mounted on warhorses tilted against each other with lances and blunted swords ladies of high rank were present as spectators and judges and one was appointed at each tournament to preside and to distribute the honors and rewards to those who were most successful in the contests the greatest possible degree of deference and honor was paid to the ladies by all the knights on these occasions once at a tournament in london arranged by a king of england the knights and noblemen rode in a long procession to the field each led by a lady by means of a silver chain it was a great honor to be admitted to a share in these contests as none but persons of the highest rank were allowed to take a part in them whenever one was to be held invitations were sent to all the courts of europe and kings queens and sovereign princes came to witness the spectacle  the horsemen who contended on these occasions carried long lances blunt indeed at the end so that they could not penetrate the armor of the antagonist at which they were aimed but yet of such weight that the momentum of the blow was sometimes sufficient to unhorse him the great object of every combatant was accordingly to protect himself from this danger he must turn his horse suddenly and avoid the lance of his antagonist or he must strike it with his own and thus parry the blow or if he must encounter it he was to brace himself firmly in his saddle and resist its impulse with all the strength that he could command it required therefore great strength and great dexterity to excel in a tournament in fact the rapidity of the evolutions which it required gave origin to the name the word tournament being formed from a french wordc which signifies to turn  footnote c tourner  the princes and noblemen who were present at the wedding all joined in the tournament except the poor bridegroom who was too weak and feeble in body and too timid in mind for any such rough and warlike exercises francis was very plain and unprepossessing in countenance and shy and awkward in his manners his health had always been very infirm and though his rank was very high as he was the heir apparent to what was then the greatest throne in europe every body thought that in all other respects he was unfit to be the husband of such a beautiful and accomplished princess as mary he was timid shy and anxious and unhappy in disposition he knew that the gay and warlike spirits around him could not look upon him with respect and he felt a painful sense of his inferiority  mary however loved him it was a love perhaps mingled with pity she did not assume an air of superiority over him but endeavored to encourage him to lead him forward to inspire him with confidence and hope and to make him feel his own strength and value she was herself of a sedate and thoughtful character and with all her intellectual superiority she was characterized by that feminine gentleness of spirit that disposition to follow and to yield rather than to govern that desire to be led and to be loved rather than to lead and be admired which constitute the highest charm of woman  francis was glad when the celebrations tournament and all were well over he set off from paris with his young bride to one of his country residences where he could live for a while in peace and quietness mary was released in some degree from the restraints and formalities and rules of etiquette of king henrys court and was to some extent her own mistress though still surrounded with many attendants and much parade and splendor the young couple thus commenced the short period of their married life they were certainly a very young couple being both of them under sixteen  the rejoicings on account of the marriage were not confined to paris all scotland celebrated the event with much parade the catholic party there were pleased with the final consummation of the event and all the people in fact joined more or less in commemorating the marriage of their queen there is in the castle of edinburgh on a lofty platform which overlooks a broad valley a monstrous gun several centuries old which was formed of bars of iron secured by great iron hoops the balls which this gun carried are more than a foot in diameter the name of this enormous piece of ordnance is mons meg it is now disabled having been burst many years ago and injured beyond the possibility of repair there were great rejoicings in edinburgh at the time of marys marriage and from some old accounts which still remain at the castle it appears that ten

speechmarys true nobility of soulsympathy with hermarys religious faithher frankness and candor   it was said in the last chapter that mary loved her husband infirm and feeble as he was both in body and in mind this love was probably the effect quite as much as it was the cause of the kindness which she showed him as we are very apt to hate those whom we have injured so we almost instinctively love those who have in any way become the objects of our kindness and care if any wife therefore wishes for the pleasure of loving her husband or which is perhaps a better supposition if any husband desires the happiness of loving his wife conscious that it is a pleasure which he does not now enjoy let him commence by making her the object of his kind attentions and care and love will spring up in the heart as a consequence of the kind of action of which it is more commonly the cause  about a year passed away when at length another great celebration took place in paris to honor the marriages of some other members of king henrys family one of them was franciss oldest sister a grand tournament was arranged on this occasion too the place for this tournament was where the great street of st antoine now lies and which may be found on any map of paris a very large concourse of kings and nobles from all the courts of europe were present king henry magnificently dressed and mounted on a superb warhorse was a very prominent figure in all the parades of the occasion though the actual contests and trials of skill which took place were between younger princes and knights king henry and the ladies being generally only spectators and judges he however took a part himself on one or two occasions and received great applause  at last at the end of the third day just as the tournament was to be closed king henry was riding around the field greatly excited with the pride and pleasure which so magnificent a spectacle was calculated to awaken when he saw two lances still remaining which had not been broken the idea immediately seized him of making one more exhibition of his own power and dexterity in such contests he took one of the lances and directing a high officer who was riding near him to take the other he challenged him to a trial of skill the name of this officer was montgomery montgomery at first declined being unwilling to contend with his king the king insisted queen catharine begged that he would not contend again accidents sometimes happened she knew in these rough encounters and at any rate it terrified her to see her husband exposed to such dangers the other lords and ladies and francis and queen mary particularly joined in these expostulations but henry was inflexible there was no danger and smiling at their fears he commanded montgomery to arm himself with his lance and take his position  the spectators looked on in breathless silence the two horsemen rode toward each other each pressing his horse forward to his utmost speed and as they passed each aimed his lance at the head and breast of the other it was customary on such occasions to wear a helmet with a part called a vizor in front which could be raised on ordinary occasions or let down in moments of danger like this to cover and protect the eyes of course this part of the armor was weaker than the rest and it happened that montgomerys lance struck herewas shiveredand a splinter of it penetrated the vizor and inflicted a wound upon henry on the head just over the eye henrys horse went on the spectators observed that the rider reeled and trembled in his seat the whole assembly were in consternation the excitement of pride and pleasure was every where turned into extreme anxiety and alarm  they flocked about henrys horse and helped the king to dismount he said it was nothing they took off his helmet and found large drops of blood issuing from the wound they bore him to his palace he had the magnanimity to say that montgomery must not be blamed for this result as he was himself responsible for it entirely he lingered eleven days and then died this was in july 1559  one of the marriages which this unfortunate tournament had been intended to celebrate that of elizabeth the kings daughter had already taken place having been performed a day or two before the king was wounded and it was decided after henry was wounded that the other must proceed as there were great reasons of state against any postponement of it this second marriage was that of margaret his sister the ceremony in her case was performed in a silent and private manner at night by torchlight in the chapel of the palace while her brother was dying the services were interrupted by her sobs and tears  notwithstanding the mental and bodily feebleness which seemed to characterize the dauphin marys husband who now by the death of his father became king of france the event of his accession to the throne seemed to awaken his energies and arouse him to animation and effort he was sick himself and in his bed in a palace called the tournelles when some officers of state were ushered into his apartment and kneeling before him saluted him as king this was the first announcement of his fathers death he sprang from his bed exclaiming at once that he was well it is one of the sad consequences of hereditary greatness and power that a son must sometimes rejoice at the death of his father  it was franciss duty to repair at once to the royal palace of the louvre with mary who was now queen of france as well as of scotland to receive the homage of the various estates of the realm catharine was of course now queen dowager mary the child whom she had so long looked upon with feelings of jealousy and envy was from this time to take her place as queen it was very humiliating to catharine to assume the position of a second and an inferior in the presence of one whom she had so long been accustomed to direct and to command she yielded however with a good grace though she seemed dejected and sad as they were leaving the tournelles she stopped to let mary go before her saying pass on madame it is your turn to take precedence now mary went before her but she stopped in her turn with a sweetness of disposition so characteristic of her to let queen catharine enter first into the carriage which awaited them at the door  francis though only sixteen was entitled to assume the government himself he went to rheims a town northeast of paris where is an abbey which is the ancient place of coronation for the kings of france here he was crowned he appointed his ministers and evinced in his management and in his measures more energy and decision than it was supposed he possessed he himself and mary were now together on the summit of earthly grandeur they had many political troubles and cares which can not be related here but marys life was comparatively peaceful and happy the pleasures which she enjoyed being greatly enhanced by the mutual affection which existed between herself and her husband  though he was small in stature and very unprepossessing in appearance and manners francis still evinced in his government a considerable degree of good judgment and of energy his health however gradually declined he spent much of his time in traveling and was often dejected and depressed one circumstance made him feel very unhappy the people of many of the villages through which he passed being in those days very ignorant and superstitious got a rumor into circulation that the kings malady was such that he could only be cured by being bathed in the blood of young children they imagined that he was traveling to obtain such a bath and wherever he came the people fled mothers eagerly carrying off their children from this impending danger the king did not understand the cause of his being thus shunned they concealed it from him knowing that it would give him pain he knew only the fact and it made him very sad to find himself the object of this mysterious and unaccountable aversion  in the mean time while these occurrences had been taking place in france marys mother the queen dowager of scotland had been made queen regent of scotland after her return from france but she experienced infinite trouble and difficulty in managing the affairs of the country the protestant party became very strong and took up arms against her government the english sent them aid she on the other hand with the catholic interest to support her defended her power as well as she could and called for help from france to sustain her and thus the country which she was so ambitious to govern was involved by her management in the calamities and sorrows of civil war  in the midst of this contest she died during her last sickness she sent for some of the leaders of the protestant party and did all that she could to soothe and conciliate their minds she mourned the calamities and sufferings which the civil war had brought upon the country and urged the protestants to do all in their power after her death to heal these dissensions and restore peace she also exhorted them to remember their obligations of loyalty and obedience to their absent queen and to sustain and strengthen her government by every means in their power she died and after her death the war was brought to a close by a treaty of peace in which the french and english governments joined with the government of scotland to settle the points in dispute and immediately afterward the troops of both these nations were withdrawn the death of the queen regent was supposed to have been caused by the pressure of anxiety which the cares of her government imposed her body was carried home to france and interred in the royal abbey at rheims  the death of marys mother took place in the summer of 1560 the next december mary was destined to meet with a much heavier affliction her husband king francis in addition to other complaints had been suffering for some time from pain and disease in the ear one day when he was preparing to go out hunting he was suddenly seized with a fainting fit and was soon found to be in great danger he continued some days very ill he was convinced himself that he could not recover and began to make arrangements for his approaching end as he drew near to the close of his life he was more and more deeply impressed with a sense of marys kindness and love he mourned very much his approaching separation from her he sent for his mother queen catharine to come to his bedside and begged that she would treat mary kindly for his sake after he was gone  mary was overwhelmed with grief at the approaching death of her husband she knew at once what a great change it would make in her condition she would lose immediately her rank and station queen catharine would again come into power as queen regent during the minority of the next heir all her friends of the family of guise would be removed from office and she herself would become a mere guest and stranger in the land of which she had been the queen but nothing could arrest the progress of the disease under which her husband was sinking he died leaving mary a disconsolate widow of seventeen  the historians of those days say that queen catharine was much pleased at the death of francis her son it restored her to rank and power mary was again beneath her and in some degree subject to her will all marys friends were removed from their high stations and others hostile to her family were put into their places mary soon found herself unhappy at court and she accordingly removed to a castle at a considerable distance from paris to the west near the city of orleans the people of scotland wished her to return to her native land both the great parties sent embassadors to her to ask her to return each of them urging her to adopt such measures on her arrival in scotland as should favor their cause queen catharine too who was still jealous of marys influence and of the admiration and love which her beauty and the loveliness of her character inspired intimated to her that perhaps it would be better for her now to leave france and return to her own land  mary was very unwilling to go she loved france she knew very little of scotland she was very young when she left it and the few recollections which she had of the country were confined to the lonely island of inchmahome and the castle of stirling scotland was in a cold and inhospitable climate accessible only through stormy and dangerous seas and it seemed to her that going there was going into exile besides she dreaded to undertake personally to administer a government whose cares and anxieties had been so great as to carry her mother to the grave  mary however found that it was in vain for her to resist the influences which pressed upon her the necessity of returning to her native land she wandered about during the spring and summer after her husbands death spending her time in various palaces and abbeys and at length she began to prepare for her return to scotland the same gentleness and loveliness of character which she had exhibited in her prosperous fortunes shone still more conspicuously now in her hours of sorrow sometimes she appeared in public in certain ceremonies of state she was then dressed in mourningin whiteaccording to the custom in royal families in those days her dark hair covered by a delicate crape veil her beauty softened and chastened by her sorrows made a strong impression upon all who saw her  she appeared so frequently and attracted so much attention in her white mourning that she began to be known among the people as the white queen every body wanted to see her they admired her beauty they were impressed with the romantic interest of her history they pitied her sorrows she mourned her husbands death with deep and unaffected grief she invented a device and motto for a seal appropriate to the occasion it was a figure of the liquoricetree every part of which is useless except the root which of course lies beneath the surface of the earth underneath was the inscription in latin my treasure is in the ground the expression is much more beautiful in the latin than can be expressed in any english wordsd  footnote d dulce meum terra tegit  mary did not however give herself up to sullen and idle grief but employed herself in various studies and pursuits in order to soothe and solace her grief by useful occupation she read latin authors she studied poetry she composed she paid much attention to music and charmed those who were in her company by the sweet tones of her voice and her skillful performance upon an instrument the historians even record a description of the fascinating effect produced by the graceful movements of her beautiful hand whatever she did or said seemed to carry with it an inexpressible charm  before she set out on her return to scotland she went to pay a visit to her grandmother the same lady whom her mother had gone to see in her castle ten years before on her return to scotland after her visit to mary during this ten years the unhappy mourner had made no change in respect to her symbols of grief the apartments of her palace were still hung with black her countenance wore the same expression of austerity and woe her attendants were trained to pay to her every mark of the most profound deference in all their approaches to her no sounds of gayety or pleasure were to be heard but a profound stillness and solemnity reigned continually throughout the gloomy mansion  not long before the arrangements were completed for marys return to scotland she revisited paris where she was received with great marks of attention and honor she was now eighteen or nineteen years of age in the bloom of her beauty and the monarch of a powerful kingdom to which she was about to return and many of the young princes of europe began to aspire to the honor of her hand through these and other influences she was the object of much attention while on the other hand queen catharine and the party in power at the french court were envious and jealous of her popularity and did a great deal to mortify and vex her  the enemy however whom mary had most to fear was her cousin queen elizabeth of england queen elizabeth was a maiden lady now nearly thirty years of age she was in all respects extremely different from mary she was a zealous protestant and very suspicious and watchful in respect to mary on account of her catholic connections and faith she was very plain in person and unprepossessing in manners she was however intelligent and shrewd and was governed by calculations and policy in all that she did the people by whom she was surrounded admired her talents and feared her power but nobody loved her she had many good qualities as a monarch but none considered as a woman  illustration portrait of queen elizabeth  elizabeth was somewhat envious of her cousin marys beauty and of her being such an object of interest and affection to all who knew her but she had a far more serious and permanent cause of alienation from her than personal envy it was this elizabeths father king henry viii had in succession several wives and there had been a question raised about the legality of his marriage with elizabeths mother parliament decided at one time that this marriage was not valid at another time subsequently they decided that it was this difference in the two decisions was not owing so much to a change of sentiment in the persons who voted as to a change in the ascendency of the parties by which the decision was controlled if the marriage were valid then elizabeth was entitled to the english crown if it were not valid then she was not entitled to it it belonged to the next heir now it happened that mary queen of scots was the next heir her grandmother on the fathers side was an english princess and through her mary had a just title to the crown if queen elizabeths title was annulled  now while mary was in france during the lifetime of king henry franciss father he and the members of the family of guise advanced marys claim to the british crown and denied that of elizabeth they made a coat of arms in which the arms of france and scotland and england were combined and had it engraved on marys silver plate on one great occasion they had this symbol displayed conspicuously over the gateway of a town where mary was making a public entry the english embassador who was present made this and the other acts of the same kind known to elizabeth and she was greatly incensed at them she considered mary as plotting treasonably against her power and began to contrive plans to circumvent and thwart her  nor was elizabeth wholly unreasonable in this mary though personally a gentle and peaceful woman yet in her teens was very formidable to elizabeth as an opposing claimant of the crown all the catholics in france and in scotland would naturally take marys side then besides this there was a large catholic party in england who would be strongly disposed to favor any plan which should give them a catholic monarch elizabeth was therefore very justly alarmed at such a claim on the part of her cousin it threatened not only to expose her to the aggressions of foreign foes but also to internal commotions and dangers in her own dominions  the chief responsibility for bringing forward this claim must rest undoubtedly not on mary herself but on king henry of france and the other french princes who first put it forward mary however herself was not entirely passive in the affair she liked to consider herself as entitled to the english crown she had a device for a seal a very favorite one with her which expressed this claim it contained two crowns with a motto in latin below which meant a third awaits me elizabeth knew all these things and she held mary accountable for all the anxiety and alarm which this dangerous claim occasioned her  at the peace which was made in scotland between the french and english forces and the scotch by the great treaty of edinburgh which has been already described it was agreed that mary should relinquish all claim to the crown of england this treaty was brought to france for mary to ratify it but she declined whatever rights she might have to the english crown she refused to surrender them things remained in this state until the time arrived for her return to her native land and then fearing that perhaps elizabeth might do something to intercept her passage she applied to her for a safeconduct that is a writing authorizing her to pass safely and without hinderance through the english dominions whether land or sea queen elizabeth returned word through her embassador in paris whose name was throckmorton that she could not give her any such safeconduct because she had refused to ratify the treaty of edinburgh  when this answer was communicated to mary she felt deeply wounded by it she sent all the attendants away that she might express herself to throckmorton without reserve she told him that it seemed to her very hard that her cousin was disposed to prevent her return to her native land as to her claim upon the english crown she said that advancing it was not her plan but that of her husband and his father and that now she could not properly renounce it whatever its validity might be till she could have opportunity to return to scotland and consult with her government there since it affected not her personally alone but the public interests of scotland and now she continued in substance i am sorry that i asked such a favor of her i have no need to ask it for i am sure i have a right to return from france to my own country without asking permission of any one you have often told me that the queen wished to be on friendly terms with me and that it was your opinion that to be friends would be best for us both but now i see that she is not of your mind but is disposed to treat me in an unkind and unfriendly manner while she knows that i am her equal in rank though i do not pretend to be her equal in abilities and experience well she may do as she pleases if my preparations were not so far advanced perhaps i should give up the voyage but i am resolved to go i hope the winds will prove favorable and carry me away from her shores if they carry me upon them and i fall into her hands she may make what disposal of me she will if i lose my life i shall esteem it no great loss for it is now little else than a burden  how strongly this speech expresses that mixture of melancholy and dignity of womanly softness and noble decision which pervaded her character there is a sort of gentleness even in her anger and a certain indescribable womanly charm in the workings of her mind which cause all who read her story while they can not but think that elizabeth was right to sympathize wholly with mary  throckmorton at one of his conversations with mary took occasion to ask her respecting her religious views as elizabeth wished to know how far she was fixed and committed in her attachment to the catholic faith mary said that she was born and had been brought up a catholic and that she should remain so as long as she lived she would not interfere she said with her subjects adopting such form of religion as they might prefer but for herself she should not change if she should change she said she should justly lose the confidence of her people for if they saw that she was light and fickle on that subject they could not rely upon her in respect to any other she did not profess to be able to argue herself the questions of difference but she was not wholly uninformed in respect to them as she had often heard the points discussed by learned men and had found nothing to lead her to change her ground  it is impossible for any reader whether protestant or catholic not to admire the frankness and candor the honest conscientiousness the courage and at the same time womanly modesty and propriety which characterize this reply     chapter v  return to scotland  1561  calaisartificial piers and breakwatersthrockmortonelizabeths

elizabeths insincerity   mary was to sail from the port of calais calais is on the northern coast of france opposite to dover in england these towns being on opposite sides of the straits of dover where the channel between england and france is very narrow still the distance is so great that the land on either side is ordinarily not visible on the other there is no good natural harbor at calais nor in fact at any other point on the french coast the french have had to supply the deficiency by artificial piers and breakwaters there are several very capacious and excellent harbors on the english side this may have been one cause among others of the great naval superiority which england has attained  when queen elizabeth found that mary was going to persevere in her intention of returning to her native land she feared that she might after her arrival in scotland and after getting established in power there form a scheme for making war upon her dominions and attempt to carry into effect her claim upon the english crown she wished to prevent this would it be prudent to intercept mary upon her passage she reflected on this subject with the cautious calculation which formed so striking a part of her character and felt in doubt her taking mary a prisoner and confining her a captive in her own land might incense queen catharine who was now regent of france and also awaken a general resentment in scotland so as to bring upon her the hostility of those two countries and thus perhaps make more mischief than the securing of marys person would prevent  she accordingly as a previous step sent to throckmorton her embassador in france directing him to have an interview with queen catharine and ascertain how far she would feel disposed to take marys part throckmorton did this queen catharine gave no direct reply she said that both herself and the young king wished well to elizabeth and to mary too that it was her desire that the two queens might be on good terms with each other that she was a friend to them both and should not take a part against either of them  this was all that queen elizabeth could expect and she formed her plans for intercepting mary on her passage she sent to throckmorton asking him to find out if he could what port queen mary was to sail from and to send her word she then gave orders to her naval commanders to assemble as many ships as they could and hold them in readiness to sail into the seas between england and france for the purpose of exterminating the pirates which she said had lately become very numerous there  throckmorton took occasion in a conversation which he had with mary soon after this to inquire from what port she intended to sail but she did not give him the information she suspected his motive and merely said in reply to his question that she hoped the wind would prove favorable for carrying her away as far as possible from the english coast whatever might be the point from which she should take her departure throckmorton then endeavored to find out the arrangements of the voyage by other means but without much success he wrote to elizabeth that he thought mary would sail either from havre or calais that she would go eastward along the shore of the continent by flanders and holland till she had gained a considerable distance from the english coast and then would sail north along the eastern shores of the german ocean he advised that elizabeth should send spies to calais and to havre and perhaps to other french ports to watch there and to let her know whenever they observed any appearances of preparations for marys departure  in the mean time as the hour for marys farewell to paris and all its scenes of luxury and splendor drew near those who had loved her were drawn more closely to her in heart than ever and those who had been envious and jealous began to relent and to look upon her with feelings of compassion and of kind regard queen catharine treated her with extreme kindness during the last few days of her stay and she accompanied her for some distance on her journey with every manifestation of sincere affection and good will she stopped at length at st germain and there with many tears she bade her gentle daughterinlaw a long and last farewell  many princes and nobles especially of the family of guise marys relatives accompanied her through the whole journey they formed quite a long cavalcade and attracted great attention in all the towns and districts through which they passed they traveled slowly but at length arrived at calais where they waited nearly a week to complete the arrangements for marys embarkation at length the day arrived for her to set sail a large concourse of spectators assembled to witness the scene four ships had been provided for the transportation of the party and their effects two of these were galleys they were provided with banks of oars and large crews of rowers by means of which the vessels could be propelled when the wind failed the two other vessels were merely vessels of burden to carry the furniture and other effects of the passengers  many of the queens friends were to accompany her to scotland the four maries were among them she bade those that were to remain behind farewell and prepared to embark on board the royal galley her heart was very sad just at this time a vessel which was coming in struck against the pier in consequence of a heavy sea which was rolling in and of the distraction of the seamen occasioned by marys embarkation the vessel which struck was so injured by the concussion that it filled immediately and sank most of the seamen on board were drowned this accident produced great excitement and confusion mary looked upon the scene from the deck of her vessel which was now slowly moving from the shore it alarmed her and impressed her mind with a sad and mournful sense of the dangers of the elements to whose mercy she was now to be committed for many days what an unhappy omen is this she exclaimed she then went to the stern of the ship looked back at the shore then knelt down and covering her face with her hands sobbed aloud farewell france she exclaimed i shall never never see thee more presently when her emotions for a moment subsided she would raise her eyes and take another view of the slowlyreceding shore and then exclaim again farewell my beloved france farewell farewell  illustration marys embarkation at calais  she remained in this position suffering this anguish for five hours when it began to grow dark and she could no longer see the shore she then rose saying that her beloved country was gone from her sight forever the darkness like a thick veil hides thee from my sight and i shall see thee no more so farewell beloved land farewell forever she left her place at the stern but she would not leave the deck she made them bring up a bed and place it for her there near the stern they tried to induce her to go into the cabin or at least to take some supper but she would not she lay down upon her bed she charged the helmsman to awaken her at the dawn if the land was in sight when the dawn should appear she then wept herself to sleep  during the night the air was calm and the vessels in which mary and her company had embarked made such small progress being worked only by the oars that the land came into view again with the gray light of the morning the helmsman awoke mary and the sight of the shore renewed her anguish and tears she said that she could not go she wished that elizabeths ships would come in sight so as to compel her squadron to return but no english fleet appeared on the contrary the breeze freshened the sailors unfurled the sails the oars were taken in and the great crew of oarsmen rested from their toil the ships began to make their way rapidly through the rippling water the land soon became a faint low cloud in the horizon and in an hour all traces of it entirely disappeared  the voyage continued for ten days they saw nothing of elizabeths cruisers it was afterward ascertained however that these ships were at one time very near to them and were only prevented from seeing and taking them by a dense fog which at that time happened to cover the sea one of the vessels of burden was seen and taken and carried to england it contained however only some of marys furniture and effects she herself escaped the danger  the fog which was thus marys protection at one time was a source of great difficulty and danger at another for when they were drawing near to the place of their landing in scotland they were enveloped in a fog so dense that they could scarcely see from one end of the vessel to the other they stopped the progress of their vessels and kept continually sounding and when at length the fog cleared away they found themselves involved in a labyrinth of rocks and shoals of the most dangerous character they made their escape at last and went on safely toward the land mary said however that she felt at the time entirely indifferent as to the result she was so disconsolate and wretched at having parted forever from all that was dear to her that it seemed to her that she was equally willing to live or to die  mary who among her other accomplishments had a great deal of poetic talent wrote some lines called her farewell to france which have been celebrated from that day to this they are as follows                 adieu         adieu plaisant pays de france                o ma patrie                la plus cherie        qui a nourri ma jeune enfance      adieu france adieu mes beaux jours      la nef qui déjoint mes amours      na cy de moi que la moitié      une parte te reste elle est tienne      je la fie à ton amitié      pour que de lautre il te souvienne  many persons have attempted to translate these lines into english verse but it is always extremely difficult to translate poetry from one language to another we give here two of the best of these translations the reader can judge by observing how different they are from each other how different they must both be from their common original                 adieu       farewell to thee thou pleasant shore        the loved the cherished home to me      of infant joy a dream thats oer        farewell dear france farewell to thee       the sail that wafts me bears away        from thee but half my soul alone      its fellow half will fondly stay        and back to thee has faithful flown       i trust it to thy gentle care        for all that here remains with me      lives but to think of all thats there        to love and to remember thee  the other translation is as follows                 adieu        adieu thou pleasant land of france         the dearest of all lands to me       where life was like a joyful dance         the joyful dance of infancy        farewell my childhoods laughing wiles         farewell the joys of youths bright day       the bark that takes me from thy smiles         bears but my meaner half away        the best is thine my changeless heart         is given beloved france to thee       and let it sometimes though we part         remind thee with a sigh of me  it was on the 19th of august 1561 that the two galleys arrived at leith leith is a small port on the shore of the frith of forth about two miles from edinburgh which is situated somewhat inland the royal palace where mary was to reside was called the palace of holyrood it was and is still a large square building with an open court in the center into which there is access for carriages through a large arched passageway in the center of the principal front of the building in the rear but connected with the palace there was a chapel in marys day though it is now in ruins the walls still remain but the roof is gone the people of scotland were not expecting mary so soon information was communicated from country to country in those days slowly and with great difficulty perhaps the time of marys departure from france was purposely concealed even from the scotch to avoid all possibility that the knowledge of it should get into elizabeths possession  at any rate the first intelligence which the inhabitants of edinburgh and the vicinity had of the arrival of their queen was the approach of the galleys to the shore and the firing of a royal salute from their guns the palace of holyrood was not ready for marys reception and she had to remain a day at leith awaiting the necessary preparations in the mean time the whole population began to assemble to welcome her arrival military bands were turned out banners were prepared civil and military officers in full costume assembled and bonfires and illuminations were provided for the evening and night in a word marys subjects in scotland did all in their power to do honor to the occasion but the preparations were so far beneath the pomp and pageantry which she had been accustomed to in france that she felt the contrast very keenly and realized more forcibly than ever how great was the change which the circumstances of her life were undergoing  illustration palace of holyrood with salisbury crags and arthurs seat in the distance  horses were prepared for mary and her large company of attendants to ride from leith to edinburgh the long cavalcade moved toward evening the various professions and trades of edinburgh were drawn up in lines on each side of the road and thousands upon thousands of other spectators assembled to witness the scene when she reached the palace of holyrood house a band of music played for a time under her windows and then the great throng quietly dispersed leaving mary to her repose the adjoining engraving represents the palace of holyrood as it now appears in marys day the northern part only had been builtthat is the part on the left in the view where the ivy climbs about the windowsand the range extending back to the royal chapel the ruins of which are seen in the reare mary took up her abode in this dwelling and was glad to rest from the fatigues and privations of her long voyage but she found her new home a solitary and gloomy dwelling compared with the magnificent palaces of the land she had left  footnote e for the situation of this palace in respect to edinburgh see the view of edinburgh page 179  mary made an extremely favorable impression upon her subjects in scotland to please them she exchanged the white mourning of france from which she had taken the name of the white queen for a black dress more accordant with the ideas and customs of her native land this gave her a more sedate and matronly character and though the expression of her countenance and figure was somewhat changed by it it was only a change to a new form of extreme and fascinating beauty her manners too so graceful and easy and yet so simple and unaffected charmed all who saw her  mary had a half brother in scotland whose title was at this time the lord james he was afterward named the earl of murray and is commonly known in history under this latter designation the mother of lord james was not legally married to marys father and consequently he could not inherit any of his fathers rights to the scottish crown the lord james was however a man of very high rank and influence and mary immediately received him into her service and made him one of her highest ministers of state he was now about thirty years of age prudent cautious and wise of good person and manners but somewhat reserved and austere  lord james had the general direction of affairs on marys arrival and things went on very smoothly for a week but then on the first sunday after the landing a very serious difficulty threatened to occur the catholics have a certain celebration called the mass to which they attach a very serious and solemn importance when our savior gave the bread and the wine to his disciples at the last supper he said of it this is my body broken for you and this is my blood shed for you the catholics understand that these words denote that the bread and wine did at that time and that they do now whenever the communion service is celebrated by a priest duly authorized become by a sort of miraculous transformation the true body and blood of christ and that the priest in breaking the one and pouring out the other is really and truly renewing the great sacrifice for sin made by jesus christ at his crucifixion the mass therefore in which the bread and the wine are so broken and poured out becomes in their view not a mere service of prayer and praise to god but a solemn act of sacrifice the spectators or assistants as they call them meaning all who are present on the occasion stand by not merely to hear words of adoration in which they mentally join as is the case in most protestant forms of worship but to witness the enactment of a deed and one of great binding force and validity a real and true sacrifice of christ made anew as an atonement for their sins the bread when consecrated and as they suppose transmuted to the body of christ is held up to view or carried in a procession around the church that all present may bow before it and adore it as really being though in the form of bread the wounded and broken body of the lord  of course the celebration of the mass is invested in the minds of all conscientious catholics with the utmost solemnity and importance they stand silently by with the deepest feelings of reverence and awe while the priest offers up for them anew the great sacrifice for sin they regard all protestant worship which consists of mere exhortations to duty hymns and prayers as lifeless and void that which is to them the soul the essence and substance of the whole is wanting on the other hand the protestants abhor the sacrifice of the mass as gross superstition they think that the bread remains simply bread after the benediction as much as before that for the priests to pretend that in breaking it they renew the sacrifice of christ is imposture and that to bow before it in adoration and homage is the worst idolatry  now it happened that during marys absence in france the contest between the catholics and the protestants had been going fiercely on and the result had been the almost complete defeat of the catholic party and the establishment of the protestant interest throughout the realm a great many deeds of violence accompanied this change churches and abbeys were sometimes sacked and destroyed the images of saints which the catholics had put up were pulled down and broken and the people were sometimes worked up to phrensy against the principles of the catholic faith and catholic observances they abhorred the mass and were determined that it should not be introduced again into scotland  queen mary knowing this state of things determined on her arrival in scotland not to interfere with her people in the exercise of their religion but she resolved to remain a catholic herself and to continue for the use of her own household in the royal chapel at holyrood the same catholic observances to which she had been accustomed in france she accordingly gave orders that mass should be celebrated in her chapel on the first sunday after her arrival she was very willing to abstain from interfering with the religious usages of her subjects but she was not willing to give up her own  the friends of the reformation had a meeting and resolved that mass should not be celebrated there was however no way of preventing it but by intimidation or violence when sunday came crowds began to assemble about the palace and the chapelf and to fill all the avenues leading to them the catholic families who were going to attend the service were treated rudely as they passed the priests they threatened with death one who carried a candle which was to be used in the ceremonies was extremely terrified at their threats and imprecations the excitement was very great and would probably have proceeded to violent extremities had it not been for lord jamess energy and courage he was a protestant but he took his station at the door of the chapel and without saying or doing any thing to irritate the crowd without he kept them at bay while the service proceeded it went on to the close though greatly interrupted by the confusion and uproar many of the french people who came with mary were so terrified by this scene that they declared they would not stay in such a country and took the first opportunity of returning to france  footnote f the ruins of the royal chapel are to be seen in the rear of the palace in the view on page 114  one of the most powerful and influential of the leaders of the protestant party at this time was the celebrated john knox he was a man of great powers of mind and of commanding eloquence and he had exerted a vast influence in arousing the people of scotland to a feeling of strong abhorrence of what they considered the abominations of popery when queen mary of england was upon the throne knox had written a book against her and against queens in general women having according to his views no right to govern knox was a man of the most stern and uncompromising character who feared nothing respected nothing and submitted to no restraints in the blunt and plain discharge of what he considered his duty mary dreaded his influence and power  knox had an interview with mary not long after her arrival and it is one of the most striking instances of the strange ascendency which marys extraordinary beauty and grace and the pensive charm of her demeanor exercised over all that came within her influence that even john knox whom nothing else could soften or subdue found his rough and indomitable energy half forsaking him in the presence of his gentle queen she expostulated with him he half apologized nothing had ever drawn the least semblance of an apology from him before he told her that his book was aimed solely against queen mary of england and not against her that she had no cause to fear its influence that in respect to the freedom with which he had advanced his opinions and theories on the subjects of government and religion she need not be alarmed for philosophers had always done this in every age and yet had lived good citizens of the state whose institutions they had nevertheless in some sense theoretically condemned he told her moreover that he had no intention of troubling her reign that she might be sure of this since if he had such a desire he should have commenced his measures during her absence and not have postponed them until her position on the throne was strengthened by her return thus he tried to soothe her fears and to justify himself from the suspicion of having designed any injury to such a gentle and helpless queen the interview was a very extraordinary spectacle it was that of a lion laying aside his majestic sternness and strength to dispel the fears and quiet the apprehensions of a dove the interview was however after all painful and distressing to mary some things which the stern reformer felt it his duty to say to her brought tears into her eyes  mary soon became settled in her new home though many circumstances in her situation were well calculated to disquiet and disturb her she lived in the palace at holyrood the four maries continued with her for a time and then two of them were married to nobles of high rank queen elizabeth sent mary a kind message congratulating her on her safe arrival in scotland and assuring her that the story of her having attempted to intercept her was false mary who had no means of proving elizabeths insincerity sent her back a polite reply     chapter vi  mary and lord darnley  15621566

caresrebellionelizabeths treatment of the rebelsmarys generous conduct to darnleythe double thronedarnleys cruel ingratitude   during the three or four years which elapsed after queen marys arrival in scotland she had to pass through many stormy scenes of anxiety and trouble the great nobles of the land were continually quarreling and all parties were earnest and eager in their efforts to get marys influence and power on their side she had a great deal of trouble with the affairs of her brother the lord james he wished to have the earldom of murray conferred upon him the castle and estates pertaining to this title were in the north of scotland in the neighborhood of inverness they were in possession of another family who refused to give them up mary accompanied lord james to the north with an army to put him in possession they took the castle and hung the governor who had refused to surrender at their summons this and some other acts of this expedition have since been considered unjust and cruel but posterity have been divided in opinion on the question how far mary herself was personally responsible for them  mary at any rate displayed a great degree of decision and energy in her management of public affairs and in the personal exploits which she performed she made excursions from castle to castle and from town to town all over scotland on these expeditions she traveled on horseback sometimes with a royal escort and sometimes at the head of an army of eighteen or twenty thousand men these royal progresses were made sometimes among the great towns and cities on the eastern coast of scotland and also at other times among the gloomy and dangerous defiles of the highlands occasionally she would pay visits to the nobles at their castles to hunt in their parks to review their highland retainers or to join them in celebrations and fêtes and military parades  during all this time her personal influence and ascendency over all who knew her was constantly increasing and the people of scotland notwithstanding the disagreement on the subject of religion became more and more devoted to their queen the attachment which those who were in immediate attendance upon her felt to her person and character was in many cases extreme in one instance this attachment led to a very sad result there was a young frenchman named chatelard who came in marys train from france he was a scholar and a poet he began by writing verses in marys praise which mary read and seemed to be pleased with this increased his interest in her and led him to imagine that he was himself the object of her kind regard finally the love which he felt for her came to be a perfect infatuation he concealed himself one night in marys bedchamber armed as if to resist any attack which the attendants might make upon him he was discovered by the female attendants and taken away and they for fear of alarming mary did not tell her of the circumstance till the next morning  mary was very much displeased or at least professed to be so john knox thought that this displeasure was only a pretense she however forbid chatelard to come any more into her sight a day or two after this mary set out on a journey to the north chatelard followed he either believed that mary really loved him or else he was led on by that strange and incontrollable infatuation which so often in such cases renders even the wisest men utterly reckless and blind to the consequences of what they say or do he watched his opportunity and one night when mary retired to her bedroom he followed her directly in mary called for help the attendants came in and immediately sent for the earl of murray who was in the palace chatelard protested that all he wanted was to explain and apologize for his coming into marys room before and to ask her to forgive him mary however would not listen she was very much incensed when murray came in she directed him to run his dagger through the man murray however instead of doing this had the offender seized and sent to prison in a few days he was tried and condemned to be beheaded the excitement and enthusiasm of his love continued to the last he stood firm and undaunted on the scaffold and just before he laid his head on the block he turned toward the place where mary was then lodging and said farewell loveliest and most cruel princess that the world contains  in the mean time mary and queen elizabeth continued ostensibly on good terms they sent embassadors to each others courts they communicated letters and messages to each other and entered into various negotiations respecting the affairs of their respective kingdoms the truth was each was afraid of the other and neither dared to come to an open rupture elizabeth was uneasy on account of marys claim to her crown and was very anxious to avoid driving her to extremities since she knew that in that case there would be great danger of her attempting openly to enforce it mary on the other hand thought that there was more probability of her obtaining the succession to the english crown by keeping peace with elizabeth than by a quarrel elizabeth was not married and was likely to live and die single mary would then be the next heir without much question she wished elizabeth to acknowledge this and to have the english parliament enact it if elizabeth would take this course mary was willing to waive her claims during elizabeths life elizabeth however was not willing to do this decidedly she wished to reserve the right to herself of marrying if she chose she also wished to keep mary dependent upon her as long as she could hence while she would not absolutely refuse to comply with marys proposition she would not really accede to it but kept the whole matter in suspense by endless procrastination difficulties and delays  i have said that after elizabeth marys claim to the british crown was almost unquestioned there was another lady about as nearly related to the english royal line as mary her name was margaret stuart her title was lady lennox she had a son named henry stuart whose title was lord darnley it was a question whether mary or margaret were best entitled to consider herself the heir to the british crown after elizabeth mary therefore had two obstacles in the way of the accomplishment of her wishes to be queen of england one was the claim of elizabeth who was already in possession of the throne and the other the claims of lady lennox and after her of her son darnley there was a plan of disposing of this last difficulty in a very simple manner it was to have mary marry lord darnley and thus unite these two claims this plan had been proposed but there had been no decision in respect to it there was one objection that darnley being marys cousin their marriage was forbidden by the laws of the catholic church there was no way of obviating this difficulty but by applying to the pope to grant them a special dispensation  in the mean time a great many other plans were formed for marys marriage several of the princes and potentates of europe applied for her hand they were allured somewhat no doubt by her youth and beauty and still more very probably by the desire to annex her kingdom to their dominions mary wishing to please elizabeth communicated often with her to ask her advice and counsel in regard to her marriage elizabeths policy was to embarrass and perplex the whole subject by making difficulties in respect to every plan proposed finally she recommended a gentleman of her own court to maryrobert dudley whom she afterward made earl of leicesterone of her special favorites the position of dudley and the circumstances of the case were such that mankind have generally supposed that elizabeth did not seriously imagine that such a plan could be adopted but that she proposed it as perverse and intriguing people often do as a means of increasing the difficulty such minds often attempt to prevent doing what can be done by proposing and urging what they know is impossible  in the course of these negotiations queen mary once sent melville her former page of honor in france as a special embassador to queen elizabeth to ascertain more perfectly her views melville had followed mary to scotland and had entered her service there as a confidential secretary and as she had great confidence in his prudence and in his fidelity she thought him the most suitable person to undertake this mission melville afterward lived to an advanced age and in the latter part of his life he wrote a narrative of his various adventures and recorded in quaint and ancient language many of his conversations and interviews with the two queens his mission to england was of course a very important event in his life and one of the most curious and entertaining passages in his memoirs is his narrative of his interviews with the english queen he was at the time about thirtyfour years of age mary was about twentytwo  sir james melville was received with many marks of attention and honor by queen elizabeth his first interview with her was in a garden near the palace she first asked him about a letter which mary had recently written to her and which she said had greatly displeased her and she took out a reply from her pocket written in very sharp and severe language though she said she had not sent it because it was not severe enough and she was going to write another melville asked to see the letter from mary which had given elizabeth so much offense and on reading it he explained it and disavowed on marys part any intention to give offense and thus finally succeeded in appeasing elizabeths displeasure and at length induced her to tear up her angry reply  elizabeth then wanted to know what mary thought of her proposal of dudley for her husband melville told her that she had not given the subject much reflection but that she was going to appoint two commissioners and she wished elizabeth to appoint two others and then that the four should meet on the borders of the two countries and consider the whole subject of the marriage elizabeth said that she perceived that mary did not think much of this proposed match she said however that dudley stood extremely high in her regard that she was going to make him an earl and that she should marry him herself were it not that she was fully resolved to live and die a single woman she said she wished very much to have dudley become marys husband both on account of her attachment to him and also on account of his attachment to her which she was sure would prevent his allowing her that is elizabeth to have any trouble out of marys claim to her crown as long as she lived  elizabeth also asked melville to wait in westminster until the day appointed for making dudley an earl this was done a short time afterward with great ceremony lord darnley then a very tall and slender youth of about nineteen was present on the occasion his father and mother had been banished from scotland on account of some political offenses twenty years before and he had thus himself been brought up in england as he was a near relative of the queen and a sort of heirpresumptive to the crown he had a high position at the court and his office was on this occasion to bear the sword of honor before the queen dudley kneeled before elizabeth while she put upon him the badges of his new dignity afterward she asked melville what he thought of him melville was polite enough to speak warmly in his favor and yet said the queen i suppose you prefer yonder long lad pointing to darnley she knew something of marys halfformed design of making darnley her husband melville who did not wish her to suppose that mary had any serious intention of choosing darnley said that no woman of spirit would choose such a person as he was for he was handsome beardless and ladyfaced in fact he looked more like a woman than a man  melville was not very honest in this for he had secret instructions at this very time to apply to lady lennox darnleys mother to send her son into scotland in order that mary might see him and be assisted to decide the question of becoming his wife by ascertaining how she was going to like him personally queen elizabeth in the mean time pressed upon melville the importance of marys deciding soon in favor of the marriage with leicester as to declaring in favor of marys right to inherit the crown after her she said the question was in the hands of the great lawyers and commissioners to whom she had referred it and that she heartily wished that they might come to a conclusion in favor of marys claim she should urge the business forward as fast as she could but the result would depend very much upon the disposition which mary showed to comply with her wishes in respect to the marriage she said she should never marry herself unless she was compelled to it on account of marys giving her trouble by her claims upon the crown and forcing her to desire that it should go to her direct descendants if mary would act wisely and as she ought and follow her counsel she would in due time have all her desire  some time more elapsed in negotiations and delays there was a good deal of trouble in getting leave for darnley to go to scotland from his position and from the state of the laws and customs of the two realms he could not go without elizabeths permission finally mary sent word to elizabeth that she would marry leicester according to her wish if she would have her claim to the english crown after elizabeth acknowledged and established by the english government so as to have that question definitely and finally settled elizabeth sent back for answer to this proposal that if mary married leicester she would advance him to great honors and dignities but that she could not do any thing at present about the succession she also at the same time gave permission to darnley to go to scotland  it is thought that elizabeth never seriously intended that mary should marry leicester and that she did not suppose mary herself would consent to it on any terms accordingly when she found mary was acceding to the plan she wanted to retreat from it herself and hoped that darnleys going to scotland and appearing there as a new competitor in the field would tend to complicate and embarrass the question in marys mind and help to prevent the leicester negotiation from going any further at any rate lord darnleythen a very tall and handsome young man of nineteenobtained suddenly permission to go to scotland mary went to wemys castle and made arrangements to have darnley come and visit her there  illustration wemys castlethe scene of marys first interview with darnley  wemys castle is situated in a most romantic and beautiful spot on the seashore on the northern side of the frith of forth edinburgh is upon the southern side of the frith and is in full view from the windows of the castle with salisbury crags and arthurs seat on the left of the city wemys castle was at this time the residence of murray marys brother marys visit to it was an event which attracted a great deal of attention the people flocked into the neighborhood and provisions and accommodations of every kind rose enormously in price every one was eager to get a glimpse of the beautiful queen besides they knew that lord darnley was expected and the rumor that he was seriously thought of as her future husband had been widely circulated and had awakened of course a universal desire to see him  mary was very much pleased with darnley she told melville after their first interview that he was the handsomest and best proportioned long man she had ever seen darnley was in fact very tall and as he was straight and slender he appeared even taller than he really was he was however though young very easy and graceful in his manners and highly accomplished mary was very much pleased with him she had almost decided to make him her husband before she saw him merely from political considerations on account of her wish to combine his claim with hers in respect to the english crown elizabeths final answer refusing the terms on which mary had consented to marry leicester which came about this time vexed her and determined her to abandon that plan and now just in such a crisis to find darnley possessed of such strong personal attractions seemed to decide the question in a few days her imagination was full of pictures of joy and pleasure in anticipations of union with such a husband  the thing took the usual course of such affairs darnley asked mary to be his wife she said no and was offended with him for asking it he offered her a present of a ring she refused to accept it but the no meant yes and the rejection of the ring was only the prelude to the acceptance of something far more important of which a ring is the symbol marys first interview with darnley was in february in april queen elizabeths embassador sent her word that he was satisfied that marys marriage with darnley was all arranged and settled  queen elizabeth was or pretended to be in a great rage she sent the most urgent remonstrances to mary against the execution of the plan she forwarded also very decisive orders to darnley and to the earl of lennox his father to return immediately to england lennox replied that he could not return for he did not think the climate would agree with him darnley sent back word that he had entered the service of the queen of scots and henceforth should obey her orders alone elizabeth however was not the only one who opposed this marriage the earl of murray marys brother who had been thus far the great manager of the government under mary took at once a most decided stand against it he enlisted a great number of protestant nobles with him and they held deliberations in which they formed plans for resisting it by force but mary who with all her gentleness and loveliness of spirit had like other women some decision and energy when an object in which the heart is concerned is at stake had made up her mind she sent to france to get the consent of her friends there she dispatched a commissioner to rome to obtain the popes dispensation she obtained the sanction of her own parliament and in fact in every way hastened the preparations for the marriage  murray on the other hand and his confederate lords were determined to prevent it they formed a plan to rise in rebellion against mary to waylay and seize her to imprison her and to send darnley and his father to england having made arrangements with elizabeths ministers to receive them at the borders the plan was all well matured and would probably have been carried into effect had not mary in some way or other obtained information of the design she was then at stirling and they were to waylay her on the usual route to edinburgh she made a sudden journey at an unexpected time and by a new and unusual road and thus evaded her enemies the violence of this opposition only stimulated her determination to carry the marriage into effect without delay her escape from her rebellious nobles took place in june and she was married in july this was six months after her first interview with darnley the ceremony was performed in the royal chapel at holyrood they show to this day the place where she is said to have stood in the now roofless interior  mary was conducted into the chapel by lennox and another nobleman in the midst of a large company of lords and ladies of the court and of strangers of distinction who had come to edinburgh to witness the ceremony a vast throng had collected also around the palace mary was led to the altar and then lord darnley was conducted in the marriage ceremony was performed according to the catholic ritual three rings one of them a diamond ring of great value were put upon her finger after the ceremony largess was proclaimed and money distributed among the crowd as had been done in paris at marys former marriage five years before mary then remained to attend the celebration of mass darnley who was not a catholic retiring after the mass mary returned to the palace and changed the mourning dress which she had continued to wear from the time of her first husbands death to that hour for one more becoming a bride the evening was spent in festivities of every kind  we have said that darnley was personally attractive in respect both to his countenance and his manners and unfortunately this is all that can be said in his favor he was weakminded and yet selfconceited and vain the sudden elevation which his marriage with a queen gave him made him proud and he soon began to treat all around him in a very haughty and imperious manner he seems to have been entirely unaccustomed to exercise any selfcommand or to submit to any restraints in the gratification of his passions mary paid him a great many attentions and took great pleasure in conferring upon him as her queenly power enabled her to do distinctions and honors but instead of being grateful for them he received them as matters of course and was continually demanding more there was one title which he wanted and which for some good reason it was necessary to postpone conferring upon him a nobleman came to him one day and informed him of the necessity of this delay he broke into a fit of passion drew his dagger rushed toward the nobleman and attempted to stab him he commenced his imperious and haughty course of procedure even before his marriage and continued it afterward growing more and more violent as his ambition increased with an increase of power mary felt these cruel acts of selfishness and pride very keenly but womanlike she palliated and excused them and loved him still  she had however other trials and cares pressing upon her immediately murray and his confederates organized a formal and open rebellion mary raised an army and took the field against them the country generally took her side a terrible and somewhat protracted civil war ensued but the rebels were finally defeated and driven out of the country they went to england and claimed elizabeths protection saying that she had incited them to the revolt and promised them her aid elizabeth told them that it would not do for her to be supposed to have abetted a rebellion in her cousin marys dominions and that unless they would in the presence of the foreign embassadors at her court disavow her having done so she could not help them or countenance them in any way the miserable men being reduced to a hard extremity made this disavowal elizabeth then said to them now you have told the truth neither i nor any one else in my name incited you against your queen and your abominable treason may set an example to my own subjects to rebel against me so get you gone out of my presence miserable traitors as you are  thus mary triumphed over all the obstacles to her marriage with the man she loved but alas before the triumph was fully accomplished the love was gone darnley was selfish unfeeling and incapable of requiting affection like marys he treated her with the most heartless indifference though she had done every thing to awaken his gratitude and win his love she bestowed upon him every honor which it was in her power to grant she gave him the title of king she admitted him to share with her the powers and prerogatives of the crown there is to this day in marys apartments at holyrood house a double throne which she had made for herself and her husband with their initials worked together in the embroidered covering and each seat surmounted by a crown mankind have always felt a strong sentiment of indignation at the ingratitude which could requite such love

rizzio he was from savoy a country among the alps it was the custom then as it is now for the various governments of europe to have embassadors at the courts of other governments to attend to any negotiations or to the transaction of any other business which might arise between their respective sovereigns these embassadors generally traveled with pomp and parade taking sometimes many attendants with them the embassador from savoy happened to bring with him to scotland in his train this young man rizzio in 1561 that is just about the time that mary herself returned to scotland he was a handsome and agreeable young man but his rank and position were such that for some years he attracted no attention  he was however quite a singer and they used to bring him in sometimes to sing in marys presence with three other singers his voice being a good bass made up the quartette mary saw him in this way and as he was a good french and italian scholar and was amiable and intelligent she gradually became somewhat interested in him mary had at this time among her other officers a french secretary who wrote for her and transacted such other business as required a knowledge of the french language this french secretary went home and mary appointed rizzio to take his place  the native scotchmen in marys court were naturally very jealous of the influence of these foreigners they looked down with special contempt on rizzio considering him of mean rank and position and wholly destitute of all claim to the office of confidential secretary to the queen rizzio increased the difficulty by not acting with the reserve and prudence which his delicate situation required the nobles proud of their own rank and importance were very much displeased at the degree of intimacy and confidence to which mary admitted him they called him an intruder and an upstart when they came in and found him in conversation with the queen or whenever he accosted her freely as he was wont to do in their presence they were irritated and vexed they did not dare to remonstrate with mary but they took care to express their feelings of resentment and scorn to the subject of them in every possible way they scowled upon him they directed to him looks of contempt they turned their backs upon him and jostled him in a rude and insulting manner all this was a year or two before marys marriage  rizzio consulted melville asking his judgment as to what he had better do he said that being marys french secretary he was necessarily a good deal in her company and the nobles seemed displeased with it but he did not see what he could do to diminish or avoid the difficulty melville replied that the nobles had an opinion that he not only performed the duties of french secretary but that he was fast acquiring a great ascendency in respect to all other affairs melville further advised him to be much more cautious in his bearing than he had been to give place to the nobles when they were with him in the presence of the queen to speak less freely and in a more unassuming manner and to explain the whole case to the queen herself that she might cooperate with him in pursuing a course which would soothe and conciliate the irritated and angry feelings of the nobles melville said moreover that he had himself at one time at a court on the continent been placed in a very similar situation to rizzios and had been involved in the same difficulties but had escaped the dangers which threatened him by pursuing himself the course which he now recommended  rizzio seemed to approve of this counsel and promised to follow it but he afterward told melville that he had spoken to the queen on the subject and that she would not consent to any change but wished every thing to go on as it had done now the queen having great confidence in melville had previously requested him that if he saw any thing in her deportment or management or measures which he thought was wrong frankly to let her know it that she might be warned in season and amend he thought that this was an occasion which required this friendly interposition and he took an opportunity to converse with her on the subject in a frank and plain but still very respectful manner he made but little impression mary said that rizzio was only her private french secretary that he had nothing to do with the affairs of the government that consequently his appointment and his office were her own private concern alone and she should continue to act according to her own pleasure in managing her own affairs no matter who was displeased by it  it is probable that the real ground of offense which the nobles had against rizzio was jealousy of his superior influence with the queen they however made his religion a great ground of complaint against him he was a catholic and had come from a strong catholic country having been born in the northern part of italy the italian language was his mother tongue they professed to believe that he was a secret emissary of the pope and was plotting with mary to bring scotland back under the papal dominion  in the mean time rizzio devoted himself with untiring zeal and fidelity to the service of the queen he was indefatigable in his efforts to please her and he made himself extremely useful to her in a thousand different ways in fact his being the object of so much dislike and aversion on the part of others made him more and more exclusively devoted to the queen who seemed to be almost his only friend she too was urged by what she considered the unreasonable and bitter hostility of which her favorite was the object to bestow upon him greater and greater favors in process of time one after another of those about the court finding that rizzios influence and power were great and were increasing began to treat him with respect and to ask for his assistance in gaining their ends thus rizzio found his position becoming stronger and the probability began to increase that he would at length triumph over the enemies who had set their faces so strongly against him  though he had been at first inclined to follow melvilles advice yet he afterward fell in cordially with the policy of the queen which was to press boldly forward and put down with a strong hand the hostility which had been excited against him instead therefore of attempting to conceal the degree of favor which he enjoyed with the queen he boasted of and displayed it he would converse often and familiarly with her in public he dressed magnificently like persons of the highest rank and had many attendants in a word he assumed all the airs and manners of a person of high distinction and commanding influence the external signs of hostility to him were thus put down but the fires of hatred burned none the less fiercely below and only wanted an opportunity to burst into an explosion  things were in this state at the time of the negotiations in respect to darnleys marriage for in order to take up the story of rizzio from the beginning we have been obliged to go back in our narrative rizzio exerted all his influence in favor of the marriage and thus both strengthened his influence with mary and made darnley his friend he did all in his power to diminish the opposition to it from whatever quarter it might come and rendered essential service in the correspondence with france and in the negotiations with the pope for obtaining the necessary dispensation in a word he did a great deal to promote the marriage and to facilitate all the arrangements for carrying it into effect  darnley relied therefore upon rizzios friendship and devotion to his service forgetting that in all these past efforts rizzio was acting out of regard to marys wishes and not to his own as long therefore as mary and darnley continued to pursue the same objects and aims rizzio was the common friend and ally of both the enemies of the marriage however disliked rizzio more than ever  as darnleys character developed itself gradually after his marriage every body began to dislike him also he was unprincipled and vicious as well as imperious and proud his friendship for rizzio was another ground of dislike to him the ancient nobles who had been accustomed to exercise the whole control in the public affairs of scotland found themselves supplanted by this young italian singer and an english boy not yet out of his teens they were exasperated beyond all bounds but yet they contrived for a while to conceal and dissemble their anger  it was not very long after the marriage of mary and darnley before they began to become alienated from each other mary did every thing for her husband which it was reasonable for him to expect her to do she did in fact all that was in her power but he was not satisfied she made him the sharer of her throne he wanted her to give up her place to him and thus make him the sole possessor of it he wanted what was called the crown matrimonial the crown matrimonial denoted power with which according to the old scottish law the husband of a queen could be invested enabling him to exercise the royal prerogative in his own name both during the life of the queen and also after her death during the continuance of his own life this made him in fact a king for life exalting him above his wife the real sovereign through whom alone he derived his powers  now darnley was very urgent to have the crown matrimonial conferred upon him he insisted upon it he would not submit to any delay mary told him that this was something entirely beyond her power to grant the crown matrimonial could only be bestowed by a solemn enactment of the scottish parliament but darnley impatient and reckless like a boy as he was would not listen to any excuse but teased and tormented mary about the crown matrimonial continually  besides the legal difficulties in the way of marys conferring these powers upon darnley by her own act there were other difficulties doubtless in her mind arising from the character of darnley and his unfitness which was every day becoming more manifest to be intrusted with such power only four months after his marriage his rough and cruel treatment of mary became intolerable one day at a house in edinburgh where the king and queen and other persons of distinction had been invited to a banquet darnley as was his custom was beginning to drink very freely and was trying to urge other persons there to drink to excess mary expostulated with him endeavoring to dissuade him from such a course darnley resented these kind cautions and retorted upon her in so violent and brutal a manner as to cause her to leave the room and the company in tears  when they were first married mary had caused her husband to be proclaimed king and had taken some other similar steps to invest him with a share of her own power but she soon found that in doing this she had gone to the extreme of propriety and that for the future she must retreat rather than advance accordingly although he was associated with her in the supreme power she thought it best to keep precedence for her own name before his in the exercise of power on the coins which were struck the inscription was in the name of the queen and king of scotland in signing public documents she insisted on having her name recorded first these things irritated and provoked darnley more and more he was not contented to be admitted to a share of the sovereign power which the queen possessed in her own right alone he wished to supplant her in it entirely  rizzio of course took queen marys part in these questions he opposed the grant of the crown matrimonial he opposed all other plans for increasing or extending in any way darnleys power darnley was very much incensed against him and earnestly desired to find some way to effect his destruction he communicated these feelings to a certain fierce and fearless nobleman named ruthven and asked his assistance to contrive some way to take vengeance upon rizzio  ruthven was very much pleased to hear this he belonged to a party of the lords of the court who also hated rizzio though they had hated darnley besides so much that they had not communicated to him their hostility to the other ruthven and his friends had not joined murray and the other rebels in opposing the marriage of darnley they had chosen to acquiesce in it hoping to maintain an ascendency over darnley regarding him as they did as a mere boy and thus retain their power when they found however that he was so headstrong and unmanageable and that they could do nothing with him they exerted all their influence to have murray and the other exiled lords pardoned and allowed to return hoping to combine with them after their return and then together to make their power superior to that of darnley and rizzio they considered darnley and rizzio both as their rivals and enemies when they found therefore that darnley was plotting rizzios destruction they felt a very strong as well as a very unexpected pleasure  thus among all the jealousies and rivalries and bitter animosities of which the court was at this time the scene the only true and honest attachment of one heart to another seems to have been that of mary to rizzio the secretary was faithful and devoted to the queen and the queen was grateful and kind to the secretary there has been some question whether this attachment was an innocent or a guilty one a painting still hanging in the private rooms which belonged to mary in the palace at holyrood represents rizzio as young and very handsome on the other hand some of the historians of the day to disprove the possibility of any guilty attachment say that he was rather old and ugly we may ourselves perhaps safely infer that unless there were something specially repulsive in his appearance and manner such a heart as marys repelled so roughly from the one whom it was her duty to love could not well have resisted the temptation to seek a retreat and a refuge in the kind devotedness of such a friend as rizzio proved himself to be to her  however this may be ruthven made such suggestions to darnley as goaded him to madness and a scheme was soon formed for putting rizzio to death the plan after being deliberately matured in all its arrangements was carried into effect in the following manner the event occurred early in the spring of 1566 less than a year after marys marriage  morton who was one of the accomplices assembled a large force of his followers consisting it is said of five hundred men which he posted in the evening near the palace and when it was dark he moved them silently into the central court of the palace through the entrance e as marked upon the following plan  illustration plan of that part of

thousands of visitors  footnote g see view of holyrood house page 114 and compare it with this plan  it was about seven oclock in the evening that the conspirators were to execute their purpose morton remained below in the court with his troops to prevent any interruption he held a high office under the queen which authorized him to bring a force into the court of the palace and his doing so did not alarm the inmates ruthven was to head the party which was to commit the crime he was confined to his bed with sickness at the time but he was so eager to have a share in the pleasure of destroying rizzio that he left his bed put on a suit of armor and came forth to the work the armor is preserved in the little apartment which was the scene of the tragedy to this day  mary was at supper two near relatives and friends of hersa gentleman and a ladyand rizzio were with her the room is scarcely large enough to contain a greater number there were however two or three servants in attendance at a sidetable darnley came up about eight oclock to make observations the other conspirators were concealed in his room below and it was agreed that if darnley found any cause for not proceeding with the plan he was to return immediately and give them notice if therefore he should not return after the lapse of a reasonable time they were to follow him up the private staircase prepared to act at once and decidedly as soon as they should enter the room they were to come up by this private staircase in order to avoid being intercepted or delayed by the domestics in attendance in the anteroom r of which there would have been danger if they had ascended by the public staircase at t  finding that darnley did not return ruthven with his party ascended the stairs entered the bedchamber through the little door at d and thence advanced to the door of the cabinet his heavy iron armor clanking as he came the queen alarmed demanded the meaning of this intrusion ruthven whose countenance was grim and ghastly from the conjoined influence of ferocious passion and disease said that they meant no harm to her but they only wanted the villain who stood near her rizzio perceived that his hour was come the attendants flocked in to the assistance of the queen and rizzio ruthvens confederates advanced to join in the attack and there ensued one of those scenes of confusion and terror of which those who witness it have no distinct recollection on looking back upon it when it is over rizzio cried out in an agony of fear and sought refuge behind the queen the queen herself fainted the table was overturned and rizzio having received one wound from a dagger was seized and dragged out through the bedchamber b and through the anteroom r to the door o where he fell down and was stabbed by the murderers again and again till he ceased to breathe  after this scene was over darnley and ruthven came coolly back into marys chamber and as soon as mary recovered her senses began to talk of and to justify their act of violence without however telling her that rizzio had been killed mary was filled with emotions of resentment and grief she bitterly reproached darnley for such an act of cruelty as breaking into her apartment with armed men and seizing and carrying off her friend she told him that she had raised him from his comparatively humble position to make him her husband and now this was his return darnley replied that rizzio had supplanted him in her confidence and thwarted all his plans and that mary had shown herself utterly regardless of his wishes under the influence of rizzio he said that since mary had made herself his wife she ought to have obeyed him and not put herself in such a way under the direction of another mary learned rizzios fate the next day  the violence of the conspirators did not stop with the destruction of rizzio some of marys high officers of government who were in the palace at the time were obliged to make their escape from the windows to avoid being seized by morton and his soldiers in the court among them was the earl bothwell who tried at first to drive morton out but in the end was obliged himself to flee some of these men let themselves down by ropes from the outer windows when the uproar and confusion caused by this struggle was over they found that mary overcome with agitation and terror was showing symptoms of fainting again and they concluded to leave her they informed her that she must consider herself a prisoner and setting a guard at the door of her apartment they went away leaving her to spend the night in an agony of resentment anxiety and fear  lord darnley took the government at once entirely into his own hands he prorogued parliament which was then just commencing a session in his own name alone he organized an administration marys officers having fled in saying that he did these things we mean of course that the conspirators did them in his name he was still but a boy scarcely out of his teens and incapable of any other action in such an emergency but a blind compliance with the wishes of the crafty men who had got him into their power by gratifying his feelings of revenge they took possession of the government in his name and kept mary a close prisoner  the murder was committed on saturday night the next morning of course was sunday melville was going out of the palace about ten oclock as he passed along under the window where mary was confined she called out to him for help he asked her what he could do for her she told him to go to the provost of edinburgh the officer corresponding to the mayor of a city in this country and ask him to call out the city guard and come and release her from her captivity go quick said she or the guards will see you and stop you just then the guards came up and challenged melville he told them he was going to the city to attend church so they let him pass on he went to the provost and delivered marys message the provost said he dared not and could not interfere  so mary remained a prisoner her captivity however was of short duration in two days darnley came to see her he persuaded her that he himself had had nothing to do with the murder of rizzio mary on the other hand persuaded him that it was better for them to be friends to each other than to live thus in a perpetual quarrel she convinced him that ruthven and his confederates were not and could not be his friends they would only make him the instrument of obtaining the objects of their ambition darnley saw this he felt that he as well as mary were in the rebels power they formed a plan to escape together they succeeded they fled to a distant castle and collected a large army the people every where flocking to the assistance of the queen they returned to edinburgh in a short time in triumph the conspirators fled mary then decided to pardon and recall the old rebels and expend her anger henceforth on the new and thus the earl murray her brother was brought back and once more restored to favor  after settling all these troubles mary retired to edinburgh castle where it was supposed she could be best protected and in the month of july following the murder of rizzio she gave birth to a son in this son was afterward accomplished all her fondest wishes for he inherited in the end both the english and scottish crowns     chapter viii  bothwell

misfortune   the earl of bothwell was a man of great energy of character fearless and decided in all that he undertook and sometimes perfectly reckless and uncontrollable he was in scotland at the time of marys return from france but he was so turbulent and unmanageable that he was at one time sent into banishment he was however afterward recalled and again intrusted with power he entered ardently into marys service in her contest with the murderers of rizzio he assisted her in raising an army after her flight and in conquering morton ruthven and the rest and driving them out of the country mary soon began to look upon him as notwithstanding his roughness her best and most efficient friend as a reward for these services she granted him a castle situated in a romantic position on the eastern coast of scotland it was called the castle of dunbar it was on a stormy promontory overlooking the german ocean a very appropriate retreat and fastness for such a man of iron as he  in those days the border country between england and scotland was the resort of robbers freebooters and outlaws from both lands if pursued by one government they could retreat across the line and be safe incursions too were continually made across this frontier by the people of either side to plunder or to destroy whatever property was within reach thus the country became a region of violence and bloodshed which all men of peace and quietness were glad to shun they left it to the possession of men who could find pleasure in such scenes of violence and blood when queen mary had got quietly settled in her government after the overthrow of the murderers of rizzio as she thus no longer needed bothwells immediate aid she sent him to this border country to see if he could enforce some sort of order among its lawless population  the birth of marys son was an event of the greatest importance not only to her personally but in respect to the political prospects of the two great kingdoms for in this infant were combined the claims of succession to both the scotch and english crowns the whole world knew that if elizabeth should die without leaving a direct heir this child would become the monarch both of england and scotland and as such one of the greatest personages in europe his birth therefore was a great event and it was celebrated in scotland with universal rejoicings the tidings of it spread as news of great public interest all over europe even elizabeth pretended to be pleased and sent messages of congratulation to mary but every one thought that they could see in her air and manner when she received the intelligence obvious traces of mortification and chagrin  marys heart was filled at first with maternal pride and joy but her happiness was soon sadly alloyed by darnleys continued unkindness she traveled about during the autumn from castle to castle anxious and ill at ease sometimes darnley followed her and sometimes he amused himself with hunting and with various vicious indulgences at different towns and castles at a distance from her he wanted her to dismiss her ministry and put him into power and he took every possible means to importune or tease her into compliance with this plan at one time he said he had resolved to leave scotland and go and reside in france and he pretended to make his preparations and to be about to take his leave he seems to have thought that mary though he knew that she no longer loved him would be distressed at the idea of being abandoned by one who was after all her husband mary was in fact distressed at this proposal and urged him not to go he seemed determined and took his leave instead of going to france however he only went to stirling castle  darnley finding that he could not accomplish his aims by such methods as these wrote it is said to the catholic governments of europe proposing that if they would cooperate in putting him into power in scotland he would adopt efficient measures for changing the religion of the country from the protestant to the catholic faith he made too every effort to organize a party in his favor in scotland and tried to defeat and counteract the influence of marys government by every means in his power these things and other trials and difficulties connected with them weighed very heavily upon marys mind she sunk gradually into a state of great dejection and despondency she spent many hours in sighing and in tears and often wished that she was in her grave  so deeply in fact was mary plunged into distress and trouble by the state of things existing between herself and darnley that some of her officers of government began to conceive of a plan of having her divorced from him after looking at this subject in all its bearings and consulting about it with each other they ventured at last to propose it to mary she would not listen to any such plan she did not think a divorce could be legally accomplished and then if it were to be done it would she feared in some way or other affect the position and rights of the darling son who was now to her more than all the world besides she would rather endure to the end of her days the tyranny and torment she experienced from her brutal husband than hazard in the least degree the future greatness and glory of the infant who was lying in his cradle before her equally unconscious of the grandeur which awaited him in future years and of the strength of the maternal love which was smiling upon him from amid such sorrow and tears and extending over him such gentle but determined and effectual protection  the sad and sorrowful feelings which mary endured were interrupted for a little time by the splendid pageant of the baptism of the child embassadors came from all the important courts of the continent to do honor to the occasion elizabeth sent the earl of bedford as her embassador with a present of a baptismal font of gold which had cost a sum equal to five thousand dollars the baptism took place at stirling in december with every possible accompaniment of pomp and parade and was followed by many days of festivities and rejoicing the whole country were interested in the event except darnley who declared sullenly while the preparations were making that he should not remain to witness the ceremony but should go off a day or two before the appointed time  the ceremony was performed in the chapel the child was baptized under the names of charles james james charles prince and steward of scotland duke of rothesay earl of carrick lord of the isles and baron of renfrew his subsequent designation in history was james sixth of scotland and first of england a great many appointments of attendants and officers to be attached to the service of the young prince were made immediately most of them of course mere matters of parade among the rest five ladies of distinction were constituted rockers of his cradle the form of the young princes cradle has come down to us in an ancient drawing  illustration prince jamess cradle  in due time after the coronation the various embassadors and delegates returned to their respective courts carrying back glowing accounts of the ceremonies and festivities attendant upon the christening and of the grace and beauty and loveliness of the queen  in the mean time bothwell and murray were competitors for the confidence and regard of the queen and it began to seem probable that bothwell would win the day mary in one of her excursions was traveling in the southern part of the country when she heard that he had been wounded in an encounter with a party of desperadoes near the border moved partly perhaps by compassion and partly by gratitude for his services mary made an expedition across the country to pay him a visit some say that she was animated by a more powerful motive than either of these in fact this as well as almost all the other acts of marys life are presented in very different lights by her friends and her enemies the former say that this visit to her lieutenant in his confinement from a wound received in her service was perfectly proper both in the design itself and in all the circumstances of its execution the latter represent it as an instance of highly indecorous eagerness on the part of a married lady to express to another man a sympathy and kind regard which she had ceased to feel for her husband  bothwell himself was married as well as mary he had been married but a few months to a beautiful lady a few years younger than the queen the question however whether mary did right or wrong in paying this visit to him is not after all a very important one there is no doubt that she and bothwell loved each other before they ought to have done so and it is of comparatively little consequence when the attachment began the end of it is certain bothwell resolved to kill darnley to get divorced from his own wife and to marry the queen the world has never yet settled the question whether she was herself his accomplice or not in the measures he adopted for effecting these plans or whether she only submitted to the result when bothwell by his own unaided efforts reached it each reader must judge of this question for himself from the facts about to be narrated  bothwell first communicated with the nobles about the court to get their consent and approbation to the destruction of the king they all appeared to be very willing to have the thing done but were a little cautious about involving themselves in the responsibility of doing it darnley was thoroughly hated despised and shunned by them all still they were afraid of the consequences of taking his life one of them morton asked bothwell what the queen would think of the plan bothwell said that the queen approved of it morton replied that if bothwell would show him an expression of the queens approval of the plot in her own handwriting he would join it otherwise not bothwell failed to furnish this evidence saying that the queen was really privy to and in favor of the plan but that it was not to be expected that she would commit herself to it in writing was this all true or was the pretense only a desperate measure of bothwells to induce morton to join him  most of the leading men about the court however either joined the plot or so far gave it their countenance and encouragement as to induce bothwell to proceed there were many and strange rumors about darnley one was that he was actually going to leave the country and that a ship was ready for him in the clyde another was that he had a plan for seizing the young prince dethroning mary and reigning himself in her stead in the princes name other strange and desperate schemes were attributed to him in the midst of them news came to mary at holyrood that he was taken suddenly and dangerously sick at glasgow where he was then residing and she immediately went to see him was her motive a desire to make one more attempt to win his confidence and love and to divert him from the desperate measures which she feared he was contemplating or was she acting as an accomplice with bothwell to draw him into the snare in which he was afterward taken and destroyed  the result of marys visit to her husband after some time spent with him in glasgow was a proposal that he should return with her to edinburgh where she could watch over him during his convalescence with greater care this plan was adopted he was conveyed on a sort of litter by very slow and easy stages toward edinburgh he was on such terms with the nobles and lords in attendance upon mary that he was not willing to go to holyrood house besides his disorder was contagious it is supposed to have been the smallpox and though he was nearly recovered there was still some possibility that the royal babe might take the infection if the patient came within the same walls with him so mary sent forward to edinburgh to have a house provided for him  illustration view of edinburgh  the situation of this house is seen near the city wall on the left in the accompanying view of edinburgh holyrood house is the large square edifice in the foreground and the castle crowns the hill in the distance there is now as there was in the days of mary a famous street extending from holyrood house to the castle called the cannon gate at the lower end and the high street above this street with the castle at one extremity and holyrood house at the other were the scenes of many of the most remarkable events described in this narrative  the residence selected was a house of four rooms close upon the city wall the place was called the kirk of field from a kirk or church which formerly stood near there in the fields  this house had two rooms upon the lower floor with a passageway between them one of these rooms was a kitchen the other was appropriated to marys use whenever she was able to be at the place in attendance upon her husband over the kitchen was a room used as a wardrobe and for servants and over marys room was the apartment for darnley there was an opening through the city wall in the rear of this dwelling by which there was access to the kitchen these premises were fitted up for darnley in the most thorough manner a bath was arranged for him in his apartment and every thing was done which could conduce to his comfort according to the ideas which then prevailed darnley was brought to edinburgh conveyed to this house and quietly established there  the following is a plan of the house in which darnley was lodged  illustration plan of the house at the kirk o field  m marys room below darnleys k kitchen servants room above o passage through the city wall into the kitchen s staircase leading to the second story p passageway  the accommodations in this house do not seem to have been very sumptuous after all for a royal guest but royal dwellings in scotland in those days were not what they are now in westminster and at st cloud  the day for the execution of the plan which was to blow up the house where the sick darnley was lying with gunpowder approached bothwell selected a number of desperate characters to aid him in the actual work to be done one of these was a frenchman who had been for a long time in his service and who went commonly by the name of french paris bothwell contrived to get french paris taken into marys service a few days before the murder of darnley and through him he got possession of some of the keys of the house which darnley was occupying and thus had duplicates of them made so that he had access to every part of the house the gunpowder was brought from bothwells castle at dunbar and all was ready  mary spent much of her time at darnleys house and often slept in the room beneath his which had been allotted to her as her apartment one sunday there was to be a wedding at holyrood the bride and bridegroom were favorite servants of marys and she was intending to be present at the celebration of the nuptials she was to leave darnleys early in the evening for this purpose her enemies say that this was all a concerted arrangement between her and bothwell to give him the opportunity to execute his plan her friends on the other hand insist that she knew nothing about it and that bothwell had to watch and wait for such an opportunity of blowing up the house without injuring mary be this as it may the sunday of this wedding was fixed upon for the consummation of the deed  the gunpowder had been secreted in bothwells rooms at the palace on sunday evening as soon as it was dark bothwell set the men at work to transport the gunpowder they brought it out in bags from the palace and then employed a horse to transport it to the wall of some gardens which were in the rear of darnleys house they had to go twice with the horse in order to convey all the gunpowder that they had provided while this was going on bothwell who kept out of sight was walking to and fro in an adjoining street to receive intelligence from time to time of the progress of the affair and to issue orders the gunpowder was conveyed across the gardens to the rear of the house taken in at a back door and deposited in the room marked m in the plan which was the room belonging to mary mary was all this time directly over head in darnleys chamber  the plan of the conspirators was to put the bags of gunpowder into a cask which they had provided for the occasion to keep the mass together and increase the force of the explosion the cask had been provided and placed in the gardens behind the house but on attempting to take it into the house they found it too big to pass through the back door this caused considerable delay and bothwell growing impatient came with his characteristic impetuosity to ascertain the cause by his presence and his energy he soon remedied the difficulty in some way or other and completed the arrangements the gunpowder was all deposited the men were dismissed except two who were left to watch and who were locked up with the gunpowder in marys room and then all things being ready for the explosion as soon as mary should be gone bothwell walked up to darnleys room above and joined the party who were supping there the cool effrontery of this proceeding has scarcely a parallel in the annals of crime  at eleven oclock mary rose to go saying she must return to the palace to take part as she had promised to do in the celebration of her servants wedding mary took leave of her husband in a very affectionate manner and went away in company with bothwell and the other nobles her enemies maintain that she was privy to all the arrangements which had been made and that she did not go into her own apartment below knowing very well what was there but even if we imagine that mary was aware of the general plan of destroying her husband and was secretly pleased with it as almost any royal personage that ever lived under such circumstances would be we need not admit that she was acquainted with the details of the mode by which the plan was to be put in execution the most that we can suppose such a man as bothwell would have communicated to her would be some dark and obscure intimations of his design made in order to satisfy himself that she would not really oppose it to ask her woman as she was to take any part in such a deed or to communicate to her beforehand any of the details of the arrangement would have been an act of littleness and meanness which such magnanimous monsters as bothwell are seldom guilty of  besides mary remarked that evening in darnleys room in the course of conversation that it was just about a year since rizzios death on entering her palace too at holyrood that night she met one of bothwells servants who had been carrying the bags and perceiving the smell of gunpowder she asked him what it meant now mary was not the brazenfaced sort of woman to speak of such things at such a time if she was really in the councils of the conspirators the only question seems to be therefore not whether she was a party to the actual deed of murder but only whether she was aware of and consenting to the general design  in the mean time mary and bothwell went together into the hall where the servants were rejoicing and making merry at the wedding french paris was there but his heart began to fail him in respect to the deed in which he had been engaged he stood apart with a countenance expressive of anxiety and distress bothwell went to him and told him that if he carried such a melancholy face as that any longer in the presence of the queen he would make him suffer for it the poor consciencestricken man begged bothwell to release him from any further part in the transaction he was sick really sick he said and he wanted to go home to his bed bothwell made no reply but to order him to follow him bothwell went to his own rooms changed the silken court dress in which he had appeared in company for one suitable to the night and to the deed directed his men to follow him and passed from the palace toward the gates of the city the gates were shut for it was midnight the sentinels challenged them the party said they were friends to my lord bothwell and were allowed to pass on  they advanced to the convent gardens here they left a part of their number while bothwell and french paris passed over the wall and crept softly into the house they unlocked the room where they had left the two watchmen with the gunpowder and found all safe men locked up under such circumstances and on the eve of the perpetration of such a deed were not likely to sleep at their posts all things being now ready they made a slow match of lint long enough to burn for some little time and inserting one end of it into the gunpowder they lighted the other end and crept stealthily out of the apartment they passed over the wall into the convent gardens where they rejoined their companions and awaited the result  men choose midnight often for the perpetration of crime from the facilities afforded by its silence and solitude this advantage is however sometimes wellnigh balanced by the stimulus which its mysterious solemnity brings to the stings of remorse and terror bothwell himself felt anxious and agitated they waited and waited but it seemed as if their dreadful suspense would never end bothwell became desperate he wanted to get over the wall again and look in at the window to see if the slow match had not gone out the rest restrained him at length the explosion came like a clap of thunder the flash brightened for an instant over the whole sky and the report roused the sleeping inhabitants of edinburgh from their slumbers throwing the whole city into sudden consternation  the perpetrators of the deed finding that their work was done fled immediately they tried various plans to avoid the sentinels at the gates of the city as well as the persons who were beginning to come toward the scene of the explosion when they reached the palace of holyrood they were challenged by the sentinel on duty there they said that they were friends of earl bothwell bringing dispatches to him from the country the sentinel asked them if they knew what was the cause of that loud explosion they said they did not and passed on  bothwell went to his room called for a drink undressed himself and went to bed half an hour afterward messengers came to awaken him and inform him that the kings house had been blown up with gunpowder and the king himself killed by the explosion he rose with an appearance of great astonishment and indignation and after conferring with some of the other nobles concluded to go and communicate the event to the queen the queen was overwhelmed with astonishment and indignation too  the destruction of darnley in such a manner as this of course produced a vast sensation all over scotland every body was on the alert to discover the authors of the crime rewards were offered proclamations were made rumors began to circulate that bothwell was the criminal he was accused by anonymous placards put up at night in edinburgh lennox darnleys father demanded his trial and a trial was ordered the circumstances of the trial were such however and bothwells power and desperate recklessness were so great that lennox when the time came did not appear he said he had not force enough at his command to come safely into court there being no testimony offered bothwell was acquitted and he immediately afterward issued his proclamation offering to fight any man who should intimate in any way that he was concerned in the murder of the king thus bothwell established his innocence at least no man dared to gainsay it  darnley was murdered in february bothwell was tried and acquitted in april immediately afterward he took measures for privately making known to the leading nobles that it was his design to marry the queen and for securing their concurrence in the plan they concurred or at least perhaps for fear of displeasing such a desperado said what he understood to mean that they concurred the queen heard the reports of such a design and said as ladies often do in similar cases that she did not know what people meant by such reports there was no foundation for them whatever  toward the end of april mary was about returning from the castle of stirling to edinburgh with a small escort of troops and attendants melville was in her train bothwell set out at the head of a force of more than five hundred men to intercept her mary lodged one night on her way at linlithgow the palace where she was born and the next morning was quietly pursuing her journey when bothwell came up at the head of his troops resistance was vain bothwell advanced to marys horse and taking the bridle led her away a few of her principal followers were taken prisoners too and the rest were dismissed bothwell took his captive across the country by a rapid flight to his castle of dunbar the attendants who were taken with her were released and she remained in the castle of dunbar for ten days entirely in bothwells power  illustration dunbar castlethe residence of earl bothwell  according to the account which mary herself gives of what took place during this captivity she at first reproached bothwell bitterly for the ungrateful and cruel return he was making for all her kindness to him by such a deed of violence and wrong and begged and entreated him to let her go bothwell replied that he knew that it was wrong for him to treat his sovereign so rudely but that he was impelled to it by the circumstances of the case and by love which he felt for her which was too strong for him to control he then entreated her to become his wife he complained of the bitter hostility which he had always been subject to from his enemies and that he could have no safeguard from this hostility in time to come but in her favor and he could not depend upon any assurance of her favor less than her making him her husband he protested that if she would do so he would never ask to share her power but would be content to be her faithful and devoted servant as he had always been it was love not ambition he said that animated him and he could not and would not be refused mary says that she was distressed and agitated beyond measure by the appeals and threats with which bothwell accompanied his urgent entreaties she tried every way to plan some mode of escape nobody came to her rescue she was entirely alone and in bothwells power bothwell assured her that the leading nobles of her court were in favor of the marriage and showed her a written agreement signed by them to this effect at length wearied and exhausted she was finally overcome by his urgency and yielding partly to his persuasions and partly as she says to force gave herself up to his power  mary remained at dunbar about ten days during which time bothwell sued out and obtained a divorce from his wife his wife feeling perhaps resentment more than grief sued at the same time for a divorce from him bothwell then sallied forth from his fastness at dunbar and taking mary with him went to edinburgh and took up his abode in the castle there as that fortress was then under his power mary soon after appeared in public and stated that she was now entirely free and that although bothwell had done wrong in carrying her away by violence still he had treated her since in so respectful a manner that she had pardoned him and had received him into favor again a short time after this they were married the ceremony was performed in a very private and unostentatious manner and took place in may about three months after the murder of darnley  by some persons marys account of the transactions at dunbar is believed others think that the whole affair was all a preconcerted plan and that the appearance of resistance on her part was only for show to justify in some degree in the eyes of the world so imprudent and inexcusable a marriage a great many volumes have been written on the question without making any progress toward a settlement of it it is one of those cases where the evidence being complicated conflicting and incomplete the mind is swayed by the feelings and the readers of the story decide more or less favorably for the unhappy queen according to the warmth of the interest awakened in their hearts by beauty and misfortune     chapter ix  the fall of bothwell  1567  marys infatuationexcuses for hermarys deep depressioninterposition of the king of

miserable end   the course which mary pursued after her liberation from dunbar in yielding to bothwells wishes pardoning his violence receiving him again into favor and becoming his wife is one of the most extraordinary instances of the infatuation produced by love that has ever occurred if the story had been fiction instead of truth it would have been pronounced extravagant and impossible as it was the whole country was astonished and confounded at such a rapid succession of desperate and unaccountable crimes mary herself seems to have been hurried through these terrible scenes in a sort of delirium of excitement produced by the strange circumstances of the case and the wild and uncontrollable agitations to which they gave rise  such was however at the time and such continues to be still the feeling of interest in marys character and misfortunes that but few open and direct censures of her conduct were then or have been since expressed people execrated bothwell but they were silent in respect to mary it was soon plain however that she had greatly sunk in their regard and that the more they reflected upon the circumstances of the case the deeper she was sinking when the excitement too began to pass away from her own mind it left behind it a gnawing inquietude and sense of guilt which grew gradually more and more intense until at length she sunk under the stings of remorse and despair  her sufferings were increased by the evidences which were continually coming to her mind of the strong degree of disapprobation with which her conduct began soon every where to be regarded wherever scotchmen traveled they found themselves reproached with the deeds of violence and crime of which their country had been the scene marys relatives and friends in france wrote to her expressing their surprise and grief at such proceedings the king of france had sent a short time before a special embassador for the purpose of doing something if possible to discover and punish the murderers of darnley his name was le croc he was an aged and venerable man of great prudence and discretion well qualified to discover and pursue the way of escape from the difficulties in which mary had involved herself if any such way could be found he arrived before the day of marys marriage but he refused to take any part or even to be present at the ceremony  in the mean time bothwell continued in edinburgh castle for a while under the protection of a strong guard people considered this guard as intended to prevent marys escape and many thought that she was detained after all against her will and that her admissions that she was free were only made at the instigation of bothwell and from fear of his terrible power the other nobles and the people of scotland began to grow more and more uneasy the fear of bothwell began to be changed into hatred and the more powerful nobles commenced forming plans for combining together and rescuing as they said mary out of his power  bothwell made no attempts to conciliate them he assumed an air and tone of defiance he increased his forces he conceived the plan of going to stirling castle to seize the young prince who was residing there under the charge of persons to whom his education had been intrusted he said to his followers that james should never do any thing to avenge his fathers death if he could once get him into his hands the other nobles formed a league to counteract these designs they began to assemble their forces and every thing threatened an outbreak of civil war  the marriage took place about the middle of may and within a fortnight from that time the lines began to be pretty definitely drawn between the two great parties the queen and bothwell on one side and the insurgent nobles on the other each party claiming to be friends of the queen whatever was done on bothwells side was of course in the queens name though it is very doubtful how far she was responsible for what was done or how far on the other hand she merely aided under the influence of a species of compulsion in carrying into execution bothwells measures we must say in narrating the history that the queen did this and that and must leave the reader to judge whether it was herself or bothwell acting through her who was the real agent in the transactions described  stirling castle where the young prince was residing is northwest of edinburgh the confederate lords were assembling in that vicinity the border country between england and scotland is of course south in the midst of this border country is the ancient town of melrose where there was in former days a very rich and magnificent abbey the ruins of which to this day form one of the most attractive objects of interest in the whole island of great britain the region is now the abode of peace and quietness and plenty though in marys day it was the scene of continual turmoil and war it is now the favorite retreat of poets and philosophers who seek their residences there on account of its stillness and peace sir walter scotts abbotsford is a few miles from melrose  about a fortnight after marys marriage she issued a proclamation ordering the military chiefs in her kingdom to assemble at melrose with their followers to accompany her on an expedition through the border country to suppress some disorders there the nobles considered this as only a scheme of bothwells to draw them away from the neighborhood of stirling so that he might go and get possession of the young prince rumors of this spread around the country and the forces instead of proceeding to melrose began to assemble in the neighborhood of stirling for the protection of the prince the lords under whose banners they gathered assumed the name of the princes lords and they called upon the people to take up arms in defense of young jamess person and rights the princes lords soon began to concentrate their forces about edinburgh and bothwell was alarmed for his safety he had reason to fear that the governor of edinburgh castle was on their side and that he might suddenly sally forth with a body of his forces down the high street to holyrood and take him prisoner he accordingly began to think it necessary to retreat  now bothwell had among his other possessions a certain castle called borthwick castle a few miles south of edinburgh it was situated on a little swell of land in a beautiful valley it was surrounded with groves of trees and from the windows and walls of the castle there was an extended view over the beautiful and fertile fields of the valley this castle was extensive and strong it consisted of one great square tower surrounded and protected by walls and bastions and was approached by a drawbridge in the sudden emergency in which bothwell found himself placed this fortress seemed to be the most convenient and the surest retreat on the 6th of june he accordingly left edinburgh with as large a force as he had at command and rode rapidly across the country with the queen and established himself at borthwick  the princes lords taking fresh courage from the evidence of bothwells weakness and fear immediately marched from stirling passed by edinburgh and almost immediately after bothwell and the queen had got safely as they imagined established in the place of their retreat they found their castle surrounded and hemmed in on all sides by hostile forces which filled the whole valley the castle was strong but not strong enough to withstand a siege from such an army bothwell accordingly determined to retreat to his castle of dunbar which being on a rocky promontory jutting into the sea and more remote from the heart of the country was less accessible and more safe than borthwick he contrived though with great difficulty to make his escape with the queen through the ranks of his enemies it is said that the queen was disguised in male attire at any rate they made their escape they reached dunbar and mary or bothwell in her name immediately issued a proclamation calling upon all her faithful subjects to assemble in arms to deliver her from her dangers at the same time the princes lords issued their proclamation calling upon all faithful subjects to assemble with them to aid them in delivering the queen from the tyrant who held her captive  the faithful subjects were at a loss which proclamation to obey by far the greater number joined the insurgents some thousands however went to dunbar with this force the queen and bothwell sallied forth about the middle of june to meet the princes lords or the insurgents as they called them to settle the question at issue by the kind of ballot with which such questions were generally settled in those days  mary had a proclamation read at the head of her army now that she supposed she was on the eve of battle in which she explained the causes of the quarrel the proclamation stated that the marriage was marys free act and that although it was in some respects an extraordinary one still the circumstances were such that she could not do otherwise than she had done for ten days she had been in bothwells power in his castle at dunbar and not an arm had been raised for her deliverance her subjects ought to have interposed then if they were intending really to rescue her from bothwells power they had done nothing then but now when she had been compelled by the cruel circumstances of her condition to marry bothwellwhen the act was done and could no longer be recalled they had taken up arms against her and compelled her to take the field in her own defense  the army of the princes lords with marys most determined enemies at their head advanced to meet the queens forces the queen finally took her post on an elevated piece of ground called carberry hill carberry is an old scotch name for gooseberry carberry hill is a few miles to the eastward of edinburgh near dalkeith here the two armies were drawn up opposite to each other in hostile array  le croc the aged and venerable french embassador made a great effort to effect an accommodation and prevent a battle he first went to the queen and obtained authority from her to offer terms of peace and then went to the camp of the princes lords and proposed that they should lay down their arms and submit to the queens authority and that she would forgive and forget what they had done they replied that they had done no wrong and asked for no pardon that they were not in arms against the queens authority but in favor of it they sought only to deliver her from the durance in which she was held and to bring to punishment the murderers of her husband whoever they might be le croc went back and forth several times vainly endeavoring to effect an accommodation and finally giving up in despair he returned to edinburgh leaving the contending parties to settle the contest in their own way  bothwell now sent a herald to the camp of his enemies challenging any one of them to meet him and settle the question of his guilt or innocence by single combat this proposition was not quite so absurd in those days as it would be now for it was not an uncommon thing in the middle ages to try in this way questions of crime many negotiations ensued on bothwells proposal one or two persons expressed themselves ready to accept the challenge bothwell objected to them on account of their rank being inferior to his but said he would fight morton if morton would accept his challenge morton had been his accomplice in the murder of darnley but had afterward joined the party of bothwells foes it would have been a singular spectacle to see one of these confederates in the commission of a crime contending desperately in single combat to settle the question of the guilt or innocence of the other  the combat however did not take place after many negotiations on the subject the plan was abandoned each party charging the other with declining the contest the queen and bothwell in the mean time found such evidences of strength on the part of their enemies and felt probably in their own hearts so much of that faintness and misgiving under which human energy almost always sinks when the tide begins to turn against it after the commission of wrong that they began to feel disheartened and discouraged the queen sent to the opposite camp with a request that a certain personage the laird of grange in whom all parties had great confidence should come to her that she might make one more effort at reconciliation grange after consulting with the princes lords made a proposition to mary which she finally concluded to accept it was as follows  they proposed that mary should come over to their camp not saying very distinctly whether she was to come as their captive or as their queen the event showed that it was in the former capacity that they intended to receive her though they were probably willing that she should understand that it was in the latter at all events the proposition itself did not make it very clear what her position would be and the poor queen distracted by the difficulties which surrounded her and overwhelmed with agitation and fear could not press very strongly for precise stipulations in respect to bothwell they compromised the question by agreeing that as he was under suspicion in respect to the murder of darnley he should not accompany the queen but should be dismissed upon the field that is allowed to depart without molestation wherever he should choose to go this plan was finally adopted the queen bade bothwell farewell and he went away reluctantly and in great apparent displeasure he had in fact with his characteristic ferocity attempted to shoot grange pending the negotiation he mounted his horse and with a few attendants rode off and sought a retreat once more upon his rock at dunbar  from all the evidence which has come down to us it seems impossible to ascertain whether mary desired to be released from bothwells power and was glad when the release came or whether she still loved him and was planning a reunion so soon as a reunion should be possible one party at that time maintained and a large class of writers and readers since have concurred in the opinion that mary was in love with bothwell before darnleys death that she connived with him in the plan for darnleys murder that she was a consenting party to the abduction and the spending of the ten days at dunbar castle in his power that the marriage was the end at which she herself as well as bothwell had been all the time aiming and then when at last she surrendered herself to the princes lords at carberry hill it was only yielding unwillingly to the necessity of a temporary separation from her lawless husband with a view of reinstating him in favor and power at the earliest opportunity  another party both among her people at the time and among the writers and readers who have since paid attention to her story think that she never loved bothwell and that though she valued his services as a bold and energetic soldier she had no collusion with him whatever in respect to darnleys murder they think that though she must have felt in some sense relieved of a burden by darnleys death she did not in any degree aid in or justify the crime and that she had no reason for supposing that bothwell had any share in the commission of it they think also that her consenting to marry bothwell is to be accounted for by her natural desire to seek shelter under some wing or other from the terrible storms which were raging around her and being deserted as she thought by every body else and moved by his passionate love and devotion she imprudently gave herself to him that she lamented the act as soon as it was done but that it was then too late to retrieve the step and that harassed and in despair she knew not what to do but that she hailed the rising of her nobles as affording the only promise of deliverance and came forth from dunbar to meet them with the secret purpose of delivering herself into their hands  the question which of these two suppositions is the correct one has been discussed a great deal without the possibility of arriving at any satisfactory conclusion a parcel of letters were produced by marys enemies some time after this which they said were marys letters to bothwell before her husband darnleys death they say they took the letters from a man named dalgleish one of bothwells servants who was carrying them from holyrood to dunbar castle just after mary and bothwell fled to borthwick they were contained in a small gilded box or coffer with the letter f upon it under a crown which mark naturally suggests to our minds marys first husband francis the king of france dalgleish said that bothwell sent him for this box charging him to convey it with all care to dunbar castle the letters purport to be from mary to bothwell and to have been written before darnleys death they evince a strong affection for the person to whom they are addressed and seem conclusively to prove the unlawful attachment between the parties provided that their genuineness is acknowledged but this genuineness is denied marys friends maintain that they are forgeries prepared by her enemies to justify their own wrong many volumes have been written on the question of the genuineness of these love letters as they are called and there is perhaps now no probability that the question will ever be settled  whatever doubt there may be about these things there is none about the events which followed after mary had surrendered herself to her nobles they took her to the camp she herself riding on horseback and grange walking by her side as she advanced to meet the nobles who had combined against her she said to them that she had concluded to come over to them not from fear or from doubt what the issue would have been if she had fought the battle but only because she wanted to spare the effusion of christian blood especially the blood of her own subjects she had therefore decided to submit herself to their counsels trusting that they would treat her as their rightful queen the nobles made little reply to this address but prepared to return to edinburgh with their prize  the people of edinburgh who had heard what turn the affair had taken flocked out upon the roads to see the queen return they lined the waysides to gaze upon the great cavalcade as it passed the nobles who conducted mary thus back toward her capital had a banner prepared or allowed one to be prepared on which was a painting representing the dead body of darnley and the young prince james kneeling near him and calling on god to avenge his cause mary came on in the procession after this symbol they might perhaps say that it was not intended to wound her feelings and was not of a nature to do it unless she considered herself as taking sides with the murderers of her husband she however knew very well that she was so regarded by great numbers of the populace assembled and that the effect of such an effigy carried before her was to hold her up to public obloquy the populace did in fact taunt and reproach her as she proceeded and she rode into edinburgh evincing all the way extreme mental suffering by her agitation and her tears  she expected that they were at least to take her to holyrood but no they turned at the gate to enter the city mary protested earnestly against this and called half frantic on all who heard her to come to her rescue but no one interfered they took her to the provosts house and lodged her there for the night and the crowd which had assembled to observe these proceedings gradually dispersed there seemed however in a day or two to be some symptoms of a reaction in favor of the fallen queen and to guard against the possibility of a rescue the lords took mary to holyrood again and began immediately to make arrangements for some more safe place of confinement still  in the mean time bothwell went from carberry hill to his castle at dunbar revolving moodily in his mind his altered fortunes after some time he found himself not safe in this place of refuge and so he retreated to the north to some estates he had there in the remote highlands a detachment of forces was sent in pursuit of him now there are north of scotland some groups of dismal islands the summits of submerged mountains and rocks rising in dark and sublime but gloomy grandeur from the midst of cold and tempestuous seas bothwell finding himself pursued undertook to escape by ship to these islands his pursuers headed by grange who had negotiated at carberry for the surrender of the queen embarked in other vessels and pressed on after him at one time they almost overtook him and would have captured him and all his company were it not that they got entangled among some shoals granges sailors said they must not proceed grange eager to seize his prey insisted on their making sail and pressing forward the consequence was they ran the vessels aground and bothwell escaped in a small boat as it was however they seized some of his accomplices and brought them back to edinburgh these men were afterward tried and some of them were executed and it was at their trial and through the confessions they made that the facts were brought to light which have been related in this narrative  bothwell now a fugitive and an exile but still retaining his desperate and lawless character became a pirate and attempted to live by robbing the commerce of the german ocean rumor is the only historian in ordinary cases to record the events in the life of a pirate and she in this case sent word from time to time to scotland of the robberies and murders that the desperado committed of an expedition fitted out against him by the king of denmark of his being taken and carried into a danish port of his being held in imprisonment for a long period there in a gloomy dungeon of his restless spirit chafing itself in useless struggles against his fate and sinking gradually at last under the burdens of remorse for past crimes and despair of any earthly deliverance of his insanity and finally of his miserable end     chapter x  loch leven castle  15671568  grange of kircaldymarys letterremoval of marya ride at nightloch leven castlethe square towerplan of loch leven castlelady douglaslady

man of integrity and honor and he having been the negotiator through whose intervention mary gave herself up felt himself bound to see that the stipulations on the part of the nobles should be honorably fulfilled he did all in his power to protect mary from insult on the journey and he struck with his sword and drove away some of the populace who were addressing her with taunts and reproaches when he found that the nobles were confining her and treating her so much more like a captive than like a queen he remonstrated with them they silenced him by showing him a letter which they said they had intercepted on its way from mary to bothwell it was written they said on the night of marys arrival at edinburgh it assured bothwell that she retained an unaltered affection for him that her consenting to be separated from him at carberry hill was a matter of mere necessity and that she should rejoin him as soon as it was in her power to do so this letter showed they said that after all mary was not as they had supposed bothwells captive and victim but that she was his accomplice and friend and that now that they had discovered their mistake they must treat mary as well as bothwell as an enemy and take effectual means to protect themselves from the one as well as from the other marys friends maintain that this letter was a forgery  they accordingly took mary as has been already stated from the provosts house in edinburgh down to holyrood house which was just without the city this however was only a temporary change that night they came into the palace and directed mary to rise and put on a traveling dress which they brought her they did not tell her where she was to go but simply ordered her to follow them it was midnight they took her forth from the palace mounted her upon a horse and with ruthven and lindsay two of the murderers of rizzio for an escort they rode away they traveled all night crossed the river forth and arrived in the morning at the castle of loch leven  the castle of loch leven is on a small island in the middle of the loch it is nearly north from edinburgh the castle buildings covered at that time about one half of the island the water coming up to the walls on three sides on the other side was a little land which was cultivated as a garden the buildings inclosed a considerable area there was a great square tower marked on the plan below which was the residence of the family it consisted of four or five rooms one over the other the cellar or rather what would be the cellar in other cases was a dungeon for such prisoners as were to be kept in close confinement the only entrance to this building was through a window in the second story by means of a ladder which was raised and let down by a chain this was over the point marked e on the plan the chain was worked at a window in the story above there were various other apartments and structures about the square and among them there was a small octagonal tower in the corner at m which consisted within of one room over another for three stories and a flat roof with battlements above in the second story there was a window w looking upon the water this was the only window having an external aspect in the whole fortress all the other openings in the exterior walls being mere loopholes and embrasures  the following is a general plan of loch leven castleh  illustration plan of loch leven castle  footnote h compare this plan with the view of the castle page 236  this castle was in possession of a certain personage styled the lady douglas she was the mother of the lord james afterward the earl of murray who has figured so conspicuously in this history as marys half brother and at first her friend and counselor though afterward her foe lady douglas was commonly called the lady of loch leven she maintained that she had been lawfully married to james v marys father and that consequently her son and not mary was the rightful heir to the crown of course she was marys natural enemy they selected her castle as the place of marys confinement partly on this account and partly on account of its inaccessible position in the midst of the waters of the lake they delivered the captive queen accordingly to the lady douglas and her husband charging them to keep her safely the lady douglas received her and locked her up in the octagonal tower with the window looking out upon the water  in the mean time all scotland took sides for or against the queen the strongest party were against her and the church was against her on account of their hostility to the catholic religion a sort of provisional government was instituted which assumed the management of public affairs mary had however some friends and they soon began to assemble in order to see what could be done for her cause their rendezvous was at the palace of hamilton this palace was situated on a plain in the midst of a beautiful park near the river clyde a few miles from glasgow the duke of hamilton was prominent among the supporters of the queen and made his house their headquarters they were often called from this circumstance the hamilton lords  on the other hand the party opposed to mary made the castle of stirling their headquarters because the young prince was there in whose name they were proposing soon to assume the government their plan was to depose mary or induce her to abdicate the throne and then to make murray regent to govern the country in the name of the prince until the prince should become of age during all this time murray had been absent in france but they now sent urgent messages to him to return he obeyed the summons and turned his face toward scotland  in the mean time mary continued in confinement in her little tower she was not treated like a common prisoner but had in some degree the attentions due to her rank there were five or six female and about as many male attendants though if the rooms which are exhibited to visitors at the present day as the apartments which she occupied are really such her quarters were very contracted they consist of small apartments of an octagonal form one over the other with tortuous and narrow staircases in the solid wall to ascend from one to the other the roof and the floors of the tower are now gone but the stairways the capacious fireplaces the loopholes and the one window remain enabling the visitor to reconstruct the dwelling in imagination and even to fancy mary herself there again seated on the stone seat by the window looking over the water at the distant hills and sighing to be free  the hamilton lords were not strong enough to attempt her rescue the weight of influence and power throughout the country went gradually and irresistibly into the other scale there were great debates among the authorities of government as to what should be done the hamilton lords made proposals in behalf of mary which the government could not accede to other proposals were made by different parties in the councils of the insurgent nobles some more and some less hard for the captive queen the conclusion however finally was to urge mary to resign her crown in favor of her son and to appoint murray when he should return to act as regent till the prince should be of age  they accordingly sent commissioners to loch leven to propose these measures to the queen there were three instruments of abdication prepared for her to sign by one she resigned the crown in favor of her son by the second she appointed murray to be regent as soon as he should return from france by the third she appointed commissioners to govern the country until murray should return they knew that mary would be extremely unwilling to sign these papers and yet that they must contrive in some way to obtain her signature without any open violence for the signature to be of legal force must be in some sense her voluntary act  the two commissioners whom they sent to her were melville and lindsay melville was a thoughtful and a reasonable man who had long been in marys service and who possessed a great share of her confidence and good will lindsay was on the other hand of an overbearing and violent temper of very rude speech and demeanor and was known to be unfriendly to the queen they hoped that mary would be induced to sign the papers by melvilles gentle persuasions if not lindsay was to see what he could do by denunciations and threats  when the two commissioners arrived at the castle melville alone went first into the presence of the queen he opened the subject to her in a gentle and respectful manner he laid before her the distracted state of scotland the uncertain and vague suspicions floating in the public mind on the subject of darnleys murder and the irretrievable shade which had been thrown over her position by the unhappy marriage with bothwell and he urged her to consent to the proposed measures as the only way now left to restore peace to the land mary heard him patiently but replied that she could not consent to his proposal by doing so she should not only sacrifice her own rights and degrade herself from the position she was entitled to occupy but she should in some sense acknowledge herself guilty of the charges brought against her and justify her enemies  melville finding that his efforts were vain called lindsay in he entered with a fierce and determined air mary was reminded of the terrible night when he and ruthven broke into her little supperroom at holyrood in quest of rizzio she was agitated and alarmed lindsay assailed her with denunciations and threats of the most violent character there ensued a scene of the most rough and ferocious passion on the one side and of anguish terror and despair on the other which is said to have made this day the most wretched of all the wretched days of marys life sometimes she sat pale motionless and almost stupefied at others she was overwhelmed with sorrow and tears she finally yielded and taking the pen she signed the papers lindsay and melville took them left the castle gate entered their boat and were rowed away to the shore  this was on the 25th of july 1567 and four days afterward the young prince was crowned at stirling his title was james vi lindsay made oath at the coronation that he was a witness of marys abdication of the crown in favor of her son and that it was her own free and voluntary act james was about one year old the coronation took place in the chapel where mary had been crowned in her infancy about twentyfive years before mary herself though unconscious of her own coronation mourned bitterly over that of her son unhappy mother how little was she aware when her heart was filled with joy and gladness at his birth that in one short year his mere existence would furnish to her enemies the means of consummating and sealing her ruin  on returning from the chapel to the state apartments of the castle after the coronation the noblemen by whom the infant had been crowned walked in solemn procession bearing the badges and insignia of the newlyinvested royalty one carried the crown morton who was to exercise the government until murray should return followed with the scepter and a third bore the infant king who gazed about unconsciously upon the scene regardless alike of his mothers lonely wretchedness and of his own new scepter and crown  in the mean time murray was drawing near toward the confines of scotland he was somewhat uncertain how to act having been absent for some time in france and on the continent he was not certain how far the people of scotland were really and cordially in favor of the revolution which had been effected marys friends might claim that her acts of abdication having been obtained while she was under duress were null and void and if they were strong enough they might attempt to reinstate her upon the throne in this case it would be better for him not to have acted with the insurgent government at all to gain information on these points murray sent to melville to come and meet him on the border melville came the result of their conferences was that murray resolved to visit mary in her tower before he adopted any decisive course  murray accordingly journeyed northward to loch leven and embarking in the boat which plied between the castle and the shore he crossed the sheet of water and was admitted into the fortress he had a long interview with mary alone at the sight of her longabsent brother who had been her friend and guide in her early days of prosperity and happiness and who had accompanied her through so many changing scenes and who now returned after his long separation from her to find her a lonely and wretched captive involved in irretrievable ruin if not in acknowledged guilt she was entirely overcome by her emotions she burst into tears and could not speak what further passed at this interview was never precisely known they parted tolerably good friends however and yet murray immediately assumed the government by which it is supposed that he succeeded in persuading mary that such a step was now best for her sake as well as for that of all others concerned  murray however did not fail to warn her as he himself states in a very serious manner against any attempt to change her situation madam said he i will plainly declare to you what the sources of danger are from which i think you have most to apprehend first any attempt of whatever kind that you may make to create disturbance in the country through friends that may still adhere to your cause and to interfere with the government of your son secondly devising or attempting any plan of escape from this island thirdly taking any measures for inducing the queen of england or the french king to come to your aid and lastly persisting in your attachment to earl bothwell he warned mary solemnly against any and all of these and then took his leave he was soon after proclaimed regent a parliament was assembled to sanction all the proceedings and the new government was established apparently upon a firm foundation  mary remained during the winter in captivity earnestly desiring however notwithstanding murrays warning to find some way of escape she knew that there must be many who had remained friends to her cause she thought that if she could once make her escape from her prison these friends would rally around her and that she could thus perhaps regain her throne again but strictly watched as she was and in a prison which was surrounded by the waters of a lake all hope of escape seemed to be taken away  now there were in the family of the lord douglas at the castle two young men george and william douglas the oldest george was about twentyfive years of age and the youngest was seventeen george was the son of lord and lady douglas who kept the castle william was an orphan boy a relative who having no home had been received into the family these young men soon began to feel a strong interest in the beautiful captive confined in their fathers castle and before many months this interest became so strong that they began to feel willing to incur the dangers and responsibilities of aiding her in effecting her escape they had secret conferences with mary on the subject they went to the shore on various pretexts and contrived to make their plans known to marys friends that they might be ready to receive her in case they should succeed  the plan at length was ripe for execution it was arranged thus the castle not being large there was not space within its walls for all the accommodations required for its inmates much was done on the shore where there was quite a little village of attendants and dependents pertaining to the castle this little village has since grown into a flourishing manufacturing town where a great variety of plaids and tartans and other scotch fabrics are made its name is kinross communication with this part of the shore was then as now kept up by boats which generally then belonged to the castle though now to the town  on the day when mary was to attempt her escape a servant woman was brought by one of the castle boats from the shore with a bundle of clothes for mary mary whose health and strength had been impaired by her confinement and sufferings was often in her bed she was so at this time though perhaps she was feigning now more feebleness than she really felt the servant woman came into her apartment and undressed herself while mary rose took the dress which she laid aside and put it on as a disguise the woman took marys place in bed mary covered her face with a muffler and taking another bundle in her hand to assist in her disguise she passed across the court issued from the castle gate went to the landing stairs and stepped into the boat for the men to row her to the shore  the oarsmen who belonged to the castle supposing that all was right pushed off and began to row toward the land as they were crossing the water however they observed that their passenger was very particular to keep her face covered and attempted to pull away the muffler saying let us see what kind of a looking damsel this is mary in alarm put up her hands to her face to hold the muffler there the smooth white and delicate fingers revealed to the men at once that they were carrying away a lady in disguise mary finding that concealment was no longer possible dropped her muffler looked upon the men with composure and dignity told them that she was their queen that they were bound by their allegiance to her to obey her commands and she commanded them to go on and row her to the shore  the men decided however that their allegiance was due to the lord of the castle rather than to the helpless captive trying to escape from it they told her that they must return mary was not only disappointed at the failure of her plans but she was now anxious lest her friends the young douglases should be implicated in the attempt and should suffer in consequence of it the men however solemnly promised her that if she would quietly return they would not make the circumstances known the secret however was too great a secret to be kept in a few days it all came to light lord and lady douglas were very angry with their son and banished him together with two of marys servants from the castle whatever share young william douglas had in the scheme was not found out and he was suffered to remain george douglas went only to kinross he remained there watching for another opportunity to help mary to her freedom  illustration loch leven castlethe place of marys imprisonment  in the mean time the watch and ward held over mary was more strict and rigorous than ever her keepers being resolved to double their vigilance while george and william on the other hand resolved to redouble their exertions to find some means to circumvent it william who was only a boy of seventeen and who remained within the castle acted his part in a very sagacious and admirable manner he was silent and assumed a thoughtless and unconcerned manner in his general deportment which put every one off their guard in respect to him george who was at kinross held frequent communications with the hamilton lords encouraging them to hope for marys escape and leading them to continue in combination and to be ready to act at a moments warning they communicated with each other too by secret means across the lake and with mary in her solitary tower it is said that george wishing to make mary understand that their plans for rescuing her were not abandoned and not having the opportunity to do so directly sent her a picture of the mouse liberating the lion from his snares hoping that she would draw from the picture the inference which he intended  at length the time arrived for another attempt it was about the first of may by looking at the engraving of loch leven castle it will be seen that there was a window in marys tower looking out over the water george douglass plan was to bring a boat up to this window in the night and take mary down the wall into it the place of egress by which mary escaped is called in some of the accounts a postern gate and yet tradition at the castle says that it was through this window it is not improbable that this window might have been intended to be used sometimes as a postern gate and that the iron grating with which it was guarded was made to open and shut the key being kept with the other keys of the castle  the time for the attempt was fixed upon for sunday night on the 2d of may george douglas was ready with the boat early in the evening when it was dark he rowed cautiously across the water and took his position under marys window william douglas was in the mean time at supper in the great square tower with his father and mother the keys were lying upon the table he contrived to get them into his possession and then cautiously stole away he locked the tower as he came out went across the court to marys room liberated her through the postern window and descended with her into the boat one of her maids whose name was jane kennedy was to have accompanied her but in their eagerness to make sure of mary they forgot or neglected her and she had to leap down after them which feat she accomplished without any serious injury the boat pushed off immediately and the douglases began to pull hard for the shore they threw the keys of the castle into the lake as if the impossibility of recovering them in that case made the imprisonment of the family more secure the whole party were of course in the highest state of excitement and agitation jane kennedy helped to row and it is said that even mary applied her strength to one of the oars  they landed safely on the south side of the loch far from kinross several of the hamilton lords were ready there to receive the fugitive they mounted her on horseback and galloped away there was a strong party to escort her they rode hard all night and the next morning they arrived safely at hamilton now said mary i am once more a queen  it was true she was again a queen popular feeling ebbs and flows with prodigious force and the change from one state to the other depends sometimes on very accidental causes the news of marys escape spread rapidly over the land her friends were encouraged and emboldened sympathies long dormant and inert were awakened in her favor she issued a proclamation declaring that her abdication had been forced upon her and as such was null and void she summoned murray to surrender his powers as regent and to come and receive orders from her she called upon all her faithful subjects to take up arms and gather around her standard murray refused to obey but large masses of the people gave in their adhesion to their liberated queen and flocked to hamilton to enter into her service in a week mary found herself at the head of an army of six thousand men                                       illustration ruins of loch leven castle  the castle of loch leven is now a solitary ruin the waters of the loch have been lowered by means of an excavation of the outlet and a portion of land has been left bare around the walls which the proprietor has planted with trees visitors are taken from kinross in a boat to view the scene the square tower though roofless and desolate still stands the window in the second story which served as the entrance and the one above where the chain was worked with the deep furrows in the sill cut by its friction are shown by the guide the courtyard is overgrown with weeds and encumbered with fallen stones and old foundations the chapel is gone though its outline may be still traced in the ruins of its walls the octagonal tower which mary occupied remains and the visitors climbing up by the narrow stone stairs in the wall look out at the window over the waters of the loch and the distant hills and try to

forgotten in her captivity   hamilton which had been thus far the queens place of rendezvous was a palace rather than a castle and therefore not a place of defense it was situated as has been already stated on the river clyde above glasgow that is toward the southeast of it the river clyde flowing toward the northwest the castle of dumbarton which has already been mentioned as the place from which mary embarked for france in her early childhood was below glasgow on the northern shore of the river it stands there still in good repair and is well garrisoned it crowns a rock which rises abruptly from the midst of a comparatively level country smiling with villages and cultivated fields and frowns sternly upon the peaceful steamers and merchant ships which are continually gliding along under its guns up and down the clyde  queen mary concluded to move forward to dumbarton it being a place of greater safety than hamilton murray gathered his forces to intercept her march the two armies met near glasgow as the queen was moving westward down the river there was a piece of rising ground between them which each party was eager to ascend before the other should reach it the leader of the forces on murrays side ordered every horseman to take up a footsoldier behind him and ride with all speed to the top of the hill by this means the great body of murrays troops were put in possession of the vantage ground the queens forces took post on another rising ground less favorable at a little distance the place was called langside a cannonading was soon commenced and a general battle ensued mary watched the progress of it with intense emotions her forces began soon to give way and before many hours they were retreating in all directions the whole country being soon covered with the awful spectacles which are afforded by one terrified and panicstricken army flying before the furious and triumphant rage of another mary gazed on the scene in an agony of grief and despair  a few faithful friends kept near her side and told her that she must hurry away they turned to the southward and rode away from the ground they pressed on as rapidly as possible toward the southern coast thinking that the only safety for mary now was for her to make her escape from the country altogether and go either to england or to france in hopes of obtaining foreign aid to enable her to recover her throne they at length reached the seacoast mary was received into an abbey called dundrennan not far from the english frontier here she remained with a few nobles and a small body of attendants for two days spending the time in anxious consultations to determine what should be done mary herself was in favor of going to england and appealing to elizabeth for protection and help her friends and advisers knowing elizabeth perhaps better than mary did recommended that she should sail for france in hopes of awakening sympathy there but mary as we might naturally have expected considering the circumstances under which she left that country found herself extremely unwilling to go there as a fugitive and a suppliant it was decided finally to go to england  the nearest stronghold in england was carlisle castle which was not very far from the frontier the boundary between the two kingdoms is formed here by the solway frith a broad arm of the sea dundrennan abbey to which mary had retreated was near the town of kirkcudbright which is of course on the northern side of the frith it is also near the sea carlisle is further up the frith near where the river solway empties into it and is twenty or thirty miles from the shore  mary sent a messenger to the governor of the castle at carlisle to inquire whether he would receive and protect her she could not however wait for an answer to this message as the country was all in commotion and she was exposed to an attack at any time from murrays forces in which case even if they should not succeed in taking her captive they might effectually cut off her retreat from scottish ground she accordingly determined to proceed immediately and receive the answer from the governor of the castle on the way she set out on the 16th of may eighteen or twenty persons constituted her train this was all that remained to her of her army of six thousand men she proceeded to the shore they provided a fishingboat for the voyage furnishing it as comfortably for her as circumstances would admit she embarked and sailed along the coast eastward up the frith for about eighteen miles gazing mournfully upon the receding shore of her native landreceding in fact now from her view forever they landed at the most convenient port for reaching carlisle intending to take the remainder of the journey by land  in the mean time the messenger on his arrival at carlisle found that the governor had gone to london his second in rank whom he had left in command immediately sent off an express after him to inform him of the event the name of this lieutenantgovernor was lowther lowther did all in marys favor that it was in his power to do he directed the messenger to inform her that he had sent to london for instructions from elizabeth but that in the mean time she would be a welcome guest in his castle and that he would defend her there from all her enemies he then sent around to all the nobles and men of distinction in the neighborhood informing them of the arrival of the distinguished visitor and having assembled them they proceeded together toward the coast to meet and receive the unhappy fugitive with the honors becoming her rank though such honors must have seemed little else than a mockery in her present condition  mary was received at the castle as an honored guest it is however a curious circumstance that in respect to the reception of princes and queens in royal castles there is little or no distinction between the ceremonies which mark the honored guest and those which attend the helpless captive mary had a great many friends at first who came out of scotland to visit her the authorities ordered repairs to be commenced upon the castle to fit it more suitably for so distinguished an inmate and in consequence of the making of these repairs they found it inconvenient to admit visitors of course mary being a mere guest could not complain she wanted to take a walk beyond the limits of the castle upon a green to which there was access through a postern gate certainly the governor made no objection to such a walk but sent twenty or thirty armed men to accompany her they might be considered either as an honorary escort or as a guard to watch her movements to prevent her escape and to secure her return at one time she proposed to go ahunting they allowed her to go properly attended on her return however the officer reported to his superior that she was so admirable in her horsemanship and could ride with so much fearlessness and speed that he thought it might be possible for a body of her friends to come and carry her off on some such occasion back across the frontier so they determined to tell mary when she wished to hunt again that they thought it not safe for her to go out on such excursions as her enemies might make a sudden invasion and carry her away the precautions would be just the same to protect mary from her enemies as to keep her from her friends  elizabeth sent her captive cousin very kind and condoling messages dispatching however by the same messenger stringent orders to the commander of the castle to be sure and keep her safely mary asked for an interview with elizabeth elizabeths officers replied that she could not properly admit mary to a personal interview until she had been in some way or other cleared of the suspicion which attached to her in respect to the murder of darnley they proposed moreover that mary should consent to have that question examined before some sort of court which elizabeth might constitute for this purpose now it is a special point of honor among all sovereign kings and queens throughout the civilized world that they can technically do no wrong that they can not in any way be brought to trial and especially that they can not be by any means or in any way amenable to each other mary refused to acknowledge any english jurisdiction whatever in respect to any charges brought against her a sovereign queen of scotland  elizabeth removed her prisoner to another castle further from the frontier than carlisle in order to place her in a situation where she would be more safe from her enemies it was not convenient to lodge so many of her attendants at these new quarters as in the other fortress and several were dismissed additional obstructions were thrown in the way of her seeing friends and visitors from scotland mary found her situation growing every day more and more helpless and desolate elizabeth urged continually upon her the necessity of having the points at issue between herself and murray examined by a commissioner artfully putting it on the ground not of a trial of mary but a calling of murray to account by mary for his usurpation at last harassed and worn down and finding no ray of hope coming to her from any quarter she consented elizabeth constituted such a court which was to meet at york a large and ancient city in the north of england murray was to appear there in person with other lords associated with him mary appointed commissioners to appear for her and the two parties went into court each thinking that it was the other which was accused and on trial  the court assembled and after being opened with great parade and ceremony commenced the investigation of the questions at issue which led of course to endless criminations and recriminations the ground covering the whole history of marys career in scotland they went on for some weeks in this hopeless labyrinth until at length murray produced the famous letters alleged to have been written by mary to bothwell before darnleys murder as a part of the evidence and charged mary on the strength of this evidence with having been an abettor in the murder elizabeth finding that the affair was becoming as in fact she wished it to become more and more involved and wishing to get mary more and more entangled in it and to draw her still further into her power ordered the conference as the court was called to be adjourned to london here things took such a turn that mary complained that she was herself treated in so unjust a manner and murray and his cause were allowed so many unfair advantages that she could not allow the discussion on her part to continue the conference was accordingly broken up each party charging the other with being the cause of the interruption  murray returned to scotland to resume his government there mary was held a closer captive than ever she sent to elizabeth asking her to remove these restraints and allow her to depart either to her own country or to france elizabeth replied that she could not considering all the circumstances of the case allow her to leave england but that if she would give up all claims to the government of scotland to her son the young prince she might remain in peace in england mary replied that she would suffer death a thousand times rather than dishonor herself in the eyes of the world by abandoning in such a way her rights as a sovereign the last words which she should speak she said should be those of the queen of scotland  elizabeth therefore considered that she had no alternative left but to keep mary a prisoner she accordingly retained her for some time in confinement but she soon found that such a charge was a serious incumbrance to her and one not unattended with danger the disaffected in her own realm were beginning to form plots and to consider whether they could not in some way or other make use of marys claims to the english crown to aid them finally elizabeth came to the conclusion when she had become a little satiated with the feeling at first so delightful of having mary in her power that after all it would be quite as convenient to have her imprisoned in scotland and she opened a negotiation with murray for delivering mary into his hands he was on his part to agree to save her life and to keep her a close prisoner and he was to deliver hostages to elizabeth as security for the fulfillment of these obligations  various difficulties however occurred in the way of the accomplishment of these plans and before the arrangement was finally completed it was cut suddenly short by murrays miserable end one of the hamiltons who had been with mary at langside was taken prisoner after the battle murray who of course as the legally constituted regent in the name of james considered himself as representing the royal authority of the kingdom regarded these prisoners as rebels taken in the act of insurrection against their sovereign they were condemned to death but finally were pardoned at the place of execution their estates were however confiscated and given to the followers and favorites of murray  one of these men in taking possession of the house of hamilton with a cruel brutality characteristic of the times turned hamiltons family out abruptly in a cold nightperhaps exasperated by resistance which he may have encountered the wife of hamilton it is said was sent out naked but the expression means probably very insufficiently clothed for such an exposure at any rate the unhappy outcast wandered about half frantic with anger and terror until before morning she was wholly frantic and insane to have such a calamity brought upon him in consequence merely of his fidelity to his queen was as the bereaved and wretched husband thought an injury not to be borne he considered murray the responsible author of these miseries and silently and calmly resolved on a terrible revenge  murray was making a progress through the country traveling in state with a great retinue and was to pass through linlithgow there is a town of that name close by the palace hamilton provided himself with a room in one of the houses on the principal street through which he knew that murray must pass he had a fleet horse ready for him at the back door the front door was barricaded there was a sort of balcony or gallery projecting toward the street with a window in it he stationed himself here having carefully taken every precaution to prevent his being seen from the street or overheard in his movements murray lodged in the town during the night and hamilton posted himself in his ambuscade the next morning armed with a gun  the town was thronged and murray on issuing from his lodging escorted by his cavalcade found the streets crowded with spectators he made his way slowly on account of the throng when he arrived at the proper point hamilton took his aim in a cool and deliberate manner screened from observation by black cloths with which he had darkened his hidingplace he fired the ball passed through the body of the regent and thence descending as it went killed a horse on the other side of him murray fell there was a universal outcry of surprise and fear they made an onset upon the house from which the shot had been fired the door was strongly barricaded before they could get the means to force an entrance hamilton was on his horse and far away the regent was carried to his lodgings and died that night  murray was queen marys half brother and the connection of his fortunes with hers considered in respect to its intimacy and the length of its duration was on the whole greater than that of any other individual he may be said to have governed scotland in reality during the whole of marys nominal reign first as her minister and friend and afterward as her competitor and foe he was at any rate during most of her life her nearest relative and her most constant companion and mary mourned his death with many tears  there was a great nobleman in england named the duke of norfolk who had vast estates and was regarded as the greatest subject in the realm he was a catholic among the other countless schemes and plots to which marys presence in england gave rise he formed a plan of marrying her and through her claim to the crown and by the help of the catholics to overturn the government of elizabeth he entered into negotiations with mary and she consented to become his wife without however as she says being a party to his political schemes his plots were discovered he was imprisoned tried and beheaded mary was accused of sharing the guilt of his treason she denied this she was not very vigorously proceeded against but she suffered in the event of the affair another sad disappointment of her hopes of liberty and her confinement became more strict and absolute than ever  still she had quite a numerous retinue of attendants many of her former friends were allowed to continue with her jane kennedy who had escaped with her from loch leven remained in her service she was removed from castle to castle at elizabeths orders to diminish the probability of the forming and maturing of plans of escape she amused herself sometimes in embroidery and similar pursuits and sometimes she pined and languished under the pressure of her sorrows and woes sixteen or eighteen years passed away in this manner she was almost forgotten very exciting public events were taking place in england and in scotland and the name of the poor captive queen at length seemed to pass from mens minds except so far as it was whispered secretly in plots and intrigues     chapter xii  the end  15861587  plots and intrigueshow far mary was involvedbabingtons conspiracysecret correspondenceseizure of marys

itomb of mary at westminster abbeymarys love and ambitionshe triumphs in the end   mary did not always discourage the plots and intrigues with which her name was connected she of course longed for deliverance from the thraldom in which elizabeth held her and was ready to embrace any opportunity which promised release she thus seems to have listened from time to time to the overtures which were made to her and involved herself in elizabeths opinion more or less in the responsibility which attached to them elizabeth did not however in such cases do any thing more than to increase somewhat the rigors of her imprisonment she was afraid to proceed to extremities with her partly perhaps for fear that she might by doing so awaken the hostility of france whose king was marys cousin or of scotland whose monarch was her son  at length however in the year 1586 about eighteen years from the commencement of marys captivity a plot was formed in which she became so seriously involved as to subject herself to the charge of aiding and abetting in the high treason of which the leaders of the plot were proved to be guilty this plot is known in history by the name of babingtons conspiracy babington was a young gentleman of fortune who lived in the heart of england he was inspired with a strong degree of interest in marys fate and wished to rescue her from her captivity he joined himself with a large party of influential individuals of the catholic faith the conspirators opened negotiations with the courts of france and spain for aid they planned an insurrection the assassination of elizabeth the rescue of mary and a general revolution they maintained a correspondence with mary this correspondence was managed very secretly the letters being placed by a confidential messenger in a certain hole in the castle wall where queen mary was confined  one day when mary was going out to ride just as she was entering her carriage officers suddenly arrived from london they told her that the plot in which she had been engaged had been discovered that fourteen of the principal conspirators had been hung seven on each of two successive days and that they had come to arrest some of her attendants and to seize her papers they accordingly went into her apartments opened all her desks trunks and cabinets seized her papers and took them to london mary sat down in the scene of desolation and disorder which they left and wept bitterly  the papers which were seized were taken to london and elizabeths government began seriously to agitate the question of bringing mary herself to trial one would have thought that in her forlorn and desolate condition she would have looked to her son for sympathy and aid but rival claimants to a crown can have little kind feeling to each other even if they are mother and son james as he gradually approached toward maturity took sides against his mother in fact all scotland was divided and was for many years in a state of civil war those who advocated marys right to the crown on one side and jamess adherents on the other they were called kings men and queens men james was of course brought up in hostility to his mother and he wrote to her about a year before babingtons conspiracy in terms so hostile and so devoid of filial love that his ingratitude stung her to the heart was it for this she said that i made so many sacrifices and endured so many trials on his account in his early years i have made it the whole business of my life to protect and secure his rights and to open before him a prospect of future power and glory and this is the return  the english government under elizabeths direction concluded to bring mary to a public trial they removed her accordingly to the castle of fotheringay fotheringay is in northamptonshire which is in the very heart of england northampton the shire town being about sixty miles northwest of london fotheringay castle was on the banks of the river nen or avon which flows northeast from northampton to the sea a few miles below the castle is the ancient town of peterborough where there was a monastery and a great cathedral church the monastery had been built a thousand years before  they removed mary to fotheringay castle for her trial and lawyers counselors commissioners and officers of state began to assemble there from all quarters the castle was a spacious structure it was surrounded with two moats and with double walls and was strongly fortified it contained numerous and spacious apartments and it had especially one large hall which was well adapted to the purposes of this great trial the preparations for the solemn ordeal through which mary was now to pass brought her forth from the obscurity in which she had so long been lost to the eyes of mankind and made her the universal object of interest and attention in england scotland and france the people of all these nations looked on with great interest at the spectacle of one queen tried solemnly on a charge of high treason against another the stories of her beauty her graces her misfortunes which had slumbered for eighteen years were all now revived and every body felt a warm interest in the poor captive worn down by long confinement and trembling in the hands of what they feared would be a merciless and terrible power  mary was removed to the castle of fotheringay toward the end of september 1586 the preparations for the trial proceeded slowly every thing in which kings and queens or affairs of state were concerned in those days was conducted with great pomp and ceremony the arrangements of the hall were minutely prescribed at the head of it a sort of throne was placed with a royal canopy over it for the queen of england this though it was vacant impressed the court and the spectators as a symbol of royalty and denoted that the sovereignty of elizabeth was the power before which mary was arraigned  when the preparations were made mary refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court she denied that they had any right to arraign or to try her i am no subject of elizabeths said she i am an independent and sovereign queen as well as she and i will not consent to any thing inconsistent with this my true position i owe no allegiance to england and i am not in any sense subject to her laws i came into the realm only to ask assistance from a sister queen and i have been made a captive and detained many years in an unjust and cruel imprisonment and though now worn down both in body and mind by my protracted sufferings i am not yet so enfeebled as to forget what is due to myself my ancestors and my country  this refusal of marys to plead or to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court caused a new delay they urged her to abandon her resolution they told her that if she refused to plead the trial would proceed without her action and by pursuing such a course she would only deprive herself of the means of defense without at all impeding the course of her fate at length mary yielded it would have been better for her to have adhered to her first intention  the commission by which mary was to be tried consisted of earls barons and other persons of rank twenty or thirty in number they were seated on each side of the room the throne being at the head in the center was a table where the lawyers by whom the trial was to be conducted were seated below this table was a chair for mary behind marys chair was a rail dividing off the lower end of the hall from the court and this formed an outer space to which some spectators were admitted  mary took her place in the seat assigned her and the trial proceeded they adduced the evidence against her and then asked for her defense she said substantially that she had a right to make an effort to recover her liberty that after being confined a captive so long and having lost forever her youth her health and her happiness it was not wonderful that she wished to be free but that in endeavoring to obtain her freedom she had formed no plans to injure elizabeth or to interfere in any way with her rights or prerogatives as queen the commissioners after devoting some days to hearing evidence and listening to the defense sent mary back to her apartments and went to london there they had a final consultation and unanimously agreed in the following decision that mary commonly called queen of scots and dowager of france had been an accessory to babingtons conspiracy and had compassed the death of elizabeth queen of england  elizabeth pretended to be very much concerned at this result she laid the proceedings before parliament it was supposed then and has always been supposed since that she wished mary to be beheaded but desired not to take the responsibility of it herself and that she wanted to appear unwilling and to be impelled greatly against her own inclinations by the urgency of others to carry the sentence into execution at any rate parliament and all the members of the government approved and confirmed the verdict and wished to have it carried into effect  it has always been the custom in modern times to require the solemn act of the supreme magistrate of any state to confirm a decision of a tribunal which condemns a person to death by signing what is called a warrant for the execution this is done by the king or queen in england and by the governor in one of the united states this warrant is an order very formally written and sealed with the great seal authorizing the executioner to proceed and carry the sentence into effect of course queen mary could not be executed unless elizabeth should first sign the warrant elizabeth would herself probably have been better pleased to have been excused from all direct agency in the affair but this could not be she however made much delay and affected great unwillingness to proceed she sent messengers to mary telling her what the sentence had been how sorry she was to hear it and how much she desired to save her life if it were possible at the same time she told her that she feared it might not be in her power and she advised mary to prepare her mind for the execution of the sentence  mary wrote a letter to elizabeth in reply she said in this letter that she was glad to hear that they had pronounced sentence of death against her for she was weary of life and had no hope of relief or rest from her miseries but in the grave she wrote therefore not to ask any change in the decision but to make three requests first that after her execution her body might be removed to france and be deposited at rheims where the ashes of her mother were reposing secondly that her execution should not be in secret but that her personal friends might be present to attest to the world that she met her fate with resignation and fortitude and thirdly that her attendants and friends who had through their faithful love for her shared her captivity so long might be permitted to retire wherever they pleased after her death without any molestation i hope said she in conclusion you will not refuse me these my dying requests but that you will assure me by a letter under your own hand that you will comply with them and then i shall die as i have lived your affectionate sister and prisoner mary queen of scots  the king of france and james marys son in scotland made somewhat vigorous efforts to arrest the execution of the sentence which had been pronounced against mary from these and other causes the signing of the warrant was delayed for some months but at length elizabeth yielded to the solicitations of her ministers she affixed her signature to the instrument the chancellor put upon it the great seal and the commissioners who were appointed by it to superintend the execution went to fotheringay they arrived there on the 7th of february 1587  after resting and refreshing themselves for a short time from their journey the commissioners sent word to mary that they wished for an interview with her mary had retired they said that their business was very important she rose and prepared to receive them she assembled all her attendants fourteen or fifteen in number in order to receive the commissioners in a manner comporting so far as circumstances allowed with her rank and station the commissioners were at length ushered into the apartment they stood respectfully before her with their heads uncovered the foremost then in language as forbearing and gentle as was consistent with the nature of his message informed her that it had been decided to carry the sentence which had been pronounced against her into effect and then he requested another of the number to read the warrant for her execution  illustration fotheringay in its present state  mary listened to it calmly and patiently her attendants one after another were overcome by the mournful and awful solemnity of the scene and melted into tears mary however was calm when the reading of the warrant was ended she said that she was sorry that her cousin elizabeth should set the example of taking the life of a sovereign queen but for herself she was willing to die life had long ceased to afford her any peace or happiness and she was ready to exchange it for the prospect of immortality she then laid her hand upon the new testament which was near her of course a catholic version and called god to witness that she had never plotted herself or joined in plots with others for the death of elizabeth one of the commissioners remarked that her oath being upon a catholic version of the bible they should not consider it valid she rejoined that it ought to be considered the more sacred and solemn on that account as that was the version which she regarded as the only one which was authoritative and true  mary then asked the commissioners several questions as whether her son james had not expressed any interest in her fate and whether no foreign princes had interposed to save her the commissioners answered these and other inquiries and mary learned from their answers that her fate was sealed she then asked them what time was appointed for the execution they replied that it was to take place at eight oclock the following morning  mary had not expected so early an hour to be named she said it was sudden and she seemed agitated and distressed she however soon recovered her composure and asked to have a catholic priest allowed to visit her the commissioners replied that that could not be permitted they however proposed to send the dean of peterborough to visit her a dean is the ecclesiastical functionary presiding over a cathedral church and of course the dean of peterborough was the clergyman of the highest rank in that vicinity he was however a protestant and mary did not wish to see him  the commissioners withdrew and left mary with her friends when there ensued one of those scenes of anguish and suffering which those who witness them never forget but carry the gloomy remembrance of them like a dark shadow in the soul to the end of their days mary was quiet and appeared calm it may however have been the calm of hopeless and absolute despair her attendants were overwhelmed with agitation and grief the expression of which they could not even attempt to control at last they became more composed and mary asked them to kneel with her in prayer and she prayed for some time fervently and earnestly in the midst of them  she then directed supper to be prepared as usual and until it was ready she spent her time in dividing the money which she had on hand into separate parcels for her attendants marking each parcel with the name she sat down at the table when supper was served and though she ate but little she conversed as usual in a cheerful manner and with smiles her friends were silent and sad struggling continually to keep back their tears at the close of the supper mary called for a cup of wine and drank to the health of each one of them and then asked them to drink to her they took the cup and kneeling before her complied with her request though as they did it the tears would come to their eyes mary then told them that she willingly forgave them for all that they had ever done to displease her and she thanked them for their longcontinued fidelity and love she also asked that they would forgive her for any thing she might ever have done in respect to them which was inconsistent with her duty they answered the request only with a renewal of their tears  mary spent the evening in writing two letters to her nearest relatives in france and in making her will the principal object of these letters was to recommend her servants to the attention and care of those to whom they were addressed after she should be gone she went to bed shortly after midnight and it is said she slept this would be incredible if any thing were incredible in respect to the workings of the human soul in a time of awful trial like this which so transcends all the ordinary conditions of its existence  at any rate whether mary slept or not the morning soon came her friends were around her as soon as she rose she gave them minute directions about the disposition of her body she wished to have it taken to france to be interred as she had requested of elizabeth either at rheims in the same tomb with the body of her mother or else at st denis an ancient abbey a little north of paris where the ashes of a long line of french monarchs repose she begged her servants if possible not to leave her body till it should reach its final home in one of these places of sepulture  in the mean time arrangements had been made for the last act in this dreadful tragedy in the same great hall where she had been tried they raised a platform upon the stone floor of the hall large enough to contain those who were to take part in the closing scene on this platform was a block a cushion and a chair all these things as well as the platform itself were covered with black cloth giving to the whole scene a most solemn and funereal expression the part of the hall containing this scaffold was railed off from the rest the governor of the castle and a body of guards came in and took their station at the sides of the room two executioners one holding the axe stood upon the scaffold on one side of the block two of the commissioners stood upon the other side the remaining commissioners and several gentlemen of the neighborhood took their places as spectators without the rail the number of persons thus assembled was about two hundred strange that any one should have come in voluntarily to witness such a scene  when all was ready the sheriff carrying his white wand of office and attended by some of the commissioners went for mary she was at her devotions and she asked a little delay that she might conclude them perhaps the shrinking spirit clung at the last moment to life and wished to linger a few minutes longer before taking the final farewell the request was granted in a short time mary signified that she was ready and they began to move toward the hall of execution her attendants were going to accompany her the sheriff said this could not be allowed she accordingly bade them farewell and they filled the castle with the sound of their shrieks and lamentations  mary went on descending the staircase at the foot of which she was joined by one of her attendants from whom she had been separated for some time his name was sir andrew melville and he was the master of her household the name of her secretary melville was james sir andrew kneeled before her kissed her hand and said that this was the saddest hour of his life mary began to give him some last commissions and requests say said she that i died firm in the faith that i forgive my enemies that i feel that i have never disgraced scotland my native country and that i have been always true to france the land of my happiest years tell my son here her voice faltered and ceased to be heard and she burst into tears  she struggled to regain her composure tell my son said she that i thought of him in my last moments and that i have never yielded either by word or deed to any thing whatever that might lead to his prejudice tell him to cherish the memory of his mother and say that i sincerely hope his life may be happier than mine has been  mary then turned to the commissioners who stood by and renewed her request that her attendants who had just been separated from her might come down and see her die the commissioners objected they said that if these attendants were admitted their anguish and lamentations would only add to her own distress and make the whole scene more painful mary however urged the request she said they had been devotedly attached to her all her days they had shared her captivity and loved and served her faithfully to the end and it was enough if she herself and they desired that they should be present the commissioners at last yielded and allowed her to name six who should be summoned to attend her she did so and the six came down  the sad procession then proceeded to the hall mary was in full court dress and walked into the apartment with the air and composure of a reigning queen she leaned on the arm of her physician sir andrew melville followed bearing the train of her robe her dress is described as a gown of black silk bordered with crimson velvet over which was a satin mantle a long veil of white crape edged with rich lace hung down almost to the ground around her neck was an ivory crucifixthat is an image of christ upon the cross which the catholics use as a memorial of our saviors sufferingsand a rosary which is a string of beads of peculiar arrangement often employed by them as an aid in their devotions mary meant doubtless by these symbols to show to her enemies and to the world that though she submitted to her fate without resistance yet so far as the contest of her life had been one of religious faith she had no intention of yielding  mary ascended the platform and took her seat in the chair provided for her with the exception of stifled sobs here and there to be heard the room was still an officer then advanced and read the warrant of execution which the executioners listened to as their authority for doing the dreadful work which they were about to perform the dean of peterborough the protestant ecclesiastic whom mary had refused to see then came forward to the foot of the platform and most absurdly commenced an address to her with a view to convert her to the protestant faith mary interrupted him saying that she had been born and had lived a catholic and she was resolved so to die and she asked him to spare her his useless reasonings the dean persisted in going on mary turned away from him kneeled down and began to offer a latin prayer the dean soon brought his ministrations to a close and then mary prayed for some time in a distinct and fervent voice in english the large company listening with breathless attention she prayed for her own soul and that she might have comfort from heaven in the agony of death she implored gods blessing upon france upon scotland upon england upon queen elizabeth and more than all upon her son during this time she held the ivory crucifix in her hand clasping it and raising it from time to time toward heaven  when her prayer was ended she rose and with the assistance of her attendants took off her veil and such other parts of her dress as it was necessary to remove in order to leave the neck bare and then she kneeled forward and laid her head upon the block the agitation of the assembly became extreme some turned away from the scene faint and sick at heart some looked more eagerly and intensely at the group upon the scaffold some wept and sobbed aloud the assistant executioner put marys two hands together and held them the other raised his axe and after the horrid sound of two or three successive blows the assistant held up the dissevered head saying so perish all queen elizabeths enemies  the assembly dispersed the body was taken into an adjoining apartment and prepared for interment marys attendants wished to have it delivered to them that they might comply with her dying request to convey it to france but they were told that they could not be allowed to do so the body was interred with great pomp and ceremony in the cathedral at peterborough where it remained in peace for many years                                       now that the deed was done the great problem with elizabeth was of course to avert the consequences of the terrible displeasure and thirst for revenge which she might naturally suppose it would awaken in scotland and in france she succeeded very well in accomplishing this as soon as she heard of the execution of mary she expressed the utmost surprise grief and indignation she said that she had indeed signed the death warrant but it was not her intention at all to have it executed and that when she delivered it to the officer she charged him not to let it go out of his possession this the officer denied elizabeth insisted and punished the officer by a long imprisonment and perpetual disgrace for his pretended offense she sent a messenger to james explaining the terrible accident as she termed it which had occurred and deprecating his displeasure james though at first filled with indignation and determined to avenge his mothers death allowed himself to be appeased  about twenty years after this elizabeth died and the great object of marys ambition throughout her whole life was attained by the union of the scotch and english crowns on the head of her son as soon as elizabeth ceased to breathe james the sixth of scotland was proclaimed james the first of england he was at that time nearly forty years of age he was married and had several young children the circumstances of king jamess journey to london when he went to take possession of his new kingdom are related in the history of charles i belonging to this series though james thus became monarch of both england and scotland it must not be supposed that the two kingdoms were combined they remained separate for many yearstwo independent kingdoms governed by one king  when james succeeded to the english throne his mother had been dead many years and whatever feelings of affection may have bound his heart to her in early life they were now wellnigh obliterated by the lapse of time and by the new ties by which he was connected with his wife and his children as soon as he was seated on his new throne however he ordered the castle of fotheringay which had been the scene of his mothers trial and death to be leveled with the ground and he transferred her remains to westminster abbey where they still repose  illustration marys tomb at westminster abbey  if the lifeless dust had retained its consciousness when it was thus transferred with what intense emotions of pride and pleasure would the mothers heart have been filled in being thus brought to her final home in that ancient sepulcher of the english kings by her son now at last safely established where she had so long toiled and suffered to instate him in his place in the line ambition was the great paramount ruling principle of marys life love was with her an occasional though perfectly uncontrollable impulse which came suddenly to interrupt her plans and divert her from her course leaving her to get back to it again after devious wanderings with great difficulty and through many tears the love with the consequences which followed from it destroyed her while the ambition recovering itself after every contest with its rival and holding out perseveringly to the last saved her son so that in the long contest in which her life was spent though she suffered all the way and at last sacrificed herself she triumphed in the end                           the end
