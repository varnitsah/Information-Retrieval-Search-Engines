cage to worry cranmer  first gentleman and furthermore my daughter said that when there rose a talk of the late rebellion she spoke even of northumberland pitifully and of the good lady jane as a poor innocent child who had but obeyed her father and furthermore she said that no one in her time should be burnt for heresy  second gentleman well sir i look for happy times  first gentleman there is but one thing against them i know not if you know  second gentleman i suppose you touch upon the rumour that charles the master of the world has offerd her his son philip the pope and the devil i trust it

before his shutup booth and lookd as grim and grave as from a funeral and here a knot of ruffians all in rags with execrating execrable eyes glared at the citizen here was a young mother her face on flame her red hair all blown back she shrilling wyatt while the boy she held mimickd and piped her wyatt as red as she in hair and cheek and almost elbowing her so close they stood another mute as death and white as her own milk her babe in arms had felt the faltering of his mothers heart and lookd as bloodless here a pious catholic mumbling and mixing up in his scared prayers heaven and earths maries over his bowd shoulder scowld that worldhated and worldhating beast a haggard anabaptist many such groups the names of wyatt elizabeth courtenay nay the queens right to reignfore god the rogues were freely buzzed among them so i say your city is divided and i fear one scruple this or that way of success would turn it thither wherefore now the queen in this low pulse and palsy of the state bad me to tell you that she counts on you and on myself as her two hands on you in your own city as her right my lord for you are loyal  white             am i thomas white one word before she comes elizabeth her name is much abused among these traitors where is she she is loved by all of us i scarce have heart to mingle in this matter if she should be mishandled  howard                      no she shall not the queen had written her word to come to court methought i smelt out renard in the letter and fearing for her sent a secret missive which told her to be sick happily or not it found her sick indeed  white                    god send her well here comes her royal grace      enter guards mary and gardiner sir thomas     white leads her to a raised seat on the dais  white i the lord mayor and these our companies and guilds of london gathered here beseech your highness to accept our lowliest thanks for your most princely presence and we pray that we your true and loyal citizens from your own royal lips at once may know the wherefore of this coming and so learn your royal will and do iti lord mayor of london and our guilds and companies  mary in mine own person am i come to you to tell you what indeed ye see and know how traitorously these rebels out of kent have made strong head against ourselves and you they would not have me wed the prince of spain that was their pretextso they spake at first but we sent divers of our council to them and by their answers to the question askd it doth appear this marriage is the least of all their quarrel they have betrayed the treason of their hearts seek to possess our person hold our tower place and displace our councillors and use both us and them according as they will now what i am ye know right wellyour queen to whom when i was wedded to the realm and the realms laws the spousal ring whereof not ever to be laid aside i wear upon this finger ye did promise full allegiance and obedience to the death ye know my father was the rightful heir of england and his right came down to me corroborate by your acts of parliament and as ye were most loving unto him so doubtless will ye show yourselves to me wherefore ye will not brook that anyone should seize our person occupy our state more specially a traitor so presumptuous as this same wyatt who hath tamperd with a public ignorance and under colour of such a cause as hath no colour seeks to bend the laws to his own will and yield full scope to persons rascal and forlorn to make free spoil and havock of your goods now as your prince i say i that was never mother cannot tell how mothers love their children yet methinks a prince as naturally may love his people as these their children and be sure your queen so loves you and so loving needs must deem this love by you returnd as heartily and thro this common knot and bond of love doubt not they will be speedily overthrown as to this marriage ye shall understand we made thereto no treaty of ourselves and set no foot theretoward unadvised of all our privy council furthermore this marriage had the assent of those to whom the king my father did commit his trust who not alone esteemd it honourable but for the wealth and glory of our realm and all our loving subjects most expedient as to myself i am not so set on wedlock as to choose but where i list nor yet so amorous that i must needs be husbanded i thank god i have lived a virgin and i noway doubt but that with gods grace i can live so still yet if it might please god that i should leave some fruit of mine own body after me to be your king ye would rejoice thereat and it would be your comfort as i trust and truly if i either thought or knew this marriage should bring loss or danger to you my subjects or impair in any way this royal state of england i would never consent thereto nor marry while i live moreover if this marriage should not seem before our own high court of parliament to be of rich advantage to our realm we will refrain and not alone from this likewise from any other out of which looms the least chance of peril to our realm wherefore be bold and with your lawful prince stand fast against our enemies and yours and fear them not i fear them not my lord i leave lord william howard in your city to guard and keep you whole and safe from all the spoil and sackage aimd at by these rebels who mouth and foam against

gardiner pole paget bonner etc   mary the king and i my lords now that all traitors against our royal state have lost the heads wherewith they plotted in their treasonous malice have talkd together and are well agreed that those old statutes touching lollardism to bring the heretic to the stake should be no longer a dead letter but requickend  one of the council why what hath flusterd gardiner how he rubs his forelock  paget        i have changed a word with him in coming and may change a word again  gardiner madam your highness is our sun the king and you together our two suns in one and so the beams of both may shine upon us the faith that seemd to droop will feel your light lift head and flourish yet not light alone there must be heatthere must be heat enough to scorch and wither heresy to the root for what saith christ compel them to come in and what saith paul i would they were cut off that trouble you let the dead letter live trace it in fire that all the louts to whom their a b c is darkness clowns and grooms may read it so you quash rebellion too for heretic and traitor are all one two vipers of one breedan amphisbaena each end a sting let the dead letter burn  paget yet there be some disloyal catholics and many heretics loyal heretic throats cried no godblessher to the lady jane but shouted in queen mary so there be some traitorheretic there is axe and cord to take the lives of others that are loyal and by the churchmans pitiless doom of fire were but a thankless policy in the crown ay and against itself for there are many  mary if we could burn out heresy my lord paget we reck not tho we lost this crown of england ay tho it were ten englands  gardiner                      right your grace paget you are all for this poor life of ours and care but little for the life to be  paget i have some time for curiousness my lord watchd children playing at their life to be and cruel at it killing helpless flies such is our timeall times for aught i know  gardiner we kill the heretics that sting the soul they with right reason flies that prick the flesh  paget they had not reachd right reason little children they killd but for their pleasure and the power they felt in killing  gardiner            a spice of satan ha why good what then grantedwe are fallen creatures look to your bible paget we are fallen  paget i am but of the laity my lord bishop and may not read your bible yet i found one day a wholesome scripture little children love one another  gardiner          did you find a scripture i come not to bring peace but a sword the sword is in her graces hand to smite with paget you stand up here to fight for heresy you are more than guessd at as a heretic and on the steepup track of the true faith your lapses are far seen  paget                    the faultless gardiner  mary you brawl beyond the question speak lord legate  pole indeed i cannot follow with your grace rather would saythe shepherd doth not kill the sheep that wander from his flock but sends his careful dog to bring them to the fold look to the netherlands wherein have been such holocausts of heresy to what end for yet the faith is not established there  gardiner the ends not come  pole nonor this way will come seeing there lie two ways to every end a better and a worsethe worse is here to persecute because to persecute makes a faith hated and is furthermore no perfect witness of a perfect faith in him who persecutes when men are tost on tides of strange opinion and not sure of their own selves they are wroth with their own selves and thence with others then who lights the faggot not the full faith no but the lurking doubt old rome that first made martyrs in the church trembled for her own gods for these were trembling but when did our rome tremble  paget                         did she not in henrys time and edwards  pole                         what my lord the church on peters rock never i have seen a pine in italy that cast its shadow athwart a cataract firm stood the pine the cataract shook the shadow to my mind the cataract typed the headlong plunge and fall of heresy to the pit the pine was rome you see my lords it was the shadow of the church that trembled your church was but the shadow of a church wanting the papal mitre  gardiner muttering  here be tropes  pole and tropes are good to clothe a naked truth and make it look more seemly  gardiner                     tropes again  pole you are hard to please then without tropes my lord an overmuch severeness i repeat when faith is wavering makes the waverer pass into more settled hatred of the doctrines of those who rule which hatred by and by involves the ruler thus there springs to light that centaur of a monstrous commonweal the traitorheretic then tho some may quail yet others are that dare the stake and fire and their strong torment bravely borne begets an admiration and an indignation and hot desire to imitate so the plague of schism spreads were there but three or four of these misleaders yet i would not say burn and we cannot burn whole towns they are many as my lord paget says  gardiner              yet my lord cardinal  pole i am your legate please you let me finish methinks that under our queens regimen we might go softlier than with crimson rowel and streaming lash when herodhenry first began to batter at your english church this was the cause and hence the judgment on her she seethed with such adulteries and the lives of many among your churchmen were so foul that heaven wept and earth blushd i would advise that we should thoroughly cleanse the church within before these bitter statutes be requickend so after that when she once more is seen white as the light the spotless bride of christ like christ himself on tabor possibly the lutheran may be won to her again till when my lords i counsel tolerance  gardiner what if a mad dog bit your hand my lord would you not chop the bitten finger off lest your whole body should madden with the poison i would not were i queen tolerate the heretic no not an hour the ruler of a land is bounden by his power and place to see his people be not poisond tolerate them why do they tolerate you nay many of them would burnhave burnt each other call they not the one true faith a loathsome idolworship beware lord legate of a heavier crime than heresy is itself beware i say lest men accuse you of indifference to all faiths all religion for you know right well that you yourself have been supposed tainted with lutheranism in italy  pole angered but you my lord beyond all supposition in clear and open day were congruent with that vile cranmer in the accursed lie of good queen catherines divorcethe spring of all those evils that have flowd upon us for you yourself have truckled to the tyrant and done your best to bastardise our queen for which gods righteous judgment fell upon you in your five years of imprisonment my lord under young edward who so bolsterd up the gross kings headship of the church or more denied the holy father  gardiner               ha what eh but you my lord a polishd gentleman a bookman flying from the heat and tussle you lived among your

protestant him perchd up there i wish some thunderbolt would make this cole a cinder pulpit and all  cole behold him brethren he hath cause to weep so have we all weep with him if ye will yet it is expedient for one man to die yea for the people lest the people die yet wherefore should he die that hath returnd to the one catholic universal church repentant of his errors  protestant murmurs ay tell us that  cole those of the wrong side will despise the man deeming him one that thro the fear of death gave up his cause except he seal his faith in sight of all with flaming martyrdom  cranmer ay  cole        ye hear him and albeit there may seem according to the canons pardon due to him that so repents yet are there causes wherefore our queen and council at this time adjudge him to the death he hath been a traitor a shaker and confounder of the realm and when the kings divorce was sued at rome he here this heretic metropolitan as if he had been the holy father sat and judged it did i call him heretic a huge heresiarch never was it known that any man so writing preaching so so poisoning the church so long continuing hath found his pardon therefore he must die for warning and example                          other reasons there be for this mans ending which our queen and council at this present deem it not expedient to be known  protestant murmurs  i warrant you  cole take therefore all example by this man for if our holy queen not pardon him much less shall others in like cause escape that all of you the highest as the lowest may learn there is no power against the lord there stands a man once of so high degree chief prelate of our church archbishop first in council second person in the realm friend for so long time of a mighty king and now ye see downfallen and debased from councillor to caitifffallen so low the leprous flutterings of the byway scum and offal of the city would not change estates with him in brief so miserable there is no hope of better left

shalt receive the penitent thiefs award and be with christ the lord in paradise remember how god made the fierce fire seem to those three children like a pleasant dew remember too the triumph of st andrew on his cross the patience of st lawrence in the fire thus if thou call on god and all the saints god will beat down the fury of the flame or give thee saintly strength to undergo and for thy soul shall masses here be sung by every priest in oxford pray for him  cranmer ay one and all dear brothers pray for me pray with one breath one heart one soul for me  cole and now lest anyone among you doubt the mans conversion and remorse of heart yourselves shall hear him speak speak master cranmer fulfil your promise made me and proclaim your true undoubted faith that all may hear  cranmer and that i will o god father of heaven o son of god redeemer of the world o holy ghost proceeding from them both three persons and one god have mercy on me most miserable sinner wretched man i have offended against heaven and earth more grievously than any tongue can tell then whither should i flee for any help i am ashamed to lift my eyes to heaven and i can find no refuge upon earth shall i despair thengod forbid o god for thou art merciful refusing none that come to thee for succour unto thee therefore i come humble myself to thee saying o lord god although my sins be great for thy great mercy have mercy o god the son not for slight faults alone when thou becamest man in the flesh was the great mystery wrought o god the father not for little sins didst thou yield up thy son to human death but for the greatest sin that can be sinnd yea even such as mine incalculable unpardonablesin against the light the truth of god which i had proven and known thy mercy must be greater than all sin forgive me father for no merit of mine but that thy name by man be glorified and thy most blessed sons who died for man  good people every man at time of death would fain set forth some saying that may live after his death and better humankind for death gives lifes last word a power to live and like the stonecut epitaph remain after the vanishd voice and speak to men god grant me grace to glorify my god and first i say it is a grievous case many so dote upon this bubble world whose colours in a moment break and fly they care for nothing else what saith st john love of this world is hatred against god again i pray you all that next to god you do unmurmuringly and willingly obey your king and queen and not for dread of these alone but from the fear of him whose ministers they be to govern you thirdly i pray you all to live together like brethren yet what hatred christian men bear to each other seeming not as brethren but mortal foes but do you good to all as much as in you lieth hurt no man more than you would harm your loving natural brother of the same roof same breast if any do albeit he think himself at home with god of this be sure he is whole worlds away

saying spoken once by him that was the truth how hard it is for the rich man to enter into heaven let all rich men remember that hard word i have not time for more if ever now let them flow forth in charity seeing now the poor so many and all food so dear long have i lain in prison yet have heard of all their wretchedness give to the poor ye give to god he is with us in the poor  and now and forasmuch as i have come to the last end of life and thereupon hangs all my past and all my life to be either to live with christ in heaven with joy or to be still in pain with devils in hell and

you my very faith without all colour  cole               hear him my good brethren  cranmer i do believe in god father of all in every article of the catholic faith and every syllable taught us by our lord his prophets and apostles in the testaments both old and new  cole           be plainer master cranmer  cranmer and now i come to the great cause that weighs upon my conscience more than anything or said or done in all my life by me for there be writings i have set abroad against the truth i knew within my heart written for fear of death to save my life if that might be the papers by my hand signd since my degradationby this hand                      holding out his right hand written and signdi here renounce them all and since my hand offended having written against my heart my hand

life i did dissemble but the hour has come for utter truth and plainness wherefore i say i hold by all i wrote within that book moreover as for the pope i count him antichrist with all his devils doctrines and refuse reject him and abhor him i have said  cries on all sides pull him down away with him  cole ay stop the heretics mouth hale him away  williams harm him not harm him not have him to

paget                   youd not hear that he passd out smiling and he walkd upright his eye was like a soldiers whom the general he looks to and he leans on as his god hath rated for some backwardness and biddn him charge one against a thousand and the man hurls his soild life against the pikes and dies  howard yet that he might not after all those papers of recantation yield again who knows  paget papers of recantation think you then that cranmer read all papers that he signd or signd all those they tell us that he signd nay i trow not and you shall see my lord that howsoever herolike the man dies in the fire this bonner or another will in some lying fashion misreport his ending to the glory of their church and you saw latimer and ridley die latimer was eighty was he not his best of life was over then  howard                his eighty years lookd somewhat crooked on him in his frieze but after they had stript him to his shroud he stood upright a lad of twentyone and gatherd with his hands the starting flame and washd his hands and all his face therein until the powder suddenly blew him dead ridley was longer burning but he died as manfully and boldly and fore god

tell us  peters you saw him how he past among the crowd and ever as he walkd the spanish friars still plied him with entreaty and reproach but cranmer as the helmsman at the helm steers ever looking to the happy haven where he shall rest at night moved to his death and i could see that many silent hands came from the crowd and met his own and thus when we had come where ridley burnt with latimer he with a cheerful smile as one whose mind is all made up in haste put off the rags they had mockd his misery with and all in white his long white beard which he had never shaven since henrys death downsweeping to the chain wherewith they bound him to the stake he stood more like an ancient father of the church than heretic of these times and still the friars plied him but cranmer only shook his head or answerd them in smiling negatives whereat lord williams gave a sudden cry make short make short and so they lit the wood then cranmer lifted his left hand to heaven and thrust his right into the bitter flame and crying in his deep voice more than once this hath offendedthis unworthy hand so held it till it all was burnd before the flame had reachd his body i stood near markd himhe never uttered moan of pain he never stirrd or writhed but like a statue unmoving in the greatness of the flame gave up the ghost and so past martyrlike martyr i may not call himpastbut whither paget to
