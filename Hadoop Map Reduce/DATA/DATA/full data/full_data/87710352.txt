44 victoria street westminster sw     chapter ithe strange lad   goodness  if ever i did see such a pig said ellen king as she mounted the stairs  i wouldnt touch him with a pair of tongs  who said a voice from the bedroom  why that tramper who has just been in to buy a loaf  he is a perfect pig i declare  i only wonder you did not find of him up here  the police ought to hinder such folk from coming into decent peoples shops there you may see him now  is that he upon the bridgethat chap about the size of our harold  yes  did you ever see such a figure  his clothes arent good enough for a scarecrowand the dirt you cant see that from here but you might sow radishes in it  oh hes swinging on the rail just as i used to do  put me down nelly i dont want to see any more  and the eyes filled with tears there was a working about the thin cheeks and the white lips and a long sigh came out at last oh if i was but like him  like him  id wish something else before i wished that said ellen dont think about it alfred dear here are miss janes pictures  i dont want the pictures said alfred wearily as he laid his head down on his white pillow and shut his eyes because they were hot with tears  ellen looked at him very sadly and the feeling in her own mind was that he was right and nothing could make up for the health and strength that she knew her mother feared would never return to him  there he lay the fair hair hanging round the white brow with the furrows of pain in it the purpleveined lids closed over the great bright blue eyes the long fingers hanging limp and delicate as a ladys the limbs stretched helplessly on the couch whither it cost him so much pain to be daily moved  who would have thought that not six months ago that poor cripple was the merriest and most active boy in the parish  the room was not a sadlooking one  there were spotless white dimity curtains round the lattice window and the little bed and the walnut of the great chest and of the doors of the pressbed on which alfred lay shone with dark and pale grainings  there was a carpet on the floor and the chairs had chintz cushions the walls were as white as snow and there were pretty china ornaments on the mantelpiece many little pictures hanging upon the walls and quite a shelf of books upon the white cloth laid so carefully on the top of the drawers  a little table beside alfred held a glass with a few flowers a cup with some toast and water a volume of the swiss family robinson and a large book of prints of animals was on a chair where he could reach it  a larger table was covered with needlework shreds of lining scissors tapes and ellens red workbox and she herself sat beside it a very nicelooking girl of about seventeen tall and slim her lilac dress and white collar fitting beautifully her black apron sitting nicely to her trim waist and her light hair shining like the newlywound silk of the silkworm round her pleasant face where the large clear wellopened blue eyes and the contrast of white and red on the cheek were a good deal like poor alfreds and gave an air of delicacy  their father had been as their mother said the handsomest coachman who ever drove to st jamess but he had driven thither once too often he had caught his death of cold one bitter day when lady jane selby was obliged to go to a drawingroom and had gone off in a deep decline fourteen years ago when the youngest of his five children was not six weeks old  the selby family were very kind to mrs king who besides her husbands claims on them had been once in service there and moreover had nursed miss jane the little heiress ellens fostersister  by their help she had been able to use her husbands savings in setting up a small shop where she sold tea tobacco and snuff tape cottons and such little matters besides capital bread of her own baking and various sweetmeats the best to the taste of her own cooking the prettiest to the eye brought from elbury  oranges too and apples shewed their yellow or rosy cheeks at her window in their season and there was sometimes a side of bacon displaying under the brown coat the delicate pink stripes bordering the white fat  of late years one pane of her window had been fitted up with a wooden box with a slit in it on the outside and a whole region round it taken up with printed sheets of paper about mails to gothenburgweekly post to vancouvers islandand all sorts of places to which the friarswood people never thought of writing  altogether she throve very well and she was a good woman whom every one respected for the pains she took to bring up her children well  the eldest charles had died of consumption soon after his father and there had been much fear for his sister matilda but lady jane had contrived to have her taken as maid to a lady who usually spent the winter abroad and the warm climate had strengthened her health  she was not often at friarswood but when she came she looked and spoke like a ladyall the more so as she gave herself no airs but was quite simple and humble for she was a very good rightminded young woman and exceedingly fond of her home and her good mother  ellen would have liked to copy matilda in everything and as a first step she went for a year to a dressmaker but just as this was over alfreds illness had begun and as he wanted constant care and attendance it was thought better that she should take in work at home indeed alfred was such a darling of hers that she could not have endured to go away and leave him so ill  alfred had been a most lively joyous boy with higher spirits than he quite knew what to do with all fun and goodhumour and yet very troublesome and provoking  he and his brother harold were the monkeys of the school and really seemed sometimes as if they could not sit still nor hinder themselves from making faces and playing tricks but that was the worst of themthey never told untruths never did anything mean or unfair and could always be made sorry when they had been in fault  their old schoolmistress liked them in spite of all the plague they gave her and they liked her too though she had tried upon them every punishment she could devise  little miss jane the orphan whom the colonel and mrs selby had left to be brought up by her grandmother had a great fancy that alfred should be a page and as she generally had her own way he went up to the grange when he was about thirteen years old and put on a suit thickly sown with buttons  but ere the gloss of his new jacket had begun to wear off he had broken four wineglasses three cups and a decanter all from not knowing where he was going he had put sugar instead of salt into the saltcellars at the housekeepers diningtable that he might see what she would say and he had been caught dressing up miss janes skye terrier in one of the butlers clean cravats so though puck the aforesaid terrier liked him better than any other person miss jane not excepted a regular complaint went up of him to my lady and he was sent home  he was abashed and sorry to have vexed mother and disappointed miss jane but somehow he could not be unhappy when he had harold to play with him again and he could halloo as loud as they pleased and stamp about in the garden instead of being always in mind to walk softly  there was the pony too  a new arrangement had just been made that the friarswood letters should be fetched from elbury every morning and then left at the various houses of the large straggling district that depended on that postoffice  all letters from thence must be in the post before five oclock at which time they were to be sent in to elbury  the post master at elbury asked if mrs kings sons could undertake this and accordingly she made a great effort and bought a small shaggy forest pony whom the boys called peggy and loved not much less than their sisters  it was all very well in the summer to take those two rides in the cool of the morning and evening but when winter came on and alfred had to start for elbury in the tardy dawn of a frosty morning or still worse in the gloom of a wet one he did not like it at all  he used to ride in looking blue and purple with the chill and though he went as close to the fire as possible and steamed like the teakettle while he ate his breakfast and his mother sorted the letters he had not time to warm himself thoroughly before he had to ride off to leave themtwo miles further altogether for besides the bag for the grange and all the letters for the rectory and for the farmers there was a young gentlemens school at a great old lonely house called ragglesford at the end of a very long dreary lane and many a day alfred would have given something if those boys relations would only have been so good as with one consent to leave them without letters  it would not have mattered if alfred had been a stouter boy but his mother had always thought he had his poor fathers constitution and therefore wished him to be more in the house but his idleness had prevented his keeping any such place  it might have been the cold and wet or as alfred thought it might have been the strain he gave himself one day when he was sliding on the ice and had a fall but one morning he came in from elbury very pale and hobbling as he said his hip hurt him so much that harold must take the letters round for him  harold took them that morning and for many another morning and evening besides while poor alfred came from sitting by the fire to being a prisoner upstairs only moved now and then from his own bed to lie outside that of his mother when he could bear it  the doctor came and did his best but the disease had thrown itself into the hip joint and it was but too plain that alfred must be a great sufferer for a long time and perhaps a cripple for life  but how long might this life be his mother dared not think  alfred himself poor boy was always trying with his whole might to believe himself getting better and ellen and harold always fancied him so when he was not very bad indeed but for the last fortnight he had been decidedly worse and his heart and hopes were sinking though he would not own it to himself and that and the pain made his spirits fail so that he had been more inclined to be fretful than any time since his illness had begun  his view from the window was a pleasant one and when he was pretty well afforded him much amusement  the house stood in a neat garden with green railings between it and the road over which alfred could see every one who came and went towards elbury and all who had business at the postoffice or at farmer shepherds  opposite was the farmyard and if nothing else was going on there were always cocks and hens ducks and turkeys pigs cows or horses to be seen there and the cowmilking or the taking the horses down to the water the pigfeeding and the like were a daily amusement  sloping down from the farmyard the ground led to the river a smooth clear stream where the white ducks looked very pretty swimming diving and standing tail upwards and there was a higharched bridge over it where alfred could get a good view of the carriages that chanced to come by and had lately seen all the young gentlemen of ragglesford going home for the summer holidays making such a whooping and hurrahing that the place rang again and beyond there were beautiful green meadows with a straight path through them leading to a stile and beyond that woods rose up and there was a little glimpse of a stately white house peeping through them  haymaking was going on merrily in the field under the bright summer sun and the air was full of the sweet smell of the grass but there was something sultry and oppressive to the poor boys feelings and when he remembered how farmer shepherd had called him to lend a hand last year and how happy he had been tossing the hay and loading the waggon a sad sick feeling crept over him and so it was that the tears rose in his eyes and he made his sister lay him back on the pillow for he did not wish to see any more  ellen worked and thought and wanted to entertain him but could not think how  presently she burst out however oh alfred theres harold coming running back  there he is jumping over that haycocknot touched the ground onceanotheroh theres farmer shepherd coming after him  hold your tongue muttered alfred moodily as if each of her words gave him unbearable pain and he hid his face in the pillow  ellen kept silence for ten minutes and then broke forth again now then alfred you will be glad  theres miss jane getting over the stile  i dont want miss jane grumbled alfred and as ellen sprang up and began smoothing his coverings collecting her scraps and tidying the room already so neat he growled again what a racket you keep  there wont you be raised up to see her  she does look so pretty in her new pink muslin with a double skirt and her little hat and feather that came from london and theres puck poking in the hayhes looking for a mouse  and shes showering the hay over him with her parasol  oh look alfred and she was going to lift him up but he only murmured a cross cant you be quiet and she let him alone but went on talking ah theres pucks little tail wriggling outhinderend foremosthere he comesthey are touching their hats to her now the farmer and all and she nods just like a little queen  shes got her basket alfred  i wonder what she has for you in it  oh dear theres that strange boy on the bridge  she wont like that  why what would he do to her  he wont bite her said alfred  oh if he spoke to her or begged of her shed be so frightened  there he looked at her and she gave such a start  you little vagabond  id like to  stuff what could he do to her with all the hayfield and farmer shepherd there to take care of her  what a fuss you do make said poor alfred who was far too miserable just then to agree with any one though at almost any other time he would have longed to knock down any strange boy who did but dare to pass miss selby without touching his cap and her visits were in general the very light of his life  they were considered a great favour for though old lady jane selby was a good kindhearted person still she had her fancies and she kept her young granddaughter like some small jewel as a thing to be folded up in a case and never trusted in common  she was afraid to allow her to go about the village or into the school and cottages always fancying she might be made ill or meet with some harm but mrs king being an old servant whom she knew so well and the way lying across only two meadows beyond friarswood park the little pet was allowed to go so far to visit her fostermother and bring whatever she could devise to cheer the poor sick boy  miss jane though of the same age as ellen and of course with a great deal more learning and accomplishment had been so little used to help herself or to manage anything that she was like one much younger  the sight of the rough stranger on the bridge was really startling to her and she came across the road and garden as fast as she could without a run and the first thing the brother and sister heard was her voice saying rather out of breath and fluttered oh what a horridlooking boy  seeing that mrs king was serving some one in the shop she only nodded to her and came straight upstairs  alfred raised up his head and beheld the little fairy through the open door first the head and the smiling little face and slight figure in the fresh summer dress  miss jane was not thought very pretty by strangers but that dainty little person and sweet sunny eyes and merry smile and shy kind gracious ways were perfect in the eyes of her grandmamma and of mrs king and her children if of nobody else  alfred in his present dismal state only felt vexed at a fresh person coming up to worry him and make a talking especially one whose presence was a restraint so that he could not turn about and make cross answers at his will  well alfred how are you today said the sweet gay voice a little subdued  better maam thank you said alfred who always called himself better whatever he felt but his voice told the truth better than his words  hes had a very bad night miss jane said his sister no sleep at all since two oclock and he is so low today that i dont know what to do with him  alfred hated nothing so much as to hear that he was low for it meant that he was cross  poor alfred said the young lady kindly  was it pain that kept you awake  no maamnot so much said the boy  miss jane saw he looked very sad and hoped to cheer him by opening her basket  ive brought you a new book alfred  it is the cherrystones  have you finished the last  no maam  did you like it  yes maam  but it was a very matterofcourse sort of yes and disappointed miss jane who thought he would have been charmed with the swiss family robinson  ellen spoke oh yes alfred you know you did like it  i heard you laughing to yourself at ernest and the shell of soup  and harold reads that and tis so seldom he will look at a book  jane did not like this quite as well as if alfred had spoken up more but she dived into her basket again and brought out a neat little packet of green leaves with some strawberries done up in it and giving a little smile she made sure that it would be acceptable  ellen thanked vehemently and alfred gave feeble thanks but unluckily he had so set his mind upon raspberries that he could not enjoy the thought of anything else  it was a sickly distaste for everything and miss selby saw that he was not as much pleased as she meant him to be she looked at him wistfully and half grieved half impatient she longed to know what he would really like or if he were positively ungrateful  she was very young and did not know whether it was by his fault or her mistake that she had failed to satisfy him  puck had raced up after her and had come poking and snuffling round alfred  she would have called him away lest he should be too much for one so weak but she saw alfred really did enjoy this his hand was in the long rough coat and he was whispering poor puck and good little doggie and the little hairy rummaging creature with the bright black beads of eyes gleaming out from under his shaggy hair was doing him more good than her sense and kindness or ellens either  she turned to the window and said to ellen what a wildlooking lad that is on the bridge  yes miss jane said ellen i was quite afraid he would frighten you  well i was surprised said jane i was afraid he might speak to me but then i knew i was too near friends for harm to come to me and she laughed at her own fears  how ragged and wretched he looks  has he been begging  no miss jane he came into the shop and bought some bread  he paid for it honestly but i never did see any one so dirty  and theres alfred wishing to be like him  i knew you would tell him it is quite wicked miss jane  it is not right i suppose to wish to be anything but what we are said jane rather puzzled by the appeal and perhaps that poor beggarboy would only like to have a nice room and kind mother and sister like you alfred  i dont say anything against them cried the boy vehemently butbutid give anythinganything in the worldto be able to run about again in the hayfield  no dont talk to me ellen i sayi hate them all when i see them there and i forced to lie here  i wish the sun would never shine  he hid his eyes and ears in the pillow as if he never wished to see the light again and would hear nothing  the two girls both stood trembling ellen looked at miss selby and she felt that she must say something  but what could she say  with tears in her eyes she laid hold of alfreds thin hand and tried to speak choked by tears  dear alfred dont say such dreadful things you know we are all so sorry for you but god sent it  alfred gave a groan of utter distress as if it were no consolation  andand things come to do us good continued miss jane the tears starting to her cheeks  i dont know what good it can do me to lie here cried alfred  oh but alfred it must  i tell you exclaimed the poor boy forgetting his manners so that ellen stood dismayed it does not do me good  i didnt use to hate harold nor to hate everybody  to hate harold said jane faintly  ay said alfred when i hear him whooping about like mad and jumping and leaping and going on like i used to do and never shall again  the tears came thick and fast and perhaps they did him good  but alfred said jane trying to puzzle into the right thing sometimes things are sent to punish us and then we ought to submit quietly  i dont know what ive done then he cried angrily  there have been many worse than i any day that are well enough now  oh alfred it is not who is worse but what one is oneself said jane  alfred grunted  i wish i knew how to help you she said earnestly it is so very sad and hard and i dare say i should be just as bad myself if i were as ill but do pray alfred try to think that nobody sent it but god and that he must know best  alfred did not seem to take in much comfort and jane did not believe she was putting it rightly but it was time for her to go home so she said anxiously goodbye alfred i hope youll be better next timeandand she bent down and spoke in a very frightened whisper you know when we go to church we pray you may have patience under your sufferings  then she sprang away as if ashamed of the sound of her own words but as she was taking up her basket and wishing ellen goodbye she saw that the strange lad had moved nearer the house and timid little thing as she was she took out a sixpence and said do give him that and ask him to go away  ellen had no very great fancy for facing the enemy herself but she made no objection and looking downstairs she saw her brother harold waiting while his mother stamped the letters and she called to him and sent him out to the boy  he came back in a few moments so much amazed that she could see the whites all round his eyes  he wont have it  hes a rum one that  he says hes no beggar and that if the young lady would give him work hed thank her but he wants none of her money and hell stand where he chooses  why didnt you lick him hallooed out alfreds voice from his bed  oh if i  nonsense alfred cried miss jane frightened into spirit stand still harold  i dont mind him  and she put up her parasol and walked straight out at the house door as bold as a little lioness going on without looking to the right or left  if began harold clenching his fistsand alfred raised himself upon his bed with flashing eyes to watch as the boy had moved nearer and looked for a moment as if he were going to grin or say something impudent but the quiet childish form stepping on so simply and steadily seemed to disarm him and he shrunk back left her to trip across the road unmolested and stood leaning over the rail of the bridge gazing after her as she crossed the hayfield  harold rode off with the letters and alfred lay gazing and wondering what that stranger could be counting the holes in his garments and trying to guess at his history  one good thing was that alfred was so much carried out of himself that he was cheerful all the evening     chapter iihaymaking   there was again a sultry night which brought on so much discomfort and restlessness that poor alfred could not sleep  he tried to bear in mind how much he had disturbed his mother the night before and he checked himself several times when he felt as if he could not bear it any longer without waking her and to remember his old experience that do what she would for him it would be no real relief and he should only be sorry the next day when he saw her going about her work with a worn face and a headache  then every now and then miss selbys words about being patient came back to him  sometimes he thought them hard coming from a being who had never known sickness or sorrow and wondered how she would feel if laid low as he was but they would not be put away in that manner for he knew they were true and were said by others than miss jane though he had begun to think no phrase so tiresome hopeless or provoking  people always told him to be patient when they had no comfort to give him and did not know what he was suffering  he would not have minded it so much if only he could have got it out of his head  somehow it would not let him call to his mother if it was only because very likely all he should get by so doing would be to be again told to be patient  and then came miss janes telling him his illness might be good for him as if she thought he deserved to be punished  really that was hard  who could think he deserved this wearing pain and helplessness only because he had played tricks on the butler and housekeeper and now and then laughed at church  it is just like job and his friends thought alfred  i dont want her to come and see me any more  poor alfred  there was a little twinge here  his conscience could not give quite such an account as did that of job  but he did not like recollecting his own errors better than any of us do and liked much more to feel himself very hardly used and greatly to be pitied  thereupon he opened his lips to call to his mother but that old thought about patience returned on him he had mercy on her regular breathing though it made him quite envious to hear it and he said to himself that he would let her alone at least till the next time the clock struck  it would be three oclock next time  oh dear would the night never be over  how often such a round of weary thoughts came again and again can hardly be counted but at any rate poor alfred was exercising one act of forbearance and that was so much gain  at last he found by the increasing light shewing him the shapes of all the pictures that he must have had a short sleep which had made him miss the clock and he felt a good deal injured thereby  however mrs king was too good a nurse not to be awakened by his first movement and she came to him gave him some cold tea and settled his pillow so as to make him more comfortable and when he begged her to let in a little more air she went to open the window wider and relieve the closeness of the little room  she had learnt while living with lady jane that night air is not so dangerous as some people fancy and it was an infinite relief to alfred when the lattice was thrown back and the cool breeze came softly in with the freshness of the dew and the delicious scent of the hayfield  mrs king stood a moment to look out at the beautiful stillness of early dawn the trees and meads so gravely calmly quiet and the silver dew lying white over everything the tanned haycocks rising up all over the field the morning star and waning moon glowing pale as light of morning spread over the sky  then a cock crew somewhere at a distance and mrs shepherds cock answered him more shrilly close by and the swallows began to twitter under the eaves  it will be a fine day to be sure she said  the farmer will get in his hay and then she stood looking as if something had caught her attention  what do you see mother asked alfred  i was looking what that was under yon haycock said mrs king and i do believe it is some one sleeping there  ha cried alfred  i dare say it is the boy that would not have miss janes sixpence  im sure i hope hes after no harm said mrs king i dont like to have tramps about so near  i hope he means no mischief by the farmers poultry  he cant be one of that sort or he wouldnt have refused the money said alfred  how nice and cool it must be sleeping in the hay  ill warrant he doesnt lie awake  i wish i was there  youll know what to be thankful for one of these days my poor lad said his mother sighing then yawning she said i must go back to bed mind you call out alfred if you hear anything like a noise in the farm yard  this notion rather interested alfred he began to build up a fine scheme of shouting out and sending harold to the rescue of the cocks and hens and how well he would have done it himself a year ago and pinned the thief and fastened the door on him  not that he thought this individual lad at all likely to be a thief nor did he care much for farmer shepherd who was a hard man and no favourite but to catch a thief would be a grand feat  and while settling his clever plan and making some compliments for the magistrate to pay him alfred fanned by the cool breeze fell into a sound sleep and did not wake till the sun was high and all the rest of the house were up and dressed  that good sleep made him much more able to bear the burden of the day first his mother came with the towel and basin and washed his face and hands and then he had his little book and said his prayers and somehow today he felt so much less fractious than usual that he asked to be taught patience and not only to be made well as he had hitherto done  that over he lay smiling as he waited for his breakfast and when ellen brought it to him he had not one complaint to make but ate it almost with a relish  is that boy gone he asked ellen as she tidied the room while he was eating  what the dirty boy  no there he is speaking to the farmer  will he beg of him  asking for work more likely  id sooner give work to a pig at once said ellen but i do believe hes getting it  i fancy they are short of hands for the hay  yes hes pointing into the field  ay and hes sending him into the yard  i hope hell give him some breakfast said alfred  do you know he slept all night on a haycock  yes so mother said just like a dog and he got up like a dog this morningnever so much as washed himself at the river  why hes coming here  whatever does he want  the lad  no the farmer  mr shepherds heavy tread was heard below and as alfred said ellen had only to hold her tongue for them be able to hear his loud tones telling mrs king that the glass was falling and his hay in capital order and his hands short and asking whether her boy harold would come and help in the hayfield between the post times  mrs king gave a ready answer that the boy would be well pleased and the farmer promised him his victuals and sixpence for the day  your lass wouldnt like to come too i suppose eh  ellen flushed with indignation  she go a haymaking  her mother was civilly making answer that her daughter was engaged with her sick brother and besideshad her work for mrs price which must be finished off  the farmer saying he had not much expected her but thought she might like a change from moping over her needle went off  ellen did not feel ready to forgive him for wanting to set her to field work  there is some difference between being fine and being refined and in ellens station of life it is very difficult to hit the right point to be refined is to be free from all that is rough coarse or ungentle to be fine is to affect to be above such things  now ellen was really refined in her quietness and maidenly modesty and there was no need for her to undertake any of those kinds of tasks which by removing young girls from home shelter do sometimes help to make them rude and indecorous but she was fine when she gave herself a little mincing air of contempt as if she despised the work and those who did it  lydia grant who worked so steadily and kept to herself so modestly that no one ventured a bold word to her as she tossed her hay was just as refined as ellen king behind her white blinds ay or as jane selby herself in her terraced garden  refinement is in the mind that loves whatsoever is pure lovely and of good report finery is in disdaining what is homely or humble  boys of all degrees are usually when they are good for anything the greatest enemies of the finery tending to affectation and alfred at once began to make a little fun of his sister and tell her it would be a famous thing for her he believed she had quite forgotten how to run and did not know a rake from a fork when she saw it  he knew she was longing for a ride in the waggon if she would but own it  ellen used to be teased by this kind of joking but she was too glad to see alfred well enough so to entertain himself to think of anything but pleasing him so she answered goodhumouredly that harold must make hay for them all three today no doubt but he would be pleased enough  he was heard trotting home at this moment and whistling as he hitched up the pony at the gate and ran in with the letterbag to snap up his breakfast while the letters were sorted  here let me have them called alfred and they were glad he should do it for he was the quickest of the family at reading handwriting but he was often too ill to attend to it and more often the weary fretfulness and languor of his state made him dislike to exert himself so it was apt to depend on his will or caprice  look sharp alf hallooed out harold rushing upstairs with the bags in one hand and his breadandbutter in the other  if you find a letter for that there ragglesford i dont know what i shall do to you  i must be back in no time for the hay  and he had bounced downstairs again before ellen had time to scold him for making riot enough to shake alfred to pieces  he was a fine tall stout boy with the same large fully open blue eyes high colour white teeth and light curly hair as his brother and sister but he was much more sunburnt  if you saw him with his coat off he looked as if he had red gloves and a red mask on so much whiter was his skin where it was covered and he was very strong for his age and never had known what illness was  the brothers were very fond of each other but since alfred had been laid up they had often been a great trial to each otherthe one seemed as little able to live without making a noise as the other to endure the noise he made and the sight of harolds activity and the sound of his feet and voice vexed the poor helpless sufferer more than they ought to have done or than they would had the healthy brother been less thoughtless in the joy of his strength  today however all was smooth  alfred did not feel every tread of those bounding limbs like a shock to his poor diseased frame and he only laughed as he unlocked the leathern bag and dealt out the letters putting all those for the lady jane selby miss selby and the servants into their own neat little leathern case with the padlock and sorting out the rest with some hope there might be one from matilda who was a very good one to write home  there was none from her but then there was none for ragglesford and that was unexpected good luck  if the old housekeeper left in charge had been wicked enough to get her newspaper that day alfred felt that in harolds place he should be sorely tempted to chuck it over the hedge  ellen looked as if he had talked of murdering her and truly such a breach of trust would have been a very grievous fault  the reverendwhats his name the reverend marcus cope friarswood near elbury read alfred one two three letters and a newspaper yes and this long printedlooking thing  who is he ellen  what did you say said ellen who was busy shaking her mothers bed and had not heard at the first moment but now turned eagerly what did you say his name was  the reverend marcus cope repeated alfred  is that another new parson  why did not we tell you what a real beautiful sermon the new clergyman preached on sunday  mr cope so thats his name  i wonder if he is come to staymother she ran to the head of the stairs the new clergymans name is the reverend mr marcus cope  he dont live at ragglesford i hope cried harold who regarded any one at the end of that long lane as his natural enemy  no it only says friarswood said ellen  youll have to find out where he lives harold  pish it will take me an hour going asking about said harold impatiently  he must have his letters left here till he chooses to come for them if he doesnt know where he lives  no no harold that wont do said mrs king  you must take the gentleman his letters and theyll be sure to know at the park or at the rectory or at the tankard where he lodges  well it will be a real comfort if he is come to stop  so harold went off with the letters and the pony and ellen and her mother exchanged a few words about the gentleman and his last sundays sermon and then ellen went to dust the shop and put out the bread while her mother attended to alfreds wound the most painful part of the day to both of them  it was over however and alfred was resting afterwards when harold cantered home as hard as the pony could or would go and came racing up to say ive seen him  hes famous  he stood out in the road and met me and asked for his letters and hes to be at the parsonage and he asked my name and then he laughed and said oh  i perceive it is the royal mail  i didnt know what he was at but he looked as goodhumoured as anything  halloo give me my old hat nellthats it hurrah for the haywaggon  i saw the horses coming out  and off he went again full drive and alfred did nothing worse than give a little groan  ellen had enough to do in wondering about mr cope  news seemed to belong of right to the postoffice and it was odd that he should have preached on sunday and now it should be tuesday without anything having been heard of him not even from miss jane but then the young lady had been fluttered by the strange boy and alfred had been so fretful that it might have put everything out of her head  friarswood was used to uncertainty about the clergyman  the rector had fallen into such bad health that he had long been unable to do anything and always hoping to get better he had sent different gentlemen to take the services first one and then another or had asked the masters at ragglesford to help him but it was all very irregular and no one had settled down long enough to know the people or do much good in visiting them  my lady as they all called lady jane was as sorry as any one could be and she tried what she could do by paying a very good school master and mistress and giving plenty of rewards but nothing could be like the constant care of a real good clergyman and the people were all the worse for the want  they had the church to go to but it was not brought home to them  the rector had been obliged at last to go abroad one of the ragglesford gentlemen had performed the service for the ensuing sundays until now there seemed to be a chance that this new clergyman was coming to stay  this interested alfred less than his sister  his curiosity was chiefly about the strange lad and when he was moved to his place by the window he turned his eyes anxiously to make him out in the line of haymakers two fields off as they shook out the grass to give it the days sunshine  he knew them all the ten women with their old straw bonnets poked down over their faces and deep curtains sewn on behind to guard their necks the farm men come in from their other work to lend a hand three or four boys among whom he could see harolds white shirt sleeves and sometimes hear his merry laugh and he was working next to the figure in brown fadedlooking tattered array which alfred suspected to belong to the strange boy  so did ellen  ah she said harold ye scraped acquaintance with that vagabondlooking boy i wish i had warned him against it but i suppose he would only have done it all the more  you want to make friends with him yourself ellen  we shall have you nodding to him next  you are as curious about him as can be said alfred slyly  me  i never was curious about nothing so insignificant said ellen all i wish is that that boy may not be running into bad company  the hayfields were like an entertainment on purpose for alfred all day he watched the shaking of the brown grass all over the meadows in the morning and the farmer walking over it and smelling it and spying up to guess what would come of the great rolling towers of grey clouds edged with pearly white soft but dazzling which varied the intense blue of the sky  then he watched all the company sit or lie down on the shady side of the hedge under the pollardwillows and tom boldre the shuffler and one or two more go into the farmhouse and come out with great yellowware with pies in them and the little sturdylooking kegs of beer and two mugs to go round among them all  there was harold lying down quite at his ease close to the strange boy alfred knew how much better that dinner would taste to him than the best with the tablecloth neatly spread in his mothers kitchen and well did alfred remember how much more enjoyment there was in such a meal as that than in any one of the dainties that my lady sent down to tempt his sickly appetite  and what must pies and beer be to the wanderer who had eaten the crust so greedily the day before then after the hours rest the haymakers rose up to rake the hay into beds ready for the waggons  harold and the stranger were raking opposite to each other and alfred could see them talking and when they came into the nearer hayfield he saw harold put up his hand and point to the open window as if he were telling the other lad about the sick boy who was lying there  he was so much absorbed in thus watching that he did not pay much heed to what interested his mother and sisterthe reports which came by every customer about the new clergyman who it appeared had been staying in the next parish till yesterday when he had moved into the rectory and mrs bonham the butchers wife reported that the rectory servants said he was come to stay till their master came back  all this and much more mrs king heard and rehearsed to ellen while alfred lay sometimes reading the swiss robinson sometimes watching the loading of the wains as they creaked slowly through the fields the horses seeming to enjoy the work among their fragrant provender as much as the human kind  when five oclock struck harold gave no signs of quitting the scene of action and mrs king in much anxiety lest the letters should be late sent helen to get the pony ready while she herself went into the field to call the boy  very unwilling he was to comehe shook his shoulders and growled and grumbled and said he should be in plenty of time and he wished the post was at the bottom of the sea  nothing but his mothers orders and the necessity of the case could have made him go at all  at last he walked off as if he had lead in his feet muttering that he wished he had not some one to be always after him  mrs king looked at the grimy face of his disreputablelooking companion and wondered whether he had put such things into his head  very cross was harold as he twitched the bridle out of ellens hand threw the strap of the letterbag round his neck and gave such a reechoing switch to the poor pony that alfred heard it upstairs and started up to call out for shame harold  harold was ashamed he settled himself in the saddle and rode off but alfred had not the comfort of knowing that his illhumour was not being vented upon the poor beast all the way to elbury  alfred had given a great deal of his heart to that pony and it made him feel helpless and indignant to think that it was illused  those tears of which he was ashamed came welling up into his eyes as he lay back on his pillow but they were better tears than yesterdaysthey were not selfish  never mind alfy said ellen harolds not a cruel lad hell not go on if he was cross for a bit  it is all that hes mad after that boy there  i wish mother had never let him go into the hayfield to meet bad company  depend upon it that boy has run away out of a reformatory sleeping out at night  i cant think how farmer shepherd could encourage him among honest folk  well now i think of it i should not wonder if he had said mrs king he is the dirtiest boy that ever i did see  most likely i wish he may do no mischief tonight  harold came home in better humour but a fresh vexation awaited him  mrs king would not let him go to the hayhome supper in the barn  the men were apt to drink too much and grow riotous and with her suspicions about his new friend she thought it better to keep him apart  she was a spirited woman who would be minded and harold knew he must submit and that he had behaved very ill  ellen told him too how much alfred had been distressed about the pony and though he would not shew her that he cared it made him go straight upstairs and with a somewhat sheepish face say i say alf the ponys all right  i only gave him one cut to get him off  hed never go at all if he didnt know his master  hed go fast enough for my voice said alfred  you know id never go for to beat him continued harold but it was enough to vex a chapwasnt itto have mother coming and lugging one off from the carrying and away from the supper and all  women always grudge one a bit of fun  mother never grudged us cricket nor nothing in reason said alfred lucky you that could make hay at all  and what made you so taken up with that new boy that ellen runs on against and will have it hes a convict  a convict if ellen says that again cried harold no more a convict than she is  what is he then  where does he come from  his name is paul blackthorn said harold and hes the queerest chap i ever came across  why he knew no more what to do with a prong than the farmers old sow till i shewed him  but where did he come from repeated alfred  he walked all the way from piggots turnpike yesterday said harold hes looking for work  and before that  hed been in the union outoh somewhere i forgot where but its a name in the postal guide  well but youve not said who he is said ellen  who why i tell you hes paul blackthorn  but i suppose he had a father and mother said ellen  no said harold  no ellen and alfred cried out together  not as ever he heard tell of said harold composedly as if this were quite natural and common  and you could go and be raking with him like born brothers there said ellen in horror  dye think id care for stuff like that said harold  why he singshe sings better than jack lyte  hes learnt to sing you know and hes such a comical fellow he said mr shepherd was like a big pig on his hind legs and when mrs shepherd came out to count the scraps after we had done what does he do but whisper to me to know how long our withered cyder apples had come to life  such talents for amusing others evidently far outweighed in harolds consideration such trifling points as fathers mothers and respectability  alfred laughed but ellen thought it no laughing matter and reproved harold for being wicked enough to hear his betters made game of  my betters said haroldan old skinflint like farmer shepherds old woman  hush harold  ill tell mother of you that i will cried ellen  do then said harold who knew his sister would do no such thing  she had made the threat too often and then not kept her word  she contented herself with saying well all i know is that im sure now he has run away out of prison and is no better than a thief and if our place isnt broken into before tomorrow morning and mothers silver sugartongs gone it will be a mercy  im sure i shant sleep a wink all night  both boys laughed and alfred asked why he had not done it last night  how should i know said ellen  most likely he wanted to see the way about the place before he calls the rest of the gang  take care harold its a gang coming now said alfred laughing again all coming on purpose to steal the sugartongs  no ill tell you what they are come to steal said harold mischievously its all for ellens fine green ivyleaf brooch that matilda sent her  i dare say harold has been and told him everything valuable in the house said ellen  i think said alfred gravely it would be a very odd sort of thief to come here when the farmers ploughing cup is just by  yes said harold id better have told him of that when i was about it dont you think so nelly  if you go on at this rate said ellen teased into anger youll be robbing the postoffice yourself some day  ay and ill get paul blackthorn to help me said the boy  come ellen dont be so foolish i tell you hes every bit as honest as i am id go bail for him  and i know hell lead you to ruin cried ellen half crying a boy that comes from nowhere and nobody knows and sleeps on a haycock all night no better than a mere tramp  what quarrelling here said mrs king coming upstairs  the lad i wish him no ill im sure but hell be gone by tomorrow so you may hold your tongues about him and well read our chapter and go to bed  harolds confidence and ellens distrust were not much wiser the one than the other  which was nearest being right     chapter iiia new friend   the postoffice was not robbed that night neither did the silver sugar tongs disappear though paul blackthorn was no farther off than the hay loft at farmer shepherds where he had obtained leave to sleep  but he did not go away with morning though the haymaking was over ellen saw him sitting perched on the empty waggon munching his breakfast and to her great vexation exchanging nods and grins when harold rode by for the mornings letters and afterwards there was a talk between him and the farmer which ended in his having a hoe put into his hand and being next seen in the turnipfield behind the farm  to make up for the good day this one was a very bad one with poor alfred  there was thunder in the air and if the sultry heat weighed heavily even on the healthy no wonder it made him faint and exhausted disposed to selfpity and terribly impatient and fretful  he was provoked by ellens moving about the room and more provoked by harolds whistling as he cleaned out the stable and on the other hand harold was petulant at being checked and vowed there was no living in the house with alfred making such a work  moreover alfred was restless and wanted something done for him every moment interrupting ellens work and calling his mother up from her baking so often for trifles that she hardly knew how to get through it  the doctor mr blunt came and he too felt the heat having spent hours in going his rounds in the closeness and dust  he was a rough man and his temper did not always hold out he told alfred sharply that he would have no whining and when the boy moaned and winced more than he would have done on a good day he punished him by not trying to be tenderhanded  when mrs king said perhaps a little lengthily how much the boy had suffered that morning the doctor wearied out no doubt with peoples complaints cut her short rather rudely ay ay my good woman i know all that  and can nothing be done sir when he feels so sinking and weak  sinkinghe must feel sinkingnothing to do but to bear it said mr blunt gruffly as he prepared to go  dont keep me now and as alfred held up his hand and made some complaint of the tightness of the bandage he answered impatiently ive no time for that my lad keep still and be glad youve nothing worse to complain of  then you dont think he is getting any better sir said mrs king keeping close to him  i thought he was yesterday and i wanted to speak to you  my oldest daughter thought if we could get him away to the sea and  thats all nonsense said the hurried doctor dont you spend your money in that way i tell you nothing ever will do him any good  this was at the bottom of the stairs and mr blunt was off  he was the cleverest doctor for a good way round and it was not easy to mrs king to secure his attendance  her savings and matildas were likely to melt away sadly in paying him since she was just too well off to be doctored at the parish expense and he was really a good and upright man though wanting in softness of manner when he was hurried and teased  if mrs king had known that he was in haste to get to a child with a bad burn she might have thought him less unkind in the short ungentle way in which he dashed her hopes  alas there had never been much hope but she feared that alfred might have heard and have been shocked  ellen heard plainly enough and her heart sank  she tried to look at her brothers face but he had put it out of sight and spoke not a word and she only could sit wondering what was the real drift of the cruel words and whether the doctor meant to give no hope of recovery or only to dissuade her mother from vainly trying change of air  her once bright brother always thus  it was a sad thought and yet she would have been glad to know he would be no worse and ellens heart was praying with all her might that he might have his health and happiness restored to him and that her mother might be spared this bitter sorrow  alfred said nothing about the doctors visit but he could eat no dinner and did not think this so much the fault of his sickly taste as of his mothers potatopie he could not think why she should be so cross as to make that thing when she knew he hated it and as to poor harold alfred would hardly let him speak or stir without ordering ellen down to tell him not to make such a row  ellen was thankful when harold was fairly hunted out of the house and garden even though he betook himself to the meadow where paul blackthorn was lying on the grass with his feet kicking in the air and shewing the skin through his torn shoes  the two lads squatted down on the grass with their heads together  who could tell what mischief that runaway might be putting into harolds head and all because alfred could not bear with him enough for him to be happy at home  they were so much engrossed that it needed a rough call from the farmer to send paul back to his work when the dinnerhour was over whereupon harold came slowly to his digging again  hotter and hotter did it grow and the grey dull clouds began to gain a yellow lurid light in the distance there were low growlings of thunder far away and ellen left her work unfinished and forgot how hot she was herself in toiling to fan alfred so as to keep him in some little degree cooler while the more he strove with the heat the more oppressed and miserable he grew  poor fellow his wretchedness was not so much the heat as the dim perception of mr blunts hasty words he had not heard them fullyhe dared not inquire what they had been and he could not endure to face themyet the echo of nothing will ever do him good seemed to ring like a knell in his ears every time he turned his weary head  nothing do him good  nothing  always these four walls that little bed this wasting weary lassitude this gnawing throbbing pain no pony no running no shouting no sense of vigour and health ever again and perhapsthat terrible perhaps which made alfreds very flesh quail he would not think of and to drive it away he found some fresh toil to require of the sister who could not content him toil as she would  slowly the afternoon hours rolled on one after the other and alfred had just been in a pet with the clock for striking four when he wanted it to be five when the sky grew darker and one or two heavy drops of rain came plashing down on the thirsty earth  the storm is coming at last and now it will be cooler said ellen looking out from the window  dear me she added there stopping short  what asked alfred  what are you gaping at  i declare cried ellen its the new clergyman  it is mr cope and he is coming up to the wicket  alfred turned his head with a peevish sound he was in the dreary mood to resent whatever took off attention from him for a moment  a very pleasantlooking gentleman commented ellen and so young  he does not look older than charles lawrence  i wonder whether he is coming in or if it is only to post a letter  oh there he is talking to mother  there  a vivid flash of lightning came over the room at that moment and made them all pause till it was followed up by the deep rumble of the thunder and then down rushed the rain plashing and leaping up again bringing out the delicious scent from the earth and seeming in one moment to breathe refreshment and relief on the sick boy  his brow was already clearing as he listened to his mothers tones of welcome as she was evidently asking the stranger to sit down and wait for the storm to be over and the cheerful voice that replied to her  he did not scold ellen for as usual making things neat and whereas five minutes sooner he would have hated the notion of any one coming near him he now only hoped that his mother would bring mr cope up and presently he heard the well known creak of the stairs under a manly foot and his mothers voice saying something about a great sufferer sir  then came in sight his mothers white cap and behind her one of the most cheerful lively faces that alfred had ever beheld  the new curate looked very little more than a boy with a nice round fresh rosy face and curly brown hair and a quick joyous eye and regular white teeth when he smiled that merry goodhumoured smile  indeed he was as young as a deacon could be and he looked younger  he knocked his tall head against the top of the low doorway as he came into the room and answered mrs kings apologies with a pleasant laugh  ellen knew her mother would like him the better for his height for no one since the handsome coachman himself had had to bend his head to get into the room  alfred liked the looks of him the first moment and by way of salutation put up one of his weary white blueveined hands to pull his damp forelock but mr cope nodding in answer to ellens curtsey took hold of his hand at once and softening the cheery voice that was so pleasant to hear said well my boy i hope we shall be good friends  and whats your name  alfred king sir was the answer  it really was quite a pleasure not to begin with the old weary subject of being pitied for his illness  king alfred said mr cope  i met king harold yesterday  ive got into royal company it seems  alfred smiled it was said so drolly but his mother who felt a little as if she were being laughed at said why sir my brothers name was alfred and as to harold it was to please miss janes little sister that diedshe was quite a little girl then sir but so clever and she would have him named out of her history of england  did miss selby give you those flowers said mr cope admiring the rose and geranium in the cup on the table  yes sir and mrs king launched out in the praises of miss jane and of my lady an inexhaustible subject which did not leave alfred much time to speak till mrs king seeing the groom from the park coming with the letterbag through the rain asked mr cope to excuse her and went down stairs  well alfred i think you are a lucky boy he said  i was comparing you with a lad i once knew of who got his spine injured and is laid up in a little narrow garret in a back street with no one to speak to all day  i dont know what he would not give for a sister and a window like this and a miss jane  alfred smiled and said please sir how old is he  about sixteen a nice stout lad he was as ever i knew till his accident i often used to meet him going about with his master and thought it was a pleasure to meet such a goodhumoured face  alfred ventured to ask his trade and was told he was being brought up to wait on his father who was a bricklayer but that a ladder had fallen with him as he was going up with a heavy load and he had been taken at once to the hospital  the house on which he was employed belonged to a friend of mr cope and all in the power of this gentleman had been done for him but that was not much for it was one of the families that no one can serve the father drank and the mother was forced to be out charing all day and was so rough a woman that she could hardly be much comfort to poor jem when she was at home  alfred was quite taken up with the history by this time and kept looking at mr cope as if he would eat it up with his eager eyes  ellen asked compassionately who did for the poor boy all day  his mother runs in at dinnertime if she is not at work too far off and he has a jug of water and a bit of bread where he can reach them the door is open generally so that he can call to some of the other lodgers but though the house is as full as a beehive often nobody hears him  i believe his great friend is a little schoolgirl who comes and sits by him and reads to him if she can but she is generally at school or else minding the children  it must be very lonely said alfred perceiving for the first time that there could be people worse off than himself but has he no books to read  he was so irregularly sent to school that he could not read to himself even if his corner were not so dark and the window so dingy  my friend gave him a bible but he could not get on with it and his mother i am sorry to say pawned it  ellen and alfred both cried out as if they had never heard of anything so shocking  it was grievous said mr cope but the poor things did not know the value and when there was scarcely a morsel of bread in the house there was cause enough for not judging them hardly but i dont think jem would allow it now  he got some of his little friends easy scripture lessons and the like in large print which he croons over as he lies there alone till one feels sure that they are working into his heart  the people in the house say that though he has been ill these three years he has never spoken an illtempered word and if any one pities him he answers it is the lord and seems to wish for no change  he lies there between dozing and dreaming and praying and always seems content  does he think he shall get well said alfred who had been listening earnestly  oh no there is no chance of that it is an injury past cure  but i suppose that while he bears the will of god so patiently here his heavenly father makes it up to him in peacefulness of heart now and the hope of what is to come hereafter  alfred made no answer but his eyes shewed that he was thinking and mr cope rose and looked out of window as a gleam of sunshine while the dark cloud lifted up from the northwest made the trees and fields glow with intense green against the deep grey of the sky darker than ever from the contrast  ellen stood up and alfred exclaimed oh sir please come again soon  very soon said mr cope goodhumouredly but youve not got rid of me yet the rain is pretty hard still and i see the beggarmen dancing all down the gardenwalk  alfred and ellen smiled to hear their mothers old word for the drops splashing up again and mr cope went on  the garden looks very much refreshed by this beautiful shower  it is in fine order  is it the other monarchs charge  harolds sir said ellen  yes he takes a great pride in it and so did alfred when he was well  ah i dare say and it must be pleasant to you to see your brother working in it now  i see him under that shed and who is that lad with him  they seem to have some good joke together  oh said ellen harold likes company you see sir and will take up with anybody  i wish you could be so good as to speak to him sir for lads of that age dont mind women folk you see sir  what  i hope his majesty does not like bad company said mr cope not at all that he thought lightly of such an evil but it was his way to speak in that droll manner especially as ellens voice was a little bit peevish  nobody knows no harm of the chap said alfred provoked at ellen for what he thought unkindness in setting the clergyman at once on his brother but ellen was the more displeased and exclaimed  nor nobody knows no good  hes a young tramper that hired with farmer shepherd yesterday a regular runaway and reprobate just out of prison most likely  well i hope not so bad as that said mr cope hes not a badlooking boy but i dare say you are anxious about your brother  it must be dull for him to have his companion laid upand by the looks of him i dare say his spirits are sometimes too much for you he added turning to alfred  he does make a terrible racket sometimes said alfred  ay and i dare say you will try to bear with it and not drive him out to seek dangerous company said mr cope at which alfred blushed a little as he remembered the morning and that he had never thought of this danger  mr cope added i think i shall go and talk to those two merry fellows i must not tire you my lad but i will soon come here again and he took leave  heartily did ellen exclaim well that is a nice gentleman and as heartily did alfred reply  he felt as if a new light had come in on his life and mr cope had not said one word about patience  ellen expected mr cope to come back and warn her mother against paul blackthorn but she only saw him stand talking to the two lads till he made them both grin again and then as the rain was over he walked away paul went back to his turnips and harold came thundering upstairs in his great shoes  alfred was cheerful and did not mind him now but ellen did and scolded him for the quantity of dirt he was bringing up with him from the moist garden which was all one steam of sweet smells as the sun drew up the vapour after the rain  if you were coming in youd better have come out of the rain not stood idling there with that goodfornothing lad  the new minister said he would be after you if you were taking up with bad company  who told you i was with bad company said harold  why i could see it  i hope he rebuked you both  he asked us if we could play at cricketand he asked the ponys name said harold if thats what you call rebuking us  and what did he say to that boy  oh he told him he heard he was a stranger here like himself and asked how long hed been here and where he came from  and what did he say  he said he was from upperscote unioncome out because he was big enough to keep himself and come to look for work said harold  hes a right good chap ill tell you and ill bring him up to see alfy one of these days  bring up that dirty boy  i should like to see you cried ellen making such a face  i dont believe a word of his coming out of the union im sure hes run away out of gaol by the look of him  ellenharoldcome down to your tea called mrs king  so they went down and presently while mrs king was gone up to give alfred his tea there came mrs shepherd bustling across with her black silk apron thrown over her cap with the crimson gauze ribbons  she wanted a bit of tape and if there were none in the shop harold must match it in elbury when he took the letters  ellen was rather familiar with mrs shepherd because she made her gowns and they had some talk about the new clergyman  mrs shepherd did not care for clergymen much if she had done so she might not have been so hard with her labourers  she was always afraid of their asking her to subscribe to something or other so she gave it as her opinion that she should never think it worth while to listen to such a very young man as that and she hoped he would not stay and then she said so your brother was taking up with that comebychance lad i saw  did he make anything out of him  he fancies him more than i like or mother either said ellen  he says hes out of upperscote union but hes a thorough impudent one and owns hes no father nor mother nor nothing belonging to him  i think it is a deal more likely that he is run away from some reformatory or prison  thats just what i said to the farmer said mrs shepherd  i said he was out of some place of that sort  im sure its a sin for the gentlemen to be setting up such places raising the county rates and pampering up a set of young rogues to let loose on us  ay ay  ill warrant hes a runaway thief  i told the farmer hed take him to his sorrow but you see he is short of hands just now and the men are so set up and grabbing i dont know how farmers is to live  so mrs shepherd went away grumbling instead of being thankful for the beautiful crop of hay safely housed before the thunder shower which had saved the turnips from the fly  ellen might have doubted whether she had done right in helping to give the boy a bad name but just then in came the ostler from the tankard with some letters  here he said heres one from one of the gentlemen lodging here fishing to cayenne  youll please to see how much there is to pay  ellen looked at her postal guide but she was quite at a fault and she called upstairs to alfred to ask if he knew where she should look for cayenne  he was rather fond of maps and knew a good deal of geography for a boy of his age but he knew nothing about this place and she was just thinking of sending back the letter to ask the gentleman where it was when a voice said  try guiana or else south america  she looked up and there were pauls dirty face and dirtier elbows leaning over the halfdoor of the shop  why how do you know she said starting back  i learnt at school cayenne capital of french guiana  sure enough cayenne had guiana to it in her list and the price was found out  but when this learned geographer advanced into the shop and asked for a loaf what a hand and what a sleeve did he stretch out  ellen scarcely liked to touch his money and felt all her disgust revive  but for all that and for all her fear of harolds running into mischief what business had she to set it about that the stranger was an escaped convict  meanwhile alfred had plenty of food for dreaming over his fellow sufferer  it really seemed to quiet him to think of another in the same case and how many questions he longed to have asked mr cope  he wanted to know whether it came easier to jem to be patient than to himself whether he suffered as much wearing pain whether he grieved over the last hope of using his limbs and above all the question he knew he never could bear to ask whether jem had the dread of death to scare his thoughts though never confessed to himself  he longed for mr copes next visit and felt strongly drawn towards that thought of jem yet ashamed to think of himself as so much less patient and submissive so little able to take comfort in what seemed to soothe jem that it was the lords doing  could jem think he had been a wicked boy and take it as punishment     chapter ivpaul blackthorn   i say cried harold running up into his brothers room as soon as he had put away the pony do you know whether paul is gone  it is always paul paul exclaimed ellen im sure i hope he is  but why do you think he would be asked alfred  oh didnt you hear  he knows no more than a baby about anything and so he turned the cows into darnel meadow and never put the hurdle to stop the gapnever thinking they could get down the bank so the farmer found them in the barley and if he did not run out against him downright shamefulthough paul up and told him the truth that twas nobody else that did it  what and turned him off  well thats what i want to know said harold going on with his tea paul said to me he didnt know how he could stand the like of thatand yet he didnt like to be offhed taken a fancy to the place you see and theres me and theres old caesarand so he said he wouldnt go unless the farmer sent him off when he came to be paid this eveningand old skinflint has got him so cheap i dont think he will  for shame harold dont call names  well there he is said alfred pointing into the farmyard towards the hayloft door  this was over the cowhouse in the gable end and in the dark opening sat paul his feet on the top step of the ladder and caesar the yarddog lying by his side his white paws hanging down over the edge his sharp white muzzle and grey prick ears turned towards his friend and his eyes casting such appealing looks that he was getting more of the hunch of bread than probably paul could well spare  how has he ever got the dog up the ladder cried harold  well said mrs king i declare he looks like a picture i have seen  well to be sure who would go for to draw a picture of the like of that exclaimed ellen pausing as she put on her things to carry home some work  it was a picture of a spanish beggarboy said mrs king and the housekeeper at castlefort used to say that the old lordthats lady janes brotherhad given six hundred pounds for it  ellen set out on her walk with a sound of wonder quite beyond words  six hundred pounds for a picture like paul blackthorn  she did not know that so poor and feeble are mans attempts to imitate the daily forms and colourings fresh from the divine hand that a likeness of the very commonest sight if represented with something of its true spirit and life wins a strange value especially if the work of the great master artists of many years ago  and even the painter murillo himself though he might pleasantly recall on his canvas the notion of the brighteyed olivetinted lad resting after the toil of the day could never have rendered the free lazy smile on his face nor the gleam of the dogs wistful eyes and quiver of its eager ears far less the glow of setting sunlight that shed over all that warm clear ruddy light so full of rest and cheerfulness beautifying as it hid so many common things the thatched roof of the barn the crested hayrick close beside it the waggons all red and blue that had brought it home and were led to rest the horses drooping their meek heads as they cooled their feet among the weed in the dark pondthe ducks moving with low contented quacks and quicklywagging tails in one long single file to their evening foraging in the dewy meadows the spruce younger poultry pecking over the yard staying up a little later than their elders to enjoy a few leavings in peace free from the persecutions of the cross old king of the dunghillall this left in shade while the ruddy light had mounted to the roofs gave brilliance to every round tuft of moss and gleamed on the sober foliage of the old spreading walnut tree  poor lad said mrs king it seems a pity he should come to such a rough life when he seems to have got such an education  i hope he is not run away from anywhere  youre as bad as ellen mother cried harold who will have it that hes out of prison  no not that said mrs king but it did cross me whether he could have run away from school and if his friends were in trouble for him  he never had any friends said harold nor he never ran away  hes nothing but a foundling  they picked him up under a blackthorn bush when he was a baby with nothing but a bit of an old plaid shawl round him  did they ever know who he belonged to asked alfred  never nor he doesnt care if they dont for sure they could be no credit to him but they that found him put him into the union and there an old woman that they called granny moll took to him  she had but one eye he says but mother i do believe he never had another friend like her for he got to pulling up the bits of grass and was near crying when he said she was dead and gone and then he didnt care for nothing  but who taught him about cayenne asked alfred  oh that was the union school  all the children went to school and they had a terrible sharp master who used to cut them over the head quite cruel and was sent away at last for being such a savage but paul being always there and having nothing else to do you see got on ever so far and can work sums in his head downright wonderful  there came an inspector once who praised him up and said hed recommend him to a place where hed be taught to be a schoolmaster if any one would pay the cost but the guardians wouldnt hear of it at no price and were quite spiteful to find he was a good scholar for fear i suppose that hed know more than they  hush hush harold said his mother wait till you have to pay the rates before you run out against the guardians  what do you mean mother  why dont you see the guardians have their duties to those who pay the rates as well as those that have parish pay  what they have to do is to mind that nobody starves or the like and their means comes out of the rates out of my pocket and the like of me as well as my ladys and all the rich  well whatever they might like to do it would not be serving us fairly to take more than was a bare necessity from us to send your master paul and the like of him to a fine school  tis for them to be just and other folk to be generous with whats their own  mother talks as if she was a guardian herself said alfred in his funny way  ah the collectors going his rounds responded harold and mrs king laughed goodhumouredly always glad to see her sick boy able to enjoy himself but she sighed saying ay and ill can i spare it though thanks be to god that ive been as yet of them that pay and not of them that receive  go on the parish  mother what are you thinking of cried both sons indignantly  poor mrs king was thinking of the long winter and the heavy doctors bill and feeling that after all suffering and humbling might not be so very far off but she was too cheerful and full of trust to dwell on the thought so she smiled and said i only said i was thankful boys for the mercy that has kept us up  go on now harold what about the boy  why i dont know that hed have gone if they had paid his expenses ever so much said harold for hes got a great spirit of his own and wouldnt be beholden to any one he said now he could keep himselfhed had quite enough of the parish and its keep so he said hed go on the tramp till he got work and they let him out of the union with just the clothes to his back and a shilling in his pocket  twas the first time he had ever been let out of bounds since he was picked up under the tree and he said no one ever would guess the pleasure it was to have nobody to order him here and there and no bounds round him and he quite hated the notion of getting inside walls again as if it was a prison  oh i know  i can fancy that cried alfred raising himself and panting and where did he go first  first he only wanted to get as far from upperscote as ever he could so he walked on i cant say how he lived but he didnt beg he got a job here and a job there but there are not so many things he knows the knack of having been at school all his life  once he took up with a man that sold salt to draw his cart for him but the man swore at him so awfully he could not bear it and beat him too so he left him and he had lived terrible hard for about a month before he came here  so you see mother theres not one bit of harm in him hes a right good scholar and never says a bad word nor has no love for drink so you wont be like ellen and be always at me for going near him  youre getting a big boy harold and it is lonely for you said mrs king reluctantly and if the lad is a good lad id not cast up his misfortune against him but i must say i should think better of him if he would keep himself a little bit cleaner and more decent so as he could go to church  harold made a very queer face and said how is he to do it up in the hayloft mother and he hant got enough to pay for lodgings nor for washing nor to change  the river is cheap enough said alfred  do you remember when we used to bathe together harold and go after the minnows  ay but he dont know how and then they did plague him so in the union that hes got to hate the very name of washingscrubbing them over and cutting their hair as if they were in gaol  poor boy he is terribly forsaken said mrs king compassionately  you may say that returned harold why hes never so much as seen how folks live at home and wanted to know if you were most like old moll or the master of the union  alfred went into such a fit of laughter as almost hurt him but mrs king felt the more pitiful and tender towards the poor deserted orphan who could not even understand what a mother was like and the tears came into her eyes as she said well im glad hes not a bad boy  i hope he thinks of the father and the home that he has above  i say harold against next sunday ill look out alfreds oldest shirt for him to put on and you might bring me his to wash only mind you soak it well in the river first  harold quite flushed with gratitude for his mothers kindness for he knew it was no small effort in one so scrupulously and delicately clean and with so much work on her hands but mrs king was one who did her alms by her trouble when she had nothing else to give  alfred smiled and said he wondered what ellen would say and almost at the same moment harold shot downstairs and was presently seen standing upon pauls ladder talking to him then paul rose up as though to come down and there was much fun going on as to how caesar was to be got down for as every one knows a dog can mount a ladder far better than he can descend and poor caesar stretched out his white paw looked down seemed to turn giddy whined and looked earnestly at his friends till they took pity on him and lifted him down between them stretching out his legs to their full length like a live handbarrow  a few seconds more and there was a great trampling of feet and then in walked harold exclaiming here he is  and there he stood shy and sheepish with rusty black shag by way of hair keen dark beads of eyes and very white teeth but all the rest face hands jacket trousers shoes and all of darker or lighter shades of olivebrown and as to the rents one would be sorry to have to count them mending them would have been a thing impossible  what a difference from the pure whiteness of everything around alfred the soft pink of the flush of surprise on his delicate cheek and the wavy shine on his light hair  a few months ago alfred would have been as ready as his brother to take that sturdy hand marbled as it was with dirt and would have heeded all drawbacks quite as little but sickness had changed him much and paul was hardly beside his couch before the colour fleeted away from his cheek and his eye turned to his mother in such distress that she was obliged to make a sign to harold in such haste that it looked like anger and to mutter something about his being taken worse  and while she was holding the smelling salts to him and sprinkling vinegar over his couch they heard the two boys voices loud under the window paul saying he should never come there again and harold something about people being squeamish and fine  it hurt alfred and he burst out almost crying mother  mother now isnt that too bad  it is very thoughtless said mrs king sorrowfully but you know everybody has their feelings alfred and i am sorry it happened so  im sure i couldnt help it said alfred as if his mother were turning against him  harold had better have brought up the farmers whole stable at once  when you were well you did not think of such things any more than he does  alfred grunted  he could not believe that and he did not feel gently when his brother shewed any want of consideration but his mother thought he would only grow crosser by dwelling on the unlucky subject so she advised him to lie still and rest before his being moved to bed and went down herself to finish some ironing  presently alfred saw the curate coming over the bridge with quick long steps and this brought to his mind that he had been wishing to hear more of the poor crippled boy  he watched eagerly and was pleased to see mr cope turn in at the wicket and presently the tread upon the stairs was heard and the high head was lowered at the door  good evening alfred your mother told me it would not disturb you if i came up alone and he began to inquire into his amusements and occupations till alfred became quite at home with him and at ease and ventured to ask if you please sir do you ever hear about jem now and as mr cope looked puzzled the boy you told me of sir that fell off the scaffold  oh the boy at liverpool  no i only saw him once when i was staying with my cousin but i will ask after him if you wish to hear  thank you sir  i wanted to know if he had been a bad boy  that i cannot tell  why do you wish to know  was it because he had such an affliction  yes sir  i dont think that is quite the way to look at troubles said mr cope i should think his accident had been a great blessing to him if it took him out of temptation and led him to think more of god  but isnt it punishment said alfred not able to get any farther but mr cope felt that he was thinking of himself more than of jem  all our sufferings in this life come as punishment of sin he said  if there had been no sin there would have been no pain and whatever we have to bear in this life is no more than is our due whatever it may be  every one is sinful said alfred slowly but why have some more to bear than others that may be much worse  did you never think it hard to be kept strictly and punished by your good mother  alfred answered rather fretfully but if it is good to be punished why aint all alike  god in his infinite wisdom sees the treatment that each particular nature needs  some can be better trained by joy and some by grief some may be more likely to come right by being left in active health others by being laid low and having their faults brought to mind  alfred did not quite choose to take this in and his answer was half sulky  bad boys are quite well  and a reckoning will be asked of them  do not think of other boys think over your past life of which i know nothing and see whether you can believe after real looking into it that you have done nothing to deserve gods displeasure  there are other more comforting ways of bringing joy out of pain but of this i am sure that none will come home to us till we own from the bottom of our heart that whatever we suffer in this life we suffer most justly for the punishment of our sins  god bless and help you my poor boy  good night  with these words he went downstairs for well he knew that while alfred went on to justify himself no peace nor joy could come to him and he thought it best to leave the words to work in praying in his heart that they might do so and help the boy to humility and submission  finding mrs king in her kitchen he paused and said we shall have a confirmation in the spring mrs king shall not you have some candidates for me  my daughter will be very glad thank you sir she is near to seventeen and a very good girl to me  and harold he is but fourteenwould he be old enough sir  i believe the bishop accepts boys as young and he might be started in life before another opportunity  well sir he shall come to you and i hope you wont think him too idle and thoughtless  hes a goodhearted boy sir but it is a charge when a lad has no father to check him  indeed it is mrs king but i think you must have done your best  i hope i have sir she said sadly ive tried but my ability is not much and he is a lively lad and im sometimes afraid to be too strict with him  if you have taught him to keep himself in order thats the great thing mrs king if he has sound principles and honours you i would hope much for him  and sir that boy he has taken a fancy to he is a poor lost lad who never had a home but harold says he has been well taught and he might take heed to you  thank you mrs king i will certainly try to speak to him  you said nothing of alfred do you think he will not be well enough  ah  sir she said in her low subdued voice my mind misgives me that it is not for confirmation that you will be preparing him  mr cope started  he had seen little of illness and had not thought of this  indeed does the doctor think so ill of him  do not these cases often partially recover  i dont know sir mr blunt does not give much account of him and her voice grew lower and lower ive seen that look in his fathers and his brothers face  she hid her face in her handkerchief as if overpowered but looked up with the meek look of resignation as mr cope said in a broken voice i had not expectedyou had been much tried  yes sir  the will of the lord be done she said as if willing to turn aside from the dark side of the sorrow that lay in wait for her but im thankful you are come to help my poor boy nowhe frets over his trouble as is natural and im afraid he should offend and im no scholar to know how to help him  you can help him by what is better than scholarship said mr cope and he shook her hand warmly and went away feeling what a difference there was in the ways of meeting affliction     chapter van unwelcome visitor   the axe is laid to the root of the tree was said by the great messenger when the new and better covenant was coming to pierce try and search into the hearts of men  something like this always happens in some measure whenever closer clearer and more stringent views of faith and of practice are brought home to christians  they do not always take well the finding that more is required of them than they have hitherto fancied needful and there are many who wince and murmur at the sharp piercing of the weapon which tries their very hearts they try to escape from it and to forget the disease that it has touched and at first often grow worse rather than better  well is it for them if they return while yet there is time before blindness have come over their eyes and hardness over their heart  perhaps this was the true history of much that grieved poor mrs king and distressed ellen during the remainder of the summer  anxious as mrs king had been to bring her sons up in the right way there was something in mr copes manner of talking to them that brought things closer home to them partly from their being put in a new light and partly from his being a man and speaking with a different kind of authority  alfred did not like his last conversationit was little more than his mother and miss selby had saidbut then he had managed to throw it off and he wanted to do so again  it was pleasanter to him to think himself hardly treated than to look right in the face at all his faults he knew it was of no use to say he had none so he lumped them all up by calling himself a sinful creature like every one else and thus never felt the weight of them at all because he never thought what they were  and yet because mr copes words had made him uneasy he could not rest in this state he was out of temper whenever the curates name was spoken and accused ellen of bothering about him as much as harold did about paul blackthorn and if he came to see him he made himself sullen and would not talk sometimes seeming oppressed and tired and unable to bear any ones presence sometimes leaving ellen to do all the answering dreading nothing so much as being left alone with the clergyman  mr cope had offered to read prayers with him and he could not refuse but he was more apt to be thinking that it was tiresome than trying to enter into what poor foolish boy would have been his best comfort  to say he was cross when mr cope was there would be saying much too little there was scarcely any time when he was not cross he was hardly civil even to miss jane so that she began to think it was unpleasant to him to have her there and if she were a week without calling he grumbled hard thoughts about fine people he was fretful and impatient with the doctor and as to those of whom he had no fears he would have been quite intolerable had they loved him less or had less pity on his suffering  he never was pleased with anything teased his mother half the night and drove ellen about all day  she good girl never said one word of impatience but bore it all with the sweetest good humour but her mother now and then spoke severely for alfreds own good and then he made himself more miserable than ever and thought she was unkind and harsh and that he was very much to be pitied for having a mother who could not bear with her poor sick boy  he was treating his mother as he was treating his father in heaven  how harold fared with him may easily be guessedhow the poor boy could hardly speak or step without being moaned at till he was almost turned out of his own house and his mother did not know what to do for alfred was really very ill and fretting made him worse and nothing could be so bad for his brother as being driven out from home to spend the long summer evenings as he could  ellen would have been thankful now had paul blackthorn been the worst company into which harold fell  not that paul was a bit cleaner on the contrary each day could not fail to make him worse till as ellen had once said you might almost grow a crop of radishes upon his shoulders  mrs kings kind offer of washing his shirt had come to nothing  she asked harold about it and had for answer do you think he would after the way you served him  either he was affronted or he was ashamed of her seeing his rags or what was not quite impossible there was no shirt at all in the case and he had a sturdy sort of independence about him that made him always turn surly at any notion of anything being done for him for charity  how or why he stayed on with the farmer was hard to guess for he had very scanty pay and rough usage the farmer did not like him the farmers wife scolded him constantly and laid on his shoulders all the mischief that was done about the place and the shuffler gave him half his own work to do and hunted him about from dawn till past sunset  he was always going at the end of every week but never gone perhaps he had undergone too much in his wanderings to be ready to begin them again or perhaps either caesar or harold one or both kept him at friarswood  and there might be another reason too for no one had ever spoken to him like mr cope  very few had ever thrown him a kindly word or seemed to treat him like a thing with feelings and those few had been rough and unmannerly but mr copes goodnatured smile and pleasant manner had been a very different thing and perhaps paul promised to come to the confirmation class chiefly because of the friendly tone in which he was invited  when there he really liked it  he had always liked what he was taught apart from the manner of teaching and now both manner and lessons were delightful to him  his answers were admirable and it was not all head knowledge for very little more than a really kind way of putting it was needed to make him turn in his loneliness to rest in the thought of the everpresent father  hard as the discipline of his workhouse home had been it had kept him from much outward harm the little he had seen in his wanderings had shocked him and he was more untaught in evil than many lads who thought themselves more respectable so there was no habit of wickedness to harden and blunt him and the application of all he had learnt before found his heart ready  he had not gone to church since he left the workhouse he did not think it belonged to vagabonds like him besides he always felt walls like a prison and he had not profited much by the workhouse prayers which were read on weekdays by the master and on sundays by a chaplain who always had more to do than he could manage and only went to the paupers when they were very ill  but when mr cope talked to him of the duty of going to church he said i will sir and he sat in the gallery with the young lads who were not quite as delicate as alfred  the service seemed to rest him and to be like being brought near a friend and he had been told that church might always be his home  he took a pleasure in going thitherthe more perhaps that he rather liked to shew how little he cared for remarks upon his appearance  there was a great deal of independence about him and having escaped from the unloving maintenance of the parish while he had as yet been untaught what affection or gratitude meant he would not be beholden to any one  scanty as were his wages he would accept nothing from anybody he daily bought his portion of bread from mrs king but it was of no use for her to add a bit of cheese or bacon to it he never would see the relish and left it behind and so he never would accept mr copes kind offers of giving him a bit of supper in his kitchen perhaps because he was afraid of being said to go to the rectory for the sake of what he could get  he did not object to the farmers beer which was sometimes given him when any unusual extra work had been put on him  that was his right for in truth the farmer did not pay him the value of his labour and perhaps disliked him the more because of knowing in his conscience that this was shameful extortion  however just at harvest time when pauls shoes had become very like what may be sometimes picked up by the roadside mr shepherd did actually bestow on him a pair that did not fit himself  harold came home quite proud of them  however on the third day they were gone and the farmers voice was heard on the bridge rating paul violently for having changed them away for drink  mrs king felt sorrowful but as ellen said what could you expect of him  in spite of the affront there was a sort of acquaintance now over the counter between mrs king and young blackthorn and when he came for his bread she could not help saying im sorry to see you in those again  why the others hurt me so i could hardly get about said paul  ah poor lad i suppose your feet has got spread with wearing those old ones but you should try to use yourself to decent ones or youll soon be barefoot and i do think it was a pity to drink them up  thats all the farmer maam  he thinks one cant do anything but drink  well what is become of them  why you see maam they just suited dick royston and he wanted a pair of shoes and i wanted a bible and prayerbook so we changed em  when ellen heard this she could not help owning that paul was a good boy after all though it was in an odd sort of way  but alas when next he was to go to mr cope there was a hueandcry all over the hayloft for the prayerbook  there was no place to put it safely or if there had been poor paul was too great a sloven to think of any such thing and as it was in a somewhat rubbishy state to begin with it was most likely that one of the cows had eaten it with her hay and all that could be said was that it would have been worse if it had been the bible  as to dick royston to find that he would change away his bible for a pair of shoes made mrs king doubly concerned that he should be a good deal thrown in harolds way  there are many people who neglect their bibles and do not read them but this may be from thoughtlessness or press of care and is not like the wilful breaking with good that it is to part with the holy scripture save under the most dire necessity and dick was far from being in real want nor was he ignorant like mr copes poor jem for he had been to school and could read well but he was one of those many lads who alas are everywhere to be found who break loose from all restraint as soon as they can maintain themselves they do their work pretty well and are tolerably honest but for the restalas they seem to live without god  prayers and church they have left behind as belonging to schooldays and in all their strength and health their days of toil their evenings of rude diversion their sundays of morning sleep noonday basking in the sun evening cricket they have little more notion of anything concerning their souls than the horses they drive  if ever a fear comes over them it seems a long long way off a whole lifetime before them they are awkward and in dread of one anothers jeers and remarks and if they ever wish to be better they cast it from them by fancying that time must steady them when they have had their bit of fun or that something will come from somewhere to change them all at once and make it easy to them to be goodas if they were not making it harder each moment  this sort of lad had been utterly let alone till mr cope came and lady jane and the schoolmaster felt it was dreary work to train up nice lads in the school only to see them run riot and forget all good as soon as they thought themselves their own masters  mr cope was anxious to do the best he could for them and the confirmation made a good opportunity but the boys did not like to be interfered withit made them shy to be spoken to and they liked lounging about much better than having to poke into that mind of theirs which they carried somewhere about them but did not like to stir up they had no notion of going to school againwhich no one wanted them to donor to church because it was like little boys and they wouldnt be obliged  so mr cope made little way with them a few who had better parents came regularly to him but others went off when they found it too much trouble and behaved worse than ever by way of shewing they did not care this folly had in some degree taken possession of harold and though he could not be as bad as were some of the others he was fast growing impatient of restraint and worried and angry as if any word of good advice affronted him  driven from home by the fear of disturbing alfred he was left the more to the company of boys who made him ashamed of being ordered by his mother and there was a jaunty careless style about all his ways of talking and moving that shewed there was something wrong about himhe scorned ellen and was as saucy as he dared even to his mother and though mr cope found him better instructed than most of his scholars he saw him quite as idle as restless at church and as ready to whisper and grin at improper times as many who had never been trained like him  one august sunday afternoon mrs king was with alfred while ellen was at church  he was lying on his couch very uncomfortable and fretful when to the surprise of both a knock was heard at the door  mrs king looked out of the window and a smart hardlooking pigeonsneck silk bonnet at once nodded to her and a voice said ive come over to see you cousin king if youll come down and let me in  i knew i should find you at home  betsey hardman exclaimed alfred in dismay you wont let her come up here mother  not if i can help it said mrs king sighing  if there were a thing she disliked above all others it was sunday visiting  you must help it mother said alfred in his most pettish tones  i wont have her here worrying with her voice like a hen cackling  say you wont let her come her  very well said mrs king in doubt of her own powers and in haste to be decently civil  say you wont repeated alfred  gadding about of a sunday and leaving her old sick mothermore shame for her  promise mother  he had nearly begun to cry at his mothers unkindness in running down stairs without making the promise for in fact mrs king had too much conscience to gain present quiet for any one by promises she might be forced to break and betsey hardman was only too well known  her mother was an aunt of alfreds father an old decrepit widow nearly bedridden but pretty well to do by being maintained chiefly by her daughter who made a good thing of taking in washing in the suburbs of elbury and always had a girl or two under her  she had neither had the education nor the good training in service that had fallen to mrs kings lot and her way of life did not lead to softening her tongue or temper  ellen called her vulgar and though that is not a nice word to use she was coarse in her ways of talking and thinking loudvoiced and unmannerly although meaning to be very goodnatured  alfred lay in fear of her step ten times harder than harolds in his most boisterous mood coming clamp clamp up the stairs and her shrill voicethe same tone in which she bawled to her deaf mother and hallooed to her girls when they were hanging out the clothes in the high windcoming pitying himay and perhaps her whole weight lumbering down on the couch beside him shaking every joint in his body  his mothers ways learnt in the selby nursery had made him more tender and more easily fretted by such things than most cottage lads who would have been used to them and never have thought of not liking to have every neighbour who chose running up into the room and talking without regard to subject or tone  he listened in a fright to the latch of the door and the coming in betseys voice came up through every chink of the boards whatever she did herself and he could hear every word of her greeting as she said how it was such a fine day she said to mother she would take a holiday and come and see cousin king and the poor lad it must be mighty dull for him moped up there  stump stump  was she coming  his mother was answering something too soft for him to hear  what is he asleep  o mother must you speak the truth  bless me  i should have thought a little cheerful company was good for him  do you leave him quite alone  well and there was a frightful noise of the foot of the heaviest chair on the floor  ill sit down and wait a bit  is he so very fractious then  what was his mother saying  alfred clenched his fist and grinned anger at betsey with closed teeth  there was the tiresome old word loway sos my mother but you should rise his spirits with company you see thats why i came over as soon as ever i heard that there wasnt no hope of him says i to mother  what  what was that she had heard  there was his mother probably trying to restrain her voice for it came up now just loud enough to make it most distressing to try to catch the words which sounded like something pitying  ay ayjust like his poor father when they be decliny it will come out one ways or another and says i to mother ill go over and cheer poor cousin king up a bit for you see after all if hed lived hed be nothing but a burden crippled up like that and a lingering job is always bad for poor folks  alfred leant upon his elbow his eyes full stretched but feeling as if all his senses had gone into his ears in his agony to hear more and he even seemed to catch his mothers voice but there was no hope in that it was of her knowing it would be all for the best and the sadness of it told him that she believed the same as betsey  then came yes i declare it gave me such a turn you might have knocked me down with a feather  i asked mr blunt to come in and see whats good for mother she feels so weak at times and has such a noise in her head just like the regiment playing drums she says till she cant hardly bear herself and so what do you think he says  dont wrap up her head so warm says hea pretty thing for a doctor to say as if a poor old creature like that past seventy years old could go without a bit of flannel to her head and her three nightcaps and a shawl over them when theres a draught  i say cousin i hant got much opinion of mr blunt  why dont you get some of them boxes of pills that does cures wonderful ever so many lords and ladies cured of a perplexity fit by only just taking an imposing draught or two  another time alfred would have laughed at the very imposing draught that was said to cure lords and ladies of this jumble between apoplexy and paralysis but this was no moment for laughing and he was in despair at fancying his mother wanted to lead her off on the quack medicine but she went on  well only read the papers that come with them  i make my girl sally read em all to me being that shes a better scholar and the long words is quite heavenlyi declare there aint one of them shorter than peregrination  id have brought one of them over to shew you if i hadnt come away in a hurry because evanss cart was going out to the merry orchard and says i to mother well ill get a lift now theres such a chance to friarswood itll do them all a bit of good to see a bit of cheerful company seeing as mr blunt says that poor lad is going after his father as fast as can be  dear me says i you dont say so such a fine healthylooking chap as he was  yes he says but its in the constitution its getting to the lungs and hell never last out the winter  alfred listened for the tone of his mothers voice he knew he should judge by that even without catching the wordslow subdued sadhe almost thought she began with yes  all the rest that he heard passed by him merely as a sound noted no more than the lowing of the cattle or the drone of the thrashing machine  he lay half lifted up on his pillows drawing his breath short with apprehension his days were numbered and death was coming fast fast straight upon him  he felt it within himselfhe knew now the meaning of the pain and sinking the shortness of breath and choking of throat that had been growing on him through the long summer days he was being cut off with pining sickness and his sentence had gone forth  he would have screamed for his mother in the sore terror and agony that had come over him in hopes she might drive the notion from him but the dread of seeing her followed by that woman kept his lips shut except for his long gasps of breath  and she could not keep himmr blunt could not keep him no one could stay the hand that had touched him  prayer  they had prayed for his father for charlie but it had not been gods will  he had himself many times prayed to recover and it had not been grantedhe was worse and worse  moreover whither did that path of suffering lead  up rose before alfred the thought of living after the unknown passage and of answering for all he had done and now the faults he had refused to call to mind when he was told of chastisement came and stood up of themselves  bred up to know the good he had not loved it he had cared for his own pleasure not for god he had not heeded the comfort of his widowed mother he had been careless of the honour of gods house said and heard prayers without minding them he had been disrespectful and illbehaved at my ladyshe had been bad in every way and when illness came how rebellious and murmuring he had been how unkind he had been to his patient mother sister and brother and when mr cope had told him it was meant to lead him to repent he would not hear and now it was too late the door would be shut  he had always heard that there was a time when sorrow was no use when the offer of being saved had been thrown away  when ellen came in and after a short greeting to betsey hardman went up stairs she found alfred lying back on his pillow deadly white the beads of dew standing on his brow and his breath in gasps  she would have shrieked for her mother but he held out his hand and said in a low hoarse whisper ellen is it true  what alfy dear  what is the matter  what she says  who  betsey hardman  dear dear alf is it anything dreadful  that i shall die said alfred his eyes growing round with terror again  that mr blunt said i couldnt last out the winter  dear alfy dont cried ellen throwing her arms round him and kissing him with all her might dont fancy it  shes always gossiping and gadding about and dont know what she says and shed got no business to tell stories to frighten my darling she exclaimed sobbing with agitation  im sure mr blunt never said no such thing  but mother thinks it ellen  she doesnt she cant cried ellen vehemently i know she doesnt or she could never go about as she does  ill call her up and ask her to satisfy you  no no not while that woman is there cried alfred holding her by the dress ill not have her coming up  even while he spoke however mrs king was coming  betsey had spied an old acquaintance on the way from church and had popped out to speak to her and mrs king caught that moment for coming up  she understood all for she had been sitting in great distress lest alfred should be listening to every word which she was unable to silence and about which betsey was quite thoughtless  so many people of her degree would talk to the patient about himself and his danger and go on constantly before him with all their fears and the doctors opinions that betsey had never thought of there being more consideration and tenderness shewn in this house nor that mrs king would have hidden any pressing danger from the sick person but such plain words had not yet passed between her and mr blunt and though she had long felt what alfreds illness would come to the perception had rather grown on her than come at any particular moment  now when ellen with tears and agitation asked what that betsey had been saying to frighten alfred so and when she saw her poor boys look at her and heard his sob oh mother it was almost too much for her and she went up and kissed him and laid him down less uneasily but he felt a great tear fall on his face  its not true mother im sure it is not true cried ellen she ought  mrs king looked at her daughter with a sad sweet face that stopped her short and brought the sense over her too  did he say so mother said alfred  not to me dear she answered but ellen shes coming back  shell be up here if you dont go down  poor ellen what would she not have given for power to listen to her mother and cry at her ease  but she was forced to hurry or betsey would have been halfway upstairs in another instant  she was a hopeful girl however and after that not to me resolved to believe nothing of the matter  mrs king knelt down by her son and looked at him tenderly and then as his eyes went on begging for an answer she said dr blunt never told me there was no hope my dear and everything lies in gods power  but you dont think i shall get well mother  i dont feel as if you would my boy she said very low and fondling him all the time  youve got to cough like father and charlie andthough he might raise my boy upyet anyhow alfy boy if god sees it good for us it will be good for us and we shall be helped through with it  but im not good mother  what will become of me  perhaps the hearing this is all out of gods mercy to give you time to get ready my dear  you are no worse now than you were this morning you are not like to go yet awhile  no indeed my child so if you dont put off any longer  mother called up ellen  she was in despair  betsey was not to be kept by her from satisfying herself upon alfreds looks and mrs king was only in time to meet her on the stairs and tell her that he was so weak and low that he could not be seen now she could not tell how it would be when he had had his tea  ellen thought she had never had so distressing a teadrinking in her life as the being obliged to sit listening civilly to betseys long story about the trouble she had about a stocking of mrs martins that was lost in the wash and that had gone to miss rosa marlowe because mrs martin had her things marked with a badlydone k e m and all that mrs martins maria and all miss marlowes jane had said about it and all betseys says i to motherwhen she was so longing to be watching poor alfred and how her mother could sit so quietly making tea and answering so civilly she could not guess but mrs king had that sense of propriety and desire to do as she would be done by which is the very substance of christian courtesy the very want of which made betsey with all her wish to be kind a real oppression and burthen to the whole party  and where was harold  ellen had not seen him coming out of church but mealtimes were pretty certain to bring him home  oh said betsey ill warrant he is off to the merry orchard  i hope not said mrs king gravely  he never would said ellen in anger  ah well i always said i didnt see no harm in a lad getting a bit of pleasure  no indeed said mrs king  harold knows i would not stint him in the fruit nor in the pleasure but i should be much vexed if he could go out on a sunday buying and selling among such a lot as meet at that orchard  well im sure i dont know when poor folks is to have a holiday if not on a sunday and the poor boy must be terrible moped with his brother so ill  not doing thine own pleasure on my holy day thought ellen but she did not say it for her mother could not bear for texts to be quoted at people  but her heart was very heavy and when she went up with some tea to alfred she looked from the window to see whether as she hoped harold might be in pauls hayloft preferring going without his tea to being teased by betsey  paul sat in his loft with his bible on his knee and his head on caesars neck  alfred said ellen do you know where harold is  sure he is not gone to the merry orchard  is not he come home said alfred  oh then he is  he is gone to the merry orchard breaking sunday with dick royston  and byandby hell be ill and die and be as miserable as i am  and alfred cried as ellen had never seen him cry     chapter vithe merry orchard   where was harold  still the evening went on and he did not come  alfred had worn himself out with his fit of crying and lay quite still either asleep or looking so like it that when betsey had finished her tea and again began asking to see him ellen could honestly declare that he was asleep  betsey had bidden them goodbye more than half affronted at not being able to report to her mother all about his looks though she carried with her a basket of gooseberries and french beans and mrs king walked all the way down the lane with her and tried to shew an interest in all she said to make up for the disappointment  maybe likewise mrs king felt it a relief to her uneasiness to look up and down the road and along the river and into the farmyard in the hope that harold might be in sight but nothing was to be seen on the road but master norland his wife and baby soberly taking their sunday walk nor by the river except the ducks who seemed to be enjoying their evening bath and almost asleep on the water nor in the yard except paul blackthorn who had come down from his perch to drive the horses in from the homefield and shut the stable up for the night  she could not help stopping a moment at the gate and calling out to paul to ask whether he had seen anything of harold  he seemed to have a great mind not to hear and turned very slowly with his shoulder towards her making a sound like eh as if to ask what she said  have you seen my boy harold  i saw him in the morning  have you not seen him since  didnt he go to church with you  no i dont go to sunday school  was he there  she did not receive any answer  do you know if many of the boys are gone to the merry orchard  ay  well you are a good lad not to be one of them  hadnt got any money said paul gruffly but mrs king thought he said so chiefly from dislike to be praised and that there had been some principle as well as poverty to keep him away  it might be better if no one had it on a sunday she could not help sighing out as she looked anxiously along the lane ere turning in and then said my good lad i dont want to get you to be telling tales but it would set my heart at rest and his poor brothers up there if you could tell me he is not gone to briar alley  paul turned up his face from the gate upon which he was leaning his elbows and gazed for a moment at her sad meek anxious face then exclaimed i cant think how he could  poor paul was it not crossing him how impossible it would seem to do anything to vex one who so cared for him  then he is gone she said mournfully  they were all at him said paul and he said hed never seen what it was like  please dont take on missus hes right kind and goodhearted and wanted to treat me  i had rather he had hearkened to you my boy said mrs king  i dont know why he should do that said paul perhaps meaning that a boy who heeded not such a mother would certainly heed no one else  but please missus he added dont beat him for you made me tell on him  beat him no said mrs king with a sad smile hes too big a boy for me to manage that way  i cant do more than grieve if he lets himself be led away  then id like to beat him myself if he grieves you burst out paul doubling up his brown fist with indignation  but you wont said mrs king gently i dont want to make a quarrel among you and i hope youll help to keep him out of bad ways paul  i look to you for it  goodnight  perhaps the darkness and her own warm feeling made her forget the condition of that hand at any rate as she said goodnight she took it in her own and shook it heartily and then she went in  paul did not say goodnight in answer but when she had turned away his head went down between his two crossed arms upon the top of the gate and he did not move for many many minutes except that his shoulders shook and shook again for he was sobbing as he had never sobbed since granny moll died  if home and home love were not matters of course to you you might guess what strange new fountains of feeling were stirred in the wild but not untaught boy by that face that voice that touch  and mrs king as she walked to her own door in the twilight with bitter pain in her heart could not help thinking of those from the highways and hedges who flocked to the feast set at naught by such as were bidden  a sad and mournful sunday evening was that to the mother and daughter as each sat over her bible  mrs king would not talk to ellen for fear of awakening alfred not that low voices would have done so but ellen was already much upset by what she had heard and seen and to talk it over would have brought on a fit of violent crying so her mother thought it safest to say nothing  they would have read their bible to one another but each had her voice so choked with tears that it would not do  that alfred was sinking away into the grave was no news to mrs king but perhaps it had never been so plainly spoken to her before and his own knowledge of it seemed to make it more sure but brokenhearted as she felt she had been learning to submit to this and it might be better and safer for him she thought to be aware of his state and more ready to do his best with the time left to him  that was not the freshest sorrow or more truly a darker cloud had come over namely the feeling so terrible to a good careful mother that her son is breaking out of the courses to which she has endeavoured and prayed to bring him upthat he is casting off restraint and running into evil that may be the beginning of ruin and with no fathers hand to hold him in  o harold had you but seen the thick tears dropping on the walnut table behind the arm that hid her face from ellen you would not have thought your fun worth them  that merry orchard was about three miles from friarswood  it belonged to a man who kept a small publichouse and had a little farm and a large garden with several cherry trees which in may were perfect gardens of blossoms white as snow and in august with small black fruit of the sort known as merries and unhappily the fertile produce of these trees became a great temptation to the owner and to all the villagers around  as sunday was the only day when people could be at leisure he chose three sundays when the cherries were ripe for throwing open his orchard to all who chose to come and buy and eat the fruit and of course cakes and drink of various kinds were also sold  it was a solitary spot out of the way of the police or the selling in churchtime would have been stopped but as there may be cases of real distress the law does not shut up all houses for selling food and drink on a sunday so others where there is no necessity take advantage of it and so for miles round all the idle young people and children would call it a holiday to go away from their churches to eat cherries at briar alley buying and selling on a sunday noisy and clamorous and forgetting utterly that it was the lords day not their day of idle pleasure  it was a sad pity that an innocent feast of fruit should be almost out of reach unless enjoyed in this manner  to be sure merries might be bought any day of the week at briar alley and were hawked up and down friarswood so cheaply that any one might get a mouth as purple as the black spaniels any day in the season but that was nothing to the fun of going with numbers and numbers never could go except on a sunday  but if people wish to serve god truly why they must make up their minds to miss pleasures for his sake and this was one to begin with and i am much mistaken if the happiness of the week would not have turned out greater in the end with him  ay and as to the owner of the trees who said he was a poor man and could not afford to lose the profit i believe that if he would have trusted god and kept his commandment his profit in the long run would have been greater here to say nothing of the peril to his own soul of doing wrong and leading so many into temptation  the kings had been bred up to think a sunday going to the merry orchard a thing never to be done and in his most idle days alfred would never have dreamt of such a thing  indeed their good mother always managed to have some treat to make up for it when they were little and they certainly never wanted for merries nay a merry pudding had been their dinner this very day with savagelooking purple juice and scalding hot stones  if harold went it was for the frolic not for want of the dainty and wrong as it was his mother was grieving more at the thought of his casting away the restraint of his old habits than for the one action  one son going away into the unseen world the other being led away from the paths of rightno wonder she wept as she tried to read  at last voices were coming and very loud ones  the summer night was so still they could be heard a great waythose rude coarse voices of village boys boasting and jeering one another  i say wouldnt you like to be one of they chaps at ragglesford school  what lots they bought there on saturday to be sure  well they may theyve lots of tin  have they  how dye know  why the moneyletters  dont i know the feel of themdirected to master this and master that and with a seal and a card and half a sovereign or maybe a whole one under it and such lots as they gets before the holidaysthats to go home you see  well its a shame such little impudent rogues should get so much without ever doing a stroke of work for it  i say harold dont ye never put one of they letters in your pocket  for shame dick  ha  i shall know where to come when i wants half a sovereign or so  no you wont  it was only these last two or three speeches that reached the cottage at all clearly and they were followed by a sound as if harold had fallen upon one of the others and they were holding him off with halloos and shouts of hoarse laughing which broke alfreds sleep and his voice came downstairs with a startled cry of mother  mother what is that  she ran upstairs in haste and ellen threw the door open  the sudden display of the light silenced the noisy boys and harold came slowly up the gardenpath pretty certain of a scolding and prepared to feel it as little as he could help  well master a nice sort of a way of spending a sunday evening this began ellen and coming hollaing up the lane just on purpose to wake poor alfred when hes so ill  im sure i never meant to wake him  then what did you bring all that goodfornothing set roaring and shouting up the road for  and just this evening too when one would have thought you would we have cared for poor mother and alfred said she crying  why whats the matter now said harold  oh theyve been saying he cant live out the winter said ellen shedding the tears that had been kept back all this time and broke out now with double force in her grief for one brother and vexation with the other  but next winter seemed a great way off to harold and he was put out besides so he did not seem shocked especially as he was reproached with not feeling what he did not know so all he did was to say angrily and how was i to know that  of course you dont know anything going scampering over the country with the worst lot you can find away from church and all not caring for anything  poor mother she never thought one of her lads would come to that  plenty does so without never such a fuss said harold  why what harm is there in eating a few cherries  there would be very little pleasure or use in knowing what a wrangling went on all the time mrs king was upstairs putting alfred to bed  ellen had all the right on her side but she did not use it wisely she was very unhappy and much displeased with harold and so she had it all out in a fretful manner that made him more cross and less feeling than was his nature  there was something he did feel howeverand that was his mothers pale worn sorrowful face when she came downstairs and hushed ellen but did not speak to him  they took down the books read their chapter and she read prayers very low and not quite steadily  he would have liked very much to have told her he felt sorry but he was too proud to do so after having shewn ellen he was above caring for such nonsense  so they all went to bed harold on a little landing at the top of the stairs butwhether it was from the pounds of merrystones he had swallowed or the talk he had had with his sisterhe could not go to sleep and lay tossing and tumbling about thinking it very odd he had not heeded more what ellen had said when he first came in and the notion dawning on him more and more that day after day would come and make alfred worse and that by the time summer came again he should be alone who could have said it  why had not he asked  what could he have been thinking about  it should not be true  a sort of frenzy to speak to some one and hear the real meaning of those words so as to make sure they were only ellens nonsense came over him in the silent darkness presently he heard alfred moving on his pillow for the door was open for the heat and that long long sigh made him call in a whisper alf are you awake  in another moment harold was by his brothers side  alf  alf are you worse he asked whispering  no  then whats all this  what did they say  its all stuff im sure it is and youre getting better  but what did ellen mean  no harold said alfred getting his brothers hand in his its not stuff i shant get well im going after poor charlie and dont you be a bad lad harold and run away from your church for you dont knowhow bad it feels to and alfred turned his face down for the tears were coming thick  but you arent going to die alf  charlie never was like you i know he wasnt he was always coughing  it is all ellen  who said it  i wont let them  the doctor said it to betsey hardman said alfred and his cough was only too like his brothers  harold would have said a great deal in contempt of betsey hardman but alfred did not let him  youll wake mother he said  hush harold dont go stamping about i cant bear it  no i dont want any one to tell me now ive been getting worse ever since i was taken andoh be quiet harold  i cant be quiet sobbed harold coming nearer to him  o alf  i cant spare you  there hasnt been no proper downright fun without you and  harold had lain down by him and clung to his hand trying not to sob aloud  o harold sighed alfred i dont think i should mindat least not so muchif i hadnt been such a bad boy  you alfy  who was ever a good boy if you was not  hush  you forget all about when i was up at my ladys and all that oh and how bad i behaved at church and when i was so saucy to master about the marbles and so often ive not minded mother  o harold and god judges one for everything  what a sad terrified voice it was  oh dont go on so alf  i cant bear it  why we are but boys and those things were so long ago  god will not be hard on little boys  he is merciful dont you know  but when i knew it was wrong i did the worst i could said alfred oh if i could only begin all over again now i do care  only harold harold you are well you can be good now when theres time  ill be ever so good if youll only get well said harold  i wouldnt have gone to that there place tonight but tis so terribly dull and one must do something  but in churchtime and on sunday  well ill never do it again but it was so sunshiny and they were all making such fun you see and it did seem so stuffy and so long and tiresome i couldnt help it you see  alfred did not think of asking how if harold could not help it this time he could be sure of never doing so again  he was more inclined to dwell on himself and went back to that one sentence god judges us for everything  harold thought he meant it for him and exclaimed  yes yes i know butoh alf you shouldnt frighten one so i never meant no harm  i wasnt thinking about that sighed alfred  i was wishing id been a better lad but ive been worse and crosser and more unkind ever since i was ill  o harold what shall i do  dont go on that way said harold crying bitterly  say your prayers and maybe you will get well and then in the morning ill ask mr cope to come down and hell tell you not to mind  i wouldnt listen to mr cope when he told me to be sorry for my sins and oh harold if we are not sorry you know they will not be taken away  well but you are sorry now  i have heard tell that there are two ways of being sorry and i dont know if mine is the right  i tell you ill fetch mr cope in the morning and when the doctor comes hell be sure to say it is all a pack of stuff and you need not be fretting yourself  when harold awoke in the morning he found himself lying wrapped in his coverlet on alfreds bed and then he remembered all about it and looked in haste as though he expected to see some sudden and terrible change in his brother  but alfred was looking cheerful he had awakened without discomfort and with some amusement was watching the starts and movements the grunts and groans of harolds waking  the morning air and the ordinary look of things had driven away the gloomy thoughts of evening and he chiefly thought of them as something strange and dreadful and yet not quite a dream  dont tell mother whispered harold recollecting himself and starting up quietly  but youll fetch mr cope said alfred earnestly  harold had begun not to like the notion of meeting mr cope lest he should hear something of yesterdays doings and he did not like alfred or himself to think of last nights alarm so he said oh very well ill see about it  he had not made up his mind  very likely if chance had brought him face to face with mr cope he would have spoken about alfred as the best way to hinder the curate from reproving himself but he had not that right sort of boldness which would have made him go to meet the reproof he so richly deserved and he was trying to persuade himself either that when alfred was amused and cheery he would forget all about that there betseys nonsense or else that mr cope might come that way of himself  but alfred was not likely to forget  what he had heard hung on him through all the little occupations of the morning and made him meek and gentle under them and he was reckoning constantly upon mr copes coming fastening on the notion as if he were able to save him  still the curate came not and alfred became grieved feeling as if he was neglected  mr blunt however came and at any rate he would have it out with him so he asked at once very straightforwardly am i going to die sir  why whats put that in your head said the doctor  there was a person here talking last night sir said mrs king  well but am i said alfred impatiently  not just yet i hope said mr blunt cheerfully  you are weak but youll pick up again  but of this persisted alfred who was not to be trifled with  mr blunt saw he must be in earnest  my boy he said im afraid it is not a thing to be got over  ill do the best i can for you by gods blessing and if you get through the winter and it is a mild spring you might do but youd better settle your mind that you cant be many years for this world  many years that sounded like a reprieve and sent gladness into ellens heart but somehow it did not seem in the same light to alfred he felt that if he were slowly going down hill and wasting away so as to have no more health or strength in which to live differently from ever before the length of time was not much to him and in his sickly impatience he would almost have preferred that it should not be what betsey kindly called a lingering job  there he lay after mr blunt was gone not giving ellen any trouble except by the sad thoughtfulness of his face as he lay dwelling on all that he wanted to say to mr cope and the terror of his sin and of judgment sweeping over him every now and then  still mr cope came not  alfred at last began to wonder aloud and asked if harold had said anything about it when he came in to dinner but he heard that harold had only rushed in for a moment snatched up a lump of bread and cheese and made off to the river with some of the lads who meant to spend the noontide rest in bathing  when he came for the evening letters he was caught and mr cope was asked for and then it came out that harold had never given the message at all  alfred greatly hurt and sadly worn by his day of expectation had no selfrestraint left and flew out into a regular passion calling his brother angry names  harold just as passionate went into a rage too and scolded his brother for his fancies  mrs king in great displeasure turned him out and he rushed off to ride like one mad to elbury and poor alfred remained so much shocked at his own outbreak just when he meant to have been good ever after and sobbing so miserably that no one could calm him at all and ellen as the only hope put on her bonnet to fetch mr cope  at that moment paul was come for his bit of bread  she found him looking dismayed at the sounds of violent weeping from above and he asked what it was  oh alfred is so low and so bad and he wants mr cope  heres your bread dont keep me  let me go  ill be quicker cried paul and before she could thank him he was down the garden and right across the first field  alfred had had time to cry himself exhausted and to be lying very still almost faint before mr cope came in in the summer twilight  good paul he had found that mr cope was dining at ragglesford and had run all the way thither and here was the kind young curate quite breathless with his haste and never regretting the cheerful party whence he had been called away  all alfred could say was o sir i shall die and im a bad boy and wouldnt heed you when you said so  and god has made you see your sins my poor boy said mr cope  that is a great blessing  but if i cant do anything to make up for them whats the use  and i never shall be well again  you cant make up for them but there is one who has made up for them if you will only truly repent  i wasnt sorry till i knew i should die said alfred  no your sins did not come home to you  now do you know what they are  oh yes ive been a bad boy to mother and at church and ive been cross to ellen and quarrelled with harold and i was so audacious at my ladys they couldnt keep me  i never did want really to be good  oh i know i shall go to the bad place  no alfred not if you so repent that you can hold to our blessed saviours promise  there is a fountain open for sin and all uncleanness  it is very good of him said alfred a little more tranquilly not in the halfsob in which he had before spoken  most merciful said mr cope  but does it mean me continued alfred  you were baptized alfred you have a right to all his promises of pardon  and he repeated the blessed sentences  come unto me all that travail and are heavy laden and i will refresh you  god so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten son to the end that all that believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life  but how ought i to believe sir  you say you feel what your sins are think of them all as you lie each one as you remember it say it out in your heart to our saviour and pray god to forgive it for his sake and then think that it cost some of the pain he bore on the cross some of the drops of his agony in the garden each sin of ours was indeed of that burden  oh that will make them seem so bad  indeed it does but how it will make you love him and feel thankful to him and anxious not to waste the sufferings borne for your sake and glad perhaps that you are bearing some small thing yourself  but you are spent and i had better not talk more now  let me read you a few prayers to help you and then i will leave you and come again tomorrow  how differently those prayers and psalms sounded to alfred now that he had really a heart grieved and wearied with the burthen of sin  the point was to make his not a frightened heart but a contrite heart     chapter viiharold takes a wrong turn   mrs king was very anxious about alfred for many hours after this visit from the curate for he was continually crying not violently but the tears flowing quietly from his eyes as he lay thinking  sometimes it was the badness of the faults as he saw them now looking so very different from what they did when they were committed in the carelessness of fun and high spirits or viewed afterwards in the hardening light of selfjustification  now they did look so wantonly hard and rudeunkind to his sister ruinous to harold regardless of his widowed mother reckless of his godthat each one seemed to cut into him with a sense of its own badness and he was quite as much grieved as afraid he hated the fault and hated himself for it  indeed he was growing less afraid for the sorrow seemed to swallow that up the grief at having offended one so loving was putting out the terror of being punished or rather when he thought that this illness was punishment he was almost glad to have some of what he deserved just as when he was a little boy he really used to be happier afterwards for having been whipped and put in the corner because that was like making it up  though he knew very well that if he had ten thousand times worse than this to bear it would not be making up for his faults and he felt now that one of them had been his despising the chastening of the lord and then the thought of what had made up for it would come and though he had known of it all his life and heeded it all too little now that his heart was tender and he had felt some of the horror and pain of sin he took it all home now and clung to it  he recollected the verses about that one kneelingnay falling on the ground in the cold dewy night with the chosen friends who could not watch with him and the agony and misery that every one in all the world deserved to feel gathering on him who had done no wrong and making his brow stream with great drops of blood  and the tortures the shame the slow deathcircumstance after circumstance came to his mind and for me this fault of mine helped would rise with it and the tears trickled down at the thought of the suffering and of the love that had caused it to be undergone  once he raised up his head and saw through the window the deep darkblue sky and the stars twinkling and sparkling away that pale band of light the milky way which they say is made of countless stars too far off to be distinguished and looking like a cloud and on it the larger brighter burnished stars differing from one another in glory  he thought of some lines in a book miss jane once gave ellen which said of the stars     the lord resigned them all to gain    the bliss of pardoning thee  and when he thought that it was the king of those stars who was scourged and spit on and for the sake of his faults the loving tears came again and he turned to another hymn of ellens     rock of ages cleft for me    let me hide myself in thee  and going on with this he fell into a more quiet sleep than he had had for many nights  alfred had worked up his mind to a point where it could not long remain and when he awoke in the morning the common affairs of the day occupied him in a way that was not hurtful to him as the one chief thought was ever present only laid away for a time and helping him when he might have been fretful or impatient  he was anxious for mr cope and grateful when he saw him coming early in the day  mr cope did not however say anything very new  he chiefly wished to shew alfred that he must not think all his struggle with sin over and that he had nothing to do but to lie still and be pardoned there was much more work as he would find when the present strong feeling should grow a little blunt he would have to keep his will bent to bear what was sent by god and to prove his repentance by curing himself of all his bad habits of peevishness and exacting to learn in fact to take up his cross  alfred feebly promised to try and it did not seem so difficult just then  the days were becoming cooler and he did not feel quite so ill and though he did not know how much this helped him it made it much easier to act on his good resolutions  miss selby came to see him and was quite delighted to see him looking so much less uncomfortable and dismal  why alfred said she you must be much better  ellen looked mournful at this and shook her head so that miss jane turned her bright face to her in alarm  no maam said alfred  dr blunt says i can never get over it  and does that make you glad almost gasped miss jane  no maam said alfred but mr cope has been talking to me and made it all so  he could not get out the words and besides he saw miss janes eyes winking very fast to check the tears and ellens had begun to rain down fast  i didnt mean to be silly said little jane in rather a trembling voice but im sorrynoim glad you are happy and good alfred  not good miss jane cried alfred im such a bad boy but there are such good things as i never minded before  well then i think youll like what ive brought you said jane eagerly  it was a little framed picture of our blessed lord on his cross all darkness round and the inscription above his head and miss jane had painted in tall old english red letters under it the two words for me  alfred looked at it as if indeed it would be a great comfort to him to be always reminded by the eye of how he was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities  he thanked miss jane with all his heart and she and ellen soon found a place to hang it up well in his sight  it was a pretty bright sight to see her insisting on holding the nail for it and then playfully pretending to shrink and fancy that ellen would hammer her fingers  alfred could enjoy the sunshine of his sickroom again and ellen and his mother downstairs told miss selby with many tears of the happy change that had come over him ever since he had resigned himself to give up hopes of life  mrs king looked so peaceful and thankful that little jane could hardly understand what it was that made her so much more at rest  even ellen though her heart ached at the hope having gone out and left a dark place where it had been felt the great relief from hour to hour of not being fretted and snarled at for whatever she either did or left undone  thanks and smiles were much pleasanter payment than groans murmurs and scoldings and the brother and sister sometimes grew quite cheerful and merry together as alfred lay raised up to look over the hedge into the harvestfield across the meadow where the reaper and his wife might be seen gathering the brown ears round and cutting them with the sickle and others going after to bind them into the glorious wheat sheaves that leant against each other in heaps of blessed promise of plenty  paul tried reaping but the first thing he did was to make a terrible cut in his hand which the shuffler told him was for good luck  some of the women in the field bound it up but he was good for nothing after it except going after the cattle and so he was likely to lose all the chance of earning himself any better clothes in harvesttime  harold grumbled dreadfully that his mother could not spare him to go harvesting beyond their own tiny quarter of an acre of wheat  the post made it impossible for him to go out to work like the labourers and besides his mother did not think he had gained much good in haytime and wished to keep him from the boys  very hard he thought it and to hear him grumble any one would have thought mrs king was a tyrant far worse than farmer shepherd working the flesh off his bones taking away the fun and the payment alike  the truth was that the morning when harold threw away from him the thought of his brothers danger and broke all his promises to him in the selfish fear of a rebuke from the clergyman had been one of the turning points of his life and a turningpoint for the bad  it had been a hardening of his heart just as it had begun to be touched and a letting in of evil spirits instead of good ones  he became more than ever afraid of mr cope and shirked going near him so as to be spoken to he cut ellen off short if she said a word to him and avoided being with alfred partly because it made him melancholy partly because he was afraid of alfreds again talking to him about the evil of his ways  in reality his secret soul was wretched at the thought of losing his brother but he tried to put the notion away from him and to drown it in the noisiest jokes and most riotous sports he could meet with keeping company with the wildest lads about the parish that dick royston especially whose honesty was doubtful but who being a clever fellow was a sort of leader was doing great harm by setting his face against the new parson and laughing at the boys who went to him  mrs king was very unhappy  it was almost worse to think of harold than of his sick brother and alfred grieved very much too and took to himself the blame of having made home miserable to harold and driven him into bad company of having been so peevish and unpleasant that it was no wonder he would not come near him more than could be helped and above all of having set a bad example of idleness and recklessness when he was well  if the tears were brought into his eyes at first by some unkind neglect of harolds they were sure to end in this thought at last and then the only comfort was that mr cope had told him that he might make his sickbed very precious to his brothers welfare by praying always for him  mr cope had talked it over with mrs king and they had agreed that as harold was under the regular age for confirmation and seemed so little disposed to prepare for it in earnest they would not press it on him  he was far from fit for it and he was in such a mood of impatient irreverence that mr cope was afraid of making his sin worse by forcing serious things on him and his mother was in constant fear of losing her last hold on him  yet harold was not a bad or unfeeling boy by nature and if he would but have paused to think he would have been shocked to see how cruelly he was paining his widowed mother and dying brother just when he should have been their strength and stay  one afternoon in october when alfred was in a good deal of pain mr blunt said he would send out some cooling ointment for the wound at the joint when harold took the evening letters into elbury  alfred reckoned much on the relief this was to give and watched the ticks of the clock for the time for harold to set off  make haste were the last words his mother spokeand harold fully meant to make haste nor was it weather to tempt him to stay long for there was a chill raw fog hanging over the meadows and fast turning into rain which hung in drops upon his eyebrows and the manytiered cape of his fathers boxcoat which he always wore in bad weather  it was fortunate he was likely to meet nothing and that he and the pony both knew the road pretty well  how fuzzy the grey fog made the lamps of the town look  did they disturb the pony  what a stumble  ha theres a shoe off  be it known that it was harolds own fault he had not looked at the shoes for many a morning as he knew it was his duty to do  he left peggy with her ears back much discomposed at being shod in a strange forge and by any one but bill saunders  then harold was going to leave his bag at the postoffice when as he turned up the street some one caught hold of him and cried ho  harold king on foot  whats the row  old pony tumbled down dead  cast a shoe said harold  oh jolly youll have to wait went on dick royston  come in here heres such a lark  harold looked into a courtyard belonging to a low publichouse and saw what was like a tent with a bright red star on a blue ground at the end lighted up  a dark figure came between and there was a sudden crack that made harold start  its the unique he called it euniquee royal shootinggallery patronized by his royal highness the prince of wales what a story said dick  youve only to lay down your tin one copper for three shots and if you hit you may take your choicegingerbreadnuts or bits of cocoanut or whats jolliest lollies with gin inside em come blaze away or hant you got the money  does mother keep you too short  if there was a thing harold had a longing for it was to fire off a gun if there was a person he envied more than another it was old isaac coffin when he prowled up and down farmer ledbitters fields with an old blunderbuss and some powder to keep off the birds  to be sure it was a publichouse but it was not inside one  and mother would call it gambling  oh but it wasnt cards or skittles  and if he shot away his halfpence how should he pay for the shoeing of the pony the blacksmith might trust him or the clerk at the postoffice would lend him the money or betsey hardman  and the time  one shot would not waste much  pony must be shod  besides dick and all the rest would say he was a baby  he paid the penny threw aside his cap and took the gun though after all it was only a sham one and what a miss he made  what business had every one to set up that great hoarse laugh which made him so angry that he had nearly turned on dick and cuffed him for his pains  however he was the more bent on trying again and the owner of the gallery shewed him how to manage better  he hit anything but the middle of the star and just saw how he thought he might hit next time  next time was barely a miss so that the man actually gave him a gindrop to encourage him  that made him mad to meet with real success but it was the turn of another young gent as the man called him and harold had to stand by with his penny in his hand burning with impatience and fancying he could mend each shot of that young gent and another and another and another who all thrust in to claim their rights before him his turn came at last and so short and straight was the gallery that he really did hit once the side of the star and once the middle and thus gained one gingerbreadnut and three of the gindrops  it would have been his nature to share them with alfred but he could not do so without saying where he had been and that he could not do so he gave one to dick and swallowed the rest to keep out the cold  just then the town clock struck six and frightened him  he had been there threequarters of an hour  what would they say at the postoffice  the clerk looked out of his hole as angry as clerk could look  this wont do king he said  late for sorting  fine remembernear an hour after time  pony cast a shoe sir said harold  he had never been so near a downright falsehood  whew  then i suppose i must not report you this time  but look out youre getting slack  no time this for borrowing of the clerk  harold was really frightened for he had dawdled much more than he ought of late and though he sometimes fancied himself sick of the whole post business a complaint to his mother would be a dreadful matter  it put everything else out of his head and he ran off in great haste to get the money from betsey hardman knocking loud at her green door  what a cloud of steamy heat the room was with the fire glowing like a red furnace and five black irons standing up before it and clothesbaskets full of heaps of whiteness and horses with vapoury webs of lace and cambric hanging on them and the three ironingboards where smoothness ran along with the irons and the heaps of folded clothes and betsey in her white apron broad and red in the midst of her maidens  ha  harold king  well to be sure you are a stranger  dont come nigh that there hoss its mrs parnells best pockethandkerchiefs real walencines she meant valenciennes  if youll just run up and see mother ill have it out of the way and well have a cup of tea  thank you but i  my  what a smoke yere in  take care or i shall have em all to do over again  go up to mother do like a good lad  i cant betsey i must go home  ay thats the way  lads never can sit down sensible and comfortable its all the same  i wanted said harold interrupting her to ask you to lend me sixpence  ponys cast a shoe and i had to leave her with the smith  ay  who did you leave her with  the first i came to up in wood street  myers  ye shouldnt have done that  his wifes the most stuckup proud body i ever sawwears steel petticoats ill answer for it  you should have gone to charles shaw  cant help it said harold  please betsey let me have the sixpence ill pay you faithfully tomorrow  ay thats always the way  never come in unless ye want somewhat twasnt the way your poor father went on  hed a civil word for every one  well and cant you stop a minute to say how your poor brother is  much the same said harold impatiently  yes hell never be no better poor thing  all decliny as i says to mother what a misfortune it is upon poor cousin king theyll all go off one after tother just like innocents to the slaughter  this was not a cheerful prediction and harold petulantly said he must get back and begged for the sixpence  he got it at last but not till all betseys pocket had been turned out and finding nothing but shillings and threepennybits she went all through her days expenses aloud calling all her girls to witness to help her to account for the sixpence that ought to have been there  mrs brown had paid her four and sixpenceone florin and a halfcrownand she had three threepennypieces in her pocket and twopence  then sally had been out and got a shillingsworth of soap and sixpennorth of blue and brought home one shilling and there was the sausagesno one could recollect what they had cost though they talked so much about their taste and fivepenceworth of redherrings and the butter yes and threepence to the beggar who said he had been in sebastopol  harolds head was ready to turn round before it was all done but he got away at last with a scolding for not going up to see mother  home he trotted as hard as the pony would go holding his head down to try to bury nose and mouth in his collar and the thick rain plastering his hair and streaming down the back of his neck  what an illused wretch was he said he to himself to have to rattle all over the country in such weather  here was home at last  how comfortable looked the bright light as the cottage door was thrown open at the sound of the horses feet  well harold cried ellen eagerly is anything the matter  no he said beginning to get sulky because he felt he was wrong only peggy lost a shoe  lame  no i took her to the smith  give me alfreds ointment please before you put her up  he is in such a way about it and we cant put him to bed  havent got it  not got it  o harold  i should like to know how to be minding such things when pony loses a shoe and such weather  i declare im as wet said harold angrily as he saw his sister clasp her hands in distress and the tears come in her eyes  is harold come safe called mrs king from above  is the ointment come cried alfred in a piteous painworn voice  harold stamped his foot and bolted to the stable to put the pony away  its not come said ellen coming upstairs very sadly  he has forgot it  forgot it cried alfred raising himself passionately  he always does forget everything  he dont care for me one farthing  i believe he wants me dead  this is very bad of him  i didnt think hed have done it said mrs king sorrowfully  hes been loitering after some mischief exclaimed alfred  taking his pleasureand i must stay all this time in pain  serve him right to send him back to elbury  mrs king had a great mind to have done so but when she looked at the torrents of rain that streamed against the window and thought how wet harold must be already and of the fatal illnesses that had been begun by being exposed to such weather she was afraid to venture a boy with such a family constitution and turning back to alfred she said i am very sorry alfred but it cant be helped i cant send harold out in the rain again or we shall have him ill too  poor alfred it was no trifle to have suffered all day and to be told the pain must go on all night  his patience and all his better thoughts were quite worn away and he burst into tears of anger and cried out that it was very hardhis mother cared for harold more than for him and nobody minded it if he lay in such pain all night  you know better than that dear said his poor mother sadly grieved but bearing it meekly  harold shall go as soon as can be tomorrow  and what good will that be tonight grumbled alfred  but you always did put harold before me  however i shall soon be dead and out of your way thats all  mrs king would not make any answer to this speech knowing it only made him worse  she went down to see about harold an additional offence to alfred who muttered something about mother and her darling  how can you alfred speak so to mother cried ellen  im sure every one is cross enough to me returned alfred  not mother said ellen  she couldnt help it  she wont send harold out again though im sure id have gone for him  you dont know what the rain was said ellen  well he should have minded but youre all against me  youll be sorry byandby alfred this isnt like the way you talk sometimes  some one else had need to be sorry not me  perhaps in the midst of his captious state alfred was somewhat pacified by hearing sounds below that made him certain that harold was not escaping without some strong words from his mother  they were not properly taken  harold was in no mood of repentance and the consciousness that he had been behaving most unkindly only made him more rough and selfjustifying  i cant help it  i cant be a slave to run about everywhere and remember everythingpony losing her shoe and nigh tumbling down with me and ross at the post so cross for nothing  youll grieve at the way you have used your poor brother one of these days harold quietly answered his mother so low that alfred could not hear through the floor  now youll please to go to bed  aint i to have no supper said harold in a sullen voice with a great mind to sit down in the chimneycorner in defiance  i shall give you something hot when you are in bed  if i treated you as you deserve i should send you to mr blunts this moment but i cant afford to have you ill too so go to bed this moment  his mother could still master him by her steadiness and he went up muttering that hed no notion of being treated like a baby and that he would soon shew her the difference he wasnt going to be made a slave to alfred and twas all a fuss about that stuff  he did fancy he said his prayers but they could not have been real ones for he was no softer when his mother came to his bedside with a great basin of hot gruel  he said he hated such nasty sick stuff and grunted savagely when with a look that ought to have gone to his heart she asked if he thought he deserved anything better  yet she did not know of the shooting gallery nor of his false excuses if he had not been deceiving her perhaps he might have been touched  well harold she said at last after taking the empty basin from him and picking up his wet clothes and boots to dry them by the fire i hope as you lie there youll come to a better mind  it makes me afraid for you my boy  it is not only your brother you are sinning against but if you are a bad boy you know who will be angry with you  goodnight  she lingered but harold was still hard and would neither own himself sorry nor say goodnight  when she passed his bed at the top of the stairs again after hanging up the things by the fire he had his head hidden and either was or feigned to be asleep  alfreds illtemper was nearly gone but he still thought himself grievously injured and was at no pains to keep himself from groaning and moaning all the time he was being put to bed  in fact he rather liked to make the most of it to shew his mother how provoking she was and to reproach harold for his neglect  the latter purpose he did not effect harold heard every sound and consoled himself by thinking what an intolerable work alfred was making on purpose  if he had tried to bear it as well as possible his brother would have been much more likely to be sorry  alfred was thinking too much about his misfortunes and discomforts to attend to the evening reading but it soothed him a little and the pain was somewhat less so he did fall asleep so uneasily though that mrs king put off going to bed as late as she could  it was nearly eleven and ellen had been in bed a long time when alfred started and mrs king turned her head at the click of the wicket gate and a step plashing on the walk  she opened the little window and the gust of wet wind puffed the curtains whistled round the room and almost blew out the candle  whos there  its me mrs king  ive got the stuff called a hoarse tired voice  well if ever  its paul blackthorn exclaimed mrs king  thank ye kindly  ill come and let you in  paul blackthorn cried alfred  been all the way to elbury for me  o mother bring him up and let me thank him  but how ever did he know the tears came running down alfreds cheeks at such kindness from a stranger  mrs king had hurried downstairs and at the threshold stood a watery figure holding out the gallipot  oh thank you thank you but come in  yes come in you must have something hot and get dried  paul shambled in very footsore  he looked as if he were made of moist mud and might be squeezed into any shape and streams of rain were dropping from each of his many rags  well i dont know how to thank yousuch a night  but hell sleep easy now  how did you come to think of it  i was just coming home from the parsons and i met harold putting up peggy in a great way because hed forgotten  thats all missus said paul looking shamefaced  goodnight to you  no no that wont do  i must have you sit down and get dry said mrs king nursing up the remains of the fire and as pauls daygarments served him for nightgear likewise he could hardly help accepting the invitation and spreading his chilled hands to the fire  as to mrs kings feelings it must be owned that grateful as she was it was rather like sitting opposite to the heap in the middle of mr shepherds farmyard  would you take that she said holding out a threepenny piece  id make it twice as much if i could but times are hard  no no missus i didnt do it for that said paul putting it aside  then you must have some supper that i declare  and she brought out a slice of cold bacon and some bread and warmed some beer at the fire  she would go without bacon and beer herself to morrow but that was nothing to her  it was a real pleasure to see the colour come into pauls bony yellow cheeks at the hearty meal which he could not refuse but he did not speak much for he was tired out and the fire and the beer were making him very sleepy  alfred rapped above with the stick that served as a bell  it was to beg that paul would come and be thanked and though mrs king was a little afraid of the experiment she did ask him to walk up for a moment  grunt went he and in rather an unmannerly way he said id rather not  pray do said mrs king i dont think alfred will sleep easy without saying thank you  so paul complied and in a most ungainly fashion clumped upstairs and stood at the door  he had not forgotten his last reception and would not come a step farther though alfred stretched out his hand and begged him to come in  alfred could say only thank you i never thought any one would be so kind  and paul made gruff reply yere very welcome turned about as if he were running away and tumbled downstairs and out of the house without even answering mrs kings goodnight  harold had wakened at the sounds  he heard all but he chose to seem to be asleep and would you believe it he was only the more provoked pauls exertion made his neglect seem all the worse and he was positively angry with him for going and meddling and poking his nose where hed no concern  now he shouldnt be able to get the stuff tomorrow and so make it up and of course mother would go and dock pauls supper out of his dinner  if such reflections were going on upon one side of the partition there were very different thoughts upon the other  the strangers kindness had done more than relieve alfreds pain the warm sense of thankfulness had softened his spirit and carried off his selfish fit  he knew not how kind people were to him and how ungrateful he had been to punish his innocent mother and sister and so much to magnify a bit of thoughtlessness on harolds part to be angry with his mother for not driving him out when she thought it might endanger his health and life and to say such cruel things on purpose to wound her  alfred felt himself far more cruel than he had even thought harold  and was this his resolution  was this the shewing the sincerity of his repentance through his conduct in illness  was this patience  was it brotherly love  was it the taking up the cross so as to bear it like his saviour who spoke no word of complaining no murmur against his tormentors  how he had fallen  how he had lost himself  it was a bitter distress and threw him almost into despair  he prayed over and over to be forgiven and began to long for some assurance of pardon and for something to prevent all his right feelings and wishes from thus seeming to slip away from his grasp at the first trial  he told his mother how sorry he was and she answered dear lad dont fret about it  it was very hard for you to bear and you are but learning you see to be patient  but im not learning if i dont go on no better sighed alfred  by bits you are my boy she said you are much less fractious now than you used to be only you could not stand this outoftheway trial  alfred groaned  do you remember what our saviour said to st peter said his mother whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards  you see st peter couldnt bear his cross then but he went on doing his best and grieving when he failed and byandby he did bear it almost like his master  he got to be made strong out of weakness  there was some comfort to alfred in this but he feared and yet longed to see mr cope and when he came had scarcely answered his questions as to how he felt before he said o sir ive been a bad boy again and so cross to them all  o sir said ellen who could not bear for him to blame himself im sure it was no wonderhes so distracted with the pain and harold getting idling and forgetting to bring him the ointment  why even that vagabond boy was so shocked that he went all the way to elbury that very night for it  i told alfred youd tell him that anybody would be put out and nobody would think of minding what he said  nobody especially so kind a sister said mr cope smiling but that is not what alfred is thinking of  no sir said alfred their being so good to me makes it all the worse  i quite believe so and you are very much disappointed in yourself  oh yes sir just when i wanted to be getting patient and more like and his eyes turned to the little picture and filled with tears  mr cope said somewhat of what his mother had said that he was but a scholar in patience and that he must take courage though he had slipped and pray for new strengthening and refreshing to go on in the path of pain his lord had hallowed for him  perhaps the words reminded alfred of the part of the catechism where they occur for he said oh i wish i was confirmed  if i could but take the holy sacrament to make me stronger and sure of being forgiven  you shallbefore said mr cope speaking eagerly but becoming choked as he went on  you are one whom the church would own as ready and desirous to come though you cannot be confirmed  you should at oncebut you see i am not yet a priest i have not the power to administer the holy communion but i trust i shall be one in the spring and then alfredor if you should be worse i promise you that i would bring some one here  you shall not go without the bread of life  alfred felt what he said to the depths of his heart but he could not say anything but thank you sir  mr cope still much moved laid his hand upon that of the boy  so alfred we prepare together  as i hope and long to prepare myself to have that great charge committed to me which our saviour christ gave to his apostles so you prepare for the receiving of that bread and that cup which will more fully unite you to him and join your suffering to what he bore for you  how shall i sir murmured alfred  i will do my best to shew you said mr cope but your catechism tells you best  think over that last answer  alfreds face lighted sweetly as he went over it  why thats what i cant help doing sir i cant forget my faults im so afraid of them and im sure i do want to lead a new life if i didnt keep on being so bad and thinking about his dying is the best comfort i have  nor im sure i dont bear illwill to nobody only i suppose it is not charity to run out at poor mother and ellen when ones put out  perhaps that is what you want to learn said mr cope and to get all these feelings deepened and more earnest and steadfast  if the long waiting does that for you it will be good and keep you from coming lightly to the holy feast  oh i could not do that exclaimed alfred  and may i think that all my faults will be taken away and forgiven  all you repent of and bring in faith  that is what they say at church in the absolution said alfred thoughtfully  rather it is what the priest says to them said mr cope it is the applying the promise of forgiveness that our saviour bought  i may not yet say those words with authority alfred but i should like to hope that some day i may speak them to you and bring rest from the weight at your heart  oh  i hope i may live to that said alfred  you shall hear them whether from me or from another said mr cope that is if god will grant us warning  but you need not fear alfred if you thoroughly repent and put your full faith in the great sacrifice that has been offered for your sins and the sins of all the world  god will take care of his child and you already have his promise that he will give you all that is needful for your salvation     chapter viiiconfirmation   if harold had known all the consequences of his neglect perhaps he would have been more sorry for it than as yet he had chosen to be  the long walk and the warm beer and fire sent paul to his haynest so heavy with sleep that he never stirred till next morning he was wakened by tom boldre the shuffler kicking him severely and swearing at him for a lazy fellow who stayed out at night and left him to do his work  paul stumbled to his feet quite confused by the pain and feeling for his shoes in the dark loft  the shuffler scarcely gave him an instant to put them on but hunted him downstairs telling him the farmer was there and he would catch it  it would do nobody any good to hear the violent way in which mr shepherd abused the boy  he was a passionate man and no good labourers liked to work with him because of his tongue  with such grown men as he had he was obliged to keep himself under some restraint but this only incited him to make up for it towards the poor friendless boy  it was really nearly eight oclock and pauls work had been neglected which was enough to cause displeasure and besides boldre had heard paul coming home past eleven and the farmer insisted on knowing what he had been doing  under all his rags paul was a very proud boy and thus asked he would not tell but stood with his legs twisted looking very sulky  no use asking him cried mrs shepherds shrill voice at the back door why dont ye hear that mrs barkers henroost has been robbed by dick royston and two or three more on em  i never robbed cried paul indignantly  none of your jaw said the farmer angrily  if you dont tell me this moment where youve been off you go this instant  drinking at the tankard ill warrant  no such thing sir said paul  i went to elbury after some medicine for a sick person  somehow he had a feeling about the house opposite which would not let him come out with the name in such a scene  thats all stuff broke in mrs shepherd i dont believe one word of it  send him off take my advice farmer let him go where he comes from ellen king told me he was out of prison  paul flushed crimson at this and shook all over  he had all but turned to go caring for nothing more at friarswood but just then john farden one of the labourers who was carrying out some manure called out no no maam  sure enough he did go to elbury to dr blunts  i was on the road myself and i hears him  goodnight says i  goodnight says he  where beest going says i  to doctors says he arter some stuff for alfred king  yes said paul speaking more to farden than to his master and then mrs king gave me some supper and that was what made me so late  she ought to be ashamed of herself then said mrs shepherd spitefully having a vagabond scamp like that drinking beer at her house at that time of night  how one is deceived in folks  well what are you doing here cried the farmer turning on paul angrily dye mean to waste any more of the day  so paul was not turned off and had to go straight to his work  it was well he had had so good a supper for he had not a moment to snatch a bit of breakfast  it so happened that his work was to go with john farden who was carrying out the manure in the cart  paul had to hold the horse while john forked it out into little heaps in the field  john was a great big powerful man with a foolish face not a good workman nor a good character or he would not have been at that farm  he had either never been taught anything or had forgotten it all he never went near church he had married a disreputable wife and had two or three unruly children who were likely to be the plagues of their parents and the parish but not a whit did john heed he did not seem to have much more sense than to work just enough to get food lodging beer and tobacco to sleep all night and doze all sunday  there was not any malice nor dishonesty in him but it was terrible that a man with an immortal soul should live so nearly the life of the brute beasts that have no understanding and should never wake to the sense of god or of eternity  he was not a man of many words and nothing passed for a long time but shouts of hoy and whoa and the like to the horse  paul went heavily on scarce knowing what he was about there was a stunned jaded feel about him as if he were hunted and driven about a mere outcast despised by every one even by the kings whose kindness had been his only ray of brightness  not that his senses or spirits were alive enough even to be conscious of pain or vexation it was only a dull dreary heedlessness what became of him next and quick clever boy as he had been in the union he did not seem to have a bit more sense thought or feeling than john farden  john farden was the first to break the silence i wouldnt bide said he  paul looked up and muttered i have nowhere to go  farmer uses thee shameful repeated john  why dont thee cut  paul saw the smoke of mrs kings chimney  that had always seemed like a friend to him but it came across him that they too thought him a runaway from prison and he felt as if his only bond of fellowship was gone  but there was something else too and he made answer ill bide for the confirmation  eh said john what goodll that do ye  help me to be a good lad said paul who knew john farden would not enter into any other explanation  why whatll they do to ye  the bishop will put his hand on me and bless me said paul and as he said the words there was hope and refreshment coming back  he was a child of god if no other owned him  whoy said farden much as he might have spoken to his horse rum sort of a head thoust got  theell never go up to bishop such a guy  cant help it said paul rather sullenly it aint the clothes that god looks at  john scanned him all over with his face looking more foolish than ever in the puzzle he felt  well he said and what wilt get by it  gods grace to do right i hope said paul then he added out of his sad heart its bad enough here to be sure  it would be a bad lookout if one hoped for nothing afterwards  somehow johns mind didnt take in the notion of afterwards and he did not go on talking to paul  perhaps there was a dread in his poor dull mind of getting frightened out of the deadly stupefied sleep it was bound in  but that bit of talk had done paul great good by rousing him to the thought of what he had to hope for  there was the confirmation nigh at hand and then on beyond there was rest and the words came into his mind there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary are at rest  poor poor boy  he was very young to have such yearnings towards the grave and wellnigh to wish he lay as near to it as alfred king so he might have those loving tender hands near him those kind voices round him  paul had gone through a great deal in these few months and used to good shelter and regular meals he was less inured to bodily hardship than many a cottage boy  his utter neglect of his person was telling on him he was less healthy and strong than he had been and though high spirits merriment and the pleasure of freedom and independence had made all light to him in the summer yet now the cold weather with his insufficient food and scanty clothing was dulling him and deadening him and hard work and unkind usage seemed to be grinding his very senses down  to be sure when twelve oclock came he went up into the loft ate his bit of dry bread and said his prayers as he had not been able to do in the morning and that made him feel less forlorn and downcast for a little while but then as he sat he grew cold and numb and sleepy and seemed to have no life in him but to be moving like a horse in a mill when boldre called him down and told him not to be idling there  the theft in mrs barkers poultryyard was never traced home to any one but the world did not the less believe dick royston and jesse rolt to have been concerned in it  indeed they had been drinking up some of their gains when harold met them at the shootinggallery and mrs shepherd would not put it out of her head that paul blackthorn was in the secret and that if he did really go for the medicine as he said it was only as an excuse for carrying the chickens to some receiver of stolen goods  she had no notion of any person doing anything out of pure love and pity  moreover it is much easier to put a suspicion into peoples heads than out again and if pauls whole history and each days doings had been proved to her in a court of justice she would still have chiefly remembered that she had always thought ill of him and that ellen king had said he was a runaway convict and so she would have believed him to the end  ellen had long ago forgotten that she had said anything of the kind and though she still held her nose rather high when paul was near she would have answered for his honesty as readily as for that of her own brothers but hers had not been the charity that thinketh no evil and her idle words had been like thistledown lightly sent forth but when they had lighted bearing thorns and prickles  those thorns were galling poor paul  nobody could guess what his glimpses of that happy peaceful loving family were to him  they seemed to him like a softer better kind of world and he looked at their fair faces and fresh wellordered garments with a sort of reverence a kind look or greeting from mrs king a mere civil answer from ellen those two sights of the white spiritlooking alfred were like the rays of light that shone into his dark hayloft  sometimes he heard them singing their hymns and psalms on a sunday evening and then the tears would come into his eyes as he leant over the gate to listen  and as if it was because ellen kept at the greatest distance from him he set more store by her words and looks than those of any one else was always glad when she served him in the shop and used to watch her on sunday looking as fresh as a flower in her neat plain dress  and now to hear that she not only thought meanly of him which he knew well enough but thought him a thief a runaway and an impostor coming about with false tales was like a weight upon his sunken spirits and seemed to take away all the little heart hard usage had left him made him feel as if suspicious eyes were on him whenever he went for his bit of bread and took away all his peace in looking at the cottage  he did once take courage to say to harold did your sister really say i had run away from gaol  oh nobody minds what our ellen says was the answer  but did she say so  i dont know i dare say she did  shes so fine that she thinks no one that comes upstairs in dirty shoes worth speaking to  im sure shes the plague of my lifealways at me  that was not much comfort for paul  he had other friends to be sure all the boys in the place liked him and were very angry with the way the farmer treated him and greatly to their credit they admired his superior learning instead of being jealous of it  mrs hayward the sextons wife the same who had bound up his hand when he cut it at harvest even asked him to come in and help her boys in the evenings with what they had to prepare for mr cope  he was not sorry to do so sometimes  the cottage was a slatternly sort of place where he did not feel ashamed of himself and the haywards were mild good sort of folks from whom he was sure never to hear either a bad or an unkind word though he did not care for them nor feel refreshed and helped by being with them as he did with the kings  john farden too was goodnatured to him and once or twice hindered boldre from striking or abusing him he offered him a pipe once but paul could not smoke and another time brought him out a pint of beer into the field  mrs shepherd spied him drinking it from her upper window and believed all the more that he got money somehow and spent it in drink  so the time wore on till the confirmation all seeming like one dull heavy dream of bondage and as the weather became colder the poor boy seemed to have no power of thinking of anything but of so getting through his work as to avoid violence to keep himself from perishing with cold and not to hurt his chilblains more than he could help  all his quick intellect and good instruction seemed to have perished away and the last time he went to mr copes he sat as if he were stupid or asleep and when a question came to him sat with his mouth open like silly bill pridden  mr cope knew him too well not to feel as he wrote the ticket that there were very few of whom he could so entirely from his heart say examined and approved as the poor lonely outcast foundling paul blackthorn who could not even tell whether he were fifteen sixteen or seventeen but could just make sure that he had once been caned by old mr haynes who went away from the union twelve years ago  do you think you can keep the ticket safe if i give it you now paul asked mr cope recollecting that the cows might sup upon it like his prayerbook  paul put his hands down to the bottom of his pockets  they were all one hole and that sad lost foolish look came over his wan face again and startled mr cope  the boys grinned but charles hayward stepped forward  please sir let me take care of it for him  mr cope and paul both agreed and mr cope kept charles for a moment to say as he gave him a shilling look here charles do you think you can manage to get that poor fellow a tolerable breakfast on saturday before he goes  and if you could make him look a little more decent  charles pulled his forelock and looked knowing  in fact there was a little plot among these goodnatured boys and harold king was in it too though he was not of the confirmation party and said and thought he was very glad of it  he did not want to bind himself to be so very good silly boy as if baptism had not bound him already  mrs hayward put her head out as paul passed her cottage and called out i say you paul you come in tomorrow evening with our charlie and jim and ill wash you when i washes them  good mrs hayward made a mistake that the more delicateminded mrs king would never have made  perhaps if a pail of warm water and some soap had been set before paul he might actually have washed himself but he was much too big and too shamefaced a lad to fancy sharing a family scrubbing by a woman whatever she might do to her own sons  but considering the size of the hayward cottage and the way in which the family lived this sort of notion was not likely to come into the head of the goodnatured mother  so she and her boys were much vexed when paul did not make his appearance and she made a face of great disgust when charles said never mind mother my white frock will hide no end of dirt  i shall have to wash it over again before you can wear it i know said mrs hayward  not as i grudges the trouble hes a poor lost orphant that its a shame to see so treated  mrs hayward did not know that she was bestowing the cup of cold water as well as being literally ready to wash the feet of the poor disciple  a clean body is a type and token of a pure mind and though the lads of friarswood did not quite perceive this there was a feeling about them of there being something unnatural and improper and a disgrace to friarswood in any one going up to the bishop in such a condition as paul  especially as charles hayward said when he was the pick of the whole lot  perhaps charles was right for surely paul was singlehearted in his hope of walking straight to his one home heaven and he had been doing no other than bearing his cross when he so patiently took the being buffeted when he did well and faithfully served his froward master  but paul was not to escape the outward cleansing and from one of the very last people from whom it would have been expected  he had just pulled his bed of hay down over him and was trying to curl himself up so as to stop his teeth from chattering with caesar on his feet when the dog growled and a great voice lowered to a gruff whisper said come along young un  im coming cried paul  though it was not boldres voice it had startled him terribly he was so much used to illtreatment that he expected a savage blow every moment  but the great hand that closed on him though rough was not unkind  poor lad how he quakes said john fardens voice  dont ye be afeard its only me  nobody got at the horses cried paul  no no only i aint going to have you going up to yon big parson all one muckheap  come on and make no noise about it  paul did not very well know what was going to befall him but he did not feel unsafe with john farden and besides his lank frame was in the grasp of that big hand like a mouse in the power of a mastiff  so he let himself be hauled down the ladder into an empty stall where behold there was a dark lantern which had been at bad work in its time a pail a brush a bit of soap and a ragged towel  john laid hold of him much as alfred in his page days used to do of lady janes little dog when it had to be washed but puck had the advantage in keeping on his shaggy coat all the time and in being more gently handled whereas farden scrubbed with such hearty goodwill that paul thought his very skin would come off  but he had undergone the like in the workhouse and he knew how to accommodate himself to it and when his rough bath was over though he was very sore and stiff and chilly he really felt relieved and more respectable than he had done for many months only rather sorry he must put on his filthy old rags again and he gave honest john more thanks than might have been expected  the confirmation was to be at eleven oclock at elbury and john had undertaken his mornings work so that mr shepherd grudgingly consented to spare him knowing that all the other farmers of course did the same and that there would be a cry of shame if he did not  paul had just found his way down the ladder in the morning with thoughts going through his mind that to him this would be the coming of the comforter and he was sure he wanted comfort and that for some hours of this day at least he should be at peace from rude words and blows when he heard a great confusion of merry voices and suppressed laughing and saw the heads of some of the lads bobbing about near mrs kings garden  was it time already to set off he wondered looking up to the sun but then those boys seemed to be in an uproarious state such as did not suit his present mood nor did he think mr cope would consider it befitting he would have let them go by feeling himself such a scarecrow as they might think a blot upon them but he remembered that charles hayward had his ticket and as he looked at himself he doubted whether he should be let into a strange church  paul  paul blackthorn called harold with a voice all aglee  well said paul what do you want of me  come on and youll see  i dont want a row  is charlie hayward there  just ask him for my card and dont make a work  hell give it you if youll come for it said harold and seeing there was no other chance paul slowly came  harold led him to the stable where just within the door stood a knot of stout hearty boys snorting with fun hiding their heads on each others shoulders and bending their buskined knees with merriment  now then cried charles hayward and he had got hold of the only button that held pauls coat together  paul was bursting out with something but george grants arms were round his waist and his hands were fumbling at his fastenings  they were each one much stronger than he was now and they drowned his voice with shouts of laughter while as fast as one garment was pulled off another was put on  mind you neednt make such a work it baint presents said george grant only we wont have them asking up at elbury if weve saved the guy to bring in  it is a present though old betty bushels shirt said charles hayward  she said shed throw it at his head if he brought it back again but the frocks mine  and the corduroys is mine said george grant  my they be a sight too big in the band  run in harold and see if your mother can lend us a pin  and the waistcoat is my summer one said fred bunting  hes too big too why paul youre no better than a natomy  never mind my white frock will hide it all said charles and heres neds cap for you  oh and its poor alfreds boots  paul could not make up his mind to walk all the way in the boots but to satisfy the boys he engaged to put them on as soon as they were getting to elbury  my he looks quite respectable cried charles running back a little way to look at him  i wonder if mr cope will know him exclaimed harold jumping leapfrog fashion on george grants back  the maids will take him for some strange gentleman exclaimed jem hayward and why bless me hes washed i do declare as a streak of light from the door fell on pauls visage  no you dont mean it broke out charles  lets look yes i protest why the old grime between his eyes is gone after all  how did you manage that paul  paul rather uneasily mumbled something about john farden and the boys clapped their hands and shouted so that alfred who well knew what was going on raised himself on his pillow and laughed  it was rather blunt treatment for feelings if they were tender but these were rough warm hearted village boys and it was all their goodnature  and wheres the grub asked charles importantly looking about  oh not far off said harold and in another moment he and charles had brought in a black coffeepot a large mug some brown sugar a hunch of bread some butter and a great big smoking sausage  paul looked at it as if he were not quite sure what to do with it  one boy proceeded to turn in an inordinate quantity of sugar another to pour in the brown coffee that sent out a refreshing steam enough to make any one hungry  george grant spread the butter cut the sausage in half put it on the bread and thrust it towards paul  eat itss said charles patting paul on the back  mr cope said you was to and you must obey your minister  not all for me said paul not able to help a pull at the coffee the mug warming his fingers the while  oh yes weve all had our breakfastisses said george grant we are only come to make you eat yours like a good boy as mr cope said you should  they stood round looking rather as they would have done had paul been an elephant taking his meal in a show but not one would hear of helping him off with a crumb out of mr copes shilling  george grant was a big hungry lad and his breakfast among nine at home had not been much to speak of but savoury as was the sausage and perfumy as was the coffee he would have scorned to take a fragment from that stranger beg him to do so as paul might and what could not be eaten at that time with a good pint of the coffee was put aside in a safe nook in the stable to be warmed up for supper  that mornings work was not a bad preparation for confirmation after all  harold had stayed so long that he had to jump on the pony and ride his fastest to be in time at the post  he was very little ashamed of not being among those lads and felt as if he had the more time to enjoy himself but there were those who felt very sad for himalfred who would have given so much to receive the blessing and ellen whose confirmation was very lonely and melancholy without either of her brothers besides his mother to whom his sad carelessness was such constant grief and heartache  ellen was called for by the carriage from the grange and sat up behind with the kitchenmaid who was likewise to be confirmed  little miss jane sat inside in her white dress and veil looking like a snowdrop alfred thought as his mother lifted him up to the window to see her as the carriage stood still while ellen climbed to her seat  in the course of the morning mrs king made time to read over the confirmation service with alfred to think of the blessing she was receiving and to pray that it might rest upon her through life  and they entreated too that harold might learn to care for it and be brought to a better mind  o mother said alfred after lying thinking for sometime if i thought harold would take up for good and be a better boy to you than i have been i should not mind anything so much  and there was harold all the time wondering whether he should be able to get out in the evening to have a lark with dick and jesse  ellen was set down byandby  her colour was very deep but she looked gentle and happy and the first thing she did was to bend over alfred kiss him and say how she wished he had been there  then when she had been into her own room she came back and told them about the beautiful large elbury church and the great numbers of young girls and boys on the two sides of the aisle and of the bishop seated in the chair by the altar and the chanted service with the organ sounding so beautiful  and then how her heart had beat and she hardly dared to speak her vow and how she trembled when her turn came to go up to the rail but she said it was so comfortable to see mr cope in his surplice looking so young among the other clergymen and coming a little forward as if to count out and encourage his own flock  she was less frightened when she had met his kind eye and was able to kneel down with a more quiet mind to receive the gift which had come down on the day of pentecost  alfred wanted to know whether she had seen paul but ellen had been kneeling down and not thinking of other people when the friarswood boys went up  only she had passed him on the way home and seen that though he was lagging the last of the boys he did not look dull and worn as he had been doing lately  ellen had been asked to go to the grange after church tomorrow evening and drink tea there in celebration of the confirmation which the two young fostersisters had shared  harold went to fetch her home at night and they both came into the house fresh and glowing with the brisk frosty air and also with what they had to tell  o mother what do you think  paul blackthorn is to go to the grange to morrow  my lady wants to see him and perhaps she will make mr pound find some work for him about the farm  harold jumped up and snapped his fingers towards the farm  theres for old skinflint said he not a chap in the place but will halloo for joy  well i am glad said mrs king i didnt think that poor lad would have held out much longer winter weather and all  but how did my lady come to hear of it  oh it seems she noticed him going to church in all his rags and mr cope told her who he was so miss jane came and asked me all about him and i told her what a fine scholar he is and how shamefully the farmer and boldre treat him and how good he was to alfred about the ointment and how steady he is  and i told her about the boys dressing him up yesterday and how he wouldnt take a gift  she listened just as if it was a story and she ran away to her grandmamma and presently came back to say that the boy was to come up tomorrow after his work for lady jane to speak to him  well at least he has been washed once said mrs king but hes so queer i hope he will have no fancies and will behave himself  ill tackle him declared harold decidedly  ive a great mind to go out this moment and tell him  mrs king prevented this she persuaded harold that mrs shepherd would fly out at them if she heard any noise in the yard and that it would be better for every one to let paul alone till the morning  morning came and as soon as harold was dressed he rushed to the farm yard but he could not find paul anywhere and concluded that he had been sent out with the cows and would be back by breakfasttime  as soon as he had brought home the postbag he dashed across the road again but came back in a few moments looking beside himself  hes gone he said and threw himself back in a chair  gone cried mrs king and ellen with one voice quite aghast  gone repeated harold  the farmer hunted him off this morning  missus will have it that hes been stealing her eggs and that there was a lantern in the stable on friday night so they told him to be off with him and hes gone  poor poor boy just when my lady would have been the making of him cried ellen  but wherewhich way is he gone asked mrs king  i might ride after him and overtake him cried harold starting up but i never thought to ask  and mrs shepherd was ready to pitch into me so i got away as soon as i could  do you run over and ask ellen you always were a favourite  they were in such an eager state that ellen at once sprang up and hastily throwing on her bonnet ran across the road and tapped at mrs shepherds open door exclaiming breathlessly o maam i beg your pardon but will you tell me where paul blackthorn is gone  paul blackthorn how should i know said mrs shepherd crossly  im not to be looking after thieves and vagabonds  hes a comebychance and hes a gobychance and a good riddance too  oh but maam my lady wanted to speak to him  this only made mrs shepherd the more set against the poor boy  ay ay i knowcoming over the gentry and a good thing hes gone said she  the place isnt to be harbouring thieves and vagrants or whos to pay the rates  my eggs are gone i tell you and who should take em but that lad id like to know  them was two rotten nesteggs as i throwed away when i was cleaning the stable  who told you to put in your word john farden screamed mrs shepherd turning on him  yed best mind what yere about or yell be after him soon  no loss neither muttered john stopping to pick up his shovel  and you didnt see which way he was gone asked ellen looking from the labourer to the farmers wife  farmer sent un off or ever i come replied john or id ha gied un a breakfast  im sure i cant tell said mrs shepherd with a toss of her head and as to you ellen king im surprised at you running after a scamp like that that you told me yourself was out of a prison  oh but mrs shepherd  you ought to be ashamed of yourself interrupted mrs shepherd and i wonder your mother allows it  but theres nothing like girls nowadays  ellen thought john farden grinned and feeling as if nothing so shocking could ever happen to her again she flew back she hardly knew how to her home clapped the door after and dropping into a chair as harold had done burst into such a fit of crying that she could not speak and only shook her head in answer to harolds questions as to how paul was gone  oh no one knew she choked out among her sobs and mrs shepherdsuch things  harold stamped his foot and mrs king tried to soothe her  in the midst she recollected that she could not bear her brothers to guess at the worst part of the such things and recovering herself a moment she said no no theyve driven him off  hes gone andand oh  mother mrs shepherd will have it hes a thief andand she says i said so  that was bad enough and ellen wept bitterly again while her mother and harold both cried out with surprise  yesbuti did say i dare said he was out of a reformatoryand that she should remember it  now ive taken away his character and hes a poor lost boy  oh idle words idle words     chapter ixrobbing the mail   there was no helping it  people must have their letters whether paul blackthorn were lost or not and harold was a servant of the public and must do his duty so after some exhortations from his mother he ruefully rose up hoping that he should not have to go to ragglesford  yes you will said his mother and maybe to wait  heres a registered letter and i think there are two more with money in them  to think sighed harold as he mounted his pony of them little chaps getting more money for nothing than paul did in a month by working the skin off his bones  dont be discontented harold on that score  them little chaps will work hard enough byandby and the money they have now is to train them in making a fit use of it then  harold looked anxiously up and down the road for paul and asked mr copes housekeeper whether he had been there to take leave  no and indeed harold would have been a little vexed if he had wished goodbye anywhere if not at home  there was a fine white frost and the rime hung thickly on every spray of the heavy branches of the dark firs and larches that overhung the long solitary lane between the grange and ragglesford and fringed the park palings with crystals  harold thought how cold poor paul must be going on his way in his ragged clothes  the ice crackled under the ponys feet as she trotted down ragglesford lane and the water of the ford looked so cold that peggy a very wise animal turned her head towards the foot bridge a narrow and not very sound affair over which harold had sometimes taken her when the stream was high and threatened to be over his feet  harold made no objection but no sooner were all the ponys four hoofs well upon the bridge than at the other end appeared dick royston  hollo harld was his greeting ive got somewhat to say to ye  dye know where paul blackthorn is asked harold  not iim a traveller myself you must know  you going to cut cried harold  ay said dick laying hold of the ponys rein  the police have been down at roltsstupid fellow left old ganders feet aboutmrs barker swore to em cause hed had so many kicks and bites on commonjesses took up and peachedive been hiding about all nightprecious cold it was and just waiting you see to wish you goodbye  harold very much shocked could have dispensed with his farewells nor did he like the look of his eyes  thank you dick im sorryi didnt thinkbut im after timei wish youd let go of peggy  so thats all you have to say to an old comrade said dick but i say harld im not going so  i must have some tin to take me to portsmouth  i want to know what youve got in that there bag  you wont have that its the post  let go dick and he pushed the pony forward but dick had got her fast by the head  harold looked round for help but ragglesford lane was one of the loneliest places in the country  there was not a house for half a mile and lady janes plantations shut in the road on either side  i mean to have it said dick looking coolly up into his face i mean to see if theres any of the letters with a halfsovereign in em that you tell us about  dick dick it would be robbing  for shame dick  what would become of mother and me  thats your lookout said dick and he stretched out his hand for the bag  he was four years older than harold and much stouter  harold with a ready move chucked the bag round to his back and shouted lustily in hopes that there might be a keeper in the woods help thieves  hes robbing the post  dicks hoarse laugh was all the answer  thatll do my dear he said now youd best be quiet id be loath to hurt you  for all answer harold shouting all the time dealt him a stroke right over the eyes and nose with his ridingswitch and made a great effort to force the pony on in hopes the blow might have made him slacken his hold but though one moment dicks arm was thrown over his watering eyes the other hand held the bridle as firmly as ever and the next instant his fist dealt harold such a blow as nearly knocked out all his breath setting his teeth and swearing an oath dick was pouncing on the boys arm when from the road before them came bursting a meagre thing darting like a wild cat which fell upon him hallooing as loud as harold  dick turned in fury and let go the bridle  the pony backed in alarm the newcomer was grappling with the thief and trying to drag him aside on on go on harld he shouted but his strength was far from equal to dicks who threw him aside on the handrail  old rotten rail that it was it crashed under the weight and fell with both the boys into the water  peggy dashed forward to the other side where harold pulled her up with much difficulty and turned round to look at the robber and the champion  the fall was not far nor the water deep and they had both risen and were ready to seize one another again in their rage  and now harold saw that he who had come to his help was no other than paul blackthorn who shouted loudly on go on  ill keep him  hell kill you screamed harold in despair ready to push in between them with his horse but at that moment cartwheels were heard in the road and dick shaking his fist and swearing at them both shook off paul as if he had been a feather and splashing out of the ford on the other side leapt over the hedge and was off through the plantations  paul more slowly crept up towards harold dripping from head to foot  paul  paul  im glad ive found you cried harold  youve saved the letters man and one was registered  come along with me up to the school  nay ill not do that said paul  then youll stay till i come back said harold earnestly ive got so much to tell you  my lady sent for you  our ellen told her all about you and youre to go to her  ellen was in such a way when she found you were off  then she didnt think id taken the eggs said paul  shed as soon think that i had said harold  why dont we all know that youre one of the parsons own sort  but what made you go off without a word to nobody  i dont know  every one was against me said paul and i thought id just go out of the way and youd forget all about me  but i never touched those eggs and you may tell mr cope so and thank him for all his kindness to me  youll tell him yourself  youre going home along with me cried harold  there  ill not stir a step till youve promised  why if you make off now twill be the way to make them think you have something to run away for like that rascal  very well said paul rather dreamily  then you wont said harold  upon your word and honour  paul said the words after him not much as if he knew what he was about and harold rather alarmed at the sound of the grange clock striking gave a cut to the pony and bounded on only looking back to see that paul was seating himself by the side of the lane  harold said to himself that his mother would not have liked to see him do so after such a ducking but he knew that he was more tenderly treated than other lads and with reason for precaution too and he promised himself soon to be bringing paul home to be dried and warmed  but he was less speedy than he intended  when he arrived at the school he had first to account to the servants for his being so late and then he was obliged to wait while the owner of the registered letter was to sign the green paper acknowledging its safe delivery  instead of having the receipt brought back to him there came a message that he was to go up to tell the master and the young gentlemen all about the robbery  so the servant led the way and harold followed a little shy but more curious  the boys were in school a great bare whitewashed room looking very cold with a large arched window at one end and forms ranged in squares round the hacked and hewed deal tables  harold thought he should tell alfred that the young gentlemen had not much the advantage of themselves in their schoolroom  the boys were mostly smaller than he was only those of the uppermost form being of the same size  there might be about forty of them looking rather red and purple with the chilly morning and all their eighty eyes black or brown blue or grey fixed at once upon the young postman as he walked into the room straight and upright in his high stout gaiters over his cord trousers his thick rough blue coat and red comforter with his cap in his hand his fair hair uncovered and his blue eyes and rosy cheeks all the more bright for that strange mornings work  he was a wellmannered boy and made his bow very properly to mr carter the master who sat at his high desk  so my little man said the master i hear youve had a fight for our property this morning  youve saved this young gentlemans birthday present of a watch and he wants to thank you  thank you sir said harold but hed have been too much for me if paul hadnt come to help  hes a deal bigger than me  the boys all made a thumping and scuffling with their feet as if to applaud harold and their master said tell us how it was  harold gave the account in a very good simple manner only he did not say who the robber washe did not like to do soindeed he would not quite believe it could be his old friend dick  the boys clapped and thumped doubly when he came to the switching and still more at the tumble into the water  do you know who the fellow was asked mr carter  yes i knowed him said harold and stopped there  but you had rather not tell  is that it  please sir hes gone and i wouldnt get him into trouble  at this the schoolboys perfectly stamped and made signs of cheering  and who is the boy that came to help you  paul blackthorn sir hes a boy from the union who worked at farmer shepherds  hes a right good boy sir but hes got no friends nor nonothing said harold pausing ere he finished  why didnt you bring him up with you asked the master  please sir he wouldnt come  well said mr carter youve behaved like a brave fellow and so has your friend and heres something in token of gratitude for the rescue of our property  it was a crown piece  and here said the boy whose watch had been saved heres halfacrown  shake hands youre a jolly fellow and ill tell my uncle about you  harold was a true englishman and of course his only answer could be thank you sir i only did my duty and as the other boys whose money had been rescued brought forward more silver pledges of gratitude he added ill take it to paulthank you sirthank you sir  thats right you must share my lad said the schoolmaster  it is a reward for both of you  thank you sir it was my duty repeated harold making his bow  sir sir pray let us give him three cheers burst out the head boy in an imploring voice  mr carter smiled and nodded and there was such a hearty roaring and stamping such hip hip hurrah bursting out again and again that the windows clattered and the room seemed fuller of noise than it could possibly hold  it is not quite certain that mr carter did not halloo as loud as any of the boys  harold turned very red and did not know which way to look while it was going on nor what to do when it was over except to say a very odd sort of thank you sir but his heart leapt up with a kind of warm grateful feeling of liking towards those boys for going along with him so heartily and the cheers gave a pleasure and glow that the coins never would have done even had he thought them his own by right  he was not particularly good in this he had never felt the pinch of want and was too young to care and he did not happen to wish to buy anything in particular just then  a selfish or a covetous boy would not have felt as he did but these were not his temptations  knowing as he did that the assault had been the consequence of his foolish boasts about the moneyletters and that he being in charge ought to defend them to the last gasp he was sure he deserved the very contrary from a reward and never thought of the money belonging to any one but paul who had by his own free will come to the rescue and saved the bag from robbery himself from injury and disgrace  how happy he was in thinking what a windfall it was for his friend and how far it would go in fitting him up respectably  peggy was ready to trot nearly as fast as he wished her down the lane to the place where he had left paul and no sooner did harold come in sight of the olivecoloured rags than he bawled out a loud hurrah  come on paul you dont know what ive got for you  twas a young gentlemans watch as you saved and theyve come down right handsome and heres twelveandsixpence for youenough to rig you out like a regular swell why whats the matter he added in quite another voice as he had now come up to paul and found him sitting nearly doubled up with his head bent over his knees  he raised his face up as harold came and it was so ghastly pale that the boy quite startled jumped off his pony  why old chap what is it  have you got knit up with cold sitting here  yes i suppose so said paul but his very voice shivered his teeth chattered and his knees knocked together with the chill  the pains run about me he added but he spoke as if he hardly knew what he was doing or saying  you must come home with me and mother will give you something hot said harold  come youll catch your death if you dont  you shall ride home  he pulled paul from his seat with some difficulty and was further alarmed when he found that the poor fellow reeled and could hardly stand but he was somewhat roused and knew better what he was about  harold tried to put him on the pony but this could not be managed he could not help himself enough peggy always swerved aside nor was harold strong enough to lift him up  the only thing to be done was for harold to mount and paul to lean against the saddle while the pony walked  when they had to separate at the ford poor pauls walk across the bridge was so feeble and staggering that harold feared every moment that he would fall where the rail was broken away but was right glad to put his arm on his shoulder again to help to hold him up  the moving brought a little more life back to the poor boys limbs and he walked a little better and managed to tell harold how he had felt too miserable to speak to any one after the rating the farmer had given him and how he had set out on the tramp for more work though with hope so nearly dead in his heart that he only wished he could sit down and die  he had walked out of the village before people were about so as not to be noticed and then had found himself so weak and weary that he could not get on without food and had sat down by the hedge to eat the bit of bread he had with him  then he had taken the first lonelylooking way he saw without knowing that it was one of harolds daily rides and was slowly dragging himself up the hill from the ford when the wellknown voice shouting for help had suddenly called him back and filled him with spirit and speed that were far enough off now poor fellow  that was a terrible mile and a halfharold sometimes thought it would never be over or that paul would drop down and he would have to gallop off for help but paul was not one to give in and somehow they got back at last and harold with his arm round his friend dragged him through the garden and across the shop and pushed him into the armchair by the fire mrs king following and ellen rushing down from upstairs  there cried harold all in a breath there he is  that rascal tried to rob me on ragglesford bridge and was nigh too much for me but he there came and pulled him off me and got spilt into the river and hes got a chill and if you dont give him something jolly hot mother hell catch his death  mrs king thought so too pauls state looked to her more alarming than it did even to harold  he did not seem able to think or speak but kept rocking himself towards the fire and that terrible shivering shaking him all over  poor lad she said kindly  ill tell you what harold all you can do is put him into your bed at oncehere ellen you run up first and bring me a shirt to warm for him  then well get his own clothes dried  no no cried harold with a caper well make a scarecrow of em you dont know what i know mother  ive got twelve shillings and sixpence here all his own and youll see what i wont do with it at old levis the secondhand clothes man tonight  harold grew less noisy as he saw how little good the fire was doing to his patient and how ill his mother seemed to think him  he quietly obeyed her by getting him upstairs and putting him into his own bed the first in which paul had lain down for more than four months  then mrs king sent harold out for some gin she thought hot spirits and water the only chance of bringing back any life after such a dreadful chill and she and ellen kept on warming flannels and shawls to restore some heat and to stop the trembling that shook the bed so that alfred felt it even in the next room where he lay with the door open longing to be able to help and wishing to understand what could have happened  at last the cordial and the warm applications effected some good  paul was able to say i dont know why you are so good to me and seemed ready to burst into a great fit of crying but mrs king managed to stop him by saying something about one good turn deserving another and that she hoped he was coming round now  harold was now at leisure to tell the story in his brothers room  alfred did not grieve now at his brothers being able to do spirited things he laughed out loud and said well done harold at the switching and rubbed his hands and lighted up with glee as he heard of the ragglesford boys and their cheers and then harold went eagerly on with his scheme for fitting up paul at the secondhand shop both mrs king and alfred taking great interest in his plans till mrs king hearing something like a moan went back to paul  she found his cheeks and hands as burning hot as they had been cold they were like live coals and what was worse such severe pains were running all over his limbs that he was squeezing the clothes into his mouth that he might not scream aloud  happily it was mr blunts day for calling and before the morning was over he came and after a few words of explanation he stood at pauls bedside  not much given to tenderness towards the feelings of patients of his degree mr blunts advice was soon given  yes he is in for rheumatic feverwont be about again for a long time to come  i say mistress all youve got to do is to send in your boy to the union at elbury tell em to send out a cart for him and take him in as a casual pauper  then they may pass him on to his parish  therewith mr blunt went on to attend to alfred  then you think this poor lad will be ill a long time sir said mrs king when mr blunt was preparing to depart  of course he will i never saw a clearer case  youd better send him off as fast as you can while he can be moved  hell have a pretty bout of it i dare say  it is nothing infectious of course sir said the mother a little startled by this hastiness  infectiousnonsense why you know better than that mrs king i only meant that youd better get rid of him as quick as you can unless you wish to set up a hospital at onceand a capital nurse youd be  i would leave word with the relieving officer for you but that ive got to go on to stoke and shant be at home till too late  mrs kings heart ached for the poor forlorn orphan when she remembered what she had heard of the nursing in elbury union  she did not know how to turn him from her door the day he had saved her son from danger such as she could not think of without shuddering and yet what could she do her rent and the winter before her a heavy doctors bill and the loss of alfreds work  slowly she went up the stairs again to the narrow landing that held the bed where paul blackthorn lay  he was quite still but there were large tears coursing one after the other from his eyes his hollow cheeks quite glazed with them  is the pain so very bad she said in her soft voice putting her hand over his hot forehead in the way that alfred liked  i dontknow he answered and his black eyes after looking up once in her face with the piteous earnest glance that some loving dogs have shut themselves as if on purpose to keep in the tears but she saw the dew squeezing out through the eyelashes  my poor boy im sure its very bad for you she said again  please dont speak so kind said paul and this time he could not prevent asob  nobody ever did so before and he paused and went on i suppose they do it up in heaven so i hope i shall die  you are vexing about the union said mrs king without answering this last speech or she knew that she should begin to cry herself  i did think id done with them said paul with another sob  i said id never set foot in those four walls again  i was proud maybe but please dont stop with me  if you wouldnt look and speak like that the place wouldnt seem so hard seeing im bred to it as they say and he made an odd sort of attempt to laugh which ended in his choking himself with worse tears  harold is not gone yet said mrs king soothingly well wait till he comes in from his work and see how you are when youve had a little sleep  dont cry you arent going just yet  that same earnest questioning glance but with more hope in it was turned on her again but she did not dare to bind herself much as she longed to take the wanderer to her home  she went on to her sons room  mother mother alfred cried in a whisper so eager that it made him cough you cant never send him to the workhouse  i cant bear the thought alfy she said the tears in her eyes but i dont know what to do  its not the trouble  that id take with all my heart but it is hard enough to live and  im sure said ellen coming close that her undertone might be heard harold and i would never mind how much we were pinched  and i could go withoutsome things began alfred  and then went on the mother you see if we got straitened and matilda found it out shed want to help and i cant have her savings touched and yet i cant bear to let that poor lad be sent off so ill as he is and after all hes done for haroldsuch a good boy too and one thats so thankful for a common kind word  o mother keep him said alfred dont you know how the psalm says god careth for the stranger and provideth for the fatherless and the widow  mrs king almost smiled  yes alf i think it would be trusting gods word but then theres my duty to you  youve not sent harold off for the cart said alfred  no i thought somehow we have enough for today and it goes against me to send him away at once  i thought wed wait to see how it is tomorrow and harold wont mind having a bed made up in the kitchen  tap tap on the counter  some one had come in while they were talking it was mr cope very anxious to hear the truth of the strange stories that were going about the place  ellen and alfred thought it very tiresome that he was so long in coming upstairs but the fact was that their mother was very glad to talk the matter over without them  she knew indeed that mr cope was a very young man and not likely to be so well able as herself with all her experience to decide what she could afford or whether she ought to follow her feelings at the risk of debt or of privations for her delicate children but she also knew that though he had not experience education had given him a wider and clearer range of thought and that as her pastor he ought to be consulted so though she did not exactly mean to make it a matter for his decision unless indeed he should have some view which had not occurred to her she knew that he was by far the best person to help her to see her way and form her own judgment  mr cope heard all the story with as much eagerness as the ragglesford boys themselves and laughed quite out loud at harolds spirited defence  thats a good lad said he  well mrs king i dont think you need be very uneasy about your boy  when a fellow can stand up like that in defence of his duty there must be the right stuff in him to be got at in time  and now as to his allythis other poor fellowvery kind of you to have taken him in  i couldnt do no other sir said mrs king he came in so drenched and so terribly bad i could do nothing but let him lie down on harolds bed and now dr blunt thinks hes going to have a rheumatic fever and wanted me to send in to the relieving officer to have him removed but i dont know how to do that the poor lad doesnt say one word against it but i can see it cuts him to the heart and they do tell such stories of the nurses at the union that it does seem hard to send him there such an innocent boy too and one that doesnt seem to know how to believe it if one says a kind word to him the tears were in mrs kings eyes as she went on i do wish to let him stay here and do what i can for him with all my heart and so does all the children but i dont hardly know whats right by them poor things  if the parish would but allow him just one shilling and sixpence a week out of the house i think i could do it  what with your own boy in such a state you could undertake to nurse a stranger through a rheumatic fever  it wouldnt make much difference sir said mrs king  you see i am up a good deal most nights with alfred and we have fire and candle almost always alight  i should only be glad to do it for a poor motherless lad like that except for the cost and i thought perhaps if you could speak to the guardians they might allow him ever so little because there will be expenses  mr cope had not much hope from the parish so he said mr shepherd ought to do something for him after he has worked for him so long  he has been looking wretchedly ill for some time past and i dare say half this illness is brought on by such lodging and living as he got there but what did you say about some eggs  mrs king told him and he stood a moment thoughtful then said well ill go and see about it and strode across to the farm  when mr cope came back ellen was serving a customer  he stood looking redder than they had ever seen him and tapping the toe of his boot impatiently with his stick and the moment the buyer had turned away he said ellen ask your mother to be kind enough to come down  mrs king came and found the young curate in such a state of indignation as he could not keep to himself  he had learnt more than he had ever known or she had ever known of the oppression that the farmer and his wife and tom boldre had practised on the friendless stranger and he was burning with all the keen generous displeasure of one new to such base ways  at the gate he had met going home to dinner john farden with mrs hayward who had been charing at the farm  both had spoken out and he had learned how far below the value of his labour the boy had been paid how he had been struck abused and hunted about as would never have been done to one who had a father to take his part  and he had further heard fardens statement of having himself thrown away the eggs and mrs haywards declaration that she verily believed that the farmer only made the accusation an excuse for hurrying the lad off because he thought him faltering for a fever and wouldnt have him sick there  this was shocking enough mr cope had thought it merely the kindhearted womans angry construction but it was still worse when he came to the farmer and his wife  so used were they to think it their business to wring the utmost they could out of whatever came in their way that they had not the slightest shame about it  they thought they had done a thing to be proud of in making such a good bargain of the lad and getting so much work out of him for so little pay in fact that they had been rather weakly kind in granting him the freedom of the hayloft the notion of his dishonesty was firmly fixed in their heads though there was not a charge to bring against him  this was chiefly because they had begun by setting him down as a convict and because they could not imagine any one living honestly on what they gave him  and lastly the farmer thought the cleverest stroke of all was the having got rid of him just as winter was coming on and work was scarce and when there seemed to be a chance of his being laid up to encumber the rates  mr cope was quite breathless after the answer he had made to them  he had never spoken so strongly in his life before and he could hardly believe his own ears that people could be found not only to do such things but to be proud of having done them  it is to be hoped there are not many such thoroughgoing tyrants but selfishness is always ready to make any one into a tyrant and mammon is a false god who manages to make his servants satisfied that they are doing their duty  it was plain enough that no help was to be expected from the farm and neither mrs king nor the clergyman thought there was much hope in the guardians however they were to be applied to and this would be at least a reprieve for paul  mr cope went up to see him and found harold sitting on the top step of the stairs  well boys he said in his hearty voice so youve had a battle i hear  im glad it turned out better than your namesakes at hastings  paul was not too ill to smile at this and harold modestly said it was all along of he sir  and he seems to be the chief suffererare you in much pain paul  sometimes sir when i try to move said paul but it is better when im still  youve had a harder time of it than i supposed my boy said mr cope why did you never let me know how you were treated  pauls face shewed more wonder than anything else  thank you sir he said i didnt think it was any ones business  no ones business exclaimed the young clergyman  it is every ones business to see justice done and it should never have gone on so if you had spoken  why didnt you  i didnt think it would be any use again said paul  there was old joe joiner he always said twas a hard world to live in and that there was nothing for it but to grin and bear it  theres something better to be done than to grin said mr cope  yes i know sir said paul with a brighter gleam on his face and i seem to understand that better since i came here  i was thinking he added if they pass me back to upperscote ill tell old joe that folks are much kinder than he told me by far  kinderi should not have thought that your experience exclaimed mr cope his head still running on the shepherds  but paul did not seem to think of them at all or else to take their treatment as a matterofcourse as he did his union hardships  there was a glistening in his eyes and he moved his head so as to sign down stairs as he said i didnt think there was neer a one in the world like her  what mrs king  i dont think there are many said mr cope warmly and yet i hope there are  ay sir said paul fervently  and theres harold and john farden and all the chaps  please sir when im gone away will you tell them all that ill never forget em and ill be happier as long as i live for knowing that there are such goodhearted folks  mr cope felt trebly moved towards one who thought harshness so much more natural than kindness and who received the one so submissively the other so gratefully but the conversation was interrupted by harolds exclaiming that my lady in her carriage was stopping at the gate and mother was running out to her  rumours of the postoffice robbery as little miss selby called it had travelled up to the grange and she was wild to know what had happened to harold but her grandmamma not knowing what highway robbers might be roaming about friarswood would not hear of her walking to the postoffice and drove thither with her herself in full state close carriage coachman and footman and there was mrs king with her head in at the carriage window telling all the story  so you have this youth here said lady jane  yes my lady he was so poorly that i couldnt but let him lie down  and you have not sent him to the workhouse yet  why no not yet my lady i thought i would wait to see how he is to morrow  you had better take care mary said lady jane  youll have him too ill to be moved and then what will you do a great lad of that age and with illness enough in the house already  she sighed and it was not said unkindly but mrs king answered with something about his being so good a lad and so friendless  and miss jane exclaimed o grandmamma it does seem so hard to send him to the workhouse  do not talk like a silly child my dear said lady jane  mary is much too sensible to think of saddling herself with such a chargenot fit for her nor the children eithereven if the parish made it worth her while which it never will  the union is intended to provide for such cases of destitution and depend on it the youth looks to nothing else  no my lady said mrs king he is so patient and meek about it that it goes to ones very heart  ay ay said the old lady but dont be softhearted and weak mary it is not what i expect of you as a sensible woman to be harbouring a mere vagrant whom you know nothing about and injuring your own children  indeed my lady began mrs king ive known the poor boy these four months and so has mr cope and he is as steady and serious a boy as ever lived  very likely said lady jane and i am sure i would do anything for himgive him work when he is out again or send him with a paper to the county hospital  eh  but the county hospital was thirty miles off and the receiving day was not till saturday  that would not do  well added lady jane ill drive home directly and send price with the spring covered cart to take him in to elbury  that will be better for him than jolting in the open cart they would send for him  why thank you my lady but ii had passed my word that he should not go today  lady jane made a gesture as if mary king were a hopelessly weak goodnatured woman and shaking her head at her with a sort of ladylike vexation ordered the coachman to drive on  my lady was put out  no wonder  she was a very sensible managing woman herself and justly and uprightly kind to all her dependants and she expected every one else to be sternly and wisely kind in the same pattern  mrs king was one whom she highly esteemed for her sense and good judgment and she was the more provoked with her for any failure in these respects  if she had known paul as the kings did it is probable she might have felt like them  not knowing him nor knowing the secrets of elbury union she thought it mrs kings clear duty to sacrifice him for her childrens sake  moreover lady jane had strict laws against lodgersthe greatest kindness she could do her tenants though often against their will  so to have her model woman receiving a strange boy into her house even under the circumstances was beyond bearing  so mrs king stood on her threshold knowing that to keep paul blackthorn would be an offence to her best friend and patroness  moreover mr cope was gone without having left her a word of advice to decide her one way or the other     chapter xchristmas day   things are rather apt to settle themselves and so did paul blackthorns stay at the postoffice for the poor boy was in such an agony of pain all night and the fever ran so high that it was impossible to think of moving him even if the waiting upon him in such suffering had not made mrs king feel that she could not dismiss him to careless hands  his patience gratitude and surprise at every trouble she took for him were very endearing as were the efforts he made to stifle and suppress moans and cries that the terrible aches would wring from him so as not to disturb alfred  when towards morning the fever ran to his head and he did not know what he said it was more moving still to see that the instinct of keeping quiet for some ones sake still suppressed his voice then too his wanderings shewed under what dread and harshness his life had been spent and what his horror was of a return to the workhouse  in his senses he would never have thought of asking to remain at friarswood but in his halfconscious state he implored again and again not to be sent away and talked about not going back but only being left in a corner to die and mrs king without knowing what she was about soothed him by telling him to lie still for he was not going to that place again  at daybreak she sent harold on his way to the post for an order from the relieving officer for medical attendance and after some long and weary hours the union doctor came  he said like mr blunt that it was a rheumatic fever the effect of hardship and exposure for which perhaps poor paulafter his regular meals warm clothing and full shelter in the workhousewas less prepared than many a country lad whose days had been much happier but who had been rendered more hardy by often going without some of those necessaries which were provided for the paupers  the head continued so much affected that the doctor said the hair must be taken off which was done by old master warren who singed the horses in the autumn killed the pigs in the winter and shaved the men on saturday night  it was a very good thing for all parties and he would take no pay for his trouble but sent down a pitcher with what he called all manner of yarbs steeping in it with which as he said to ferment the boys limbs  foment was what he meant and mrs king thought as it was kindly intended and could do no harm she would try if it would do any good but she could not find that it made much difference whether she used that or common warm water  however the good will made paul smile and helped to change his notion about its being very few that had any compassion for a stranger  so too did good mrs hayward who when he was at the worst twice came to sit up all night with him after her days work and though she was not as tender a nurse as mrs king treated him like her own son and moreover carried off to her own tub all the clothes she could find ready to be washed and would not take so much as a mouthful of meat or drink in return struggling toilworn body as she was  the parish as might have been foreseen would afford nothing but the doctor to a chancecomer such as paul  if he needed more he might come into the house and be passed home to upperscote  but by the time this reply came mrs king not only felt that it would be almost murder to send a person in such a state four miles on a november day but she was caring so much for her patient that it sounded almost as impossible as to send alfred away  besides she had remembered the cup of cold water she had thought of the widows cruse of oil and barrel of meal and she had called to mind inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me and thereupon she took heart and made up her mind that it was right to tend the sick lad and that even if she should bring trouble and want on herself and her children it would be a heaven sent trial that would be good for them  so she made up her resolution to a winter of toil anxiety and trouble and to lady janes withdrawal of favour and thinking her ungrateful which to say the truth grieved her more than anything else excepting of course her forebodings for alfred  ellen was in great distress about my ladys displeasure  not that she dreamt of her mothers giving up paul on that account but she was very fond of her little fostersister and of many of the maidservants and her visits to the grange were the chief change and amusement she ever had  so while mrs king was busy between the shop her work and paul ellen sat by her brother making the housekeepers winter dress and imagining all sorts of dreadful things that might come of my lady being angry with them till alfred grew quite out of patience  well suppose and suppose he said suppose it was not to happen at all  why mothers doing right would be any good for nothing if she only did it to please my lady  certainly this was the very touchstone to shew whether the fear of man were the guide  and ellen was still more terrified that day for when she went across to the farm for the evenings supply of milk and butter mrs shepherd launched out into such a torrent of abuse against her and her mother that she came home trembling from head to foot and mrs king declared she should never go thither again  they would send to mrs prices for the little bit of fresh butter that was real nourishment to alfred the healthy ones would save by going without any  one word more as to the shepherds and then we have done with him  on the sunday mr cope had an elder brother staying with them who preached on the lesson for the day the second chapter of the prophet habakkuk and when he came to the text woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house he brought in some of the like passages the threats to those that grind the faces of the poor that oppress the hireling in his wages and that terrible saying of st james behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept by fraud crieth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabbath  three days after the curate was very much amazed to hear that mr and mrs shepherd did not choose to be preached at in their own church and never meant to come thither again  now it so happened that he could testify that the sermon had been written five years ago and that his brother had preached it without knowing that the shepherds were in existence for he had only come late the night before and there was so much to say about their home that the younger brother had not said a word about his parish before church though the kings and their guests were very near his heart  but it was of no use to say so  it was the truth that wounded the farmer and his wife and no one could make that otherwise  they did not choose to hear their sin rebuked so they made an excuse by pretending to take offence and except when they now and then went to the next parish to a meetinghouse cut themselves off from all that might disturb them in the sole pursuit of gain  it is awful to think of such hardening of the heart first towards man then towards the warnings of god  and mind whoever chooses profit rather than mercy is in the path of farmer shepherd  some certainty as to lady jane selbys feelings came on the second evening of pauls illness  mrs crabbe the housekeeper was seen with infinite trouble and disgust getting her large person over the stiles across the path fields  a call from her was almost a greater event than one from my lady herself  why  mother had been her stillroom maid and always spoke to her as maam and she called her mary and she had chosen matildas name for her and had given her a silver watch  so when mrs crabbe had found her way in and had been set down to rest in the armchair she proceeded to give mary a good round scolding against being weak and softhearted saying at last that my lady was quite in a way about it  she was sure that harold would catch his death of cold putting him to sleep in the kitchen upon the stonesand somy lady had sent off the cart with the little chairbed that would take down and put up againmattress bedclothes and all  that was a comfortable finish to the scolding  not that it was a finish though for the thanks made mrs crabbe afraid the family thought themselves forgiven so she went on to declare they all would be pinched and get into debt and she should advise her goddaughter matilda not to help them with a farthing of her wages and as to going without their full meals that was what none of them were fit to do  with which it appeared that the cart was bringing a can of broth a couple of rabbits some calvesfeet jelly and a bottle of port wine for alfred who lived on that and codliver oil more than on any other nourishment  at that rate lady janes displeasure did not seem likely to do much harm but there was pain in it too for when mrs crabbe had managed to get upstairs past the patchwork quilt that was hung up to shelter paul from the draught and had seen alfred and been shocked to find how much wasted he was since she last had seen him she said one thing you knowmy lady says she cant have miss selby coming down here to see alfred while this great lad is always about  and im sure it is not proper for her at any time such a young lady as she is over all those inconvenient stiles  i declare i shall speak to mr price about them  losing miss janes visits was to alfred like losing a sunbeam and his spirit felt very dreary after he had heard this sentence  ellen knew her well enough to suspect that she was very sorry but that she could not help herself and mrs king caught the brother and sister making such grumbling speeches to each other about the old ladys crossness that her faithful grateful spirit was quite grieved and she spoke strongly up for the just rightminded lady to whom she had loyally looked up for many and many a year though with the right sort of independence she would not give up to any ones opinion what she knew to be her duty  we all knew it must cost us something she said and well try to be ready with it though it does go to ones heart that the first should be what vexes you my alfy but it wont be for long  no mother but if it aint here long  oh  i dont seem to have nothing to look to if miss jane aint coming here no more with her pretty ways  and there were large tears on his cheeks  mrs king had tears in her eyes too but she bent down over the boy and turning his eyes to the little picture on the wall she said in a whisper in his ear didnt he bear his cross for the sake of other people  alfred did not answer he turned his face in towards the pillow and though ellen thought he was crying it did not seem to her to be so sadly  cost them something their kindness did  to be sure there came a party of boys with the master from ragglesford when there had been time for them to write the history of the robbery to their homes and as it came just before the monthly letter which they all had to write by way of practice to be shewn up to the master it was a real treasure to them to have such a story to tell  some of their friends especially the uncle who gave the watch had sent small sums of money for the lad who had behaved so well and these altogether came to a fair amount which the boys were highly pleased to give over into mrs kings hands  she like harold never made the smallest question that it was all for pauls benefit and though when she mentioned it to him he gave a cheery smile and said it would lessen the cost of his illness to her yet she put it all aside with the first twelveandsixpence  she told ellen that it went against her to touch the orphans money and that unless it came to very bad times indeed it should be kept to set him up decently when he should recover  no one else could afford aid in money not mr cope for he had little more than a maintenance for himself indeed mrs king was not in a station where it would seem becoming to offer alms to her  lady jane gave help in nourishing food but the days when this would come were uncertain and she had made a resolution against undertaking any share of the expense lest she should seem to encourage mary king as she said in such weak good naturecramming up her house with a strange boy like that when she had quite enough to do with her own son  so they had to fight on as they could and the first week when pauls illness was at the height ellen had so much more to do for alfred and about the house and was so continually called off her work that she could not finish mrs crabbes gown as soon as was expected and the ladies maid who was kept waiting took huff and sent her new purple silk to elbury to be madeup  it is not quite certain that ellen did not shed a few tears  harold had to go without his butter and once took it much to heart that his mother would buy no shrimps for tea but after some one had whispered to him that if there were a trouble about rent or about mr blunts bill peggy would be sold he bore it all pretty well and after all alfred and paul were so apt to give him tastes of their dainties that he had not much loss  rent was the care  the pig was killed and cut up to great advantage mrs king sold a side of it at once which went a good way towards it but not the whole and there was a bad debt of john fardens for bread contracted last winter and which he had never paid off in the summer that would just have made it up but what hopes were there of that  just then however came a parcel from matilda  it was her way of helping her family to send them the clothes which her mistresses allowed her to have when they left them off when mrs king either made them up for herself or ellen or disposed of them at elbury  what a treat those parcels were  how curious were all the party at the unpacking looking at the many odd things that were sure to come out on the happy doubtful certainty that each one would be remembered by the good sister  so there were the little directed parcelsa neat knitted grey and black handkerchief for mother to wear in the shop a whole roll of fashionbooks for ellen and a nice little pocketbook besides and a bundle of illustrated news to amuse the boys a precious little square book of hymns for the sick for alfred and a famous pair of ridinggloves like bears paws for harold  and what rolls besides worn flimsy dresses once pretty but now only fit for the oldclothes man yet whose trimmings ellen pulled out and studied bonnets that looked as if they had been sat upon rolls of soft ragged cambric handkerchiefs on which mrs king seized as the most valuable part of the cargo so useful would they be to poor alfred some few real good things in especial a beautiful thick silk dress which had been stained but which dyeing would render very useful and a particularly nice grey cloth mantle which matilda had mentioned in her letter as likely to be useful to ellenit was not at all the worse for wear except as to the lining of the hood and she should just fancy ellen in it  ellen could just fancy herself in it  she had a black silk one which had come in the same way and looked very well but it was just turning off and it was not warm enough for winter without a shawl under it  that grey looked as if it was made for her it suited her shoulders and her shape so well  she put it on and twisted about in it and then she saw her good mother not saying one word and knew she was thinking of the sum that was wanting to the rent  well mother said ellen ill go in and take the things to betsey on the next marketday and if we can get thirty shillings on them without the mantle  yes if you can my dear said her mother im sure i should be very glad for you to have it but you see  and mrs king sighed  ellen passed by paul on the landing and saw him with his face flushed with pain and fever trying to smile at her  she remembered how her unkind words had brought trouble on him and how her mother had begun by telling her that they must give up their own wishes if they were to nurse him  ellen went to elbury on the marketday and by the help of betsey hardman she got great credit for her bargaining  she brought home thirty shillings and ten shillings worth of soap for the shop where that article was running low but she did not bring home the cloak though betsey had told her a silk cloak over a shawl looked so mean and she feared all the servants at the grange would think the same  they always were good children to me said mrs king to mr cope but somehow since paul has been here i think they are better than ever theres poor alfred though his cough has been so bad of late has been so thoughtful and so good he says hes quite ashamed to find how patient paul is under so much sharper pain than he ever had and hes ready to send anything to paul that he fancies will do him goodquite carried out of himself you see and theres harold so much steadier ive hardly had to find fault with him since that poor boy made offhes sure to come in in time and takes care not to disturb his brother and helps his sister and me all he can  mr cope was not at all surprised that the work of mercy was blessed to all the little household nor that it drew out all the better side of their dispositions  there was no positive change nor sudden resolution to alter harold but he had been a good deal startled by dicks wickedness and in him had lost a tempter  besides he considered paul as his own friend received for his sake and therefore felt himself bound to do all he could for him and though he was no nurse he could do much to set his mother and ellen free to attend to their patients  and pauls illness though so much less dangerous frightened and subdued harold much more than the quiet gradual pining away of alfred to which he was used  the severe pain the raging fever and the ramblings in talk were much more fearful things to witness than the low cough the wearing sore and the helpless languor though there was much hope for the one and scarcely any for the other  while to harolds apprehension alfred was always just the same only worsening visibly from month to month paul was better or worse every time he came in and when fresh from hearing his breath gasp with sharp pain or receiving his feeble thanks for some slight service it was not in harold to go out and get into thoughtless mischief  moreover there were helpful things to do at home such as harold liked he was fond of chopping wood so he was very obliging about the oven and what he liked best of all was helping his mother in certain evening cookeries of sweetmeats by receipts from mrs crabbe  on the day of the expedition from ragglesford the young gentlemen had found out that mrs kings bottles contained what they called the real article and no mistake much better than what the old woman at the turnpike sold and so they were for mrs king made them herself and like an honest woman without a morsel of sham in them  she was not going to break the eighth commandment by cheating in a comfit any more than by stealing a purse and the children of friarswood had long known that and bought all the lollies that they were not naughty enough to buy on sundays when as may be supposed her shutters were not shut only for a decent show  and now harold did not often ride up to the school without some little master giving him a commission for some variety of sweetstuff and though mrs king used to say it was a pity the children should throw away their money in that fashion it brought a good deal into her till and harold greatly liked assisting at the manufacture  how often he licked his fingers during the process need not be mentioned but his objection to ragglesford was quite gone off now that some one was nearly certain to be looking out for him with a goodnatured greeting or an inquiry for paul  he knew one little boy from another and felt friendly with them all and he really was quite grieved when the holidays came and they wished him goodbye  the coach that had been hired to take them to elbury seemed something to watch for now and some thoughtful boy stopped all the whooping and hurraing as they came near the house on the bridge some other stopped the coach and they all came dropping off it like a swarm of black flies and tumbling into the shop where mrs king and her daughter had need to have had a dozen pair of hands to have served them and they did not go till they had cleared out her entire stock of sweet things and gingerbread nay some of them would have gone off without their change if she had not raced out to catch them with it after they were climbing up the coach and then the silly fellows said they hated coppers  and meeting harold and his postbag on his way home from elbury they raised such a tremendous cheer at him that poor peggy seemed to make but three springs from the milestone to the bridge and he could not so much as touch his cap by way of answer  somehow even after those droll customers were gone every saturdays reckoning was a satisfactory one  more always seemed to come in than went out  the potatoes had been unusually free from disease in mrs kings garden and every one came for them the second pig turned out well a lodger at the butchers took a fancy to her buns and on the whole winter when her receipts were generally at the lowest was now quite a prosperous time with her  the great pressure and near anxiety she had expected had not come and something was being put by every week towards the bill for flour and for mr blunts account so that she began to hope that after all the savings bank would not have to be left quite bare  quite unexpectedly john farden came in for a share of the savings of an old aunt at service and like an honest fellow as he was he got himself out of debt at once  this quite settled all mrs kings fears mr blunt and the miller would both have their due and she really believed she should be no poorer  then she recollected the widows cruse of oil and tears of thankfulness and faith came into her eyes and other tears dropped when she remembered the other more precious comfort that the stranger had brought into the widows house but she knew that the days of miracles and cures past hope were gone and that the christian womans promise was that her children should come again but not till the resurrection of the just  and though to her eye each frost was freshly piercing her boys breast each warm damp day he faded into greater feebleness yet the hope was far clearer  he was happy and content  he had laid hold of the blessed hope of everlasting life and was learning to believe that the cross laid on him here was in mercy to make him fit for heaven first making him afraid and sorry for his sins and ready to turn to him who could take them away and then almost becoming gladness in the thought of following his master though so far off  not that alfred often said such things but they breathed peace over his mind and made scripturereading prayers and hymns very delightful to him especially those in matildas book and he dwelt more than he told any one on mr copes promise when he trusted to be made more fully one with christ in the partaking of his cup of life  it used to be his treat when no one was looking to read over that service in his prayer book and to think of the time  it was like a kind of step he could fix his mind on that and the sense of forgiveness he hoped for therein better than on the great change that was coming when there was much fear and shrinking from the pain and some dread of what as yet seemed strange and unknown he thought he should feel lifted up so as to be able to bear the thought when that holy feast should have come to him  all this made him much less occupied with himself and he took much more share in what was going on he could be amused and playful cared for all that ellen and harold did and was inclined to make the most of his time with his brother  it was like old happy times now that alfred had ceased to be fretful and harold took heed not to distress him  one thing to which alfred looked forward greatly was pauls being able to come into his room and the two on their opposite sides of the wall made many pleasant schemes for the talk and reading that were to go on but when the day came alfred was more disappointed than pleased  paul had been cased by lady janes orders in flannel he had over that a pair of trousers of alfredsmuch too long for the kings were very tall and he was small and stunted in growthand a great wrappinggown that mr cope had once worn when he was ill at college and over his shaven head a nightcap that had been their fathers  ellen with many directions from alfred had made him up a couch with three chairs and the cushions alfred used to have when he could leave his bed the fire was made up brightly and mrs king and harold helped paul into the room  but all the rheumatic pain was by no means over and walking made him feel it he was dreadfully weak and was so giddy and faint after the first few steps that they could not bring him to shake hands with alfred as both had wished but had to lay him down as fast as they could  so tired was he that he could hardly say anything all the time he was there and alfred had to keep silence for fear of wearying him still more  there was a sort of shyness too which hindered the two from even letting their eyes meet often as they had heard each others voices and had greeted one another through the thin partition  as paul lay with his eyes shut alfred raised himself to take a good survey of the sharp pinched features the hollow cheeks deepsunk pits for the eyesand yellow ghastly skin of the worn face and the figure so small and wasted that it was like nothing curled up in all those wraps  one who could read faces better than young alfred could would have gathered not only that the boy who lay there had gone through a great deal but that there was much mind and thought crushed down by misery and a gentle nature not fit to stand up alone against it and so sinking down without exertion  and when alfred was learning a verse of his favourite hymn     there is a rill whose waters rise  pauls eyelids rose and looked him all over dreamily comparing him perhaps with the notions he had carried away from his two former glimpses  alfred did not look now so utterly different from anything he had seen before since mrs king and ellen had been hovering round his bed for nearly a month past but still the fair skin pink colour dark eyelashes glossy hair and white hands were like a dream to him as if they belonged to the pure land whither alfred was going and he was quite loath to hear him speak like another boy as he knew he could do having often listened to his talk through the wall  at the least sign of alfreds looking up he turned away his eyes as if he had been doing something by stealth  he came in continually after this and little things each day and harolds talk made the two acquainted and like boys together but it was not till christmas day that they felt like knowing each other  it was the first time paul felt himself able to be of any use for he was to be left in charge of alfred while mrs king and both her other children went to church  paul was sadly crippled still and every frost filled his bones with acute pain and bent him like an old man so that he was still a long way from getting downstairs but he could make a shift to get about the room and he looked greatly pleased when alfred declared that he should want nobody else to stay with him in the morning  very glad he was that his mother would not be kept from ellens first holy communion  owing to the curate not being a priest the feast had not been celebrated since michaelmas but a clergyman had come to help mr cope that the parish might not be deprived of the festival on such a day as christmas  harold though in a much better mood than at the confirmation time was not as much concerned to miss it as perhaps he ought to have been thought had not come to him yet and his head was full of the dinner with the servants at the grange  it was sad that he and ellen should alone be able to go to it but it would be famous for all that  ay and so were the young postmans christmasboxes  so paul and alfred were left together and held their tongues for full five minutes because both felt so odd  then alfred said something about reading the service and paul offered to read it to him  paul had not only been very well taught but had a certain gift such as not many people have for reading aloud well  alfred listened to those psalms and lessons as if they had quite a new meaning in them for the right sound and stress on the right words made them sound quite like another thing and so alfred said when he left off  im sure they do to me said paul  i didnt know much about good will to men last christmas  youve not had overmuch goodwill from them neither said alfred since you came out  what not since ive been at friarswood exclaimed paul  why i used to think all that was only something in a book  all what asked alfred  all aboutwhy loving ones neighbourand the good samaritan and so on  i never saw any one do it you know but it was comfortable like to read about it and when i watched to your mother and all of you i saw how it was about ones neighbour and then what with that and mr copes teaching i got to feel how it wasabout god and pauls face looked very grave and peaceful  well said alfred i dont know as i ever cared about it muchnot since i was a little boy  it was the fun last christmas  and paul looking curious alfred told all about the going out for holly and the dining at the grange and the snapdragon over the pudding till he grew so eager and animated that he lost breath and his painful cough came on so that he could just whisper what did you do  oh  i dont know  we had prayers and there was roast beef for dinner but they gave it to me where it was raw and i couldnt eat it  those that had friends went out but twasnt much unlike other days  poor paul sighed alfred  it wont be like that again though said paul even if i was in a union  i knowwhat i know now  and paul said alfred after a pause theres one thing i should like if i was you  you know our blessed saviour had no house over him but was left out of the inn and nobody cared for him  paul did not make any answer and alfred blushed all over  presently alfred said harold will run in soon  i say paul would you mind reading me what they will say after the holy sacramentwhat the angels sang is the beginning  paul found it and felt as if he must stand to read such praise  thank you said alfred  im glad mother and ellen are there  theyll remember us you know  did you hear what mr cope promised me  paul had not heard and alfred told him adding it will be the ember week in lent  youll be one with me then paul  id like to promise said paul fervently but you see when im well  oh you wont go away for good  my lady or mr cope will get you work and i want you to be mothers good son instead of me and a brother to harold and ellen  id never go if i could help it said paul i sometimes wish id never got better  i wish i could change with you alfred nobody would care if twas me nor im sure i shouldnt  i should like to get well said alfred slowly and sighing  but then youve been a much better lad than i was  i dont know why you should say that said paul with his hand under his chin rather moodily  but if i thought i could be good and go on well i would not mind so much  i say alfred when people round go on beinglike tom boldre you knowdo you think one can always feel that about god being ones father and church home and all the rest  i cant sayi never tried said alfred  but you know you can always go to churchand then the psalms and lessons tell you those things well and you can go to the holy sacramenti say paul if you take it the first time with me youll always remember me again every time after  i must be very odd ever to forget you said paul not far from crying ha he exclaimed they are coming out of church  i want to say one thing more while ive got it in my head said alfred  mr cope said all this sickness was a cross to me and id got to take it up for our saviours sake  well and then maynt yours be being plagued and bullied without any friends  im sure something like it happened to our lord and he never said one word against them  isnt that the way you may be to follow him  illness and thought had made such things fully plain to alfred and his words sank deep into pauls mind but there was not time for any answer for harold was heard unlocking the door and striding up three steps at a time sending his voice before him  well old chaps have you quarrelled yet  have you been jolly together  i say mrs crabbe told ellen that the pudding was put into the boiler at eight oclock last night and my lady and miss jane went in to give it a stir  im to bring you home a slice you know and paul will know what a real pudding is like  the two boys spent a happy quiet afternoon with mrs king and charles hayward brought all the singing boys down that they might hear the carols outside the window  paul much tired was in his bed by that time but his last thought was that goodwill to men had come home to him at last     chapter xibetter days for paul   pauls reading was a great prize to alfred for he soon grew tired himself his sister could not spare time to read to him and if she did she went mumbling on like a bee in a bottle  her mother did much the same and harold used to stumble and gabble so that it was horrible to hear him  such reading as pauls was a new light to them all and was a treat to ellen as she worked as much as to alfred and paul with hands as clean as alfreds was only too happy to get hold of a book and infinitely enjoyed the constant supply kept up by miss selby to make up for her not coming herself  then came the making out the accounts a matter dreaded by all the family  ellen and alfred both used to do the sums but as they never made them the same mrs king always went by some reckoning of her own by pencil dots on her thumbnail which took an enormous time but never went wrong  so the slate and the books came up after tea one night and ellen set to work with her mother to pick out every ones bill  there might be about eight customers who had christmas bills but many an accountant in a london shop would think eight hundred a less tough business than did the king family these eight especially as there was a debtor and creditor account with four and coals butchers meat and shoes for man and horse had to be set against bread tea candles and the like  one pound of tea 3s 6d that was all very well but an ounce and a half of the same made ellen groan and look wildly at the corner over alfreds bed as if in hopes she should there see how to set it down so as to work it  fourpence all but said a voice from the armchair by the fire  ellen did not take any particular heed but announced the fact that three shillings were thirtysix pence and six was fortytwo  also that sixteen ounces were one pound and sixteen drams one ounce but there she got stuck and began making figures and rubbing them out as if in hopes that would clear up her mind  mrs king pecked on for ten minutes on her nail  well she said pauls right it is fourpence  however did you do it asked ellen  as 16 to 15 so 42 quoth paul quickly  three halves into 42 21 and 42 is 63 63 by 16 gives 3 and fifteensixteenths  you cant deduct a sixteenth of a penny so call it fourpence  ellen and alfred were as wise as to the working as they were before  next questionpauls answer came like the next line in the bookmrs king proved him right and so on till she was quite tired of the proofs and began to trust him  alfred asked how he could possibly do such things which seemed to him a perfect riddle  i should have had my ears pretty nigh pulled off if i took five minutes to work that in my head said paul  but ive forgotten things now i could do it faster once  im sure you hadnt need said mrs king its enough to distract ones senses to count so fast  all in your poor head too  and ive got to write them all out tomorrow said ellen dismally i must wait till dark or i shant set a stitch of work  i wish people would pay ready money and then one wouldnt have to set down their bills  heres mr cope breadbreadbread as long as my arm  if you didnt mind maybe i could save you the trouble miss ellen said paul  did you ever make out a bill asked mrs king  never a real one but every thursday i used to do sham ones  once i did a jewellers bill for twelve thousand pounds and odd  it is so long since i touched a pen that may be i cant write but i should like to try  ellen brought a pen and the cover of a letter and hobbling up to the table he took the pen cleared it of a hair that was sticking in it made a scratch or two weakly and ineffectually then wrote in a neat clear hand without running up or down friarswood christmas  a pretty hand as ever i saw said mrs king  well if you can write like that and can be trusted to make no mistakes you might write out our bills and wed be obliged to you most kindly  and so paul did so neatly that when the next evening mr cope walked in with the money he said looking at harold ah my ancient saxon i must make my compliments to you i did not think you could write letters as well as you can carry them  twas paul did it sir said harold  yes sir twas paul said mrs king  the lad is a wonderful scholar he told off all the sums as if they was in print and to hear him readtis like nothing i ever heard since poor mrs selby miss janes mother  i saw he had been very well instructedin acquaintance with the bible and the like  and sir before i got to know him for a boy that would not give a false account of himself i used to wonder whether he could have run away from some school and have friends above the common  if you observe sir he speaks so remarkably well  mr cope had observed it  paul spoke much better english than did even the kings though ellen was by way of being very particular and sometimes a little mincing  you are quite sure it is not so he said a little startled at mrs kings surmise  quite sure now sir  i dont believe he would tell a falsehood on no account and besides poor lad and she smiled as the tears came into her eyes hes so taken to me he wouldnt keep nothing back from me no more than my own boys  im sure he ought not mrs king said the curate such a mother to him as you have been  i should like to examine him a little  with so much education he might do something better for himself than fieldlabour  a very good thing it would be sir said mrs king looking much cheered for i misdoubt me sometimes if hell ever be strong enough to gain his bread that wayat least not to be a good workman  there hes not nigh so tall as harold and so slight and skinny as he is going about all bent and slouching even before his illness  why he says what made him stay so long in the union was that he looked so small and young that none of the farmers at upperscote would take him from it and so at last he had to go on the tramp  mr cope went upstairs and found ellen as usual at her needle and paul in the armchair close by alfred both busied in choosing and cutting out pictures from matildas illustrated news with which harold ornamented the wall of the staircase and landing  mr cope sat down and made them laugh with something droll about the figures that were lying spread on alfred  so paul he said i find mrs king has engaged you for her accountant  i wish i could do anything to be of any use said paul  ive half a mind to ask you some questions in arithmetic said mr cope with his merry eyes upon the boy and his mouth looking grave only im afraid you might puzzle me  i cant do as i used sir said paul rather nervously ive forgotten ever so much and my head swims  the slate was lying near mr cope pushed it towards him and said well will you mind letting me see how you can write from dictation  and taking up one of the papers he read slowly several sentences from a description of a great fire with some tolerably longwinded newspaper words in them  when he paused and asked for the slate there it all stood perfectly spelt well written and with all the stops and capitals in the right places  famously done paul  well and do you know where this place was naming the town  paul turned his eyes about for a moment and then gave the name of a county  thatll do paul  which part of england  midland  and so on mr cope got him out of his depth by asking about the rivers and made him frown and look teased by a question about a battle fought in that county  if he had ever known he had forgotten and he was weak and easily confused but mr cope saw that he had read some history and learnt some geography and was not like some of the village boys who used to think harold had been called after heroda nice namesake truly  who taught you all this paul he said  you must have had a cleverer master than is common in unions  who was he  he was a mr alcock sir  he was a clever man  they said in the house that he had been a bit of a gentleman a lawyer or a clerk or something but that he could never keep from the bottle  what and so they keep him for a schoolmaster  he was brought in sir hed got that mad fit that comes of drink sir and was fresh out of gaol for debt  and when he came to he said hed keep the school for less than our master that was gone  he couldnt do anything else you see  and how did he teach you  he knocked us about said paul drawing his shoulders together with an unpleasant recollection he wasnt so bad to me because i liked getting my tasks and when he was in a good humour hed say i was a credit to him and order me in to read to him in the evening  and when he was not  that was when hed been out  they said hed been at the ginshop but he used to be downright savage said paul  at last he never thought it worth while to teach any lessons but mine and i used to hear the other classes but the inspector came all on a sudden and found it out one day when hed hit a little lad so that his nose was bleeding and so he was sent off  how long ago was this  going on for a year said paul  didnt the inspector want you to go to a trainingschool said alfred  yes but the guardians wouldnt hear of it  did you wish it asked mr cope  i liked my liberty sir was the answer and paul looked down  well and what you do think now youve tried your liberty  paul didnt make any answer but finding that goodhumoured face still waiting he said slowly why sir it was wellnigh the worst of all to find i was getting as stupid as the cows  mr cope laughed but not so as to vex him and added so that was the way you learnt to be a reader paul  can you tell me what books you used to read to this master  paul paused and alfred said uncle toms cabin sir he told us the story of that  yes said paul but that wasnt all there was a book about paris and all the people in the back lanes there and a german prince who came and was kind  you must not tell them stories out of that book paul said mr cope quickly for he knew it was a very bad one  no sir said paul but most times it was books he called philosophy that i couldnt make anything ofno story and all dull but he was very savage if i got to sleep over them till i hated the sight of them  im glad you did my poor boy said mr cope  but one thing more tell me how with such a man as this you could have learnt about the bible and catechism as you have done  oh said paul we had only the bible and testament to read in the school because they were the cheapest and the chaplain asked us about the catechism every sunday  what was the chaplains name  paul was able with some recollection to answer but he knew little about the clergyman who was much overworked and seldom able to give any time to the paupers  three days after mr cope again came into the postoffice  well mrs king i suppose you dont need to be told that our friend paul has spoken nothing but truth  the chaplain sends me his baptismal registry for which i asked  just seventeen he must bea foundling picked up at about three weeks old january 25th 1836  they fancy he was left by some tramping musicians but never were able to trace themat least so the chaplain hears from some of the people who remember it being so stunted and looking younger than he is no farmer would take him from the house and the schoolmaster made him useful so he was kept on till the grand exposure that he told us of  ah  sir said mrs king im afraid that master was a bad man  i only wonder the poor lad learnt no more harm from him  one trembles to think of the danger said mr cope but you see theres often a guard over those who dont seek the temptation and perhaps this poor fellows utter ignorance of anything beyond the union walls helped him to let the mischief pass by his understanding better than if he had had any experience of the world  i doubt if hell ever have that sir said mrs king her sensible face lighting up rather drolly theres harold always laughing at him for being so innocent and yet so clever at his book  so much the better for him said mr cope  the son of sirach never said a wiser word than that the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom why mrs king what have i said you look as if you had a great mind to laugh at me  i beg your pardon sir said mrs king much disconcerted at what seemed to her as if it might have been disrespect though that was only mr copes droll way of putting it i never meant  well but what were you thinking of  why sir i beg your pardon but i was thinking it wouldnt have been amiss if he had had sense enough to keep himself clean and tidy  i agree with you said mr cope laughing and seeing she used innocent in a slightly different sense from what he did but perhaps union cleanliness was not inviting and hed not had you to bring him up to fresh cheeks like harolds  besides i believe it was half depression and want of heart to exert himself when there was no one to care for him and he certainly had not been taught either selfrespect or to think cleanliness next to godliness  poor ladno said mrs king nor i dont think hed do it again and i trust hell never be so lost again  lost and found said mr cope gravely  another thing i was going to say was that this irreverent economy of the guardians in allowing no lessonbooks but the bible seems to have after all been blest to him in his knowledge of it like an antidote to the evil the master poured in  yes sir said mrs king just so only he says that though he liked it because poor lad there was nothing else that seemed to him to speak kind or soft he never knew how much it was meant for him nor it didnt seem to touch him home till he came to you sir  mr cope half turned away  his bright eyes had something very like a tear in them for hardly anything could have been said to make the young clergyman so happy as to tell him that any work of his should be blessed but he went on talking quickly to say that the chaplain gave a still worse account of alcock than pauls had been saying that some gentlemen who had newly become guardians at the time of the inspectors visit had taken up the matter and had been perfectly shocked at the discoveries they had made about the man to whom the poor children had been entrusted  on his dismissal some of the old set who were all for cheapness had talked of letting young blackthorn act as schoolmaster but as he was so very young and had been brought up by this wretched man the gentlemen would not hear of it and as they could not afford to accept the inspectors offer of recommending him to a government school he had been sent out in quest of employment as being old enough to provide for himself  things had since the chaplain said been put on a much better footing and he himself had much more time to attend to the inmates  as to paul he was glad to hear that he was in good hands he said he had always perceived him to be a very clever boy and knew no harm of him but that he was a favourite with alcock which he owned had made him very glad to get him out of the house lest he should carry on the mischief  mr cope and mrs king were both of one mind that this was hard measure so it was  mans measure always is either over hard or over soft because he cannot see all sides at once  now they saw pauls side his simplicity and his suffering the chaplain had only seen the chances of his conveying the seeds of ungodly teaching to the workhouse children he could not tell that the pitch which paul had not touched by his own will had not stuck by himprobably owing to that very simplicity which had made him so helpless in common life  having learnt all this mr cope proposed to paul to use the time of his recovery in learning as much as he could so as to be ready in case any opportunity should offer for gaining his livelihood by his head rather than by his hands  pauls face glowed  he liked nothing better than to be at a book and with mr cope to help him by bright encouragements and goodnatured explanations instead of tweaks of the ears and raps on the knuckles what could be pleasanter  so mr cope lent him books set him questions and gave him pen ink and copybook and he toiled away with them till his senses grew dazed and his back ached beyond bearing so that mother as he called her now caught him up and made him lie on his bed to rest threatening to tell mr cope not to set him anything so hard while ellen watched in wonder at any one being so clever and was proud of whatever mr cope said he did well and harold looked on him as a more extraordinary creature than the piebald horse in the show who wore a hat and stood on his hind legs since he really was vexed when book and slate were taken out of his hands  he would have overtasked himself in his weakness much more if it had not been for his lovingness to alfred  to please alfred was always his first thought and even if a difficult sum were just on the point of proving itself he would leave off at the first moment of seeing alfred look as if he wanted to be read to and would miss all his calculations to answer some questionwho was going down the village or what that noise could be  alfred tried to be considerate and was sorry when he saw by a furrow on pauls brow that he was trying to win up again all that some trifling saying had made him lose  but alfred was not scholar enough to perceive the teasing of such interruptions and even had he been aware of it he was not in a state when he could lie quite still long together without disturbing any one he could amuse himself much less than formerly and often had most distressing restless fits when one or other of them had to give him their whole attention and it was all his most earnest efforts could do to keep from the old habit of fretfulness and murmuring and he grieved so much over the least want of temper and begged pardon so earnestly for the least impatient wordeven if there had been real provocation for itthat it was a change indeed since the time when he thought grumbling and complaint his privilege and relief  nothing helped him more than pauls reading psalms to himthe 121st was his favouriteor saying over hymns to him in that very sweet voice so full of meaning  sometimes ellen and paul would sing together as she sat at her work and it almost always soothed him to hear the psalm tunes that were like an echo from the church about which he had cared so little when he had been able to go there in health and strength but for which he now had such a longing  he came to be so used to depend on their singing the evening hymn to him that one of the times when it was most hard for him to be patient was one cold evening when ellen was so hoarse that she could not speak and an unlucky draught in from the shop door had so knit paul up again that he was lying in his bed much nearer screaming than singing  most of all however was alfred helped by mr copes visits and the looking forward to the promised feast with more earnestness as the time drew on and he felt his own weakness more longing for the support and blessing of uniting his suffering with that of his lord  in all our afflictions he was afflicted was a sound that came most cheeringly to him and seemed to give him greater strength and goodwill to bear his load of weakness  there was a book which young mrs selby had given his mother which was often lying on his bed and had marks in it at all the favourite places some he liked to look at himself some for paul to read to him  they were such sentences as these  my son i descended from heaven for thy salvation i took upon me thy miseries not necessity but charity drawing me thereto that thou thyself mightest learn patience and bear temporal miseries without grudging  for from the hour of my birth even until my death on the cross i was not without suffering and grief  and then again  offer up thyself unto me and give thyself wholly for god and thy offering shall be acceptable  behold i offered up myself wholly unto my father for thee and gave my whole body and blood for thy food that i might be wholly thine and that thou mightest continue mine unto the end  so he might think of all that he went through as capable of being made a free offering which god would accept for the sake of the one great offering consuming and burning away as the book said all his sins with the fire of christs love and cleansing his conscience from all offences  it was what he now felt in the words thy will be done which he tried to say in full earnest but he thought he should be very happy when he should go along with the offering ourselves our souls and bodies to be a reasonable holy and lively sacrifice  each of mr copes readings brought out or confirmed these refreshing hopes and paul likewise dwelt on such thoughts  hardship had been a training to him like sickness for alfred he knew what it was to be weary and heavy laden and to want rest and was ready to draw closer to the only home and father that he could claim  his gentle unresisting spirit was one that so readily forgot illwill that positively harold cherished more dislike to the shepherds than he did and there was no struggle to forgive no lack of charity for all men so that hope and trust were free  these two boys were a great deal to the young deacon  perhaps he reckoned on his first ministration as a priest by alfreds bedside as much or even more than did the lad for to him the whole household were as near and likeminded friends though neither he nor they ever departed from the fitting manners of their respective stations  he was one who liked to share with others what was near his heart and he had shewn alfred the service for the ordination of priests and the prayers for grace that would be offered and the holy vows that he would take upon him and the words with which those great powers would be conferredthose powers that our chief shepherd left in trust for the pastors who feed his flock  and once he had bent down and whispered to alfred to pray that help might be given to him to use those powers faithfully  so wore on the early spring and the morning had come when he was to set out for the cathedral town when harold rode up to the parsonage door and something in his looks as he passed the window made mr cope hasten to the door to meet him  o sir said harold bursting out crying as he began to speak poor alfred is took so bad and mother told me to tell you sirif hes not betterhell never live out the day  poor harold who had never seemed to heed his brothers illness was quite overwhelmed now  it had come upon him all at once  what is it  has the doctor been  no sir i went in at six oclock this morning to ask him to come out and he said hed comeand sent him a blisterbut alf was worse by the time i got back sirhe cant breatheand dont seem to notice  and without another word nor waiting for comfort harold dug his heels into peggy passed his elbow over his eyes and cantered on with the tears drying on his face in the brisk march wind  there was no finishing breakfast for the curate he thrust his letters into his pocket caught up his hat and walked off with long strides for the postoffice  it shewed how different things were from usual that paul who had hardly yet been four times downstairs his thin pointed face all in a flush was the only person in the shop trying with a very shaky hand to cut out some cheese for a great stout farm maidservant who evidently did not understand what was the matter and stared doubly when the clergyman put his strong hand so as to steady pauls trembling one and gave his help to fold up the parcel  how is he paul  paul was very near crying as he answered much worse sir  mother has been up all night with him  o sir he did so want to live till you came home  may i go up asked mr cope  paul was sure that he might and crept up after him  it was bad enough but not quite so bad as harold in his fright had made mr cope believe poor boy it had all come upon him now and seeing his brother unable to speak and much oppressed he fancied he did not know him whereas alfred was fully sensible though too ill to do more than lift his eyes and put out his weak fingers as mr cope came into the room where he was lying raised on his pillows with his mother and sister doing all they could for him  a terrible pain in the side had come on in the night making every breath painful every cough agonizing and his whole face and brow were crimson with the effort of gasping  paul looked a moment but could not bear it and went and sat down on the top of the stairs while mr cope kindly held alfreds hot hand and mrs king in her low patient tone told how the attack had begun  she was in the midst when mr blunts gig was seen at the gate  his having thus hastened his coming was more than they had dared to hope and while mrs king felt grateful for the kindness ellen feared that it shewed that he thought very badly of the case  mr cope was much hurried but he could not bear to go till he had heard mr blunts opinion so he went down to the kitchen tried to console paul by talking kindly to him wrote a note and read his letters  they were much comforted to hear that mr blunt thought that there was hope of subduing the present inflammatory pain and though there was much immediate danger it was not hastening so very fast to the end as they had at first supposed  yet in such a state as alfreds a few hours might finish all  there was no saying  already when mr cope went up again the remedies had given some relief and though the breaths came short and hard like so many stabs alfred had put his head into an easier position and his eyes and lips looked more free to look a greeting  there was so much wistful earnestness in his face and it deeply grieved mr cope to be forced to leave him and in too much haste even to be able to pray with him  well alfred dear fellow he said his voice trembling i am come to wish you goodbye  i am comforted to find that mr blunt thinks there is good hope that you will be herethat we shall be together when i come back  yes i know that is what is on your mind and i do reckon most earnestly on it but if it should not be his willhere ellen will you take care of this note  if he should be worse will you send this to mr carter at ragglesford and i know he will come at once  the dew stood on alfreds eyelashes and his lips worked  he looked up sadly to mr cope as if this did not answer his longings  mr cope replied to the lookyes dear boy but if it cannot be still remember it is communion  he can put us together  we all drink into one spirit  i shall be engaged in a like manneri would noti could not go alfred for pleasureno nor businessonly for this  you must think that i am gone to bring you home the giftthe greatest best giftthe one our lord left with his disciples to bear them through their sorrows and painsthrough the light affliction that is but for a moment but worketh an exceeding weight of glory  and if i should not be in time he added nearly sobbing as he spoke thenthen alfred the gift the blessing is yours all the same  it is the great high priest to whom you must lookperhaps you may do so the more really if it should not be throughyour friend  if we are disappointed we will make a sacrifice of our disappointment  goodbye my boy god bless you bending close down to his face he whispered think of me  pray for menowalways  then rising hastily he shook the hands of the mother and sister ran downstairs and was gone     chapter xiirest at last   the east wind had been swept aside by gales from the warm south and the spring was bursting out everywhere the sky looked softly blue instead of hard and chill the sun made everything glisten the hedges were full of catkins white buds were on the purple twigs of the blackthorns primroses were looking out on the sunny side of the road the larks were mounting up singing as if they were wild with delight and the sunbeams were full of dancing gnats as the curate of friarswood walked with quick eager steps towards the bridge  his eyes were anxiously bent on the house watching the white smoke rising from the chimney then he hastened on to gain the first sight at the upper windows feeling almost as he could have done had it been a brother who lay there so much was his heart set on the first whom he had striven to help through the valley of the shadow of death  the window was open but the blind was not drawn and almost at the same moment the gate opened some one looked out and seeing him waved his hand and arm in joyful signal towards some one within and this gesture set mr copes heart at rest  was it harold  no it was paul blackthorn who stood leaning on the wicket as he held it open for the clergyman at whom he looked up as if expecting some change and a little surprised to find the same voice and manner  well paul then he is not worse  no sir thank you he is better  the pain has left him and he can speak again said paul but not very cheerfully  that is a great comfort  but whos that as a head not ellens appeared for a moment at the window  thats miss king sirmiss matilda  oh  well and how are the bones paul  better i hope since i see you are come out with the bees said mr cope laying his hand kindly on his shoulder a thing fit to touch now since it was in a fustian coat of poor alfreds and accommodating his swift strong steps to the feeble halt with which paul still moved  thank you sir yes ive been down here twice when the sun was out he said as if it were a grand undertaking but then with a sudden smile and poor caesar knew me sir he came right across the road and wagged his tail and licked my hand  good old caesar  you were his best friend paulwell mrs king this is a blessing  mrs king looked sadly worn out with nursing and her eyes were full of tears  yes sir she said indeed it is  my poor darling has been so much afraid he was too much set on your coming home and yet so patient and quiet about it  then you ventured to wait  and mr cope heard that the attack of inflammation had given way to remedies but that alfred was so much weakened that they could not raise him again  he was sustained by as much nourishment as they could give him but the disease had made great progress and mr blunt did not think that he could last many days  his eldest sister had come for a fortnight from her place and was a great comfort to them all  and so is paul said mrs king looking for him kindly i dont know what we should do without his help upstairs and down  and sir yesterday she added colouring a good deali beg your pardon but i thought maybe youd like to hear italfred would have nobody else up with him in morning churchtimeand made him read the mostof that service sir  mr copes eyes glistened and he said something huskily of being glad that alfred could think of it  it further appeared that alfred had wished very much to see miss selby again and that mrs king had sent the two sisters to the grange to talk it over with mrs crabbe and word had been sent by harold that morning that the young lady would come in the course of the afternoon  mr cope followed mrs king upstairs alfreds face lighted up as his sister matilda made way for the clergyman  he was very white and his breath was oppressed but his look had changed very muchit had a strange still sort of brightness and peace about it  he spoke in very low tones just above a whisper and smiled as mr cope took his hand and spoke to him  thank you sir  it is very nice he said  i thank god that he has let you wait for me said mr cope  i am glad said alfred  i did want to pray for it but i thought perhaps if it was not his will i would notand then what you said  and now he is making it all happy  and you do not grieve over your year of illness  i would not have been without itno said alfred very quietly but with much meaning  it is good for me that i have been in trouble is what you mean said mr cope  it has made our saviour seemi meanhe is so good to me said alfred fervently  but talking made him cough and that brought a line in the fair forehead so full of peace  mr cope would not say more to him and asked his mother whether the feast for which he had so much longed should be on the following day  she thought it best that it should be so and alfred again said thank you sir with the serene expression on his face  mr cope read a psalm and a prayer to him and thinking him equal to no more went away pausing however for a little talk with paul in the shop  paul did not say so but poor fellow he had been rather at a loss since matilda had come  in herself she was a very good humble sensible girl but she wore a dark silk dress and looked moved and spoke much more like a lady than ellen paul stood in great awe of her and her presence seemed all at once to set him aloof from the others  he had been like one of themselves for the last three months now he felt that he was like a beggar among them he did not like to call mrs king mother lest it should seem presuming ellen seemed to be raised up the same step as her sister and even alfred was almost out of his reach matilda read to him and pauls own good feeling shewed him that he would be only in the way if he spent all his time in alfreds room as formerly so he kept downstairs in the morning and went to bed very early  nobody was in the least unkind to him but he had just begun to grieve at being a burden so long and to wonder how much longer he should be in getting his health again  and then it might be only to be cast about the world and to lose his one glimpse of home kindness  poor boy he still cried at the thought of how happy alfred was  he did all he could to be useful but he could scarcely manage to stoop down could carry nothing heavy and moved very slowly and he now and then made a dreadful muddle in the shop when a customer was not like mrs hayward who told him where everything was and the price of all she wanted as well as mrs king could do herself  he could sort the letters and see to the postoffice very well and for all his blunders he did so much by his goodwill that when mrs king wanted to cheer him up she declared that he saved her all the expense of having in a woman from the village to help and that he did more about the house than harold  this was true for harold did not like doing anything but manly things as he called them whereas paul did not care what it was so that it saved trouble to her or ellen  talking and listening to harold was one use of paul  now that it had come upon him and he saw alfred worse from day to day the poor boy was quite brokenhearted  possibly when at his work or riding he managed to shake off the remembrance but at home it always came back and he cried so much at the sight of alfred and at any attempt of his brother to talk to him that they could scarcely let him stay ten minutes in the room  then when paul had gone to bed on the landing at seven oclock he would come and sit on his bed and talk and cry and sob about his brother and his own carelessness of him often till his mother came out and ordered him downstairs to his own bed in the kitchen and paul turned his face into the pillow to weep himself to sleep loving alfred very little less than did his brother but making less noise about it and feeling very lonely when he saw how all the family cared for each other  so mr copes kind manner came all the more pleasantly to him and after some talk on what they both most cared about mr cope said paul mr shaw of berryton tells me he has a capital schoolmaster but in rather weak health and he wants to find a good intelligent youth to teach under him and have opportunities of improving himself  five pounds a year and board and lodgings  what do you think of it paul  pauls sallow face began growing red and he polished the counter on which he was leaning then as mr cope repeated eh paul he said slowly and in his almost rude way they wouldnt have me if they knew how id been brought up  perhaps they would if they knew what youve come to in spite of bringing up  and added mr cope they are not so much pressed for time but that they can wait till youve quite forgotten your tumble into the ragglesford  we must fatten youget rid of those spiderfingers and you and i must do a few more lessons togetherand i think mrs king has something towards your outfit and by whitsuntide i told mr shaw that i thought i might send him what i call a very fair sample of a good steady lad  paul did not half seem to take it inperhaps he was too unhappy or it sounded like sending him away again or maybe such a great step in life was more than he could comprehend after the outcast condition to which he had been used but mr cope could not go on talking to him for the grange carriage was stopping at the gate and matilda and ellen were both coming downstairs to receive miss jane  poor little thing she looked very pale and nervous and as she shook hands with the curate as he met her in the gardenpath she said with a startled manner oh  mr copewere you there  am i interrupting  not at all he said  i had only called in as i came home and had just come down again  is itis it very dreadful murmured jane with a sort of gasp  she was so entirely unused to scenes of sadness or pain that it was very strange and alarming to her and it was more difficult than ever to believe her no younger than ellen  very far from dreadful or distressing said mr cope kindly for he knew it was not her fault that she had been prevented from overcoming such feelings and that this was a great effort of kindness  it is a very peaceful soothing sighthe is very happy and not in a suffering state  oh will you tell grandmamma said jane with her pretty look of earnestness she is so much afraid of its much for me and she was so kind in letting me come  so miss selby went on to the two sisters and mr cope proceeded to the carriage where lady jane had put out her head glad to be able to ask him about the state of affairs  having nothing but this little grand daughter left to her the old lady watched over her with almost overtender care and was in much alarm both lest the air of the sick room should be unwholesome or the sight too sorrowful for her and though she was too kind to refuse the wish of the dying boy she had come herself in order that the child as she called her might not stay longer than was good for her and she was much relieved to hear mr copes account of alfreds calm state and of the freshness of the clean room in testimony of which he pointed to the open window  yes she said i hope mary king was wise enough but i hardly knew how it might be with such a number about the housethat boy and all  he is not gone is he  no he is not nearly well enough yet though he does what he can to be useful to her  when he is recovered i have a scheme for him  so mr cope mentioned mr shaws proposal by which my lady set more store than did paul as yet  very kindhearted she was though she did not fancy adopting chancecomers into her parish and as long as he was not saddled upon mary king as she said she was very glad of any good for him so she told mr cope to come to her for what he might want to fit him out properly for the situation and turning her keen eyes on him as he stood near the cottage door pronounced that after all he was a nice decentlooking lad enough which certainly her ladyship would not have said before his illness  miss jane did not stay long  indeed alfred could not talk to her and she did not know what to say to him she could only stand by his bed with the tears upon her cheeks making little murmuring sounds in answer to mrs king who said for her son what she thought he wished to have said  meanwhile jane was earnestly looking at him remarking with awe that changed as he was since she had last seen himso much more wasted awaythe whole look of his face was altered by the gentleness and peace that it had gained so as to be like the white figure of a saint  she could not bear it when mrs king told her alfred wanted to thank her for all her kindness in coming to see him  oh no she said i was not kind at all and her tears would not be hindered  only you know i could not help it  alfred gave her a bright look  any one could see what a pleasure it was to him to be looking at her again though he did not repent of his share in the sacrifice for pauls sake  no if paul had been given up that miss jane might come to him alfred would not have had the training that made all so sweet and calm with him now  he turned his head to the little picture and said thank you maam for that  thats been my friend  yes indeed it has miss jane said his mother  theres nothing you ever did for him that gave him the comfort that has been  and please maam said alfred will you tell my ladyi give her my dutyand ask her pardon for having behaved so badand mrs crabbeand the rest  i will alfred but every one has forgiven that nonsense long ago  it was very bad of me said alfred pausing for breath and so it was not to mind youmiss janewhen you said i was ill for a warning  did i said jane  yesin haytimei mind iti didnt mind for longbut twas true  he had patience with me  the cough came on and jane knew she must go her grandmother had bidden her not to stay if it were so and she just ventured to squeeze alfreds hand and then went downstairs checking her tears to wish matilda and ellen goodbye and as she passed by paul told him not to uncover his still very shorthaired head and kindly hoped he was better  paul in his dreary feelings hardly thought of mr copes plan till as he was getting the letters ready for harold he turned up one in mr copes writing addressed to the rev a shaw berryton elbury  thats to settle for me then he said and harold who was at tea asking whats that he explained  well said harold every one to his taste  i wouldnt go to school again not for a hundred pounds and as to keeping school  such a face as he made really caused paul to smile  nor you dont half like it neither continued harold  come youd better stay and get work here  id sooner be at the ploughtail all day than poke out my eyes over stuff like that pointing to pauls slate covered with figures here nelly as she moved about tidying the room do you hear  mr copes got an offer of a place for paulfive pounds a year and board and lodging to be schoolmasters whipperin or what dye call it  what do you say harold cried ellen putting her hands on the back of a chair quite interested  you going away paul  mr cope says soand i must get my living you know said paul  but not yet you are not well enough yet said the kind girl  and where did you say  to berryton  berrytonoh thats just four miles out on the other side of elbury where susan congleton went to live that was housemaid at the grange  she says its such a nice place and such beautiful organ and singing at church  and what did you say you were to be paul  im to help the schoolmaster  gracious me cried ellen  why such a scholar as you are youll be quite a gentleman yet paul  why they schoolmasters get fifty or sixty pounds salaries sometimes  i protest its the best thing ive heard this long time  was it mr copes doing or my ladys  mr copes said paul beginning to think he had been rather less grateful than he ought  ah it is like him said ellen after all the pains he has taken with you  and youll not be so far off paul youll come to see us in the holidays you know  to be sure he will said harold or if he dont i shall go and fetch him  of course he will said ellen with her hand on pauls chair and speaking low and affectionately to console him as she saw him so downcast dont you know how poor alfy says hes come to be instead of a son to mother and a brother to us  i must go up and tell alf and mother  theyll be so pleased  paul felt very differently about the plan now  all the house congratulated him upon it and matilda evidently thought more of him now that she found he was to have something to do  but such things as these were out of sight beside that which was going on in the room above  alfred slept better that night and woke so much revived that they thought him better and harold greatly comforted about him stood tolerably quietly by his side listening to one or two things that alfred had longed for months past to say to him  promise me harold dear that youll be a good son to mother youll be the only one now  harold made a bend of his head like a promise  o harold be good to her went on alfred earnestly shes had so much trouble  i do hope god will leave you to herif you are steady and good  do harold  shes not like some as dont care what their lads get to  and dont take after me and be idle  be rightdown good harold as paul is and when you come to be illoh it wont be so bad for you as it was for me  i do want to be good sighed harold  if id only been confirmed but twas all along of them merries last summer  and i was such a plague to youi drove you out said alfred  no no i was a brute to you  oh alfy alfy if i could only get back the time  he was getting to the sobs that hurt his brother and his sister was going to interfere but alfred said  never mind harold dear weve been very happy together and well always love each other  youll not forget alf and youll be mothers good son to take care of her  wont you  so harold gave that promise and went away with his tears  poor fellow now was his punishment for having slighted the confirmation  like esau an exceeding bitter cry could not bring back what he had lightly thrown away  well was it for him that this great sorrow came in time and that it was not altogether his birthright that he had parted with  he found he could not go out to his potatoplanting and forget all about it as he would have liked to have donesomething would not let him and there he was sitting crouched up and sorrowful on the steps of the stairs when mr cope and all the rest were gathered in alfreds room a church for the time  matilda and ellen had set out the low table with the fair white cloth and mr cope brought the small cups and paten which were doubly precious to him for having belonged to his father and because the last time he had seen them used had been for his fathers last communion  now was the time to feel that a change had really passed over the young pastor in the time of his absence  before he could only lead alfred in his prayers and give him counsel tell him to hope in his repentance and on what that hope was founded  now that he had bent beneath the hand of the bishop he had received straight down from the twelve the power from on high  it was not mr cope but the lord who had purchased that pardon by his own most precious blood who by him now declared to alfred that the sins and errors of which he had so long repented were pardoned and taken away  the voice of authority now assured him of what he had been only told to hope and trust before  and to make the promise all the more close and certain here was the means of becoming a partaker of the sacrificehere was that bread and that cup which shew forth the lords death till he come  it was very great rest and peace the hush that was over the quiet room with only alfreds hurried breath to be heard beside mr copes voice as he spoke the blessed words and the low responses of the little congregation  paul was close beside alfredhe would have him there between his mother and the walland the two whose first communion it was were the last to whom mr cope came  to one it was to be the food for the passage into the unseen world to the other might it be the first partaking of the manna to support him through the wilderness of this life  from the highways and hedges here was one brought into the foretaste of the marriage supper  ah there was one outside who had loved idle pleasure when the summons had been sent to him  perhaps the misery he was feeling now might be the means of sparing him from missing other calls and being shut out at last  it seemed to fulfil all that alfred had wished  he lay still between waking and sleeping for a long time afterwards and then begged for paul to read to him the last chapters of the book of revelation  matilda wished to read them for him but he said paul please  pauls voice was fuller and softer when it was low his accent helped the sense and alfred was more used to them than to his visitor sister  perhaps there was still another reason for when paul came to the end and was turning the leaves for one of alfreds favourite bits he saw alfreds eyes on him as if he wanted to speak  it was to say brothers quite now paul thank you  i think god must have sent you to help me  alfred seemed better all the evening and they went to bed in good spirits but at midnight mr cope who was very deeply studying and praying the better to fit himself for his new office in the ministry was just going to shut his book and go up to bed when he heard a tremulous ring at the bell  it was harold his face looking very white in the light from mr copes candle  oh please sir he said alfred is worse and mother said if your light wasnt out youd like to know  i am very grateful to her said mr cope and taking up his plaid he wrapped one end round the boy and put his arm round him as he felt him quaking as paul had done before but not cryingtoo much awestruck for that  he said that his mother thought something had broken in the lungs and that he would be choked  mr cope made the more haste that he might judge if the doctor would be of any use  paul was sitting up in his bedthey had not let him get upbut his eyes were wide open with distress as he plainly heard the loud sob that each breath had become  mrs king was holding alfred up in her arms matilda was trying to chafe his feet ellen was kneeling with her face hidden  the light of sense and meaning was not gone from alfreds eyes though the last struggle had come  he gave a look as though he were glad to see mr cope and then gazed on his brother  mrs king signed to harold to come nearer and whispered kiss him  his sisters had done so and he had missed harold  then mr cope prayed and alfreds eyes at first owned the sounds but soon they were closed and the long struggling breaths were all that shewed that the spirit was still there  he shall swallow up death in victory and the lord god shall wipe away tears from all eyes  one moment and the blue eyes they knew so well were opened and smiling on his mother and then  it was over and through affliction and pain the young spirit had gone to rest  the funeral day was a very sore one to paul blackthorn  he would have given the world to be there and have heard the beautiful words of hope which received his friend to his restingplace but he could not get so far  he had tried to carry a message to a house not half so far off as the church but his knees seemed to give way under him and his legs ached so much that he could hardly get home  somehow a black suit just such as harolds had come home for him at the same time but this could not hinder him from feeling that he was but a stranger and one who had no real place in the home where he lived  there was the house full of people who would only make their remarks on himmiss hardman who was very critical of the coffinplate the schoolmaster and some of the upperservants of the houseand poor mrs king and matilda who could not help being gratified at the attention to their darling were obliged to go down and be civil to them while ellen less used to restraint was shut into her own room crying and harold was standing on the stairs very red but a good deal engaged with his long hatband  poor paul he had not even his usual refugehis own bed to lie upon and hide his facefor that had been taken away to make room for the coffin to be carried down  there they were going at last when it had seemed as if the bustle and confusion would never cease  there was alfred leaving the door where he had so often played carried upon the shoulders of six lads in white frocks his old schoolfellows and pauls confirmation friends  how paul envied them for doing him that last service  there was his mother always patient and composed holding harolds armharold who must be her stay and help but looking so slight so boyish and so young then the two girls ellen so overpowered with crying that her sister had to lead her mrs crabbe with betsey hardman who held up a great white handkerchief for other peoples visible grief always upset her as she said and besides she felt it a duty to cry at such a time and the rest two and two quite a train in their black suits how unlike the dreary pauper funerals paul had watched away at upperscote  that respectable look seemed to make him further off and more desolate like one cut off whom no one would follow no one would weep for  alfred who had called him a brother was gone and here he was alone  the others were taking their dear one once more to the church where they had so often prayed that he might have a happy issue out of all his afflictions  they were met by mr cope ending his loving intercourse with alfred by reading out the blessed promise of resurrectionthe assurance that the body they were sowing in weakness would be raised in power so that the noble boy whom they had seen fade away like a drooping flower would rise again blossoming forth in glory after the image of the incorruptiblethat image thought mr cope as he read on which he faithfully strove to copy even through the sufferings due to the corruptible  his voice often shook and faltered  he had never before read that service and perhaps except for those of his own kin it could never be a greater effort to him going along with alfred as he had done holding up the rod and staff that bore him through the dark valley  and each trembling of his tone seemed to answer something that the mother was feeling in her peaceful hopeful thankful griefyes thankful that she could lay her once highspirited and thoughtless boy in his grave with the same sure and certain hope of a joyful resurrection as that ripe and earnestminded christian his father or his little innocent brother  it was peaceawful peace indeed but soothing even to ellen and harold new as they were to grief  but to poor paul at home out of hearing of the words of hope only listening to the melancholy toll of the knell and quite alone in the disarranged forlorn house there seemed nothing to take off the edge of misery  he was not wanted to keep alfred company now nor to read to himno one needed him no one cared for him  he wandered up to where alfred had lain so long as if to look for the pale quiet face that used to smile to him  there was nothing but the bedframe and mattress  he threw himself down on it and cried  he did not well know whyperhaps the chief feeling was that alfred was gone away to rest and bliss and he was left alone to be weary and without a friend  at last the crying began to spend itself and he turned and looked up there was alfreds little picture of the crucified still on the wall and the words under it for us  pauls eye fell on it and somehow it brought to mind what alfred had said to him on christmas day  there was one who had no home on earth there was one who had made himself an outcast and a wanderer and who had not where to lay his head  was not he touched with a fellowfeeling for the lonely boy  would he not help him to bear his friendless lot as a share of his own cross  nay had he not raised him up friends already in his utmost need  there is a friend who sticketh closer than a brother  he was the friend that paul need never lose and in whom he could still meet his dear alfred  these thoughts not quite formed but something like them came gently as balm to the poor boy and though they brought tears even thicker than the first burst of lonely sorrow they were as peaceful as those shed beside the grave  though paul was absent in the body this was a very different shutting out from harolds on last tuesday  paul must have cried himself to sleep for he did not hear the funeral party return and was first roused by mrs king coming upstairs  he had been so much used to think of this as alfreds room that he had never recollected that it was hers and now that she was come up for a moments breathingtime he started up ashamed and shocked at being so caught  but good motherly mrs king saw it all and how he had been weeping where her child had so long rested  indeed his face was swelled with crying and his voice all unsteady  poor lad poor lad she said kindly you were as fond of him as any of them and if we wanted anything else to make you one of us that would do it  o mother said paul as she kindly put her hand on him i could not bear iti was so losttill i looked at that pointing to the little print  ay said mrs king as she wiped her quiet tears that cross was alfreds great comfort and so it is to us all my boy whatever way we have to carry it till we come to where he is gone  no cross no crown they say  perhaps it was not bad for any one that this forlorn day had given paul a fresh chill which kept him in bed for nearly a week so as gently to break the change from her life of nursing to mrs king and make him very happy and peaceful in her care  and when at last on a warm sunny sunday paul blackthorn returned thanks in church for his recoveryay and for a great deal besideshe had no reason to think that he was a stranger cared for by no one     chapter xiiisix years later   it is a beautiful morning in easter week  the sun is shining on the gilded weathercock which flashes every time it veers from south to west the snowdrops are getting quite out of date and the buttercups and primroses have it all their own way the grass is making a start and getting quite long upon the graves in friarswood churchyard  really i should have sent in the saxon monarch to tidy us up says to himself the tall young rector as he stepped over the stile with one long stride but i suppose he is better engaged  that tall young rector is the reverend marcus cope six years older but young still  the poor old rector mr john selby died four years ago abroad and lady jane and miss selbys other guardians gave the living to mr cope to the great joy of all the parish except the shepherds who have never forgiven him for their own usage of their farming boy nor for the sermon he neither wrote nor preached  the saxon monarch means one harold king who looks after the rectory garden and horse as well as the postoffice and other small matters  the clerk is unlocking the church and shaking out the surplice and mr cope goes into the vestry takes out two big books covered with green parchment and sees to the pen  it is a very good one judging by the writing of the last names in that book  they are francis mowbray and jane arabella selby  captain and mrs mowbray will be a great blessing to the place if they go on as they have begun thinks mr cope  how happy they are making old lady jane and how much more mrs mowbray goes among the cottages now that she does more as she pleases  then mr cope goes to the porch and looks out  he sees two men getting over the stile  one is a small slight person in very good black clothes not at all as if they were meant to ape a gentleman and therefore thoroughly respectable  he has a thin face rather pointed as to the chin and nose and the eyes dark and keen so that it would be oversharp but that the mouth looks so gentle and subdued and the whole countenance is grave and thoughtful  you could not feel half so sure that he is a certificated schoolmaster as you can that his very brisk looking companion is so  good morning mr browngood morning paul said mr cope  i did not expect to see you arrive in this way  the grave face glitters up in a merry look of amusement while with a little colouring he answers  why sir matilda said it was the proper thing and so we supposed she knew best  there are not so many people who do talk of paul now  most people know him as mr blackthorn late schoolmaster at berryton where the boys liked him for his bright and gentle yet very firm ways the parents for getting their children on and helping them to be steady and the clergyman for being so perfectly to be trusted so anxious to do right and while efficient and well informed perfectly humble and free from conceit  now he has just got an appointment to hazleford school in another diocese with a salary of fifty pounds a year but as charles hayward would tell you he hasnt got one bit of pride no more than when he lived up in the hayloft  there is not long to wait  there is another party getting over the stile  there is a very fine tall youth first  as betsey hardman tells her mother she never saw such a one for being finegrowed and stately to look at since poor charles king when he wore his best wig  a very nice open honest face and as merry a pair of blue eyes as any in the parish does harold wear nearly enough to tell you that if in these six years it would be too much to say he has never done anything to vex his mother yet in the main his heart is in the right placehe is a very good son very tender to her and steady and rightminded  whom is he helping over the stile  oh that is mrs mowbrays pretty little maid a very good young thing whom she has read with and taught and here ladylike and delicatelooking as ever is matilda  bridemaids before the bride thats quite wrong but the bride has a shy fit and would not get over first and matilda and harold are the one encouraging her the other laughing at her and mr blackthorn turns very red and goes down the path to meet her and she takes his arm and harold takes lucy and mr brown miss king  very nice that bride looks with her hair so glossy under her straw bonnet trimmed with white her pretty white shawl and quiet purple silk dress her face rather flushed but quietlooking as if she were growing more like her mother with something of her sense and calmness  how mr blackthorn ever came to ask her that question nobody can guess and harold believes he does not know himself  however it got an answer two years ago and mrs king gave her consent with all her heart though she knew betsey hardman would talk of picking a husband up out of the gutter and that my lady would look severe and say something of silly girls  yesand though the rich widower bailiff had said sundry civil things of miss ellen being well brought up and notablefor as mrs king wrote to matilda i had rather see ellen married to a good religious man than to any one and i do not know one i can be so sure of as paul nor one that is so like a son to me and if he has no friends belonging to him that is better than bad friends  and ellen herself from looking on him as a mere boy as she had done at their first acquaintance had come to thinking no one ever had been so wise or so clever far less so good certainly not so fond of herso her answer was no great wonder  then they were to be prudent and wait for some dependence and so they did till mr shaw recommended paul blackthorn for hazleford school where there is a beautiful new house for the master so that he will have no longer to live in lodgings and be done for as the saying is  harold tells ellen that he is afraid that without her he wont wash above once in four months but however that may be she is convinced that the new schoolhouse will be lost on him and that in spite of all his fine arithmetic his fifty pounds will never go so far for one as for two and so she did not turn a deaf ear to his entreaties that she would not send him alone to hazleford  they wanted very much to get mother to come and live with them give up the postoffice and let harold live in mr copes house but mother has a certain notion that harolds stately looks and perfect health might not last if she were not always on the watch to put him into dry clothes if he comes in damp and such like little fidgets as he calls them which he would not attend to from any one but mother  so she will keep on the shop and the postoffice and try to break in that uncouth girl of john fardens to be a tidy little maid and mr and mrs blackthorn will spend their holidays with her and harold  she may come to them yet in time if as paul predicts master harold takes up with lucy at the grangebut theres time enough to think of that and even if he should it would take many years to make lucy into such a mrs king as she who is now very busy over the dinner at home but thinking about a good deal besides the dinner  there  paul and ellen have stood and knelt in an earnest reverent spirit making their vows to one another and before god and his blessing has been spoken upon them to keep them all their lives through  it is with a good heart of hope that mr cope speaks that blessing knowing that as far as human eye can judge here stands a man who truly feareth the lord and beside him a woman with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit  they are leaving the church now the bridegroom and his bride arm in arm but they turn from the path to the wicket and harold will not let even matilda follow them  just by the south wall of the church there are three graves one a very long one one quite short one of middle length the large one has a headstone with the names of charles king aged forty years and charles king aged seven years  the middlesized one has a stone cross and below it alfred king aged sixteen years and the words in all their afflictions he was afflicted  it was matilda who paid the cost of that stone miss selby who drew the pattern of it and mother who chose the words as what alfred himself loved best  at the bottom of ellens best workbox is a copy of verses about that very cross  she thinks they ought to have been carved out upon it but paul knows a great deal better so all she could do was to write them out on a sheet of notepaper with a wide lace border and keep them as her greatest treasure  perhaps she prizes them even more than the handsome watch that mr shaw gave paul though less of course than the great bible and prayerbook in which mr cope has waited till this morning to write the names of paul and ellen blackthorn  so they stand beside the cross and read the words and they neither of them can say anything though the white sweet face is before the eyes of their mind at the same time and ellen thinks she loves paul twice as much for having been one of his great comforts  goodbye alfred dear she whispers at last  no not goodbye says paul  he is as much with us as ever wherever we are  remember how we were together ellen  i have always thought of him at every holy communion since and have felt that if till now no one livingat least one at rest were mine by right  ellen pressed his arm  yes said paul the months i spent with alfred were the great help and blessing of my life  i dont believe any recollection has so assisted to guard me in all the frets and temptations there are in a life like mine
