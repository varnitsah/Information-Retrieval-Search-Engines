70901315	the eagle cliff by rm ballantyne   this is a truly delightful book by this prolific author  i know of no other of his books that leaves so many images in the mind so fresh after many a year  the scene starts with a young man cycling on his pennyfarthing towards london  on the way he has an accident knocking down an elderly lady but fleeing the scene when he sees a policeman coming  but when he gets home he finds a telegram informing him that his friends will be departing very soon in a yacht to visit the islands on the northwest of britain so he joins them  unfortunately there is a fog and the yacht is damaged but all the young men and their crew manage to get ashore finding themselves in the neighbourhood of a large house the residence of a gentleman and his family  they are invited to stay there as his guests and it is at this point that the adventures begin involving fishing shooting birdwatching sailing and so forth  there is a charming young lady also staying in the house and deploying her hobby of painting  our hero falls in love with her but is very much taken aback when she is joined by her mother who turns out to be none other than the elderly lady he had knocked down back in london  even more disastrous was the fire that destroyed the house  this is a brilliant book and you will love it  as a footnote you may be surprised that one of the children is called junkie  this certainly does not mean that same as it does today instead it is a nickname given to a favourite boychild and you will find several examples of this in ballantynes books   the eagle cliff by rm ballantyne    chapter one  begins the talenaturally  from the earliest records of history we learn that man has ever been envious of the birds and of all other winged creatures  he has longed and striven to fly  he has also signally failed to do so  we say failed advisedly because his various attempts in that direction have usually resulted in disappointment and broken bones  as to balloons we do not admit that they fly any more than do ships balloons merely float and glide when not otherwise engaged in tumbling collapsing and bursting  this being so we draw attention to the fact that the nearest approach we have yet made to the sensation of flying is that achieved by rushing down a long smooth steep hillroad on a welloiled and perfect ballbearings bicycle  skating cannot compare with this for that requires exertion bicycling down hill requires none  hunting cannot no matter how splendid the mount for that implies a certain element of bumping which however pleasant in itself is not suggestive of the smooth swift act of flying  we introduce this subject merely because thoughts somewhat similar to those which we have so inadequately expressed were burning in the brain of a handsome and joyful young man one summer morning not long ago as with legs over the handles he flashedif he did not actually flydown one of our middlesex hills on his way to london  urgent haste was in every look and motion of that young mans fine eyes and lithe body  he would have bought wings at any price had that been possible but none being yet in the market he made the most of his wheela fiftyeight inch one by the way for the young mans legs were long as well as strong  arrived at the bottom of the hill the hilarious youth put his feet to the treadles and drove the machine vigorously up the opposite slope it was steep but he was powerful  he breathed hard no doubt but he never flagged until he gained the next summit  a shout burst from his lips as he rolled along the level top for there about ten miles off lay the great city glittering in the sunshine and with only an ambertinted canopy of its usual smoke above it  among the tall elms and in the flowering hedgerows between which he swept innumerable birds warbled or twittered their astonishment that he could fly with such heedless rapidity through that beautiful country and make for the dismal town in such magnificent weather  one aspiring lark overhead seemed to repeat with persistent intensity its trill of self gratulation that it had not been born a man  even the cattle appeared to regard the youth as a sort of ornithological curiosity for the sentiment well you are a goose was clearly written on their mild faces as he flew past them  over the hilltop he wenttwelve miles an hour at the leastuntil he reached the slope on the other side then down he rushed again driving at the first part of the descent like an insane steamengine till the pace must have increased to twenty miles at which point the whirl of the wheel becoming too rapid he was obliged once more to rest his legs on the handles and take to repose contemplation and wiping his heated browequivalent this we might say to the floating descent of the seamew  of course the period of rest was of brief duration for although the hill was a long slope with many a glimpse of loveliness between the trees the time occupied in its flight was short and at the bottom a rustic bridge with an old inn and a thatched hamlet with an awkwardly sharp turn in the road beyond it called for wary and intelligent guidance of this lightning express  swiftly but safely to the foot of the hill went john barret that was the youths name at everincreasing speed and without check for no one seemed to be moving about in the quiet hamlet and the old english inn had apparently fallen asleep  a delicious undulating swoop at the bottom indicates the crossing of the bridge  a flash and the inn is in rear  the hamlet displays no sign of life nevertheless barret is cautious  he lays a finger on the brake and touches the bell  he is halfway through the hamlet and all goes well still no sign of life exceptyes this socalled proof of every rule is always forthcoming except that there is the sudden appearance of one stately cock  this is followed immediately by its sudden and unstately disappearance  a kitten also emerges from somewhere glares arches fuffs becomes indescribable andis not  two or three children turn up and gape but do not recover in time to insult or to increase the dangers of the awkward turn in the road which is now at hand  barret looks thoughtful  must the pace be checked here  the road is open and visible  it is bordered by grass banks and ditches on either side  he rushes close to the left bank and careering gracefully to the right like an algerine felucca in a white squall dares the laws of gravitation and centrifugal force to the utmost limitation and describes a magnificent segment of a great circle  almost before you can wink he is straight again and pegging along with irresistible pertinacity  just beyond the hamlet a suburban lady is encountered with clasped hands and beseeching eyes for a loose hairy bundle animated by the spirit of a dog stands in the middle of the road bidding defiance to the entire universe  the hairy bundle loses its head all at once likewise its heart it has not spirit left even to get out of the way a momentary lean of the bicycle first to the left and then to the right describes what artists call the line of beauty in a bight of which the bundle remains behind crushed in spirit but unhurt in body  at the bottom of the next hill a small roadside inn greets our cyclist that which cocks kittens dangers and dogs could not effect the inn accomplishes  he slows  in front of the door he describes an airy circlet dismounting while yet in motion leans the lightning express against the wall and enters  what does that vigorous handsome powerful fellow in the flush of early manhood drink  ay truly he does  glass of bitter sir asks the exuberant landlord  ginger says the young man pointing significantly to a bit of blue ribbon in his buttonhole  come far today sir asks the host as he pours out the liquid  fifty milesrather more says barret setting down the glass  fine weather sir for bicycling says the landlord sweeping in the coppers  very goodday  before that cheery goodday had ceased to affect the publicans brain barret was again spinning along the road to london  it was the road on which the mail coaches of former days used to whirl to the merry music of bugle wheel and whip along which so many men and women had plodded in days gone by in search of fame and fortune and happiness some to find these in a greater or less degree with much of the tinsel rubbed off others to find none of them but instead thereof wreck and ruin in the mighty human whirlpool and not a few to discover the fact that happiness does not depend either on fortune or fame but on spiritual harmony with god in jesus christ  pedestrians there still were on that road bound for the same goal and doubtless with similar aims but mail and other coaches had been driven from the scene  barret had the broad road pretty much to himself  quickly he ran into the suburban districts and here his urgent haste had to be restrained a little  what if i am too late he thought and almost involuntarily put on a spurt  soon he entered the crowded thoroughfares and was compelled to curb both steed and spirit  passing through one of the lessfrequented streets in the neighbourhood of finchley road he ventured to give the rein to his willing charger  but here fortune ceased to smileand fortune was to be commended for her severity  barret although kind courteous manly sensitive and reasonably careful was not just what he ought to have been  although a hero he was not perfect  he committed the unpardonable sin of turning a street corner sharply  a thin little old lady crossed the road at the same identical moment slowly  they met  who can describe that meeting not the writer for he did not see it mores the pity  very few people saw it for it was a quiet corner  the parties concerned cannot be said to have seen though they felt it  both went down  it was awful really to see a feeble old lady struggling with an athlete and a bicycle  two little street boys and a ragged girl appeared as if by magic  they always do  oh  i say  aint he bin and squashed er  such was the remark of one of the boys  pancakes is plump to er was the observation of the other  the ragged girl said nothing but looked unspeakable things  burning with shame trembling with anxiety covered with dust and considerably bruised barret sprang up left his fallen steed and raising the little old lady with great tenderness in his arms sat her on the pavement with her back against the railings while he poured out abject apologies and earnest inquiries  strange to say the old lady was not hurt in the leastonly a good deal shaken and very indignant  stranger still a policeman suddenly appeared in the distance  at the same time a sweep a postman and a servant girl joined the group  young barret as we have said was sensitive  to become the object and centre of a crowd in such circumstances was overwhelming  a climax was put to his confusion when one of the street arabs observing the policeman suddenly exclaimed  oh  i say eres a bobby  what a lark  wont you be ad up before the beaks  itll be a case o murder  no it wont retorted the other boy itll be a case o manslaughter an attempted suicide jined  barret started up allowing the servant maid to take his place and saw the approaching constable  visions of detention publicity trial conviction condemnation swam before him  a reglar krismas pantymime for nuffin remarked the ragged girl breaking silence for the first time  scarcely knowing what he did barret leaped towards his bicycle set it up vaulted into the saddle as he well knew how and was safely out of sight in a few seconds  yet not altogether safe  a guilty conscience pursued overtook and sat upon him  shame and confusion overwhelmed him  up to that date he had been honourable upright straightforward as far as the worlds estimation went irreproachable  now in his own estimation he was mean false underhand sneaking  but he did not give way to despair  he was a true hero else we would not have had anything to write about him  suddenly he slowed frowned compressed his lips described a complete circlein spite of a furniture van that came in his wayand deliberately went back to the spot where the accident had occurred but there was no little lady to be seen  she had been conveyed away the policeman was gone the little boys were gone the ragged girl sweep postman and servant maidall were gone like the baseless fabric of a vision leaving only new faces and strangers behind to wonder what accident and thin old lady the excited youth was asking aboutso evanescent are the incidents that occur and so busily preoccupied are the human torrents that rush in the streets of london  the youth turned sadly from the spot and continued his journey at a slower pace  as he went along the thought that the old lady might have received internal injuries and would die pressed heavily upon him thus he might actually be a murderer at the best a manslaughterer without knowing it and would carry in his bosom a dreadful secret and a terrible uncertainty to the end of his life  of course he could go to that great focus of police energyscotland yardand give himself up but on second thoughts he did not quite see his way to that  however he would watch the daily papers closely that evening in a frame of mind very different from the mental condition in which he had set out on his sixty miles ride in the afternoon john barret presented himself to his friend and old schoolfellow bob mabberly  youre a good fellow barret i knew you would come but you look warm have you been running asked mabberly opening the door of his lodging to his friend  come in i have news for you  giles jackman has agreed to go  isnt that a comfort for besides his rare and valuable sporting qualities he is more than half a doctor which will be important you know if any of us should get ill or come to grief  sit down and well talk it over  now it was a telegram from bob mabberly which led john barret to suddenly undertake a sixty miles ride that day and which was thus the indirect cause of the little old lady being run down  the telegram ran as follows  come instanter  as you are  clothes unimportant  yacht engaged crew also  sail without fail thursday  plenty more to say when we meet  now you see bob with your usual want of precision or care or some such quality  stop barret  do be more precise in the use of language  how can the want of a thing be a quality  you are right bob  let me say then that with your usual unprecision and carelessness you sent me a telegram which could not reach me till late on wednesday night after all trains were gone telling me that you sail without fail on thursday but leaving me to guess whether you meant thursday morning or evening  how stupid  my dear fellow i forgot that  just so  well to make sure of losing no time instead of coming here by trains which as you know are very awkward and slow in our neighbourhood besides necessitating long waits and several changes i just packed my portmanteau gun rods etcetera and gave directions to have them forwarded here by the first morning train then took a few winks of sleep and at the first glimmer of daylight mounted my wheel and set off across country as straight as country roads would permit ofandhere i am  true barret and in good time for tea too  we dont sail till morning for the tide does not serve till six oclock so that will give us plenty of time to put the finishing touches to our plans allow your things to arrive and permit of our makingor rather renewingour acquaintance with giles jackman  you remember him dont you  yes faintly  he was a broad sturdy goodhumoured reckless little boy when i last saw him at old blatherbys school  just so  your portrait is correct  i saw him last month after a good many years interval and he is exactly what he was but considerably exaggerated at every point  he is not indeed a little but a middle sized man now as goodhumoured as ever much more reckless sturdier and broader a great deal with an amount of hair about his lip chin and head generally that would suffice to fit out three or four average men  he has been in indiain the woods and forests department or something of that sortand has killed tigers elephants and suchlike by the hundred they say but ive met him only once or twice and he dont speak much about his own doings  he is home on sickleave just now  sickleave  will he be fit to go with us asked barret doubtfully  fit cried mabberly  ay much more fit than you are strong and vigorous though you be for the voyage home has not only cured him it has added superabundant health  voyages always do to sick angloindians dont you know  however ill a man may be in india all he has to do is to obtain leave of absence and get on board of a ship homeward bound and straightway health rushing in upon him like a river sends him home more than cured  so now our party is made up yacht victualled anchor tripped andalls well that ends well  but all is not ended bob  things have only begun and as regards myself they have begun disastrously said barret who thereupon related the incident of the little old lady being run down  my dear fellow cried mabberly laughing excuse me dont imagine me indifferent to the sufferings of the poor old thing but do you really suppose that one who was tough enough after such a collision to sit up at all with or without the support of the railings and give way to indignant abuse  not abuse bob indignant looks and sentiments she was too thorough a lady to think of abuse  well well call it what you please but you may depend upon it that she is not much hurt and you will hear nothing more about the matter  thats it  thats the very thing that i dread returned barret anxiously  to go through life with the possibility that i may be an uncondemned and unhung murderer is terrible to think of  then i cant get over the meanness of my running away so suddenly  if any one had said i was capable of such conduct i should have laughed at him  yet have i lived to do itcontemptiblyin cold blood  contemptibly it may have been but not in cold blood for did you not say you were roused to a state of frenzied alarm at the sight of the bobby and assuredly although unhung as yet you are not uncondemned if selfcondemnation counts for anything  come dont take such a desponding view of the matter  we shall see the whole affair in the morning papers before sailing with a report of the old ladys name and conditioni mean condition of healthas well as your unmanly flight without leaving your card so youll be able to start with an easyha a cab yes its jackman  i know his manservant said mabberly as he looked out at the window  another moment and a broadchested man of about fiveandtwenty with a bronzed faceas far as hair left it visiblea pair of merry blue eyes and a hearty manner was grasping his old schoolfellows by the hand and endeavouring to trace the likeness in john barret to the quiet little boy whom he used to help with his tasks many years before  man who would have thought you could have grown into such a great longlegged fellow he said stepping back to take a more perfect look at his friend who returned the compliment by asking who could have imagined that he would have turned into a zambezian gorilla  wherell i put it sor demanded a voice of metallic bassness in the doorway  down thereanywhere quin said jackman turning quickly and be off as fast as you can to see after that rifle and cartridges  yes sor returned the owner of the bass voice putting down a small portmanteau straightening himself touching his forehead with a military salute and stalking away solemnly  i say giles its not often one comes across a zoological specimen like that  where did you pick him up asked mabberly  in the woods and forests of course said jackman where i have picked up everything of latefrom salary to jungle fevers  hes an old soldieralso on sickleave though he does not look like it  he came originally from the west of ireland i believe but theres little of the irishman left save the brogue and the honesty  hes a firstrate servant if you know how to humour him and being a splendid cook we shall find him useful  i hope so said mabberly with a dubious look  why bob do you suppose i would have offered him as cook and steward if i had not felt sure of him  of course not and i would not have accepted him if i had not felt sure of you giles my boy so come along and lets have something to eat  but you have not yet told me bob said jackman while the three friends were discussing their meal what part of the world you intend to visit  does your father give you leave to go wherever you please and stay as long as you choose  no he limits me to the western isles  thats an indefinite limitation  dyou mean the isles of the western pacific  no only those of the west of scotland  and to tell you the truth i have no settled or definite plan  having got leave to use the yacht all the summer on condition that i dont leave our own shores i have resolved to begin by running at once to the wildest and farthest away part of the kingdom leaving circumstances to settle the rest  a circumstantial account of the matter no doubt yet rather vague have you a good crew  yes two men and a boy one of the men being skipper and the nearest approach to a human machine you ever saw  he is a highlander a thorough seaman hard as mahogany and about as dark stiff as a poker selfcontained silent except when spoken to and absolutely obedient  and we set sail tomorrow early asked barret  yes after seeing the morning papers said mabberly with a laugh  this of course turned the conversation on the accident much to the distress of barret who feared that the jovial offhand reckless man from the woods and forests would laugh at and quiz him more severely than his friend bob  to his surprise and great satisfaction however he found that his fears were groundless for jackman listened to the account of the incident quite gravely betrayed not the slightest tendency to laugh or even smile asked a good many questions in an interested tone spoke encouragingly as to the probable result and altogether showed himself to be a man of strong sympathy as well as high spirits  next morning found our three adventurers dropping down the thames with the first of the ebb tide and a slight breeze from the southwest mabberly and jackman in the very small cabin looking after stores guns rods etcetera barret anxiously scanning the columns of a newspaper quin and the skipper making each others acquaintance with much of the suspicion observable in two bulldogs who meet accidentally the boy in the fore part of the vessel coiling ropes and the remainder of the crew at the helm  port port stiddy growled the skipper  port it is steady replied the steersman in a singsong professional tone as a huge steamer from the antipodes went slowly past like a mighty leviathan of the deep  is it to the north south east or west were bound for captain asked quin with a voice like that of a conciliatory bassoon  i dont know where were bound for growled the skipper slowly starboard a bit stiddy  steady sang out the man at the tiller  a few hours carried them into the german ocean  here quin thought he would try again for a little information  sure its noreast were steerin captain he remarked in a casual way  no its not growled the skipper very much through his nose shes headin west  its to somewhere that coorse will take us in the ind no doubt if we carry on suggested quin interrogatively  ay oot to sea replied the skipper  quin was obliged to give it up for the time being  for some time they were nearly becalmed then as the land dropped astern and the shades of night deepened the wind fell altogether and when the stars came out a profound calm prevailed over the gently undulating sea  the exuberant spirits of our three friends were subdued by the sweet influences around and as the hour for rest drew near the conversation which at first became fitful dropped at last to silence  this was broken at length by jackman saying to the surprise of his companions what dyou say to reading a chapter before turning in  im fond of striking whats called a keynote  if we begin this pleasuretrip with an acknowledgment of our dependence on god we shall probably have a really pleasant time of it  what say you  both mabberly and barret gladly agreed to their friends proposalfor both had been trained in godfearing familiesthough neither would have had the courage to make the proposal himself  the crew were invited to join and thus family worship was established on board the fairy from the first day  only one point is worthy of note in connection with thisalthough no one noted it particularly at the time namely that the portion of scripture undesignedly selected contained that oftquoted verse ye know not what a day may bring forth  the truth of this was very soon thrust home upon them by stern experience    chapter two  the voyage auspiciously begun and promptly ended  a voyage up the east coast of great britain and through the pentland firth does not usually take a long time  when the vessel is a swift little schooneryacht and the breeze is stiff as well as fair the voyage is naturally a brief one  everything favoured the little fairy  sun moon and stars cheered her and winds were propitious so that our voyagers soon found themselves skimming over the billows of the western sea  it was one part of mabberlys plan that he and his friends should do duty as part of the crew  he was himself accustomed to the handling of yachts and barret he knew had been familiar with the management of boats from childhood  you can steer of course he had asked giles jackman almost as soon as they were fairly at sea  well yees oh yes  no doubt i could steer if i were to try  have you never tried asked his friend in surprise  oh yes i have triedonce  it was on an occasion when a number of us had gone on a picnic  we had to proceed part of the way to our destination by river in a small boat which was managed by a regular old seadogi forget his name for we generally hailed him by the title of old salt  some of the impatient members of the party suggested a little preliminary lunch  there are always people ready to back up impatient suggestions  it was agreed to and old salt was ordered to open the provision basket which had been stowed away in the bows of the boat would you steer sir said old salt to me as he rose to go forward certainly with pleasure said i for as you know its an old weakness of mine to be obliging  well in a few minutes they were all eating away as if theyd had no breakfast while we went merrily down the river with the current and a light breeze in our favour  suddenly old salt shouted something that was smothered in its passage through a bite of sandwich  i looked up and saw a native canoe coming straight towards us  port roared old salt in an explosion that cleared away half the sandwich  no thankee i prefer sherry said i but i stopped there for i saw intuitively from the yell with which he interrupted me that something was wrong  hard aport he cried jumping up and scattering his rations  i shoved the tiller hard to the side that suggested itself and hoped for the best  the worst followed for we struck the native canoe amidships as it was steering wildly out of our way and capsized it  there were only two men in it and they could swim like ducks but the river was full of alligators and two sharpset ones were on the scent instantly  it is my opinion that those two natives would then and there have been devoured if we had not run in between and made such a splashing and hullaballoo with boathook oars and voices that the monsters were scared away  i have never steered since that day  i dont wonder and with my consent you shall not steer now said mabberly laughing  why giles i was under the impression that you understood everything and could do almost anything  quite a mistake bob founded in error or superstition  you have confused the will with the deed  i am indeed willing to try anything but my capacity for action is limited like my knowledge  in regard to the higher mathematics for instance i know nothing  coppermining i do not understand  i may say the same with reference to tartar mythology and as regards the management of infants under two years i am densely ignorant  but do you really know nothing at all about boats and ships giles asked barret who being a good listener did not always shine as a speaker  how can you ask such a question  of course i know a great deal about them  they float they sail and row they steer  rather badly sometimes according to your own showing remarked barret  having cleared the pentland firth mabberly consulted the skipper one morning as to the prospects of the weather  going to fall calm i fear he said as mcpherson came aft with his hands in his pilotcoat pockets  ay sir that iss true whatever  to pronounce the last word correctly the central e must be run into a longdrawn not an interjectional sound  moreover continued the skipper in his drawling nasal tone its goin to be thick  being a weatherwise man the skipper proved to be right  it did come thick then it cleared and as we have said things became favourable until they got further out to sea  then a fancy took possession of mabberlynamely to have a spin out into the atlantic and see how it looked  it mattered not to jackman or barret what they did or where they went the first being exuberantly joyous the other quietly happy so they had their run out to sea but twentyfour hours of it sufficed it became monotonous  i think wed better go back now suggested mabberly  agreed said his companions  iss it goin back youll be asked the skipper  yes  dont you think we may as well turn now said mabberly who made it a point always if possible to carry the approbation of the skipper with him  i think it wass petter if we had niver come oot  why so captain  because its comin on to plow  putt her roond shames  james mcgregor to whom the order was given and who was the other man of the crew obeyed  the yacht which had latterly been beating against a headwind now ran gaily before it towards the scottish coast but when night closed in no outlying islands were visible  we wull hev to keep a sharp lookoot shames remarked the skipper as he stopped in his monotonous perambulation of the deck to glance at the compass  oo ay responded mcgregor with the air of a man who knew that as well as his superior  what do you fear asked mabberly coming on deck at the moment to take a look at the night before turning in  i fear naething sir replied mcpherson gravely  i mean what danger threatens us  none that i ken o but were makin the land an it behooves us to ca canny  it may be well to remark here that the skipper having voyaged much on all parts of the scottish coast had adopted and mixed up with his own peculiar english several phrases and words in use among the lowland scots  next morning when mabberly again visited the deck he found the skipper standing on the same spot where he had left him apparently in the same attitude and with the same grave sleepless expression on his castiron features  the boy robin tips was at the helm looking very sleepy he was an english boy smart active and wideawakein the slang sensein which sense also we may add that he was cheeky  but neither the skipper nor tips was very visible at the distance of three yards owing to a dense fog which prevailed  it was one of those white luminous dry fogs which are not at all depressing to the spirits though obstructive to the eyes and which are generally if not always accompanied by profound calm  has it been like this long asked mabberly after the first salutations  ay sir a coot while  and have we made no progress during the night  oo ay a coot bit  we should nae be far off some o the islands noo but its hard to say wi naither sun moon nor stars veesible to let us fin oot where we are  jackman and barret came on deck at the moment closely followed by quin who quietly ignoring the owner of the yacht went up to his master and said  tays riddy sor  breakfast you mean said mabberly with a smile  sure i wouldnt conterdickye sor av ye was to call it supperbut it was tay that i put in the pot  at breakfast the conversation somehow turned upon boatsships boats and their construction  it is quite disgraceful said jackman the way in which government neglects that matter of boats  some things we know will never be generally adopted unless men are compelled to adopt them  another biscuit barret  instance something giles said mabberly and pass the butter  i hate to hear sweeping assertions of an indefinite nature which no one can either corroborate or confute  well there is the matter of lowering boats into the water from a ships davits  now ill be bound that the apparatus for lowering your little punt astern is the ordinary couple of blocksone at the stem the other at the stern  of course it is  what then  why then dont you know what would happen if you were lowering that boat full of people in a rough sea and the man at the bow failed to unhook his block at the exact same moment as the man at the stern  yes i know too well giles for i have seen it happen  the boat on the occasion i refer to was hung up by one of the blocks all the people were dropped into the water and several of the women and children drowned  but how is government to remedy that  thus bob thus  there is a splendid apparatus invented by somebody which holds fast the two blocks  by means of an iron lever worked by one man the rod is disengaged from both blocks at the same instant you cannot work it wrong if you tried to do so  now the government has only to compel the adoption of that apparatus in the royal and merchant navies and the thing is done  then again continued jackman devouring food more ravenously in proportion as he warmed with his subject look at the matter of rafts how constantly it happens that boats get swamped and lost while being launched in cases of shipwreck at sea and there is nothing left for the crews and passengers after the few remaining boats are filled save loose spars or a hastily and illmade raft for of course things cannot be well planned and constructed in the midst of panic and sudden emergency  now it has been suggested if not actually carried out that mattresses should be made of cork with bands and straps to facilitate buckling them together and that a ships chairs tables campstools etcetera should be so constructed as to be convertible into rafts which might be the means of saving hundreds of lives that would under present arrangements inevitably be lost  why i ask does not government see to this have a special committee appointed to investigate find out the best plan and compel its adoption  men will never do this  they are too obstinate  whats wanted is that our ladies should take it up and howl with indignation till it is done  my dear giles ladies never howl said barret quietly tapping the end of an egg they smile and gently insinuatethat is always sufficient because irresistible  well being a bachelor i cannot say much on that point returned jackman  but i was not aware that you were married  neither am i but i have a mother and sisters aunts and cousins and i know their ways  if such are their ways i must get you to introduce me to them said the woodsandforester  come on deck now and i will give you a practical illustration of what might be done  jackman being an enthusiast always went at things with a will  bring me a hencoop quin he said to the steward who having so far completed his morning work and consumed his morning meal was smoking his pipe seated on the rail beside tips  tips was an admirer of the irishman and in consequence an imitator as far as he dared and was permitted  lend a hand ye spalpeen said quin going forward and quickly returning with the coop from which a cackling of strong remonstrance issued  will ye have the other wan too sor  yes and the mainhatch besides and a lot of spunyarn  of course thats not strong enough for real service but it will do for illustration  in a few minutes the two hencoops were placed face to face and lashed firmly together despite the remonstrative poultry  then the mainhatch was laid upon the top and fixed there by means of the iron rings at its four corners  now quin fetch four of the cabin chairs said the operator and observe gentlemen how much more easily and quickly this would have been accomplished if the coops and hatch and chairs had been made to fit into each other with a view to this very purpose with strong straps and buckles in handy positions  now then for the chairs  at each corner of this extemporised raft jackman fastened one of the cabin chairs pointing out as he did so that there was no limit to the extension of the raft  you see he continued all you would have to do if the ship were properly fitted out would be to add chair to chair bench to bench cork mattress to mattress until your raft was as big as you wanted or you could make two or three rafts if preferable  but sure sor it would be an unstiddy machine intirely an given to wobblin said quin who was one of those privileged men who not only work for their wages but generously throw their opinions into the bargain  it would not be more unsteady than the waves quin and as to wobbling that would be an advantage for a rigid raft in a rough sea would be more liable to be damaged than one that was pliable  the discussion about rafts and ships boats which thus began was continued with much interest till lunchtime for it chanced that john barret was one of those men whose tendency of heart and mind is to turn everything to its best uses and generally to strive after the highest point of perfection in everything with a view to the advancement of human felicity  this tendency called into exercise his inventive faculties inducing him to search after improvements of all descriptions  thus it was natural that he and jackman should enter into a keen controversy as to what was the best method of constructing the raft in detail and that when the faithful quin announced lunch as being riddy sor the lifesaving machine was left in an incomplete state on the deck  the interest attaching to this discussion had helped the three comrades and crew alike to tide over what might otherwise have proved a tedious forenoon for during the whole of that day the dense fog and profound calm continued  on returning to the deck the discussion was continued for a time but gradually the interest flagged then other subjects engaged attention and the raft was finally allowed to lie undisturbed and forgotten  i dont know how it is said bob mabberly but somehow i always feel a depression of spirits in a fog at sea  explanation simple enough returned jackman are we not constantly reading in the papers of ships being run down in fogs  where there is risk there is always in some minds anxietyin your case you call it depression of spirits  your explanation giles uncomplimentary to me though it be might have some force if we were just now in the channel where being run down in fog is an event of frequent occurrence but here in a comparatively unfrequented sea it would be strange indeed were i to be influenced by such possibilities  what say you captain  mcpherson who had sauntered towards the group gazed in the direction where the horizon would have been visible had the fog been absent and said  hmweel and then stopped as if for the purpose of mature consideration  the audience waited for the announcement of the oracles opinion  oo ayweel ye see many persons are strangely influenced by possibeelities whatever  there is a maiden aunt o my ownshe wass niver marrit an she wass niver likely to be for besides bein poor an plain an mittleaged which are not in my opeenion objectionable she had an uncommon bad temper  yet she wass all her life influenced by the notion that half the young men o the place wass wantin to marry her though the possibeelities in her case wass fery small  i should like to ave knowd that old gurl whispered tips to quin  howld your tongue ye spalpeen whispered his friend in reply  have you any idea captain where we are now asked jackman  oo ay were somewheres wastard o the lewis  but whether wast norwast or soothwast i could not say preceesely  the nicht ye see wass uncommon dark an when the fog came doon i the mornin i could na feel sure we had keep it the richt coorse for the currents hereaboots are strang  but well see whan it comes clear  do you believe in presentiments giles asked barret in an unusually grave tone  of course i do answered jackman  i have a presentiment just now that you are going to talk nonsense  barret was not however to be silenced by his friends jest  listen he said earnestly as he rose and stood in an attitude of intense attention  it may be imagination playing with the subjects of our recent conversation but i cannot help thinking that i hear the beating of paddles  keep a sherp lookoot shames cried the skipper suddenly as he went forward with unwonted alacrity  a few minutes more and the sound which had at first been distinguished only by barrets sharp ear became audible to allthe soft regular patting of a paddlewheel steamer in the distance yet clearly coming towards them  presently a shrill sound very faint but prolonged was heard showing that she was blowing her steamwhistle as a precaution  strange is it not that the very thing we have been talking about should happen said mabberly  nay returned jackman lightly we were talking about being run down and we have not yet come to that  the strangest thing of all to me said barret is that with a wide ocean all round vessels should ever run into each other at all at least on the open sea for there is only one line a few feet wide in favour of such an accident whereas there are thousands of miles against it  jackman who was a great theorist here propounded a reason for this  if vessels would only hold straight on their courses you see he said the accident of collision would be exceedingly rare for although thousands of ships might pass near to each other not one in ten thousand would meet but when vessels come pretty near their commanders sometimes become anxious take fancies into their heads as to each having forgotten the rules of the road and each attempting to correct the otheras we do sometimes in the streetsthey bring about the very disaster they are trying to avoid  had we not better ring the bell captain cried mabberly in rising excitement  oo ay if you think so sir  ring poy  the boy who was getting alarmed seized the tongue of the ships bell and rang with all his might  whether this had the effect to which jackman had referred we cannot tell but next moment what appeared to be a mountain loomed out of the mist  the steamwhistle had been silent for some time but as soon as the bell was heard it burst forth with increased fury  from the instant her form was dimly seen the fate of the yacht was sealed  there was a wild shouting on board the steamer but there was no time for action  starboard hard was the cry  starboard it is was the immediate answer  but before the helm could act the great rushing mass struck the fairy amidships and literally cut her in two  the awful suddenness of a catastrophe which those on board had just been arguing was all but impossible seemed to have paralysed every one for no one made the slightest effort to escape  perhaps the appearance of the walllike bow of the steamer without rope or projection of any kind to lay hold of or jump at might have conveyed the swift perception that their case was hopeless  at all events they all went under with the doomed yacht and nothing was left in the wake of the leviathan but a track of foam on the mistencumbered sea  but they were not lost  one after another the wrecked party rose struggling to the surface and all of them could swim except the boy  giles jackman was the first who rose  treading water and brushing the hair out of his eyes he gazed wildly about  barret came up close beside him almost a moment later  he had barely taken breath when the others rose at various distances  a cry not far from him caused him to turn  it was poor robin tips struggling for life  a few powerful strokes carried barret alongside  he got behind the boy caught him under the armpits and thus held him at arms length until he could quiet him  there is a spar thank god  make for it barret while i see to quin shouted jackman  as he spoke they could hear the whistle of the steamer rushing away from them  barret forcing himself breasthigh out of the water glanced quickly round and caught sight of the floating spar to which his companion had referred  although only a few yards off the fog rendered it almost invisible  are you quiet now demanded barret in a stern voice for the terrified boy still showed something like a hysterical determination to turn violently round and grasp his rescuer in what would probably have turned out to be the grip of death  yes sir oh yes  but ddont let me go  mmind i cant swim  you are perfectly safe if you simply do nothing but what i tell you returned barret in a quiet ordinary tone of voice that reassured the poor lad more than the words  by way of reply he suddenly became motionless and as limp as a dead eel  getting gradually on his back and drawing tips slowly on to his chest so that he rested with his mouth upwards and his head entirely out of the water barret struck out for the spar swimming thus on his back  on reaching it he found to his surprise that it was the experimental raft and that the captain mabberly and mcgregor were already clinging to it  wont bear us all i fear said mabberly but thank god that we have it  put the boy on  in order to do this barret had to get upon the raft and he found that it bore him easily as well as the boy  have you seen jackman asked mabberly  yes replied barret rising and looking round  here he comes towing quin i think who seems to be stunned  hallo this wayhi  giles  but giles suddenly ceased to swim turned over on his back and lay as if dead  rescue bob rescue shouted barret plunging into the water mabberly followed and soon had hold of giles and his man by the hair  all right said jackman turning round i was only taking a rest  no one lost i hope  no all safe so far  you can tow him in now  im almost used up said jackman making for the raft  hes only stunned i think  it was found that the irishman had in truth been only stunned when they lifted him on to the raft for he soon began to show signs of returning life and a large bump on his head sufficiently explained the nature of his injury  but when the whole party had cautiously clambered up on the raft it sank so deep that they scarcely dared to move  to make matters worse they clearly distinguished the steamers whistle going farther and farther away as if she were searching for them in a wrong direction  this was indeed the case and although they all shouted singly and together the whistle grew fainter by degrees and finally died away  with feelings approaching to despair the crew of the frail raft began to talk of the prospect before them when they were silenced by a slight movement in the mist  the white curtain was lifted for a few yards and revealed to their almost incredulous eyes a rocky shore backed by a range of precipitous cliffs with a wild mountainous region beyond  as the sea was still perfectly calm there was no surf  our castaways therefore with the exception of quin and the boy quietly slipped into the water and with thankful hearts propelled the raft vigorously towards the shore    chapter three  the wreck is followed by repose refreshment surprise and disaster  the distance from land was not more than a few hundred yards nevertheless it occupied a considerable time to pass over that space the raft being illadapted for quick progression through the water  close to the shore there was a flat rock to which as they approached it their attention was drawn by the appearance of what seemed to be living creatures of some sort  quin and robin tips sitting on the raft naturally saw them first  i do belave its men for theyre liftin their hids an lookin at us av it was the south says now id say they was saviges peepin at us over the rocks  praps theyre boys abathin suggested tips  are they white asked captain mcpherson who being chindeep in the water and behind the raft could not see the rock referred to  no sure they seem to be grey or blue  oo theyll be seals returned the skipper nasallya tone which is eminently well adapted for sarcastic remark without the necessity of elaborate language  in coorse they is said tips dont you see theyre aheavin up their tails as well as their eads  on advancing a few yards farther all doubt upon the question was put at rest  the animals of which about a dozen were enjoying themselves on the rock raised themselves high on their flippers and gazed with enormous eyes at the strangelooking monster that was coming in from the sea  thus they remained apparently paralysed with astonishment until the raft was within pistolshot and then unable to endure the suspense longer they all slipped off into the sea  a few minutes later and the raft struck on the shore  and well was it for the party that the weather chanced to be so fine for if there had been anything like a breeze their frail contrivance would inevitably have been dashed to pieces  even a slight swell from the westward would have raised such a surf on that rugged shore that it would have been impossible for the best of swimmers to have landed without broken limbs if not loss of life  as it was they got ashore not only without difficulty but even succeeded in hauling the raft up on the beach without much damage to its partsthough of course the unfortunate fowls in the hencoops had all perished  while mabberly and the others were engaged in securing the raft barret was sent off along shore with directions to ascertain whether there was any habitation near  to his right the high cliffs came down so close to the sea that it seemed very improbable that any cottage or hamlet could be found in that direction  he therefore turned towards the left where the cliffs receded some distance from the shore leaving a narrow strip of meadow land  hurrying forward about a quarter of a mile he stopped and looked about him  the sun was still high in the heavensfor the days are long and nights brief in that region during summerand its rays had so far scattered the mists that all the lowlying land was clear though the mountainrange inland was only visible a short distance above its base the effect of this was to enhance the weird grandeur of the view for when the eye had traced the steep glens overhanging cliffs rugged watercourses and sombre corries upward to the point where all was lost in cloud the imagination was set free to continue the scenery to illimitable heights  the youth was still gazing upward with solemnised feelings when there was presented to him one of those curious aspects of nature which are sometimes though rarely witnessed in mountainous regions  suddenly an opening occurred in the cloudsor mistwhich shrouded the mountaintops and the summit of a stupendous cliff bathed in rich sunshine was seen as if floating in the air  although obviously part of the mountain near the base of which he stood this cliffcompletely isolated as it wasseemed a magical effect and destitute of any real connection with earth  while he was looking in wonder and admiration at the sight he observed a bird hovering about motionless in the blue vault high above the cliffs  although inexperienced in such scenery and sights barret knew well enough that nothing but an eagleand that of the largest size could be visible at all at such a distance  suddenly the bird sailed downwards with a grand circular sweep and was lost among the shadows of the perpendicular rocks  a few minutes more and the mists drifted over the opening causing the vision to disappear  this was barrets first view of the eagle cliff which was destined to exercise a powerful and lasting influence upon his fortunes  a few yards beyond this the explorer came upon a sheep track and a little farther on he found one of those primitive roads which are formed in wild outoftheway places by the passage of light country carts with the aid of a few rounded stones where holes required to be filled up or soft places strengthened  following it a short distance to a spot where it ran between a precipice and the shore he came suddenly in sight of a wilderness of fallen rocks which were varied in size from mere pebbles to masses the size of an omnibus  these had all fallen from a steep spur of the mountains which projected towards the sea of that place  the whole of the level land at the base of the spur was strewn with them some being old mosscovered and weatherworn others fresh and sharp in outline as if they had fallen only the previous winter as probably they had for the places from which they had been dislodged could be seen still fresh and lightcoloured nearly a thousand feet up on the riven cliffs  it was a species of desolation that powerfully recalled some scenes in dantes inferno and had a depressing effect on the youths spirits for nothing seemed more unlikely than the existence of a human habitation in such a place  a new view of the matter broke upon him however when he suddenly became aware that a spot in the confused scene which he had taken to be a clump of withered bracken was in reality a red cow  looking a little more narrowly at objects he soon perceived a hut among the rocks  it was so small and rude and rugged as almost to escape detection  a furious barking soon told that he had been seen and two collie dogs rushed towards him with demonstrations that threatened him with immolation on the spot  the uproar put life into a few more clumps of red bracken and produced a lively display of sheep and cattle throughout the region  barret walked straight up to the door of the hut and the collies withdrew from the attackas most noisy demonstrators do when treated with silent indifference  is there any one inside he asked of a barelegged shaggyheaded boy who came out and gazed at him apparently with his mouth as well as his eyes  na answered the boy  any other cottages or houses near this  ay yonder  the boy pointed in the direction of the sea where in a stony nook between two jutting masses of rock nestled about a dozen huts built of boulder stones gathered from the seashore  so small were these huts and so stupendous the rocks around them that they might easily have been overlooked by a careless eye  so might the halfdozen fishingboats that lay in the little cove beside them  a stream or rivuletbetter known in scotland as a burnran past the hamlet formed a pool just below it and dropped into the cove close to the place where the boats lay  rejoiced to find even the poorest kind of shelter in such a place barret hastened down to the cove and tapping at the door of the largest of the cottages was bidden come in by a soft voice  entering he was surprised to find a neatly though plainly furnished room which was evidently the kitchen of the houseindeed the sole room with the exception of an offshoot closet  the large open fireplace contained a peat fire on the hearth over which hung a bubbling pot  there were two boxbeds opposite the fire and in the wall which faced the door there was a very small window containing four panes of glass each of which had a knot in the middle of it  one of them also presented the phenomenon of a flattened nose for the boy with the ragged head had rushed down and stationed himself there to observe the result of the unexpected and singular visit  beside the window in a homely armchair sat an invalid girl with pale thin cheeks bright blue eyes and long flaxen hair  if not pretty she was at all events extremely interesting and possessed the great charm of a winning smile  apologising for causing her alarm by his damp dishevelled and sudden appearance barret asked if there were any men about the place  no there were none there at the moment most of them being out after the sheep and cattle and some gathering peat or away in the boats  but surely they have not left you all by yourself said barret struck not only by the appearance of the girl but by the comparative refinement of her language  oh no she replied with a slight smile they look well after me mrs anderson has only gone to fetch some peats  but where have you come from sir  your clothes are all wet  you are right  i have just been saved from drowning through gods mercy along with my companions  here barret gave her a brief outline of the recent disaster and then asked if mrs anderson was her mother  no she is my aunt but she is very good to me takes as much care of me as if i was her own daughter  i dont belong to this place  they have sent me here for my health  at this point they were interrupted by mrs anderson herself who entered with a load of peat which she flung down shook her fist at the noseflattener outside and turned in astonishment to her visitor  of course our shipwrecked friend had to retail his story to the woman and then learned from her that the island was a very large one with a name unpronounceable by english lips that it was very thinly inhabited that it consisted almost entirely of pasture land and that the laird owned a large portion of it including the little fishing village of cove  while the woman was speaking an elderly man entered whom she introduced as her husband ian  to him barret had to rerepeat his story and then asked if he and his friends could obtain shelter in the village for the night  iss it shelter yell be wantin  yell hev that an welcome though it will be of the poorest  but in the mornin yell gang up to the hoose for the laird wud be illpleased if we keepit ye here  pray who is this laird asked barret your wife has already mentioned him  maister gordon is his name  he lives near the heed o loch lossie  it iss over eight mile from here said ian an a coot shentleman he iss too  fery fond o company though it iss not much company that comes this way for the steampoats dont veesit the loch reglar or often hell be fery glad to see you sir an to help ye to git home  but wed petter be goin to tell your freens that we can putt them up for the nicht  ill go pack with ye an well take the poy to help an carry up their things  you forget that we have been wrecked returned barret with a laugh and have no things to carry except our own damp carcases  thats true sir but well be none the worse o the poy whatever come away tonal said ian as they started back along the shore  it iss under the eagle cliff where ye came to laund i make no doot  well i suppose it was at least there is a range of cliffs close to the place where our raft struck  oo aybut it iss not the wee precipices it iss the big hull behind them that we ca the eagle cliff  oh indeed  i saw that cliff in a peculiar manner as i came along said barret giving a description of the scene  ay it iss sometimes seen like that said ian an we often see the eagle but its no possible to git a shot at that crater  the laird is real keen to bring it doon for it plays the mischief among the lambs an him an his freens hes aften tried but they hev not manicht it yet  thus chatting they soon reached the raft and found the disconsolate party waiting impatiently for them  shall we leave it where it lies or drag it further up on the beach asked mabberly referring to the raft  ye petter haul it a wee higher up said ian examining the machine with much interest for when it comes on to plow theres a heavy sea here  weel weel but it iss a strange contrivance  ay an also a useful one said the skipper drilyat least as duly as was possible in the circumstance  noo shentlemen i think we had petter be goin  it was indeed time for although the weather was warm and fine the sun had set and their damp garments began to feel uncomfortable  at the cove the whole party was accommodated in a singleroomed hut which chanced to be empty at the time  here the hospitable fishermen spread nets for bedding and with plaids made up for the lack of blankets  they also kindled a large peat fire and put on a pot of potatoes and some splendid seatrout while mrs anderson prepared oatcakes at her own fire and sent them in as required  noo shentlemen yell tak a tram said ian producing a black bottle  immeasurable was the astonishment of the highlander when the gentlemen refused a dram  butbut yell catch yer death o cauld if ye dont he said remonstratively as he stood bottle and glass in hand  thanks friend replied jackman but we have taken in so much salt water during our swim to land that we are not sure whether the whisky would agree with it  hoots havers exclaimed ian pouring out some of the liquid yere jokin  in truth we are not then said mabberly for we are all total abstainers  nonsense exclaimed ian who could not understand the principles or feelings of men who after a long exhausting swim in their clothes were capable of refusing whisky  for it is to be remembered that although the time we write of is comparatively recent that remote island had not been visited by any apostle of temperance or total abstinence in regard to alcohol  of course ian had heard something of such principles but he did not believe in them and certainly did not practise them hooiver shentlemen he added if ye wunna tak itheres wushin your fery coot health  raising the glass he drained it without winking as if the contents had been water smacked his lips and put the bottle away  it must not be supposed that all the crew of the late unfortunate fairy witnessed this proceeding unmoved for although they had all been engaged on the understanding that no strong drink was to be allowed or consumed while the voyage lasted not one of them was a pledged abstainer and now that the voyage was ended it did seem as if the laws of the voyage should no longer be binding  still there remained a feeling that as long as they continued a united party the spirit of the agreement should not be broken therefore the skipper and shames let the bottle pass with a sigh and quin followed suit with an undertoned remark to tips that he wouldnt have belaved timtation to be so strong av he hadnt wrastled wid it  by that time most of the men of the hamlet had returned and a rig out of fisher clothes was lent to each of the unfortunates so that they were enabled to pass the night in comfort while their own garments were in front of a good fire  is that sick girl your daughter ian asked giles jackman that night as he walked on the shore with his host before retiring to rest  no sir shes a niecethe daughter of a brother o mine who hes feathered his nest petter than me  hes a welltodo grocer in oban an hes geen his bairn a pretty good edication but its my opeenion they hev all but killed her wi their edication for the doctor has telt them to stop it altogither an send her here for a change o air  indeed  an interesting child and so wellmannered too remarked jackman  humph  nae doot she is  they do say that its because my brither has gotten an english wife  but for my pairt oor weemen seem to me to be as weel mainered as the weemen sooth o the tweed  quite as well i doubt not though i have not seen much of your countrywomen ian  besides good manners are to be judged by varying standards  what is good in the opinion of the eskimo may be thought very bad by the hindoo and vice versa  it is very much a matter of taste  the manners of your niece at all events are admirable  now it is time to turn in  goodnight ian  the sun was high next morning when the wrecked men awoke and began to feel the outcries of nature with reference to breakfast  long before that time the men of cove had gone off to the hills the peathags or the sea according to their respective callings  but mrs anderson had a sumptuous breakfast of oatmeal porridge and fresh milk ready for the strangers  musha but itll make me mouth wather all the afthernoon thinkin of it said quin on finishing his second plateful  its prime wittles remarked tips as he helped himself to more  now barret have you finished asked mabberly  no why  because in the first place you are evidently eating too much for your health and in the second place i want you to go up to what ian calls the hoose as a deputation to the laird  you see although we are forced as it were to throw ourselves on his hospitality i dont quite like to descend on him all at once with the whole strength of our party it will be better for one of us to break the ice and as you are the bestlooking and most hypocritically urbane when you choose i think we could not do better than devolve the duty upon you  right bob as usual but dont you think said barret helping himself to another ladleful of the porridge that my going may cut in two directions  doubtless the laird would be agreeably surprised to meet with me but then that will raise his expectations so high that he will be woefully disappointed on meeting with you  come friends cried jackman it is dangerous to play with edged tools immediately after a meal  my medical knowledge assures me of that  i quite approve of barret forming the deputation and the sooner he starts off the better  the rest of us will assist ian to fish in his absence  thus authorised and admonished barret finished breakfast put on his own garmentswhich like those of his companions were seminautical and sallied forth for an eight miles walk over the mountains to the mansion of the laird which lay on the other side of the eagles cliff ridge on the shores of loch lossie  he was guided the first part of the journey by tonal with the ragged head who with an activity that seemed inexhaustible led him up into wild and rugged places such as he had never before dreamed ofrocky fastnesses which looked at from below seemed inaccessible even to goats but which on being attempted proved to be by no means beyond the powers of a steady head and strong limbs  reaching the summit of a heatherclad knoll that projected from a precipitous part of the mountainside barret paused to recover breath and look back at the calm sea  it lay stretched out far below him looking with its numerous islets in birdseye view somewhat like a map  the mists had completely cleared away and the sun was glittering on the white expanse like a line of light from the shore to the horizon never before had our englishman felt so like a bird both as to the point of vision from which he surveyed the glorious scene and the internal sensation of joy which induced him not only to wish that he could fly but to think that a very little more of such exultation of spirit would enable him to do so  is that the cove down there he asked of the ragged companion who stood beside him  ay thats the cove  why donald it looks like a mere speck in the scene from here and the men look no bigger than crows  as this observation called for no answer none was given and donald seemed to regard his companion as one who was rather weakminded  have we come halfway yet donald  nono near  is it difficult to find the rest of the way from this point  no but it wad be diffeecult to miss it  well donald my boy i have a strong desire to be alonethat is to try if i cannot go the rest of the way without guidance so if you will just give me a little direction ill let you go home and many thanks for coming thus far  now point out the landmarks  he turned as he spoke towards the grand mountain that still towered behind him  theres naethin t pint oot returned the boy yeve only t haud on by this sheep track till ee come close under the cliff yonder  the eagle cliff  ay  itll bring ee to a cairt road an yeve only to follow that through the pass an haud on till ee come to the hoose  ye can see the hoose frae the other side o the pass  and what is the hoose called asked barret  kinlossie  thank you  goodbye my boy  a few coppers sent the youth of the ragged head away in high spirits the young man watched him till he was concealed by a clump of small birch trees that hung like a fringe on the top of a neighbouring precipice  barret had just turned to continue the ascent to the eagle cliff whose frowning battlements still rose high above him when a wild shout from the boy made him turn and look anxiously back  the place which he had reached was strewn with great masses of rock that had fallen from the cliffs  he was about to clamber on to one of these in order to obtain a better view when the cause of the shout became obvious  a splendid stag frightened from its lair by the boy burst from the birchwood and with antlers laid well back bounded up the slope towards him  it was closely followed by two does  barret crouched at once behind the mass of rock  the deer thinking doubtless only of the danger behind had failed to observe him  oh for giles with his rifle thought the youth as the agile creatures passed within less than a hundred yards of him and headed straight for the pass of the eagle cliff  scarcely had the thought occurred when a flapping noise behind caused him to turn quickly  it was the eagle himself sailing majestically and slowly overhead as though he knew full well that an englishman without a gun was a harmless creature  considerably excited by these unexpected and to him stirring sights barret pushed steadily upward and soon reached a part of the pass whence he could see the valley beyond with a house in the far distancewhich of course must be kinlossiestanding in a clump of wood on the margin of an inlet of the sea known by the name of loch lossie  but a far more astonishing sight than anything he had beheld that morning was yet in store for barret  on turning round a projecting rock at the foot of the eagle cliff he suddenly came upon a young girl lying on the road as if dead  springing towards her he knelt and raised her head  there was no blood upon the face which was deadly pale and no apparent injury  she did not seem to breathe but on feeling her pulse he fancied that he felt a flutter there  a feeling of desperate regret passed through him as he thought of his utter destitution alike of medical or surgical knowledge but barret was not by any means a helpless man  running to one of the many streams of water which trickled from the cliff he filled the top of his wideawake therewith and returning laved the girls face and poured a little into her mouth  his efforts were successful  she recovered consciousness opened her eyes and asked with a confused look what was the matter  you must have had a fall dear child but youll be better presently let me raise you  the girl tried to rise but with a sharp cry of pain fell back again unconscious  barret soon ascertained that one of the poor girls arms was severely bruised perhaps broken  he knew not what to do but he knew that the greatest present evil was delay  he therefore wrapped her in the shepherds plaid which she wore and raised her as gently as possible in his armsmaking use of the plaid as a sort of sling with part of it round his own neck  then thanking god for the strong limbs and muscles with which he had been endowed he set off with vigorous tread for kinlossie house    chapter four  the family at kinlossie  serenity was the prevailing feature in the character of old allan gordon the laird of kinlossie but when that amiable portly grand silverheaded old gentleman suddenly met an unknown young man of fine proportions carrying his favourite niece wrapped up as a bundle in his arms all his serenity disappeared and he stared glared almost gasped with mingled astonishment and consternation  a very brief explanation however quickly sufficed to charge his susceptible spirit to overflowing with a compound of grave anxiety and heartfelt gratitude  come in my dear sir come in luckily our doctor is spending the day with me  but for you my poor dear milly might have beenthis way to her own room  are you sure the arm is broken  i fear so replied barret entering the mansion but before he could proceed farther his words were drowned in a shriek of surprise from four little gordons aged from sixteen to four who yelled rather than demanded to know what ailed their cousinranging from archies whats wrong with cousin milly to floras wass wong wid cuzn miwy  by that time mrs gordon a pleasantvoiced lady with benignity in her looks appeared on the scene followed quickly by a man and several maid servants all of whom added to the confusion in the midst of which cousin milly was conveyed to her room and deposited on her bed  the family doctor a rotund little man of fiftyfive was speedily in attendance  so fortunate that the doctor happens to be here said the laird as he led barret to the library and offered him a glass of wine  no you dont drink  well well as you please  here duncan fetch milk lemonade coffee hot at once  you must be tired after carrying her so far even though she is a light weight  but forgive me in my anxiety about my poor niece i have quite forgotten to ask either your name or how you came here for no steamer has been to the island for a week past  pray be seated and wherever you may be bound for ultimately make up your mind that my house is to be your home for a week at least  we suffer no visitor ever to leave us under that period  you are very kind returned the young man smiling and i accept your proffered hospitality most gladly  my name is john barret  i came to the other side of the island in a yacht and swam on shore in my clothes with six companions spent the night at cove and have walked over here to make known these facts to you  you speak in riddles my young friend returned the laird with an amused look  yet i speak the truth returned barret who thereupon gave a circumstantial account of the disaster that had befallen himself and his friends  excuse me said mr gordon rising throwing up the window he shouted to a man who was passing at the moment roderick get the big waggonette ready to go to cove and bring it round here as fast as you can  you see he added to barret the road is considerably longer than the short cut by which you came and we must have them all over here without delay  dont distress yourself about room  we have plenty of accommodation  but come ill take you to your own room and when you have made yourself comfortable we will talk over your future plans just let me say however to prevent your mind running away on wrong ideas that in the circumstances we wont allow you to leave us for two months  the post goes out tomorrow so you can write to your father and tell him so  thus running on in a rich hearty voice the hospitable allan gordon conducted barret to a room in the southern wing of the rambling old edifice and left him there to meditate on his good fortune and enjoy the magnificent prospect of the islandstudded firth or fiord from which the mansion derived its name  while the waggonette was away for the rest of the wrecked party the laird finding that millys arm was not actually broken though severely bruised sat down to lunch with restored equanimity and afterwards drove barret in his dogcart to various parts of his estate  your friends cannot arrive for several hours you see he said on starting and we dont dine till seven so you could not be better engaged than in making acquaintance with the localities of our beautiful island  it may seem a little wild to you in its scenery but there are thousands of picturesque points and what painters call bits about it as my sweet little milly moss will tell you when she recovers for she is an enthusiastic painter and has made innumerable drawings both in watercolour and oils since she came to stay here  i cannot tell you how grateful i am to you mr barret for rescuing the poor girl from her perilous position  i count myself fortunate indeed in having been led to the spot so opportunely said barret and i sincerely hope that no evil effects may result from her injuries  may i ask if she resides permanently with you at kinlossie  i wish she did said the laird fervently for she is like a sunbeam in the house  no we have only got the loan of her on very strict conditions too from her mother who is a somewhat timid lady of an anxious temperament  ive done my best to fulfil the conditions but they are not easy  indeed  how is that  well you see my sister is firmly convinced that there is deadly danger in wet feet and one of her conditions is that milly is not to be allowed to wet her feet  now you know it is not easy for a londoner to understand the difficulty of keeping ones feet dry while skipping over the mountains and peathags of the western isles  from which i conclude that mrs moss is a londoner returned barret with a laugh  she is  although a gordon and born in the argyll highlands she was sent to school in london where she was married at the age of seventeen and has lived there ever since  her husband is dead and nothing that i have been able to say has yet tempted her to pay me a visit  she regards my home here as a wild uninhabitable region though she has never seen it and besides is getting too old and feeble to venture as she says on a long voyage  certes she is not yet feeble in mind whatever she may be in body but shes a good amiable affectionate woman and i have no fault to find with her except in regard to her severe conditions about milly and her anxiety to get her home again after all it is not to be wondered at for milly is her only child and i am quite sure if i had not gone to london and made all sorts of promises to be extremely careful of milly and personally take her home again she never would have let her come at all  see there is one of millys favourite views said the laird pulling up and pointing with his whip to the scene in front where a range of purple hills formed a fine background to the loch with its foreground of tanglecovered stones she revels in depicting that sort of thing  barret after expressing his thorough approval of the young girls taste in the matter of scenery asked if millys delicate health was the cause of her mothers anxiety  delicate health exclaimed the laird  why man sylphlike though she appears she has got the health of an amazon  no no theres nothing wrong with my niece save in the imagination of my sister  we will stop at this cottage for a few minutes  i want to see one of my men who is not very well  he pulled up at the door of a little stone hut by the roadside which possessed only one small window and one chimney the top of which consisted of an old cask with the two ends knocked out  a barelegged boy ran out of the hut to hold the horse  is your brother better today asked the laird  no sir hes jist the same  mind your head said the laird as he stooped to pass the low doorway and led his friend into the hut  the interior consisted of one extremely dirty room in which the confined air was further vitiated by tobacco smoke and the fumes of whisky  one entire side of it was occupied by two boxbeds in one of which lay a brawny broadshouldered man with fiery red hair and scarcely less fiery red eyes which seemed to glare out of the dark den in which he lay  well ivor are ye not better today man  there was a sternness in mr gordons query which not only surprised but grieved his young companion and the surprise was increased when the sick man replied in a surly tone  na laird im not better an whats more ill not be better till my heeds under the sod  im afraid you are right ivor returned the laird in a somewhat softer tone for when a man wont help himself no one else can help him  help myself exclaimed the man starting up on one elbow and gazing fiercely from under his shaggy brows  help myself he repeated  and then as if resolving suddenly to say no more he sank down and laid his head on the pillow with a short groan  here ivor is a bottle o physic that my wife sends to ye said mr gordon pulling a pint bottle from his pocket and handing it to the man who clutched it eagerly and was raising it to his mouth when his visitor arrested his hand  hoot man he said with a short laugh its not whisky  she bid me say ye were to take only half a glass at a time every two hours  poort oot then lairdpoort oot said the man impatiently yell fin a glass i the wundy  fetching a wineglass from the window mr gordon half filled it with a liquid of a dark brown colour which the sick man quaffed with almost fierce satisfaction and then lay down with a sigh  it seems to have done ye good already man said the laird putting the bottle and glass on that convenient shelfthe windowsill  ive no idea what the physic is but my good wife seems to know and thats enough for me and for you too i think  ay shes a good wumin  thank her for me responded ivor  remounting the dogcart the old gentleman explained as they drove along that ivor donaldsons illness was the result of intemperance  he is my gamekeeper said the laird and there is not a better or more trustworthy man in the island when he is sober but when he takes one of his drinking fits he seems to lose all control over himself and goes from bad to worse till a fit of delirium tremens almost kills him  he usually goes for a good while after that without touching a drop and at such times he is a most respectful painstaking man willing to take any amount of trouble to serve one but when he breaks down he is as bad as evernay even worse  my wife and i have done what we could for him and have tried to get him to take the temperance pledge but hitherto without avail  my wife has even gone the length of becoming a total abstainer in order to have more influence over him but i dont quite see my way to do that myself  then you have not yet done all that you could for the man though your wife has thought barret but he did not venture to say so  at this point in the conversation they reached a place where the road left the shores of the loch and ascended into the hills  being rather steep at its lower end they alighted and walked the laird pointing out as they ascended features in the landscape which he thought would interest his young guest  yonder he said pointing to a wood on the opposite side of the valley yonder is a good piece of cover for deer  the last time we had a drive there we got three one o them a stag with very fine antlers it was there that a young friend of mine who was not much accustomed to sporting shot a red cow in mistake for a deer  the same friend knocked over five or six of my tame ducks under the impression that they were wild ones because he found them among the heather  are you fond of sport  not particularly answered barret that is i am not personally much of a sportsman though i have great enjoyment in going out with my sporting friends and watching their proceedings  my own tastes are rather scientific  i am a student of natural historya botanist and geologistthough i lay no claim to extensive knowledge of science  ah my young friend then you will find a powerful sympathiser in my niece millythat is when the poor child gets wellfor she is half mad on botany  although only two weeks have passed since she came to us she has almost filled her room with specimens of what she calls rare plants  i sometimes tease her by saying it is fortunate that bracken does not come under that head else shed pull it all up and leave no cover for the poor rabbits  she has also halffilled several huge books with gummedin specimens innumerable though i cant see that she does more than write their names below them  and that is no small advance in the science let me tell you returned barret who was stirred up to defend his coscientist  no one can succeed in anything who does not take the first steps and undergo the drudgery manfully  womanfully in this case my friend but do not imagine that i underrate my little niece  my remark was to the effect that i do not see that she does more though i have no manner of doubt that her pretty little head thinks a great deal more  now we will get up here as the road is more level for a bit  dyou see the group of alders down in the hollow yonder where the little stream that runs through the valley takes a sudden bend  theres a deep pool there where a good many seatrout congregate  you shall try it soonthat is if you care for fishing  oh yes i like fishing said barret  it is a quiet contemplative kind of sport  contemplative exclaimed the old gentleman with a laugh well yes it is a little  sometimes you get down into the bed of the stream with considerable difficulty and you have to contemplate the banks a long time occasionally before deciding as to which precipice is least likely to give you a broken neck  yes it is a contemplative sport  as to quiet that depends very much on what your idea of quietude may be our burn descends for two or three miles in succession of leaps and bounds  if the roaring of cataracts is quieting to you there is no end of it down there  see the pool that i speak of is partly visible now with the waterfall above it  you see it  yes i see it  we call it macs pool continued the laird driving on because it is a favourite pool of an old school companion of mine named macrummle who is staying with us just now  he tumbles into it about once a week  is that considered a necessary part of the process of fishing asked barret  no it may rather be regarded as an eccentric addition peculiar to macrummle  the fact is that my good friend is rather too old to fish now but his spirit is still so juvenile and his sporting instincts are so keen that he is continually running into dangerous positions and getting into scrapes  fortunately he is very punctual in returning to meals so if he fails to appear at the right time i send off one of my men to look for him  i have offered him a boy as an attendant but he prefers to be alone  there seems to be some one down at the pool now remarked barret looking back  no doubt it is macrummle himself said the laird pulling up  ay and he seems to be making signals to us  shall i run down and see what he wants asked barret  do you are active and your legs are strong  it will do you good to scramble a little  leaping the ditch that skirted the road the youth soon crossed the belt of furze and heather that lay between him and the river about which he and his host had been conversing  being unaccustomed to the nature of the western isles he was a little surprised to find the country he had to cross extremely rugged and broken and it taxed all the activity for which the laird had given him credit as well as his strength of limb to leap some of the peathags and watercourses that came in his way he was too proud of his youthful vigour to pick his steps round them only once did he make a slip in his kangaroolike bounds but that slip landed him kneedeep in a bog of brown mud out of which he dragged his legs with difficulty  gaining the bank of the river at last he soon came up to the fisher who was of sturdy build though somewhat frail from age and dressed in brown tweed garments with a dirty white wideawake the crown of which was richly decorated with castinglines and hooks ranging from small brown hackle to salmonfly  but the striking thing about him was that his whole person was soaking wet  water dripped from the pockets of his shooting coat dribbled from the battered brim of his wideawake and flowing from his straightened locks trickled off the end of his roman nose  you have been in the water i fear said barret in a tone of pity  and you have been in the mud young man said the fisher in a tone of goodhumoured sarcasm  the youth burst into a laugh at this and the old fishermans mouth expanded into a broad grin which betrayed the fact that age had failed to damage his teeth though it had played some havoc with his legs  these are what i style highland boots said the old man pointing to the muddy legs  indeed returned barret  well you see i have put them on at once for i have only arrived a few hours since  my name is barret  i believe i have the pleasure of addressing mr macrummle  you have that pleasure mr barret and now if you will do me the kindness to carry my rod and basket i will lead you back to the dogcart by a path which will not necessitate an additional pair of native boots  i would not have hailed you but having tumbled into the river as you see i thought it would be more prudent to get driven home as quickly as possible  you have a good basket of fish i see or rather feel remarked barret as he followed the old man who walked rather slowly for his physical strength was not equal to his spirits  ay it is not so bad but i lost the best one  fishers always do you know  he was a grilse a sixpounder at the least if he was an ounce for i had him within an inch of my gaff when i overbalanced myself and shot into the stream head foremost with such force that i verily believe i drove him to the very bottom of the pool  strange to say the rod was not broken but when i scrambled ashore i found that the grilse was gone  how unfortunate  you were not hurt i hope  not in the least  there was plenty of depth for a dive besides im used to it  it became quite evident to john barret that his new friend was used to a good many more things besides tumbling into the river for as they went slowly along the winding footpath that led them through the peathags macrummle tripped over a variety of stumps roots and other excrescences which presented themselves in the track and which on several occasions brought him to the ground  the old gentleman however had a fine facility in falling  being slow in all his movements he usually subsided rather than fell a result perhaps of laziness as well as of unwillingness to struggle against fate  his frequent staggerings also on the verge of dark peat holes caused his companion many a shock of alarm and many a start forward to prevent a catastrophe before they gained the high road  they reached it at last however rather breathless but safe  macrummles speech like his movements was slow  his personal courage considering the dangers he constantly and voluntarily encountered was great  youve been in again mac i see exclaimed the laird heartily extending his hand to his old friend with the view of hauling him up on the seat beside him  mind the step  now then  yes ive been in but the weather is warm  stop stop  dont pull quite so hard allan mind my rheumatic shoulder  give a shove behind mr barretgentlythere  thankee  the old man sat down with something of a crash beside his friend barret handed him his rod put the basket under his feet and sprang up on the seat behind  returning at a swift pace by the road they had come they soon reached kinlossie where the laird drove into the back yard so as to deliver the still dripping macrummle at the back door and thus prevent his leaving a moist track from the front hall to his bedroom  having got rid of him and given the dogcart in charge to the groom mr gordon led his young friend round to the front of the house  i see your friends have already arrived said the laird pointing to the waggonette which stood in the yard  no doubt we shall find them about somewhere  they turned the corner of the mansion as he spoke and certainly did come on barrets friends in circumstances however which seemed quite unaccountable at first sight for there in front of the open door were not only bob mabberly giles jackman skipper mcpherson james mcgregor pat quin and robin tips but also mrs gordon the two boy gordons named respectively eddie and junkieduncan the butler and little flora with a black wooden doll in her arms all standing in more or less awkward attitudes motionless and staring straight before them as if petrified with surprise or some kindred feeling  barret looked at his host with a slight elevation of his eyebrows  hush said the laird softly holding up a finger of caution  my boy archie is behind that laurel bush  hes photographing them  thatll do in a loud voice from archie disenchanted the party and while the operator rushed off to his dark closet the laird hurried forward to be introduced to the new arrivals and give them hospitable greeting  that evening the host and his wife entertained their guests to a genuine highland feast in the trophied hall and at a somewhat later hour duncan the butler and elsie the cook assisted by roderick the groom and mary the housemaid held their share of high revelry in the kitchen with quin tips and shames mcgregor  you have come to the right place for sport gentlemen said the laird as he carved with vigour at a splendid haunch of venison  in their seasons we have deer and grouse on the hills rabbits hares partridges and pheasants on the low grounds  whatll you have mr mabberly  my dear what have you got there  pigeon pie answered mrs gordon  mac that will suit your taste i know cried the host with a laugh  yes it will slowly returned macrummle whose ruddy face and smooth bald head seemed to glow with satisfaction now that he had got into dry garments  yes im almost as fond of pie as my old friend robinson used to be  he was so fond of it that strange though it may seem to you gentlemen he had a curious predilection for piebald horses  come now mac dont begin upon your friend robinson till after dinner  has archies photography turned out well asked mabberly at this point  i do a little in that way myself and am interested as to the result of his efforts today  we cannot know that before tomorrow i fear replied mrs gordon  did i hear you ask about archies work mabberly said the laird interrupting  oh itll turn out well i have no doubt  he does everything well  in fact all the boys are smartish fellows a little selfwilled and noisy perhaps like all boys but  a tremendous crash in the room above which was the nursery caused the laird to drop his knife and fork and quickly leave the room with a look of anxiety for he was a tenderhearted excitable man while his quiet and delicatelooking wife sat still with a look of serenity not unmingled with humour  something overturned i suppose she remarked  in a few minutes her husband returned with a bland smile  yes he said resuming his knife and fork it was junkie as usual fighting with flo for the black doll  no mischief would have followed i daresay but archie and eddie joined in the scrimmage and between them they managed to upset the table  i found them wallowing in a sea of porridge and milkthat was all    chapter five  plans prospects and a great fight  there is something very enjoyable in awaking in a strange bedroom with a feeling of physical strength and abounding health about one with a glorious early sunbeam irradiating the roomespecially if it does not shine upon ones facewith a window opposite through which you can see a mountain rising through the morning mists until its summit appears to claim kindred with the skies and with the consciousness that work is over for a time and recreation is the order of the day  some such thoughts and feelings caused john barret to smile as he lay flat on his back the morning after his arrival with his hands under his head surveying the lowroofed but cosy apartment which had been allotted to him in the mansion of kinlossie  but the smile gave place to a grave earnest expression as his eyes fell upon a framed card on which was printed in scarlet and blue and gold the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof  so it is thought the youth and my power to enjoy it comes from the lordmy health my strength myself  yet how seldom do i thank him for the mere fact of a happy existence  god forgive me  although barret thus condemned himself we would not have it supposed that he had been a careless unbeliever  his temperament was grave not by any means gloomy by nature and a christian mothers love and teaching had before her early death deepened his religious impressions  he was beginning to wonder whether it was mrs gordon who had hung the text there and whether it had been executed by milly moss when the get up gong sent forth a sonorous peal causing him to bound out of bed  the act brought before his eyes another beda small onein a corner of the room reminding him of what he had forgotten that the house being full to overflow by the recent accession of visitors little joseph better known as junkie shared the room with him  junkie was at the moment sleeping soundly after the manner of the hedgehogthat is curled up in the form of a ball  it was plain that neither dressing gongs nor breakfastbells had any effect upon him for he lay still in motionless slumber  hallo  junkie did you hear the gong said barret pushing the boy gently  but junkie answered not and he had to push him three or four times gently and twice roughly before he could awaken the youngster uncoiling himself and turning on the other side junkie heaved a deep sigh and murmuredleave m lone  junkie  junkie youll be late for breakfast shouted barret in his ear  donwananybrkfst murmured the boy  leave m lone i say orll wallop you  a laugh from barret and a still severer shake roused the boy so far as to make him sit up and stare about him with almost supernatural solemnity  then he yawned rubbed his eyes and smiled faintly  oh its you is it he said  i thought it was eddie and  another yawn checked his utterance  then he suddenly jumped up and began to haul on his clothes with surprising rapidity  it was evident that junkie had a will of his own and was accustomed to exert it on all occasions  he continued to dress wash himself brush his hair and his teeth without speaking and with such vigour that he soon distanced his companion in the race  true he did not do everything thoroughly  he did not render his little hands immaculately clean  he did not remember that the secret places behind his ears required to be particularly attended to and in brushing operations he totally forgot that he was possessed of backhair  indeed it is just possible that he disbelieved that fact for he neglected it entirely insomuch that when he had completed the operation to his own entire satisfaction several stiff and independent locks pointed straight to the sky and two or three to the horizon  thats a pretty text on the wall junkie observed barret while the youngster was busy with the comb  yes its pretty  barret wished to draw the boy out but like a tough piece of indiarubber he refused to be drawn out  it is beautifully painted  who did it asked the youth making another attempt  he had accidentally touched the right chord this time  it vibrated at once  junkie looked up with sparkling eyes and said that milly did it  she does everything beautifully he added as he brushed away at his forelocka remarkably obstinate forelock considering that it was the most highly favoured lock of his head  you like milly i see said his friend  of course i do  everybody does  indeed  why does everybody like her so much  cause shes so nice said junkie dropping his brush on the floor not accidentally but as the easiest way of getting rid of it  and she sometimes says that im good  im glad to hear that my boy for if milly says so it must be true  no its not true returned the boy promptly as he fastened his necktie in a complex knot and thrust his arm through the wrong hole of his little vest  milly is mistaken thats all  but i like her to say it all the same  it feels jolly  but im badawful bad  everybody says so  father says so an he must be right you know for he says he knows everything  besides i feel it an i know it an i dont care  having given vent to this reckless statement and wriggled into his jacketthe collar of which he left half down and half upjunkie suddenly plumped down on his knees laid his head on his bed and remained perfectly still for the space of about one quarter of a minute then jumping up with the pleased expression of one who felt that he had done his duty he was about to rush from the room when barret stopped him  im glad to see that you say your prayers at all events he said  but i wouldnt say them if it wasnt for milly returned the urchin i do it to please her  an i wash an brush myself an all that just cause she likes me to do it  id neither wash nor pray nor brush nor anything if it wasnt to please millyand mother he added after a moments reflection  i like them an i dont care a button for anybody else  what for nobody else at all  well yes i forgoti like ivor too  is that the sick gamekeeper junkie  sick no hes the drunken keeper  drunken ivor we call himnot to his face you know  wouldnt we catch it if we did that  but im fond of drunken ivor an hes fond of me  he takes me out sometimes when he goes to shoot rabbits and fish  sometimes hes awful fierce but hes never fierce to his old mother that lives in the hut close behind hiscept when hes drunk  dee knowthe boy lowered his voice at this point and looked solemnhe very nearly killed his mother once when he was drunk you know an when he came sober he criedoh just as our flo cries when shes bin whipped  at this point the breakfastbell pealed forth with so to speak a species of clamorous enthusiasm by no means unusual in scottish country mansions as if it knew that there was spread out a breakfast worth ringing for  at the first sound of it junkie burst from the room left the door wide open clattered along the passage singing yelling vociferously as he wentand trundled downstairs like a retiring thunderstorm  the arrangements for the day at kinlossie were usually fixed at the breakfast hour if they had not been settled the night before  there was therefore a good deal to consult about during the progress of the meal  you see gentlemen said the host when the demands of nature were partially satisfied friends who come to stay with me are expected to select their occupations or amusements for the day as fancy or taste may lead them  my house is liberty hall  sometimes we go together on the hills after grouse at other times after reddeer  when the rivers are in order we take our rods and break up into parties  when weather and wind are suitable some go boating and seafishing  others go sketching or botanising  if the weather should become wet you will find a library next to this room a billiardtable in the west wing and a smokingroomwhich is also a rod and gunroomin the back premises we cannot take the men from their work today so that a deerdrive is not possible but that can be done any day  so gentlemen think over it and make your choice  how is milly this morning asked macrummle who came down late to breakfast as he always did and consequently missed morning prayers  better much better than we could have expected  of course the arm is inflamed and very painful but not broken which is almost a miracle considering the height from which she fell  but for you mr barret she might have lain there for hours before we found her and the consequences might have been very serious  as it is the doctor says she will probably be able to leave her room in a few days  come now mac continued the host we have been talking over plans for the day  what do you intend to do  try the river said the old gentleman with quiet decision as he slowly helped himself to the ham and egg that chanced to be in front of him  theres a threepounder if not a four which rose in the middle pool yesterday and i feel sure of him today  why mr macrummle said mrs gordon smilingly you have seen that threepounder or fourpounder every day for a month past  i have mrs gordon and i hope to see him every day for a month to come if i dont catch him today  whatever you do mac dont dive for him said the laird else we will some day have to fish yourself out of the middle pool  have another cut of salmon mr mabberly  in what direction do your tastes point  i feel inclined to make a lazy day of it and go out with your son archie said mabberly to look at the best views for photographing  i had intended to photograph a good deal among the western isles this summer but my apparatus now lies with the yacht at the bottom of the sea  yes in company with my sixteenshooter rifle said giles jackman with a rueful countenance  well gentlemen i cannot indeed offer you much comfort as regards your losses for the sea keeps a powerful hold of its possessions but you will find my boys camera a fairly good one and there are plenty of dry plates  it so happens also that i have a new repeating rifle in the house which has not yet been used so in the meantime at all events neither of you will suffer much from your misfortunes  it was finally arranged before breakfast was over that macrummle was to go off alone to his usual and favourite burn that jackman and quin under the guidance of junkie should try the river for salmon and seatrout that barret with exskipper mcpherson shames mcgregor robin tips eddie gordon the lairds second sona boy of twelveand ivor the keeperwhose recoveries were as rapid as his relapses were suddenshould all go off in the boat to try the seafishing and that bob mabberly with archie should go photographing up one of the most picturesque of the glens conducted by the laird himself  as it stands to reason that we cannot accompany all of these parties we elect to follow giles jackman quin and junkie up the river  this expedition involved a preliminary walk of four miles which they all preferred to being driven to the scene of action in a dogcart  junkie was a little fellow for his age but remarkably intelligent active bright and strong  from remarks made by various members of the gordon family and their domestics both jackman and his servant had been led to the conclusion that the boy was the very impersonation of mischief and were more or less on the look out for displays of his propensity but junkie walked demurely by their side asking and replying to questions with the sobriety of an elderly man and without the slightest indication of the latent internal fires with which he was credited  the truth is that junkie possessed a nature that was tightly strung and vibrated like an aeolian harp to the lightest breath of influence  he resembled somewhat a pot of milk on a very hot fire rather apt to boil over with a rush nevertheless he possessed the power to restrain himself in a simmering condition for a considerable length of time  the fact that he was fairly out for the day with two strangers to whom he was to show the pools where salmon and seatrout lay was a prospect so charming that he was quite content to simmer  dee know how to fish for salmon he asked looking gravely up in jackmans face after they had proceeded a considerable distance  oh yes junkie i know how to do it  i used to fish for salmon before i went to india  isnt that the place where they shoot lions and tigers andand grillas  well not exactly lions and gorillas my boy but there are plenty of baboons and monkeys there and lots of tigers  have you shot them asked junkie with a look of keen interest  yes many of them  did you ever turn a tiger outside in  jackman replied with a laugh that he had never performed that curious operation on anything but socksthat indeed he had never heard of such a thing being done  i knew it was a cracker said junkie  what dyou mean by a cracker my boy inquired jackman  a lie said junkie promptly  and who told the cracker  ivor  he tells me a great great many stories  dyou mean ivor donaldson the keeper  yes he tells me plenty of stories but some of them are crackers  he said that once upon a time a man was walkin through the junglethats what they call the bushes you know in indiaan he met a great big tiger which glared at him with its great eyes and gave a tremendous roar and sprang upon him  the man was brave and strong  he held out his right arm straight so that when the tiger came upon him his arm went into its open mouth and right down its throat and his hand caught hold of something  it was the inside end of the tigers tail  the man gave an awful pull and the tiger came inside out at once with a tremendous crack  sure and that was a cracker remarked quin who had been listening to the boys prattle with an amused expression as they trudged along  nevertheless it may not be fair to call it a lie junkie said jackman  did ivor say it was true  no  when i asked if it was he only laughed and said he had once read of the same thing being done to a walrus but he didnt believe it  just so junkie  he meant you to understand the story of the tiger as he did the story of the walrusas a sort of fairy tale you know  how could he mean that demanded junkie when he said it was a tigers tailnot a fairys at all  jackman glanced at quin and suppressed a laugh  quin returned the glance and expressed a smile  better luck next time murmured the servant  did you ever see walruses asked junkie whose active mind was prone to jump from one subject to another  no never but i have seen elephants which are a great deal bigger than walruses returned jackman and i have shot them too  i will tell you some stories about them one of these daysnot crackers but true ones  thatll be nice  now were close to the seapool but the tides too far in to fish that just now so well go up to the next one if you like  by all means my boy  you know the river and we dont so we put ourselves entirely under your guidance and orders replied jackman  by this time they had reached the river at the upper end of the loch it ran in a winding course through a level plain which extended to the base of the encircling hills  the pool next the sea being unfishable as we have said owing to the state of the tide junkie conducted his companions high up the stream by a footpath  and a proud urchin he was in his grey kilt and hose with his glengarry cocked a little on one side of his curly head as he strode before them with all the selfreliance of a highland chieftain  in a few minutes they came to the first practicable poola wide rippling oily deep hole caused by a bend in the stream the appearance of whichsuggestive of silvery scaleswas well calculated to arouse sanguine hopes in a salmon fisher  here quin proceeded to put together the pieces of his masters rod while jackman opening a portly fishingbook selected a casting line and fly  have you been in india too asked junkie of quin as he watched their proceedings with keen interest  sure an i haveleastways if it wasnt dhreamin ive bin there  an have you killed lions and tigers and elephants  well not exactly me boy but its meself as used to stand by an howld the spare guns whin the masther was killin them  wasnt you frightened  niver a taste  och thriflin craters like them niver cost me a nights rest which is more than i can say of the rats in kinlossie anyhow  a little shriek of laughter burst from junkie on hearing this  what are ye laughin at honey asked quin  at you not bein able to sleep for the rats returned the boy  its the way with everybody who comes to stay with us at first but they get used to it at last  are the rats then so numerous asked jackman  swarmin all over  havent you heard them yet  well yes i heard them scampering soon after i went to bed but i thought it was kittens at play in the room overhead and soon went to sleep  but they dont come into the rooms do they  oh noi only wish they would  wouldnt we have a jolly hunt if they did  but they scuttle about the walls inside and between the ceilings and the floors  and you cant frighten them  the only thing that scared them once was the bagpipes  an old piper came to the house one day and played a great deal and we heard nothing more of the rats for two or three weeks after that  sensible bastes remarked quin handing the rod to his master an a sign too that theyve got some notion o music  why quin i thought you had bagpipes in ireland said jackman as he fastened a large fly to his line  an thats what we have sor but the irish pipes are soft mellow gentle thingslike the irish girlsnot like them big scotch bellows that screech for all the world like a thousand unwillin pigs bein forced to go to markit  true quin theres something in that  now then both of you stand close to mea little behindso its the safest place if you dont want to be hooked and be ready with the gaff junkie said the fisher as he turned a critical eye on the water and made a fine cast over what he deemed the most likely part of the pool  father never rose a fish there said junkie with a demure look  the fisher paid no attention to the remark but continued to cast a little lower down stream each time  youre gettin near the bit now said junkie in the tone of one whose expectations are awakened  ththere  thats him  ay and a good one too exclaimed jackman as a fanlike tail disappeared with a heavy splash  again the fisher cast with the same result  hes only playin wi the fly said junkie in a tone of disappointment  thats often the waynoththere  got im  the rod bent like a hoop at that moment the reel spun round to its own merry music as the line flew out and the fish finished its first wild rush with a leap of three feet into the air  hooray yelled junkie now fairly aflame as he jumped like the fish flourished the big hook round his head and gaffed quin by the lappet of his coat  have a care you spalpeen shouted the irishman grasping the excited youngster by the collar and disengaging himself from the hook  sure it might have been me nose as well as me coat an a purty objec that would have made me  junkie heeded not  when released he ran toward jackman who was struggling skilfully with the fish  dont let him take you down the rapid he shouted  theres no good place for landin him there  hold on an bring im up if you can hi  this last exclamation was caused by another rush of the fish  jackman had wound up his line as far as possible and was in hopes of inducing the salmon to ascend the stream for he had run perilously near to the head of the rapid against which the boy had just warned him  but to this the fish objected and finding that the fisher was obstinate had as we have said made a sudden rush across the pool causing the reel to spin furiously as the line ran out and finishing off with another splendid jump  a few more bursts like that will soon exhaust him said jackman as he wound in the line again and drew the fish steadily towards him  yes but dont let him go down said the boy earnestly  it seemed almost as if the creature had heard the warning for it turned at the moment and made a straight rush for the head of the rapid  when a large salmon does this it is absolutely impossible to stop him only two courses are open to the fishereither to hold on and let him break the tackle or follow him as fast as possible  the former alternative we need hardly say is only adopted when following is impracticable or involves serious danger  in the present case it was neither impossible nor dangerous but it was difficult and the way in which giles jackman went after that fish staggering among pebbles leaping obstructions crashing through bushes and bounding over boulders causing quin to hold his sides with laughter and little junkie to stand transfixed and staring with admiration was indescribable  for junkie had only seen his old father in such circumstances and sometimes the heavy rather clumsy though powerful ivor donaldson  he had not till that day seenmuch less imaginedwhat were the capacities of an indian woods and forester of athletic build superb training and fresh from his native jungles  i say what a jumper he is exclaimed junkie recovering presence of mind and dashing after him  the rapid was a short though rough one  the chief danger was that the line might be cut among the foamcovered rocks or that the hook if not firmly fixed might tear itself away also that the fisher might fall which would probably be fatal to rod or line to say nothing of elbows and shins  but jackman came triumphantly out of it all  the salmon shot into the pool below the rapid and turned into the eddy to rest  the fisher at the same moment bounded on to a strip of sand thereminus only hat and windand proceeded to reel in the line for the next burst  but another burst did not occur for the fish was by that time pretty well exhausted and took to what is styled sulking that is lying at the bottom of a hole with its nose probably under a stone  while in this position a fish may recover strength to renew the battle  it is therefore advisable if possible to drive him or haul him out of his refuge by all or any means  a small fish may be hauled out if the tackle be strong but this method is not possible with a heavy one such as that which jackman had hooked  whats to be done now junkie he said after one or two vain efforts to move the fish  bomb stones at him said the urchin without a moments hesitation  bomb away then my boy  junkie at once sent several large stones whizzing into the pool  the result was that the salmon made another dash for life but gave in almost immediately and came to the surface on its side  the battle is usually about ended when this takes place though not invariably so for lively fish sometimes recover sufficiently to make a final effort  in this case however it was the close of the fight  slowly and carefully the fisher drew the fish towards the shelving bank where junkie stood ready with the gaff  another moment and the boy bounded into the water stuck the hook into the salmons shoulder and laid it like a bar of glittering silver on the bank  a twentypounder said junkie with critical gravity  twinty an threequarters said quin as he weighed it  and a good job too returned the practical urchin for i heard mother say wed have no fish for dinner tomorrow if somebody didnt catch something    chapter six  dangerous studies peculiar art and splendid fishing  there was a glass conservatory in one corner of the garden at kinlossie house to which the laird was wont to retire regularly for the enjoyment of a pipe every morning after breakfast  in this retreat which was rich in hothouse plants he was frequently joined by one or more of the members of his family and sometimes by the friends who chanced to be staying with him  thither john barret got into the way of goingpartly for the sake of a chat with the old man of whom he soon became very fond and partly for the sake of the plants in which he was scientifically interested botany being as mabberly said his peculiar weakness  one morningand a gloriously bright morning it was such as induces one to thank god for the gift of sunshine and the capacity of enjoying it john barret sauntered down to the garden after breakfast to have a quiet chat with his host  he had decided to remain at home that morning for the purpose of writing a letter or two intending in the afternoon to follow up some of his companions who had gone off to the hills  entering the conservatory he found that the laird was not there but in his usual rustic chair there sat a beautiful girl sound asleep with her fair cheek resting on her little hand and her nutbrown hair straggling luxuriantly over her shoulders  barret was spellbound  he could not move for a few seconds  surprise may have had something to do with the sudden paralysis of his powers it may have been curiosity possibly admiration certainly some sort of sensation that he could neither describe nor account for  he knew at a glance who the girl was though he had not seen her since the day of her accident  even if he had been so obtuse as not to know the arm in a sling would have revealed that it was milly moss who slumbered there yet he found it hard to believe that the neat little woman with the lovely benignant countenance before him was in very truth the dishevelled dusty scratched and bloodsprinkled being whom he had carried for several miles over the heather a short time before  as we have said barret stood immovable not knowing very well what to do  then it occurred to him that it was scarcely gallant or fair thus to take advantage of a sleeping beauty  staring at her was bad enough but to awake her would be still worse so he turned slowly about as a cat turns when afraid of being pounced on by a glaring adversary  he would retire on tiptoe as softly as possible so as not to disturb her in carrying out this considerate intention he swept a flowerpot off its stand which fell with a mighty crash upon the stone floor  the poor youth clasped his hands and glanced back over his shoulder in horror  the startled milly was gazing at him with mingled surprise and alarm which changed however into a flush and a look of restrained laughter as she began to understand the situation  never mind mr barret she said rising and coming forward with a gracious manner  it is only one of the commonest plants we have there are plenty more of them  you came i suppose in search of my uncle  excuse my left hand the right as you see is not yet fit for duty  i did indeed come here in search of mr gordon said barret recovering himself but permit me to lead you back to the chair your strength has not quite returned yet i see  he was right  although milly had recovered much more rapidly than the doctor had expected she could not stand much excitement and the shock given by the breaking flowerpot coupled perhaps with the unexpected meeting with the man who had rescued her from what might well have caused her death somewhat overcame her  excuse me she said with a fluttering sigh as she sank down into the rustic chair i do feel rather faint  it does seem so strange  ii suppose it is because i have had no experience of anything but robust health all my life till now  therei feel better  will you kindly fetch me a glass of water  you will find a cistern with a tumbler beside it outside  the youth hurried out and on returning with the glass found that the deadly pallor of the girls face had passed away and was replaced by a tint that might have made the blush rose envious  you must understand said milly setting down the glass while barret seated himself on a vacant flowerpotstand beside her that this conservatory is a favourite haunt of mine to which before my accident i have resorted every morning since i came here in order to sit with uncle allan  the doctor thought me so much better this morning that he gave me leave to recommence my visits  this is why i came but i had totally forgotten that uncle had arranged to go out with the shooting party today so i sat down to enjoy my favourite plants and paid them the poor compliment of falling asleep owing to weakness i suppose but how does it happen mr barret that you have been left behind they gave me to understand that you are a keen sportsman  they misled you then for i am but a poor sportsman and by no means enthusiastic  indeed whether i go out with rod or gun i usually convert the expedition into a search for plants  oh then you are fond of botany exclaimed the girl with a flush of pleasure and awakened interest  i am so glad of that because because  well why do you hesitate miss moss asked barret with a surprised look and a smile  well i dont quite like to lay bare my selfishness but the truth is there are some rare plants in terribly inaccessible places which can only be reached by creatures in male attire  in fact i was trying to secure one of these on the eagle cliff when i fell and was so nearly killed at the time you rescued me  pray dont give the little service i rendered so dignified a name as rescue  but it rejoices me to know that i can be of further service to youall the more that you are now so helpless for if you found climbing the precipices difficult before you will find it impossible now with your injured arm  by the way i was very glad to find that i had been mistaken in thinking that your arm was broken  has it given you much pain  yes a good deal but i am very very thankful it was no worse  and now i must show you some of the plants i have been trying to bring up since i came here said milly with animation  of course i cannot walk about to show them to you so i will point them out and ask you to fetch the potsthat is if you have nothing better to do and wont be bored  barret protested earnestly that he had nothingcould have nothing better to do and that even if he had he wouldnt do it  as for being bored the idea of such a state of mind being possible in the circumstances was ridiculous  milly was rejoiced  here she had unexpectedly found a friend to sympathise with her intelligently  her uncle she was well aware sympathised with her heartily but not intelligently for his knowledge of botany he told her frankly was inferior to that of a tomcat and he was capable of little more in that line than to distinguish the difference between a cabbage and a potato  at it therefore the two young people went with real enthusiasmwe might almost say with redhot enthusiasmfor botany was only a superstructure so to speak love being the foundation of the whole affair  but let not the reader jump to hasty conclusions  barret and milly being young and inexperienced were absolutely ignorant at that time of the true state of matters  both were earnest and straightforwardboth were ardently fond of botany and neither up to that period had known what it was to fall in love  what more natural then than that they should attribute their condition to botany  there is indeed a sense in which their idea was correct for sympathy is one of the most precious seeds with which poor humanity is entrusted and did not botany enable these two to unite in planting that seed and is not sympathy the germ of fullblown love  if so may they not be said to have fallen in love botanically  we make no assertion in regard to this  we merely and modestly put the question leaving it to the intelligent reader to supply the answeran exceedingly convenient mode of procedure when one is not quite sure of the answer ones self  to return  having got at it barret and milly continued at it for several hours during which period they either forgot or did not care to remember the flight of time  they also contrived during that time to examine discuss and comment upon a prodigious number of plants all of which being in pots or boxes were conveyed by the youth to the empty stand at the side of the fair invalid  the minute examination with a magnifying glass of corolla and stamen and calyx etcetera rendered it necessary of course that these inquiries into the mysteries of nature should bring the two heads pretty close together one consequence being that the seedplant of sympathy was forced a good deal and developed somewhat after the fashion of those plants which hindoo jugglers cause magically to sprout blossom and bloom before the very eyes of astonished beholderswith this difference however that whereas the development of the jugglers is deceptive as well as quick that of our botanists was genuine and natural though rapid  the clang of the luncheon gong was the first thing that brought them to their senses  surely there must be some mistake  junkie must be playing withno it is indeed one oclock exclaimed milly consulting in unbelief a watch so small that it seemed like cruelty to expect it to go at all much less to go correctly  as she spoke the door of the conservatory opened and mrs gordon appeared with affected indignation on her usually mild countenance  you naughty child she exclaimed hurrying forward  did i not warn you to stay no longer than an hour and here you are flushed and no doubt feverish in consequence of staying the whole forenoon  take my arm and come away directly  i pray you mrs gordon to lay the blame on my shoulders said barret  i fear it was my encouraging miss moss to talk of her favourite study that induced her to remain  i would be only too glad to lay the blame on your shoulders if i could lay millys weakness there too returned the lady  it is quite evident that you would never do for a nurse  strong men like you have not sympathy enough to put yourself in the place of invalids and think how they feel  i would scold you severely sir if you were not my guest  as it is i will forgive you if you promise me not to mention the subject of botany in the presence of my niece for a week to come  the condition is hard said barret with a laugh but i promisethat is if miss moss does not force the subject on me  i promise that mr barret but i also attach a condition  which is  that you go to eagle cliff some day this week and find for me a particular plant for which i have sought for a long time in vain but which i am told is to be found there  most willingly  nothing could give me greater pleasure returned the youth with an air of such eager enthusiasm that he felt constrained to addyou see the acquisition of new and rare plants has been a sort of passion with me for many years and i am quite delighted to find that there is a possibility of not only gratifying it here but of being able at the same time to contribute to your happiness  they reached the house as he made this gallant speech and milly went straight to her room  the only members of the household who sat down to luncheon that day were mrs gordon archie the enthusiastic photographer and flo with her black doll and the only guest besides barret was mcpherson the skipper of the lost yacht  the rest were all out rambling by mountain loch or stream  milly wont appear again today said the hostess as she sat down i knew that she had overdone it  the shock to her system has been far too severe to admit of botanical discussions  barret professed himself overwhelmed with a sense of guilt and promised to avoid the dangerous subject in future  mother exclaimed flo who was a good but irrepressible child what dee tink  archie have pofografft dolly an shes as like asastwo peas  isnt she archie  quite as like as that flo replied archie with a laugh liker if anything  by the way how did you get on with your photographing yesterday afternoon archie asked barret  pretty well with some of the views but i ruined the last one because father would have me introduce captain mcpherson and his man mcgregor  is that so captain asked mrs gordon  oo ay it iss true enough answered the skipper with a grim smile he made a queer like mess o me whatever  how was it archie  well mother this is how it was  you know the waterfall at the head of ravens nook  well i have long wanted to take that so i went up with father and mr mabberly  we found the captain and mcgregor sitting there smoking their pipes and when i was arranging the camera the captain said to me  no maister archie interrupted the skipper i did not say anything to shames  you should be more parteekler  but shames said something to me whatever  just so i forgot continued archie  well mcgregor said to the captain what would you think if we wass to sit still an co into the pictur  oo ay that was just it an fery like him too said the skipper laughing at archies imitation though he failed to recognise the similarity to his own drawling and nasal tones  people always do thus fail  we can never see ourselves  well continued archie father insisted that i was to take them though they quite spoiled the view  so i did but in the very middle of the operation what did the captain do but insist on changing his  not at all maister archie again interrupted the skipper you have not got the right of it  it wass shames said to me that he thought you had feenished an so i got up an then you roared like a wild bullock to keep still and so what could i do but keep still an so  exactly that was it cried archie interrupting in his turn but you kept still standing and so there were three figures in the picture when it was done and your fist in the standing one came right in front of your own nose in the sitting one for all the world as if you were going to knock yourself down  such a mess it was altogether  that iss fery true  it wass a mess whatever  you must show me this curious photograph archie after lunch said barret it must be splendid  but it is not so splendid as my dolly chimed in flo  ill show you zat after lunch too  accordingly after the meal was over archie carried barret off to his workshop  then flo took him to the nursery where she not only showed him the portrait of the nigger doll which was a striking likenessfor dolls invariably sit wellbut took special pains to indicate the various points which had come out so bootifullysuch as the nails which junkie had driven into its wooden head for the purpose of making it behave better the chip that junkie had taken off the end of its nose when he tried to convert that feature into a roman the deep line drawn round the head close to the hair by junkie when as the chief of the micmac indians he attempted to scalp it and the hole through the right eye by which junkie proposed to let a little more light into its black brain  having seen and commented on all these things barret retired to the smokingroom not to smoke but to consult a bundle of newspapers which the post had brought to the house that day  for it must not be imagined that the interests and amusements by which he was surrounded had laid the ghost of the thin little old lady whom he had murat least run downin london  no wherever he went and whatever he did that old lady like nemesis pursued him  when he looked down she lay sprawlinga murdered at least a manslaughtered victimat his feet  when he looked up she hung like the sword of damocles by a single fibre of maidens hair over his head  it was of no use that his friend jackman rallied him on the point  my dear fellow he would say dont you see that if you had really killed her the thing would have been published far and wide all over the kingdom with a minute description and perhaps a portrait of yourself on the bicycle in all the illustrated papers  even if you had only injured her severely they would have made a sensation of it with an offer perhaps of a hundred pounds for your capture and a careful indication of the streets through which you passed when you ran away  ay thats what makes the matter so much worse barret would reply the unutterable meanness of running away  but you repented of that immediately jackman would return in soothing tones and you did your utmost to undo it though the effort was futile  barret was usually comforted a good deal by the remarks of his friend and indeed frequently forgot his trouble especially when meditating on botanical subjects with milly  still it remained a fact that he was haunted by the little old lady more or less and had occasional bad dreams besides becoming somewhat anxious every time he opened a newspaper  while barret and the skipper were thus taking what the latter called an easy day of it their friend mabberly with eddie and junkie and the seaman mcgregor had gone over the pass in the waggonette to the village of cove for a days seafishing  they were driven by ivor donaldson  youll not have been in these parts before sir said ivor who was a quiet polite and sociable man when not under the influence of drink  no never answered mabberly who sat on the seat beside him and if it had not been for our misfortune or the carelessness of that unknown steamer i should probably never have known of the existence of your beautiful island  at least i would have remained in ignorance of its grandeur and beauty  that proves the truth of the southcountry sayin sirits an ill wind that blaws nae guid  it does indeed for although the loss of my fathers yacht is a very considerable one to have missed the hospitality of the laird of kinlossie and the rambling over your magnificent hills would have been a greater misfortune  the keeper who cherished a warm feeling for old mr gordon and admired him greatly expressed decided approval of the young mans sentiments as was obvious from the pleased smile on his usually grave countenance though his lips only gave utterance to the expression fery true sir you are not far wrong  at the eagle pass they halted a few minutes to breathe the horses eddie and junkie of course jumped down followed by james mcgregor with whom they had already formed a friendship  come away an well show you the place where milly fell down  come along quicker shames cried junkie adopting the name that the skipper used for the boys love of pleasantry not infrequently betrayed him into impudence  with a short laugh mabberly turned to ivor and asked if shames was the gaelic for james  no sir replied the keeper but james is the english for shames  ha you are quoting nowor rather misquotingfrom the lips of some irishman  weel sir i never heard it said that quotaashun wass a sin retorted ivor then turning to the stupendous cliff that frowned above them hev ye heard of the prophecy sir aboot this cliff  no  what is it  its said that the cliff is to be the scene of a ghost story a love story and a murder all at the same time  is that all ivor  did the prophet give no indication how the stories were to end or who the murderer is to be or the murdered one  never a word sir only they wass all to be aboot the same time indeed the prophet whether man or wuman is not known  noo we better shump up  in a few minutes the waggonette was rattling down the slopes that led to cove and soon afterwards they were exchanging greetings with old ian anderson the fisherman  iss it to fush yell be wantin asked ian as he ushered the party into his cottage where mrs anderson was baking oatcakes and aggy was busy knitting socks with her thin fingers as deftly and rapidly as if she had been in robust health  yes that is our object today said mabberly  goodday mrs anderson goodday aggy  im glad to see you looking so much better though i cant see very well for your cottage is none of the lightest he said glancing at the small window where a ragged head with a flattened white nose accounted for the obscurity  there might be more light said ian seizing a thick thorn stick and making a sudden demonstration towards the door the instant effect of which action was an improvement in the light  it did not last long however for tonal after watching at the corner of the cottage long enough to make sure that the demonstration was a mere feint returned to his post of observation  yes sir remarked mrs anderson aggy is much better  the fresh air is doin her cood already an the peels that the shentlemanyour friendgave her is workin wonders  they usually do of one sort or another returned mabberly with a peculiar smile  im glad they happen to be wonders of the right sort in aggys case  my friend has been out in india and his prescriptions have been conceived in a warm climate you see which may account for their wonderworking qualities  can we have your boat today mr anderson  oo ay ye can hev that sir said ian summoning donald to his presence with a motion of his finger  tonal he said when ragged head stood at the open door hev we ony pait  ay plenty  co doon then an git the poat ready  the boy disappeared without replya willing messenger  a few minutes more and ivor and ian were rowing the boat towards a part of the sea which was deemed good fishing ground while the rest of the party busied themselves arranging the lines  strong brown lines they were wound on little square wooden frames each with a heavy leaden sinker and a couple of strong coarse hooks of whitened metal attached to the lines by stout whipcord for the denizens of those western waters were not the poddlies coddlings and shrimps that one is apt to associate with summer resorts by the sea  they were those veritable inhabitants of the deep that figure on the slabs of billingsgate and similar marketsplaice and skate of the largest dimensions congers that might suggest the great sea serpent and even sharks of considerable size  the surroundings were cognate  curlews and sandpipers whistled on the shore complaining seamews sailed overhead and the lowlying skerries outside were swarming with skarts and other frequenters of the wild north  oh what a funny face exclaimed junkie as a great seal rose head and shoulders out of the sea not fifty yards off to look at them  its observations induced it to sink promptly  let co the anchor tonal said ian the pottom should be cood here  hand me the pait junkie said mcgregor  shie a bit this way shouted eddie  thereive broke it exclaimed junkie almost whimpering as he held up the handle of his knife in one hand and in the other a mussel with a broken blade sticking in it  never mind junkie  you can have mine and keep it said mabberly handing to the delighted boy a large buckhornhandled knife which bristled with appliances  an dont try it on again said ian  here iss pait for you my poy  a few minutes more and the lines were down and expectation was breathlessly rampant  hi burst from eddie at the same moment that ho slipped from mcgregor but both ceased to haul in on finding that the tugs were not repeated  hallo yelled tonal who fished beside junkie on feeling a tug worthy of a whale and hee hee burst from junkie whose mischievous hand had caused the tug when ragged head was not looking  in the midst of these false alarms ivor drew up his line and no one was aware of his success until a fish of full ten pounds weight was floundering in the boat  the boys were yet commenting on it noisily when ian put a large cod beside it  what a tug cried eddie beginning to haul up in violent haste  hev a care or the line will pairt said mcgregor  at the same moment shames himself gave a jerk as if he had received an electric shock and in a few seconds a large plaice and a small crab were added to the pile  ive got something at last said mabberly doing his best to repress excitement as he hauled in his line deliberately  the something turned out to be an eel about four feet long which went about the boat as if it were in its native element and cost an amazing amount of exertion whacking and shouting to subdue  but this was nothing to the fish with which junkie began to struggle immediately after and which proved to be a real shark five feet long after the united efforts of ian and donald had drawn it to the surface junkie was allowed to strike the gaff into it and a loud cheer greeted the monster of the deep as it was hurled into the bottom of the boat  thus in expectation excitation and animation they spent the remainder of that memorable day    chapter seven  amazing deeds and misdeeds at a deerdrive  to some casts of mind there is no aspect of nature so enchanting or romantic as that which is presented on a fine summer day from the vantage ground of a ridge or shoulder high up on the mountains of one of our western isles  it may be that the union of the familiar and beautiful with the unfamiliar and wild is that which arouses our enthusiastic admiration as we stand in the calm genial atmosphere of a summer day surveying the land and seascape from a commanding height that seems to have raised us above the petty cares of life the eye and mind pass like the lightningflash from the contemplation of the purple heather and purple plants aroundand from the homefeelings thereby engenderedto the grand apparently illimitable ocean and the imagination is set free to revel in the unfamiliar and romantic regions beyond seas  some such thoughts were passing in the mind of giles jackman as he stood alone rifle in hand on such a height one splendid forenoon and contemplated the magnificent panorama  far down belowso far that the lowing of the red and black specks which were cattle and the bleating of the white specks which were sheep failed to reach hima few tiny cottages could be seen each in the midst of a green patch that indicated cultivation  farther on a snowwhite line told where the wavelets kissed the rugged shore but no sound of the kiss reached the hunters ear  beyond as if floating on the calm water numerous rocky islets formed the playground of innumerable gulls skarts seals loons and other inhabitants of the wild north but only to the sense of vision were their varied activities perceptible  among these islets were a few blacker spots which it required a steady look to enable one to recognise as the boats of fishermen but beyond them no ship or sign of man was visible on the great lone sea over and reflected in which hung a few soft and towering masses of cloudland    if thus thy meaner works are fair   and beautiful beyond compare   how glorious must the mansions be   where thy redeemed shall dwell with thee  jackman murmured rather than spoke the words for no human ear was there to hear  nevertheless there were human ears and tongues also not far distant engaged in earnest debate  it was on one of the ledges of the eagle cliff that our hunter stood  at another part of the same cliff close to the pass where milly moss met with her accident allan gordon stood with nearly all his visitors and several of his retainers around him  higher up the pass youll have a much better chance mr barret  is it not so ivor  the keeper who in kilt hose and bonnet was as fine a specimen of a tall athletic highlander as one could wish to see replied that that was true  nae doot he said i hev put mr jackman in the best place of all for whativer way the deer come theyll hev to pass close either above or below himan thats maybe as weel for him wi his queer newfashioned rifle but at the heed o the pass is the next best place the only thing is that yell hev to tak sure aim for theres more room for them to stray an ye may chance to git only a lang shot  well then it is not the place for me for i am a poor shot said barret besides i have a fancy to stay here where i am  you say it is a very good spot ivor i understand  weel its no that bad as a spote answered the keeper with a grim smile for he had not much opinion of barrets spirit as a sportsman but its ackward as the lawnd lies  never mind  ill stay here and you know laird that i have some pleasant associations with it in connection with your niece  that is more than milly has returned the old gentleman laughing however have your way  now gentlemen we must place ourselves quickly for the beaters will soon be entering the wood  i will take you mr mabberly to a spot beyond the pass where you will be pretty sure of a shot  and macrummlewhere shall we place him  he can do nothing wi the gun at a sir muttered the keeper in a low voice so that he might not be overheard  i wad putt him doon at the white rock  hell git a lang shot at them there  of course hell miss but thatll do weel enough for himfor hes easy pleased ony way if he taks shootin as he taks fishin a mere sight o the deer like the rise o a salmon ll send him home happy  very well ivor arrange as you think best  and how about captain mcpherson and mcgregor  ill tak care o them mysel sir  ye need na fash yer heed aboot us laird said the skipper  bein more used to the sea than the mountains we will be content to look on iss that not so shames  that iss sowhatever returned the seaman  well come along then the beaters must be at work now  how many did you get ivor  im not exactly sure sir returned the keeper theres ian anderson an tonal from cove an mister archie an eddie an roderickthats five  oo ay i forgot theres that queer english loon robin tips hes no o much use but he can mak a noisebesides three o mr grants men  thats plentynow then  please father said junkie who had listened with open eyes and mouth as well as ears for this was his first deerstalk may i stop with mr barret  certainly my boy if mr barret does not object  of course mr barret did not object though he was rather surprised at this mark of preference  i say me boy whispered pat quin ask av i may stop wid ye  junkie looked at the irishman doubtfully for a moment then said  father quin says he wants to stop with me  you maynt do that quin returned the laird with a smile but you may go and stay with your master  i heard him say that he would like you to be with him to keep you out of mischief  thankee sor  i was used to attend on im in the jungles to carry his spare guns for its ellyphints no less that we was used to bag out there but i make no question he can amuse himsilf wid deer an things like that where theres nothin better  he was always aisy to plaze like mr macrummle  just so quin and as macrummle knows the hill and has to pass the place where mr jackman has been left you had better follow him  this arranged the different parties took up their positions to await the result of the beating of a strip of dwarf forest several miles in extent which clothed part of the mountain slopes below the eagle cliff  on reaching the spot where jackman was stationed old macrummle explained to him the various arrangements that had just been made for the comfort of all  i am sorry they gave me the best place said jackman  i suppose it is because the laird thinks my experience in india entitles me to it but i would much rather that mabberly or barret had got the chance for im used to this sort of thing and after bagging elephants i can afford to lay on my oars and see my friends go in and win  an sure arent thim the very words i said sor put in quin  have they given you a good place asked jackman of macrummle taking no notice of his mans remarks  theyve given me the worst said the old man simply and i cannot blame them for as the keeper truly remarked i can do nothing with the gunstill less with the rifle he might have added  at the same time i confess it would have added somewhat to the zest of the day if ivor had allowed me some degree of hope  he thought i didnt overhear him but i did for they give me credit for greater deafness than i deserve  there was something so pitiful yet half amusing in the way in which this was said that jackman suddenly grasped the old gentlemans hand  mr macrummle he said firmly will you do me a favour  certainly with pleasureif i can  you canand you shall  it is this change places and rifles with me  my dear kind sir you dont know what you ask  my rifle is an old doublebarrel muzzle loader and at the white rock you wouldnt have the ghost of a chance  i know the place well having often passed it in fishing excursions up the burns  besides i never used a repeating rifle in my life  i couldnt manage it even if i were to try  mr macrummle are you not a highlander  i believe i am replied the old man drawing himself up with a smile  and is not that equivalent to saying that you are a man of your word  welli suppose it is soat least it should be so  but you will prove that it is not so if you fail to do me a favour that lies in your power after promising to do it  come now we have no time to lose  i will show you how to use the repeater  see it is empty just now  all you have to do is to take aim as you would with any ordinary rifle and pull the trigger  when the shot is off you load again by simply doing this to the triggerguardso  dyou understand  yes perfectly but is that all no putting in of cartridges anywhere  no nothing more  simply do that openand the cartridge flies out and that shutand you are loaded and ready to fire  now try it  thats it  capital  couldnt be better  why you were born to be a sportsman  yes with fish remarked the gratified old man as he went through the motions of loading and firing to perfection  now then i will load it thus  watch me  as he spoke he filled the chamber under the barrel with cartridge after cartridge to the amazement of macrummle and the amusement of quin who looked on  how many shots will it fire without reloading asked the old man at length  sixteen replied jackman  what sixteen  butbut how will i ever know how many ive let off  you dont require to know  just blaze away till it refuses to fire now i must be off  where is this white rock that i have to go to  there it islook  a good bit down the hill on the open ground near the forest  if you have good eyes you can see it from here  look just behind the ridge  dyou see  i see  great luck to you  do good work and teach that rascal ivor to respect your powers with the rifle  come along quin  but really my young friend it is too good too selfdenying of you to  he stopped for jackman and quin were already striding down the mountain on their way to the white rock  macrummle had been somewhat excited by the enthusiasm of his young friend and the novelty of his situation  to say truth he would much rather have been pottering along the banks of one of his loved highland streams rod in hand than crouching in the best pass of the eagle cliff in expectation of reddeer but being an amiable and sympathetic man he had been fired by the enthusiasm of the household that morning and seeing that all were going to the drive including the laird he made up his mind to brace himself up to the effort and float with the current his enthusiasm had not cooled when he reached the eagle cliff and jackmans kindness coupled with hope and the repeating rifle increased it even to white heat  in which condition he sat down on a rock removed his hat and wiped his bald perspiring head while a benignant smile illuminated his glowing features  about the same time barret and junkie having selected a convenient mass of rock as their outlook so that they could command the pass for some distance in both directions without exposing themselves to view rested the rifle against the cliff and began to talk  soon the young man discovered that the little boy like many other mischievous boys was of an exceedingly inquiring disposition  among other things he not only began an intelligent inquiry about the locks of a rifle but a practical inquiry with his fingers which called for remonstrance  do you know junkie that this is the very spot where your cousin milly fell said barret by way of directing the urchins thoughts into a safer channel  is it  oh dear what a thump she must have come down  yes indeed a dreadful thumppoor thing  she was trying to get flowers at the time  do you know that she is exceedingly fond of flowers  oh dont i  shes got books full of themall pasted in with names printed under them  i often wonder what she sees in flowers to be so fond of them  i dont care a button for them myself unless they smell nice  but i often scramble after them for her  there is a good deal to like in flowers besides the smell said barret assuming an instructive tone which junkie resented on the spot  oh yes i dont want to know you neednt try to teach me he said firmly  of course not  i wouldnt think of teaching you my boy  you know im not a schoolmaster  im not clever enough for that and when i was your age i hated to be taught  but i could show you some things about flowers and plants that would astonish you  only it would not be safe to do it just now for the deer might come up and  no they wont interrupted the boy its a monstrous big wood theyve got to pass through before they can come here so we have time to look at some of the stonishin things  well then come  we will just go a little way up the cliff  leading junkie away among the masses of fallen rock which strewed that ledge of the cliff the wily youth began to examine plants and flowers minutely and to gradually arouse in the boys mind an interest in such parts of botanical science as he was capable of understanding  meanwhile the small army of beaters had extended themselves across the distant end of the forest which being some miles off and on the other side of a great shoulder of the mountain was not only out of sight but out of hearing of the stalkers who watched the passes of the eagle cliff  all the beaters or drivers were well acquainted with the work they had to do with the exception of robin tips to whom of course it was quite new  but ian anderson put him under donalds care with strict injunctions to look well after him  now tonal see that ye dont draw together an git taalkin so as to forget what yere about  keep him at the right distance away from ye an as much in line as ye can  oo ay returned ragged head in a tone that meant when translated into familiar english dont teach your grandmother to suck eggs  in a sequestered dell on the slope of the hills a lordly stag and several hinds were enjoying themselves that morning among the bracken and bright mosses partially screened from the sun by the overarching boughs of birch and hazel and solaced by the tinkling music of a neighbouring rill  thick underwood concealed the dell on all sides grey lichencovered boulders surrounded it no sound disturbed it save the faint cry of the plover and curlew on the distant shore or the flap of a hawks wing as it soared overhead  altogether it looked like a safe and sure retreat but it did not prove to be so  mingled with the plaintive cries of the wild fowl there came a faint barely perceptiblesound of the human voice  the stag pricked up his ears and raised his antlered head  it was by no means a new sound to him  the shepherds voice calling to his collie on the mountainside was a familiar sound that experience had taught him boded no evil  the converse of friends as they plodded along the roads or footpaths that often skirted his lairs had a tone of innocence about it which only induced cautionnot alarm  but there was nothing of this in the sounds that now met his ears  he raised himself higher opened his nostrils wider sniffed the tainted air and then turning his graceful head made some remarkwe presume though we cannot be positive on this pointto his wives  these meek and gentleas females usually are or ought to beturned their soft inquiring gaze on their lord  thus they stood as if spellbound while the sounds slowly but steadily increased in volume and approached their retreat  presently a shoulder of the mountain was turned by the drivers and their discordant voices came down on the gentle breeze with unmistakable significance  we regret being unable to report exactly what the stag then said to his wives but the result was that the entire family bounded from their retreat and in the hurry and alarm of the moment scattered along various glades all of which however trended ultimately towards those mountain fastnesses that exist about and beyond the eagle cliff  two of the hinds followed their lord in a direction which led them out of the wood within sight of though a considerable distance from the white rock behind which jackman and quin were concealed  the others fled by tracks somewhat higher on the hillsides where however as the reader knows the enemy was posted to intercept them  sure its a purty stag afther all whispered quin who in spite of elephantineindian sport was somewhat excited by this sudden appearance of the scottish reddeer  but theyre a long way off sor  not too far if the rifle is true said jackman in a very low voice as he put up the longrange sight  youll git a good chance at the stag whin he tops the hillock forenent you sor remarked the somewhat garrulous irishman  i wont fire at the stag quin returned jackman quietly  you and i have surely killed enough of bigger game abroad  we can afford to let the stag pass on to our friends higher up some of whom have never seen a reddeer before and may never have a chance of seeing one again  all this was said by the sportsman in a low soft voice which could not have been heard three yards off yet his sharp eye was fixed intently on the passing deer  seeing that there was no likelihood of their coming nearer he raised his rifle took steady but quick aim and fired  one of the hinds dropped at once the other followed her terrified lord as he dashed wildly up the slope  partial deafness is a slight disadvantage in deerstalking  so at least macrummle discovered that day  after having wiped his forehead as already described he set himself steadily to fulfil the duties of his situation  these were not so simple as one might suppose for as had been explained to him by jackman he had to watch two passesone close above his post the other close below iteither of which might bring the deer within easy reach of his rifle but of course there was the uncertainty as to which of the two passes the deer would choose  as it was a physical impossibility to have his eyes on both passes at once the old gentleman soon found that turning his head every few seconds from one side to the other became irksome  then it became painful  at last it became torture and then he gave up this plan in despair resolving to devote a minute at a time to each pass although feeling that by so doing his chances were greatly diminished  when jackman fired his shot macrummles ears refused to convey the information to his brain  he still sat there turning his head slowly to and fro and feeling rather sleepy  one of the scattered deer which had gone higher up the mountain passed him by the upper track macrummle was gazing at the lower track just then  having given the allotted time to it he turned languidly and beheld the hind trotting rather slowly for it was somewhat winded  the sight sent sportsmanfire through the old gentlemans entire frame he sprang he almost tumbled up but before he could fire a jealous boulder intervened  rushing up a few yards he was just in time to see the animal bound over a cliff and disappear  depressed beyond measure he returned to his post and resumed the rapid headmotion which he had foolishly discontinued  this was fortunate for it enabled him to see in time the stag and hind which jackman had sent bounding towards him  another moment and the affrighted creatures were within range  macrummle sprang up put the repeater to his shoulder and then commenced a fusillade that baffles description bang bang bang went the repeater bang bang doublebang and banging everywhere went the startled echoes of the mountain  never since it sprang from the volcanic forces of nature had the eagle cliff sent forth such a spout of rattling reverberation  the old man took no aim whatever  he merely went through the operations of load and fire with amazing rapidity  each crack delivered into the arms of echo was multiplied a hundredfold  showers of bullets seemed to hail around the astounded quarry  smoke as of a battle enshrouded the sportsman  the rifle became almost too hot to hold and when at last it ceased to respond to the drain upon its bankrupt magazine the stag and hind lay dead upon the track and macrummle lay exhausted with excitement and exertion upon the heather  this unwonted fusillade took the various parties higher up the hill by surprise  to ivor indeed it was quite a new experience and he regarded it with a smile of grim contempt  there iss noise enoughwhatever remarked skipper mcpherson who sat beside the keeper with a doublebarrelled gun charged with buckshot which he had in readiness  look look exclaimed ivor pointing to another part of the pass your friend mcgregor has got a fright  ay thats true  shames would be troubled in his mind i think  there was indeed some reason to suppose so  the worthy seaman having got tired of waiting had against ivors advice wandered a few yards along the pass where seeing something farther on that aroused his curiosity he laid down the singlebarrelled fowlingpiece with which he had been provided and began to clamber  just as the repeater opened fire two hinds which had got ahead of the others ran through the pass by different tracks  one of these mcgregor saw before it came up and he rushed wildly back for his gun  it was this act that his comrades rightly attributed to mental perturbation  look out whispered the keeper  as he spoke the other hind doubling round a mass of fallen rock almost leaped into mcgregors arms  it darted aside and the seaman uttering a wild shout half raised his gun and fired  the butt hit him on the chest and knocked him down while the shot went whizzing in all directions round his comrades cutting their garments but fortunately doing them no serious injury  oh shames ye was always in too great a hurry remonstrated the skipper oblivious of the fact that he himself had been too slow  quick man fire cried ivor testily  the captain tried to energise  in doing so he let off one barrel at the celestial orbs unintentionally  the other might as well have gone the same way for all the execution it did  when he looked at the keeper half apologetically he saw that he was quietly examining his leg which had been penetrated by a pellet  eh man are ee shot cried the captain anxiously  oo ay but im none the worse o it  i had a presentiment o somethin o this sort an loaded his gun wi small shot replied the keeper  profound were the expressions of apology from mcgregor on learning what he had done and patronisingly cool were the assurances of ivor that the injury was a mere fleabite  and intense was the astonishment when it was discovered that a stag and a hind had fallen to old macrummle with that treemendious repeater  and great was the laughter afterwards at lunch time on the field of battle when junkie gravely related that barret was upon a precipice trying to reach a rare plant when the deer passed so that he did not get a shot at all  and confused was the expression of barrets face when he admitted the fact though he carefully avoided stating that his mind was taken up at the time with a very different kind of dear  it was afternoon when the assembled party including drivers sat down to luncheon on the hillside and began to allay the cravings of appetite and at the same time to recount or discuss in more or less energetic tones the varied experiences of the morning  gradually the victuals were consumed and the experiences pretty well thrashed out including those of poor mabberly who had failed to get even a chance of a shot  an sure its no wonder at all was pat quins remark for the noise was almost as bad as that night when you an me sor was out after the elephants in that great hunt in the northwestern provinces of indy  oh do tell us about that cried junkie and his brothers turning eagerly to jackman  so i will my boys but not now  it will take too long  some other time in the house perhaps when a bad day comes  no now now cried junkie  seeing that most of those present had lighted their pipes and that the laird seemed to wish it jackman washed down his lunch with a glass of sparkling water cleared his throat and began    chapter eight  jackmans wonderful elephant story  once upon a time said jackman glancing at junkie and robin tips who sat before him openmouthed and openeyed as if ready to swallow anything  yes murmured junkie nodding thats the right way to begin  but you must not interrupt junkie  no i wont do it again but first tell me is it true  yes my boy it is absolutely true in all its main points replied jackman  well as i said once upon a time not very long ago i was sent up to the northwest provinces of india to a place near the base of the himalaya mountainrange  the country was swarming with elephants at that time  you see previous to that the elephants had been hunted and killed to such an extent that the government had been obliged to pass an elephant preservation act for their protection and the act worked so well that the elephants multiplied very fast  they roamed at will through the forests and frequently leaving these made raids upon the cultivated lands to the great damage of property and danger of human life from the rogues as old solitary elephants which have been driven from the herds are called  these rogues are extremely illnatured and dangerous so it was found necessary to take steps to kill some of them and thin the herds by capturing some of the females which might be tamed and made useful  for this purpose of hunting and catching elephants a hunt upon a truly magnificent scale was instituted  now as it is very difficult to kill such huge creatures and still more difficult to catch them men are obliged to call to their aid tame elephants which are trained for the purpose of what is called khedda hunting  but i dont mean to tell you either about the killing or catching just now  i shall rather relate an extraordinary and thrilling incident that occurred before the hunt had properly begun  great men from all parts of the country assembled at this hunt some of them bringing troops of tame elephants and followers with them  there were governors and rajahs and private secretaries with some of their wives military officers forest officers commissioners collectors superintendents magistrates surgeons medical officers and even clergymen besides a host of smaller fry and servants  it was a regular army  the maharajah of bulrampore sent sixtyfive catching elephants and five koonkies or fighting elephants among which was a famous warrior named chand moorut  along with these came a body of men trained to that special work  a good contingent also came from rampore  the rajah of khyrigarh came in person with thirteen elephants and a noted fighting animal named berchir bahadur other elephants were collected from the rajahs and native gentlemen around  among the koonkies or gladiators were two tremendous fellows both as to colossal size and courage named respectively raj mungul and isri pershad  but far before them all in towering height and stupendous weight and unconquerable courage as well as warlike tendency was the mighty chand moorut whom i first mentioned  this grand slowmoving sedate hero of a hundred fights was a sort of elephantine bulldog a concentrated earthquake an animal thunderbolt a suppressed volcano  nothing in the forests had yet been found which could stand before his onset  and when we saw him stalk solemnly into camp with his mahowt or guide looking like a small monkey on his great neck and remembered his fame as a fighter and his eager thirst at all times for battle we felt that the keystone had been put to the arch of our arrangements  this great mixed multitude was put under the direction of a conservator of forests a man celebrated for his exploits and daring adventures in the field and it was as a friend of his that i joined the hunt with my man pat quin there  troth sor an av it wasnt for chand moorut blissins on his great sowl av he has wan an on his body av he hasnt your man pat quin would have been left there as flat as a pancake  excuse me sor for spakin but me feelins overcomed me  no doubt quin you had a narrow escape ill come to that soon  well the spot at last chosen for pitching the camp was a splendid one facing northward where we had an extensive view of the great forests that stretched to the base of the irregular and rugged sawalick hills behind these rose the mighty himalayas themselves their grand peaks seeming to push up into the very heavens where the sun shone with dazzling brilliancy on their everlasting snows  the camp covered an immense piece of ground which was partly open and partly dotted with clumps of trees  it was so large that the tents etcetera were arranged in streets and our director pitched his tent in the very centre of it with all the tame elephants and their attendants around him  you may easily fancy that it was a noisy camp with so many hundreds of men and animals around full of excitement more or less about the coming fight for we had a number of men called trackers out in the woods who had brought in news that a herd of wild elephants had just been discovered in the saharanpur and dun forests on the banks of the ganges  the glens in these forests were known to be well suited for hunting purposes so our hopes and expectations were raised to a high pitch towards evening we had got pretty well settled down when a rumour got about the camp that one of the khedda elephants had killed a man and that it was highly probable he would run amuck to the great danger of every one  it happened thus  a big tusker named mowla buksh was being taken by his mahowt to drink and bathe according to custom when it was observed that the elephant seemed to be out of temper  just then one of the foddercutters chanced to pass by  keep out of his way cried the mahowt in a warning tone  theres something wrong with him today  i wont bathe him i think  oh he knows me well and wont harm me returned the cutter  the words were scarcely out of the mans mouth when the brute rushed at him knocked him down gored him with his tusks and kicked him after the fashion of enraged elephants  of course the poor man was instantly killed  when this deed was done mowlah buksh seemed to feel that having lost his character he might as well go on in his course of mischief  he became wild with fury and kept throwing his head back in a vain endeavour to seize his mahowt with his trunk and kill him also in this effort he failed  the mahowt though old was active and strong  he managed to hold on and sit so far back on the elephants hind quarters as to be just out of reach  luckily the brute did not think of shaking him off  had he attempted that he would soon have succeeded  the poor man would have fallen to the ground and been killed  finding that he could not accomplish his purpose the infuriated animal rushed towards the camp where the khedda or hunting elephants were and where as i have said our director had pitched his tent  my own tent was close beside his  the first i heard of what was going on was from quin who came running into my tent where i was sitting quietly at the time cleaning my rifle  quins eyes were starting out of his head and there was i assure you nothing of the pleasant smile that rests on his face at this moment  och sor gasped quin bowla muknomowla bukshhas gone mad entoirely  i jumped up quickly you may believe for i didnt often see that look on quins face and when i did i knew well that something very serious was in the wind  where away is he  i asked  sorrow wan o me knows sor said quin  rushing out with no very fixed purpose in view i soon found that the shouting in the camp was a sufficient guide to the spot where the mischief was going on  in a few minutes i came on a cordon of musketeers who had been hastily drawn up so as to prevent mowla buksh from getting at the other elephants for if he had succeeded in doing so he would certainly have gone knocking about the smaller ones perhaps maiming them and killing every man who might chance to come in his path  on the other hand if the musketeers managed to turn him there was the danger of his making for the main camp and killing every one he could lay hold of in that direction  of course the thought of turning out the big fighting elephants to master him occurred to every one but even here there would be risk for these gladiators would not rest content without knocking mowla buksh off his legs in which case the mahowt would assuredly be killed  besides our director chanced to be in the forest at the time and no one else seemed ready to take the responsibility of ordering them out  when i came up to the musketeers i saw the elephant rushing wildly about trying to find a way through them with the old mahowt sticking to his back like a burr  the bulrampore men shouted to him to try and get the elephant to go to his standingplace saying that if he could persuade him to sit down they would tie his legs up  after the brute had exhausted itself somewhat by rushing about the mahowt did succeed in recovering control so far as to persuade him to move to his standingplace which was not far distant and to our great relief he sat down in the usual way  the bulrampore men were as good as their word  smart hands every one they ran up with ropes and commenced tying up his hind legs  being experts at the work they manipulated the thick ropes with amazing rapidity and had the panting animal almost secured when he partially recovered and began to understand what was being done to him  he started up indignantly just before the knots were properly fastened and struck out right and left with his trunk scattering the men in all directions  although the ropes had not been quite secured they were sufficiently fast to impede his movements  he therefore took to venting his rage on the surrounding trees and really until that day i had not realised the prodigious strength of this king of beasts  he knocked and smashed them down right and left with the greatest possible ease although i do assure you some of them were fully eight inches in diameter  all this time the old mahowt was clinging to his back not daring to slip off  the men now began to lay large ropenooses about here and there in the hope that he would accidentally put a foot into one of them  but mowla buksh was much too knowing to be caught in this way  whenever he came across one of these nooses he took it up with his trunk and tossed it contemptuously aside  gradually he worked his way up to a cluster of trees near the tent in which our directors wife had been seated all the timewith what feelings i will not pretend to guess  in this cluster he spent two hours smashing down trees all the time and occasionally by way of variety trying to lay hold of the poor mahowt who was gradually becoming exhausted through terror and the exertion of holding on  strange to say now and then the man appeared to regain control over the beast though only for a few seconds  during one of these intervals he even succeeded in making mowla buksh partially sit down  och now or niver  off wid ye yelled a splitting voice close to my ear  i need not tell you whose voice that was or that its owner was skipping about like a gorilla almost as mad as the elephant  ah sor interrupted quin dont ye remimber how yourself wasbut ill have mercy on ye  go on sor  well i confess resumed jackman that i was a little excited however the bulrampore men echoed quins advice in eagerly expressed hindustani  the mahowt took it slipped to the ground and ran for his life  fortunately the excited mowla either did not perceive or did not care  he rose up and recommenced his work of destruction  all this time he had been freeing himself from the ropes with which he was imperfectly bound  at last he detached them entirely and began to make furious rushes in every direction  at that critical moment our director arrived on the scene  seeing how matters stood he at once gave orders to have the fighting elephants brought to the front as the only chance that remained to bring the mischief to an end  the orders were gladly and promptly obeyed  before they arrived however mowla buksh in one of his rushes came straight to where quin and i were standing  skippin sor ye said  well skipping  but we stopped skipping at once and took to running as hard as we could  we both ran through some soft reedy ground where the brute overtook us  i glanced over my shoulder and saw him knock quin into the rushes and set his enormous foot on him  oh was he killed exclaimed junkie with a look of consternation at the now heroic quin  there was a general burst of laughter in which junkie joined for he saw the absurdity of the question which sudden anxiety had forced from him  but why wasnt you killed he asked almost indignantly  whisht honey an yell hear av yell howld your tongue  you must know continued jackman that the place he had tumbled into was wet soft ground and quin has a sharp way of looking after his life  although half stunned he rolled to one side so that only the side of the great foot came down on his shoulder and thrust him deep into the mud  i stopped at once with a feeling of horror but without the slightest conception of what i meant to do and the horror was deepened as i saw the monster turn with the evident intention of completing his work  at that terrible moment the colossal forms of raj mungul isri pershad and the mighty chand moorut appeared coming towards us  mowla buksh did not carry out his deadly intentions  there was method in his madness  seeing the koonkies approach he retreated at once to the shelter of the cluster of trees and waited  i rushed forward expecting to find my man dead and flattened but he rose slowly as i came up and with an indescribable expression of countenance said arrah then but he was heavy  an that must have been truewhatever said mcgregor unable to restrain a comment at this point  what you remark is true likewise shames said the skipper  go onquick cried junkie eagerly  well our director gave orders to take raj mungul to the south side of the clump of trees isri pershad to the west and chand moorut to the east  it was impossible to let the last go in though he was impatient to do so for by that time it was getting dark and his mahowt would have probably been swept off his back by the branches and the risk of such a gladiator being let loose without a controlling hand was not to be thought of for a moment  the difficulty was got over by means of a ruse  two men were sent to the north side of the clump with orders to talk and attract the attention of mowla  the plan succeeded  the moment the still fuming brute heard their voices he went at them furiously  now was the chance for the heroic chand moorut and that warrior was never known to let an opportunity slip  no british bulldog ever gave or accepted a challenge with more hilarious alacrity than he  as soon as mowla came out of the trees chand moorut went at him with a rush that seemed incredible in such a mountain of usually slow and dignified flesh  but darkness coupled perhaps with haste interfered  he missed his mark and mowla buksh turning round dashed straight at the tent in front of which our director and a friend were standing  the friend who was a vc as well as a cool and intrepid sportsman directed the light of a lantern full on the monsters face till it was close upon him thus enabling the director to plant a bullet in his head  whether the shot gave him a headache or not i cannot tell  the only certain effect it had was to turn the animal aside and cause it to rush off in the direction of the main camp closely followed by isri pershad and raj mungul  chand moorut was held back in reserve  happily raj mungul managed to outstrip and turn the runaway and as mowla buksh came back chand moorut got another chance at him  need i say that he took advantage of it charging in like a live locomotive he sent the mad creature flyingas if it had been a mere kittenhead over heels into a small hollow  well done  capital shouted junkie at this point unable to restrain himself as with glittering eyes he glanced round the circle of listeners  a laugh at his enthusiasm seemed to junkie to endorse his sentiment so he turned to jackman and earnestly bade him to go on  there is not much to go on with now my boy continued the narrator for mowla buksh being down the fighting elephants took good care to punish him well before they let him up again  but as the encounter had aroused the combative propensities of chand moorut it was thought wise to remove him from the scene before he became too excited  this being managed by his mahowt the punishing of the rebel was left to isri pershad and raj mungul who did their work thoroughly  no sooner did the culprit scramble out of the hollow than isri pershad knocked him back into it and pummelled him heartily with trunk and legs  again mowla buksh rose and this time raj mungul gave him a tap on the forehead with his own ponderous head which sent him into a bed of giant rushes over the top of which his little tail was seen to wriggle viciously as he disappeared with a crash  there he would probably have been content to lie still for a time but his opponents had other views in regard to him  they went at him together and so cuffed kicked bumped and pummelled him that in about five minutes he was reduced to a pitiable state of humiliation  as quin truly remarked at the time his own mother would have failed to recognise him  just at this point to my surprise the old mahowt came forward with tears in his eyes and begged that his elephant might be spared  it had been punished quite sufficiently he thought  i was much impressed with this display of a tender forgiving spirit towards a brute that had done its very best to take his own life  but no one sympathised with him at the moment and the punishment was continued until mowla buksh was thoroughly subdued and compelled by his conquerors to return to his standingplace where he was finally and firmly secured  thus at last ended this exciting and most unexpected commencement to our hunt and the whole camp was soon after steeped in silence and repose  not a bad beginning eh junkie  yes but go on wi the hunt said the boy with eager promptitude a request which was loudly echoed by his brothers  no no boys youve had enough to digest for one day besides i see the cart coming up the road to fetch our deer  and perhaps your father has more work cut out for us  well not much replied the laird who had been quite as much interested in the elephant story as his sons  there is another drive on the east side of the hill which we have still time for though i dont expect much from it  however we can try it  come now lads well be going  shames said captain mcpherson as the party moved away from the lunchingground i wonder if a good thrashin like that would make the elephant a better beast afterwards  weel now captain mcphairson i dont think it would replied mcgregor after a pause for consideration  you are right shames said ian anderson the old fisherman who was a deepthinking man  it has always appeared to me that the object of poonishment is a not to make us coot but to make us obedient  then what for are ye always poonishin me an tellin me to be coot when ye say it wont make me coot asked donald  because tonal it iss my duty to tell ye to be coot although i cannot make ye coot ye rascal answered the fisherman sternly but i can make ye obey me by poonishin youay an i wull do it too  donald knew too well from experience that it was not safe to attempt arguing the question but he gave a peculiarly defiant shake of his ragged head which said as plainly as words that the time was coming when poonishment would cease to secure even obedienceat least in his case  you are right ian said jackman turning round for he had overheard the conversation  punishment compelled mowla buksh to walk to his standingplace and submit to be tied up for he did not dare to disobey with isri pershad and raj mungul standing guard over him but it certainly did not make him good  i went with many others to see him the next morning  on the way over to the elephant camp i saw the huge trees which he had smashed down in his rage lying about in all directions and on reaching his standingplace found him looking decidedly vicious and badtempered  it was quite evident that any one venturing within reach of his trunk would receive harsh treatment and no mercy  a small red spot in his great forehead showed that our directors aim had been a fairly good one though it had not hit the deadly spot in the centre  but i want to know said junkie who kept close to jackmans side thirsting for every word that fell from his lips why did the bullet not go in and kill bowly muksh  because the head of mowla buksh was too thick said jackman laughing you see to be a thickhead is not always a disadvantage  there you ought to take comfort from that junkie remarked his brother archie with that fine spirit of tenderness which is so often observable in brothers  ha ha ha yelled eddie with that delicacy of feeling which is equally common  hold your tongues growled junkiethe more classic shut up not having at that time found its way to the western isles  you must know junkie that all parts of an elephants head are not of equal thickness said jackman in that kindly confidential tone which tends so powerfully to soothe a ruffled spirit  the only point in an elephants forehead that can be pierced by a rifle ball is exactly in the centre  it is about the size of a saucer and if you miss that you might as well fire against the eagle cliff itself for the ball would only stick in the skull  with this explanation junkie was fain to rest content at the time for the party had reached a part of the hill where it became necessary to station the guns at their several posts  in regard to this drive we have only to say that it ended in nothing except heavy rain and a severe draft on the patience of the sportsmen without any reward save that which may be derived from mild martyrdom  now when the events which we have described were taking place on the mountains of loch lossie a very different scene was occurring in the nursery of kinlossie house  in that interesting apartment which was one of the chief country residences of the spirits row and smash little flora was seated all alone in the afternoon of that day  her seat was a low chair before her was a low table to match  on the table sat her favourite doll blackie to whom she was administering counsel of the gravest kind in tones the most solemn  the counsel we need scarcely say gave unquestionable proof that her mothers admonitions to herself had been thoroughly understood though not always acted on  flo was in the midst of one of her most pathetic appeals to blackie to be dood when her mother entered hastily  come with me darling to visit poor old mrs donaldson  she is not very well i hear  flo required no second bidding for she was extremely fond of the keepers motherand love needs no persuasion  as we have said mrs donaldsons little cottage stood behind that of her son ivor  it was very small consisting of only one apartment with a box bed and a few articles of old furniture the most cherished of which was a little clock with a staring face and a poor landscape on it  what caused the bruise maggie asked mrs gordon after much talk on the subject of fomentations and bandages  the old woman hesitated to tell but after a little pressing she said in half apologetic toneweel mem it was na ivors faut but the day before yesterday he cam infouye ken hes fond o his glass mem an he was swingin aboot his airms poor falla an withoot the least intention his haund cam doon wi sik a ding on my heed that knockit me doon  but he kens na aboot it so yell no speak ot to himor to the laird  you may depend upon it poor maggie that i will not  my mentioning it could do no good  and as you say ivor was not quite himself at the time  thankee mem thats just it  an hes the best sons to mewhan hes sober  soon afterwards a shout outside told that the sportsmen had returned from the hills so bidding the old woman goodbye mrs gordon and her sympathetic child returned to the house    chapter nine  a quiet day with a stirring termination  what fisher does not know the charm the calm delight of a quiet day by the riverside after it may be months of too much contact with society  on such an occasion a congenial comrade is an advantage but unless the comrade be congenial one is better alone  this may sound selfish to some ears but is it really so  when a man has all but immolated himself for ten or eleven months it may be on the altar of business art and social duty is a tremendous thirst for nature and solitude altogether selfish  we think not  and evidently macrummle thought not as he wandered one soft delightful morning rod in hand down to the riverside  the riverside  there is something restfully suggestive in the very words  the quiet pools the gurgling deeps the rushing rapids the rippling shallows the little cascadeswhat ardent hopes what wild suggestions what grand possibilities these have for the young what gentle excitations what pleasant even though sad memories for the old  of course the nonfisher knows nothing of all this  his terrestrial joys are limited poor thing  the painter indeed has some part in the matteras regards his own line so to speakand when he goes on what is vulgarly termed his own hook  we have profound sympathy with the painter  but for the poor fellow who neither fishes nor paints alas to be sure he may botanise  strange to say we had almost forgotten that and also geologise but our concern at present is with fishers or rather with that fishing enthusiast macrummle  the sunshine of his face was second only to that of nature  his visage beamed with satisfaction his eyes gleamed with hope as he sat down on the bank near to his first pool and began to select flies  we have probably given the impression that macrummle was alone but this is not strictly correct  in his own estimation he was indeed in absolute solitude and so far his felicity was unbroken but his steps had been dogged that morning and the dogger was junkie  that eccentric youngster possessed a mind which it is not easy to analyse or describe  one strong element in it however was curiosity another was ambition  the blending of these two qualities produced wonder in junkiewonder that he though as ardent a sportsman as macrummle should go forth frequently to fish and catch little or nothing while the old gentleman went out and was wont to return with baskets full to overflowing  there must be a secret of some sort  he did not like to ask what that secret was so he made up his mind to follow the old man and watch himnot of course with the slightest intention of doing anything sly or wrong but secretly because he was well aware that macrummle did not like to be distracted by company especially his company  following then at a respectful distance and relying for success very much on the fishers partial blindness and deafness junkie went out to have a day of it  he even went so far in the matter of forethought as to provide himself with a massive slice of bread and cheese to sustain him while carrying on his investigations  before he had got far from the house however he encountered donald of the ragged head who had hung about the place in hopes of another deerdrive and whom he styled tonal in semisarcastic imitation of old ian  him he at once took into his confidence  ill co wuth ye said donald  come along then  but mind if you make a noise or show yourself if you so much as cough or sneeze ill punch your head an tumble you into the river  fery coot said donald  and upon this clear understanding they advanced  the other members of the company at the house meanwhile had scattered in various directions to fish shoot paint or botanise according to fancy  we may explain here that there were several trouting streams in the vicinity of the house besides the river at the head of the loch thus it was that macrummle had a stream all to himself  at first the fisher tried fly to which he was partial but success did not attend his efforts  the water was not in the best condition for fly being rather swollen by recent rains  perseverance however was one of macrummles strong qualities  he was not to be easily beaten  there was a certain big boulder about the size of a dogcart near the mouth of the stream which narrowed its bed considerably and thus produced a formation of rock below water favourable to the shelter of fish  it also sent an oily ripple over the surface of the water which was favourable to the operations of the fisher  the old gentleman seldom failed to raise or hook a good seatrout there and always made his first cast with eager expectation  but the fish were either obdurate or blind that morning  they could not or they would not see with a slight but by no means desponding sigh the old man changed his cast and tried again  he knew every stone and ledge of the pool and cast again and again with consummate skill and unusual care  still without result  thats odd he muttered for being naturally a sociable man he found talking to himself an immense relief  try once more just at the tail o yon swirl dick my boy  his christian name was richard  no one would have presumed to call him dick but himself  no result following this appeal to the tail of the swirl he sat down on the bank and once more changed his hook  the nature of change might have been heard by the insects among the heather close by if they were listening for donald whispered to his companionhes coin to try pait  didnt i bid ye haud your tongue  ay  dot then  macrummle dropped a worm gently into the head of the pool and let it go with the current  instantly the line straightened the rod bent the reel spun and from the other side of the pool there leaped a lovely bar of silver which fell back to its native element with a considerable splash  a twopounder gasped donald unable to restrain his excitable spirit as he half rose  junkie had him by the throat in a moment and crammed his ragged head down among the heather  tonal he whispered remonstratively  i forgot whispered donald when the strong little hands relaxed ill not dot again  ye better no returned junkie with a shake of his fist that required no explanation  by this time the fish had darted like a lightning flash twice up stream once down three times across and twice into the air  at the same time the fisher had hurried up and down the bank had tripped over two stumps and a root had dropped his wideawake and had very nearly gone head foremost into the pool for his tackle was fine and his fish large  the fisherboy gasped  tonal said junkie in very low tones if ye dont behave better ill send ye away  it iss not easy but ill try said he  donald could say no more  the best of men or boys could do no more than try  we may as well say here at once however that his efforts at selfcontrol were crowned with success  he proved himself to be a great man in embryo by ruling his own spirit that day  in a few minutes the trout was landed by means of a miniature gaff which the fisher carried in his basket for the purpose of securing fish that were too heavy to be pulled out by the line  it was afterwards found to be a twoandahalf pounder which being an unusually good fish for that stream was the occasion of much rejoicing on the part of the old gentleman as he stood wiping his forehead and commenting on it  capital  not had such a fellow as that for more than a week  theres more where that came from but you must give the pool a rest dick  try the run higher up  in obedience to his own orders macrummle went up to a part of the stream where a high cliff on one side and a steepish bank on the other caused it to flow in a deep channel not much more than a couple of yards wide  at the head of the run was a ledge where fish were invariably captured  towards this spot the old man hurried eagerly  the two boys lay still in the heather allowed him to pass and then softly followed bending low and keeping as much as possible behind bushes and in hollows until they were again close upon him  ensconcing themselves in a convenient mass of heather they raised their heads and saw the fisher stepping carefully from rock to rock as he approached the run  rounded boulders large or small are never safe to walk on even for the young and active  macrummle found it so  his foot slipped and he sat down with undignified haste in a small pool of water  down went the boys heads that they might explode their laughter as softly as possible among the roots of the heather  wass it not funny whispered donald  i hope hes not hurt replied junkie raising his head cautiously  he saw that macrummle had risen and with a rueful expression of face was making insane and futile efforts to look at himself behind  a beaming smile overspread the boys face as he glanced at his companion for he knew well that the old gentleman cared little or nothing for water  and this was obviously the case for after squeezing as much water out of his nether garments as chose to come he proceeded to the head of the runs and resumed fishing  im beginnin to see throught murmured junkie after watching for some time  see he has hooked another  ye see tonal it must be lettin the hook drift away down under the ledges that does it  look hes got im  im thinking ye are right junkie  an the creat thing to know iss where the ledges lie  he keeps well back from the watter also  there maun be somethin in that whatever  ye wull be tryin it yoursel the morn maype  to this junkie vouchsafed no reply for the fisher having secured his fish was proceeding further up stream  when he was sufficiently far in advance the boys rose to their feet and again followed him  thus the trio occupied themselves all the forenoonmacrummle gradually filling his basket with fine seatrout junkie storing his inquisitive mind with piscatorial knowledge and dodges and donald enjoying himself in the mere act of wallowing about in heather and sunshine  about noon macrummle suddenly ceased to gaze intently on the water and placed his hand upon his waistcoat  time dick he murmured pulling out his watch  i knew it  commend me to nature  its the best timekeeper after allneeds no regulating  he was wrong as was frequently the case but it mattered little for there was no one to contradict him  let me see he muttered taking off his basket and drawing a newspaper parcel from the pocket of his coatin which operation he was induced by memory to make a last futile attempt to see himself behindwhat have they put up for me  the parcel when opened disclosed a tempting pile of meat sandwiches the old gentleman spread them out on a flattish boulder which served as an admirable table  having leaned his rod against a tree he emptied the basket on a grassy spot and arranged the silver bars in a row  then he sat down on his basket beside the table and gave himself up to food and contemplation  a goodly row he muttered as well as the ham sandwich would let him not a bad beginning and such a splendid dish  theres comfort in that for i hate useless work of any kind  a sort of an illustration this of the fitness of things  apparently the peculiar unfitness of simultaneous mastication and speech struck him for he paused a few moments then continuedyes fitness supplies for the table absolutely needed  healthy exercise a consequence  result felicity  the supplies checking speech again macrummle looked around him with benignant goodwill to man and beast expressed on his countenance  craning their necks over a bank and seeing the old gentleman thus pleasantly engaged the two boys sank into the heather and disappeared from view as completely as did clan alpines warriors true after they had been shown to fitz james by roderick dhu  like two sparrows in a purple nest they proceeded to enjoy themselves  now tonal we will grub said junkie  why whats the matter with you he asked on observing a sudden fall in his companions countenance  the matter repeated the boy  it iss the crub thats the matter for i hev not a crumb with me  now isnt that awful said junkie with a hypocritically woeful look we will just have to starve  but theres plenty of water he added in a consoling tone  here tonal take this leather cup an fill it ye can git down to the river by the back o the bluff without bein noticed  see that ye make no noise now  mind what i said to ye  while donald went at a slow sad pace to fetch water junkie spread his handkerchief on the ground and on this tablecloth laid out the following articles which he took from a small bag that he had carried slung on his shouldera very large piece of loaf bread a thick slice of cheese two hard biscuits an apple a bit of liquorice a mass of homemade toffee inseparably attached to a dirty bit of newspaper three peppermint lozenges and a gully knife with a broken blade  when donald returned and beheld this feast he opened his eyes wide then opening his mouth he was on the point of giving vent to a cheer when junkie stopped him with a glance and an ominous shake of the fist  it is to this day an undecided question which of those feasters enjoyed himself most  i always bring with me more than i can eat tonal so youre welcome to the half  fair play as daddy says although he sometimes keeps the fairest play to himself with which dutiful remark the urchin proceeded to divide the viands very justly  it did not take long to consume the whole  but macrummle was quicker even than they possibly because he had enticing work still before him the consequence was that he had resumed his rod unnoticed by the boys and in the process of his amusement had reached that part of the bank on the top of which they lay concealed  their devotion to lunch had prevented his approach being perceived and the first intimation they had of his near presence was the clatter of pebbles as he made a false step and the swish of his flies above their heads as he made a cast  the boys gazed at each other for one moment in silence then hastily stuffed the remnant of their feast into their pockets  suddenly the glengarry bonnet of junkie leaped mysteriously off his head and dropped on the heather behind him  hanked again growled macrummle from the riverbed below  every fisher knows the difficulty of casting a long line with a steep bank behind him  once already the old gentleman had hanked on the bank a little lower down but so slightly that a twitch brought the flies away  now however the hank was too complicated to give way to a twitch for the glengarry held hard on to the heather  in desperate haste junkie bending low tried to extract the hook  it need scarcely be said that a hook refuses to be extracted in haste  before he could free it the voice of macrummle was heard in sighs and gasps of mild exasperation as he scrambled up the bank to disentangle his line  there was no time for consideration  junkie dropped his cap and rolling behind a mass of rock squeezed himself into a crevice which was pretty well covered with pendent bracken  donald vanished in a somewhat similar fashion and both remaining perfectly still listened with palpitating hearts to macrummles approach  well well exclaimed the fisher in surprise its not every day i hook a fish like this  a glengarry  and junkies glengarry  the small rascal  crumbs too ha that accounts for it  he must have been having his lunch here yesterday and was so taken up with victuals that he forgot his cap when he went away  foolish boy  it is like his carelessness but hes not a bad little fellow for all that  he chuckled audibly at this point  junkie did the same inaudibly as he watched his old friend carefully disengage the hook but the expression of his face changed a little when he saw his cap consigned to the fishers pocket as he turned and descended to the stream  having given the fisher sufficient time to get away from the spot junkie emerged from his hidingplace  tonal he said in a low voice looking round ye may come oot noo man  hes safe away  the ragged head in a broad grin emerged from a clump of bracken  it wass awful amusin junkie wass it not  yes tonal it was but it wont be very amusin for me to go all the rest of the day bareheaded  donald sympathised with his friend on this point and assured him that he would have divided his cap with him as junkie had divided his lunch but for the fact that he never wore a cap at all and the ragged hair would neither divide nor come off  after this they resumed their work of dogging the fishers steps  it would require a volume to relate all that was said and done on that lovely afternoon if all were faithfully detailed but our space and the readers patience render it advisable to touch only on two points of interest  as the day advanced the heat became overpowering and to escape from the glare of the sun for a little the fisher took shelter under some very tall bracken on the bank near a deep pool  in order to secure a slight feeling of pleasurable expectation while resting he put on a baitcast dropped the worm into the deepest part of the pool propped up his rod with several stones and then lay down to watch  the turf happened to be soft and level  as a natural consequence the tired man fell sound asleep  whats to be done noo junkie  i dont know tonal  to make matters more exasperating at that moment the rod began to bend and the reel to spin jerkily  a fush exclaimed donald  looks like it returned his friend drily  i better gee a yell an wauken him suggested donald  yed better no said junkie shaking his fist  yonder iss the end o yer bonnet stickin oot o his pooch whatever said donald  youd better lie low an keep still said junkie and without further explanation of his intentions he went softly down the bank and crept towards the sleeper taking advantage of every stone and root and bush as he went along  really for a first attempt it was worthy of the child of a pawnee brave  macrummle was a heavy sleeper so junkie had no difficulty in recovering his cap  putting it on he returned the way he had come  that wass cliver man said the admiring donald when his friend rejoined him  junkie accepted the compliment with a dignified smile and then sat down to wait but it was a severe trial of patience to both of them for the old man slept steadily on and even snored  he seemed in short to have fairly gone to bed for the night  what say ye to bomb stanes at um suggested donald  an kill im maybe returned junkie with sarcasm in his eye  heave divits at um then  ay thats better  accordingly the two urchins tore up a mass of turf which was much too heavy to heave  lets rowd suggested the activeminded donald  as this also met the approval of junkie they carried the divit or mass of turf to the bank just above the sleeper and taking a careful aim let it go  the bank was not regular  a lump diverted the divit from its course and it plunged into the pool to the obvious discomposure of the fish which was still at intervals tugging at the line  another divit was tried but with similar result  a third clod went still further astray  the bombardment then became exciting as every kind of effort does when one begins to realise the beneficial effect of practice  i can see how it is whispered junkie as he carefully laid the next gun  if we keep more to the right itll hit that lump o grass glance into the hollow and  he stopped abruptly and both boys stood in crablike attitudes of expectation ready to fly for the divit took the exact course thus indicated and bounding down the bank hit macrummle fair on his broad back  the guilty ones dived like rabbits into the bracken  bless me exclaimed the old gentleman jumping up and shaking the dry earth off  this is most remarkable  i do believe ive been asleep but why the bank should take to crumbling down upon me is more than i can understand  hallo  a fish  you dont deserve such luck dick my boy  winding in the line in a way which proved that the divit had done him no harm he gave utterance to an exclamation of huge disgust as he drew an eel to the bank with the line entangled hopelessly about its shiny body  this was too much for macrummle  unable to face the misery of disentanglement he cut the line despatched the eel attached a new hook and continued his occupation  at the head of the pool in question the bank was so precipitous and high that the boys could see only the top of the rod swinging gracefully to and fro as the patient man pursued his sport  suddenly the top of the rod described a wild figure in the air and disappeared  at the same moment a heavy plunge was heard  hech hes tumled in the pool gasped donald  they rushed to the overhanging edge of the cliff and looked down  sure enough macrummle was in the water  they expected to see him swim for junkie knew he was an expert swimmer but the poor man was floating quietly down with the current his head under water  banged his heed whatever cried donald jumping up and bounding down the bank to the lower and shallow end of the pool  quick though he was junkie outran him but the unfortunate macrummle was unintentionally quicker than either for they found him stranded when they got there  running into the water they seized him by the hair and the collar of his coat and dragged him into the shallow part easily enough but they had not strength to haul him ashore  fetch a divit tonala big one an ill keep up his head  one of the masses of recent artillery was fetched and the fishers head was gently pillowed on it so as to be well out of the water  theres no cut that i can see said junkie inspecting the head critically hes only stunned i think  noo tonal cut away to the hoose  run as ye never ran before and tell them  ill stop beside him for fear his heed slips in again  donald went off like a shot  junkie went a few steps with him intending to fetch another divit  looking back he saw what made him sink into the heather and give a low whistle  donald heard it stopped and also hid himself for macrummle was seen trying to rise he succeeded and staggered to dry land when sitting down on a stone he felt himself all over with an anxious expression  then he felt a lump on the back of his head and smiled intelligently  after that he squeezed as much water out of his garments as he could quietly took down his rod ascertained that the fish in his basket were all right then looked with some perplexity at the big divit lying in the shallow close to where he stood and finally with a highly contented expression of countenance wended his way homeward  the two boys gave him time to get well out of sight in advance and then followed his example commenting sagely as they went on the desirability of possessing pluck in old age and on the value of the various lessons they had learned that day    chapter ten  a wildish chapter  it was the habit of our three friendsbob mabberly john barret and giles jackmanduring their residence at kinlossie to take a stroll together every morning before breakfast by the margin of the sea for they were fond of each others company and mabberly as a yachtsman had acquired the habit of early rising  he had also learned to appreciate the early morning hours as being those which present nature in her sweetest as well as her freshest aspectwhen everything seems more than at other periods of the day to be under the direct influence of a benignant creator  it was also the habit of captain mcpherson and his man james mcgregor to indulge daily in similar exercise at about the same hour but owing probably to their lives having been spent chiefly on the sea they were wont to ramble up a neighbouring glen in preference to sauntering on the shore  one bright calm morning however when the sky was all blue and the loch was like a mirror the two seamen took it into their heads to desert the glen and ramble along the shore  thus it came to pass that on returning homeward they encountered our three friends  it iss fery strange that we should foregather this mornin mr mabberly said the skipper after greeting the young men for shames an me was jist speakin aboot ye  we will be thinkin that it iss foolishness for hum an me to be stoppin here wastin our time when we ought to be at oor work  nonsense captain said mabberly surely you dont think that taking a holiday in a pleasant place like this is wasting time  besides i dont consider you free from your engagement to me  you were hired for the trip and that includes land as well as water so i wont give you your discharge till you have had a long rest and recruited yourselves after the shock to your nervous systems occasioned by the wreck and the swim to shore  a grim smile played on the skippers iron features when reference was made to his nerves and a flicker of some sort illumined the wooden visage of mcgregor  you are fery kind sir returned the skipper but we dont like to be receivin pay for doin nothin  you see neither shames nor me cares much for fushin in the burns or goin after the deer an theres no chance o raisin the yat from the pottom o the sea so if you hev no objection sir we will be goin by the steamer that arrives tomorrow i thought i would speak to you today for we will hev to start early in the mornin before youre up for it iss a long way well hev to go iss it not so shames  oo ay replied the seaman with more than ever of the nasal twang it iss a coot many miles to where the poat comes inso the poy tonal wass tellin me whatever  mabberly tried to persuade the men to remain a little longer but they were obdurate so he let them go knowing well that his father who was a wealthy merchant and shipowner would see to the interests of the men who had suffered in his sons service  as they retraced their steps to the house the skipper gave giles jackman some significant glances which induced him to fall behind the others  you want to speak with me privately i think skipper  yes sir i do replied the seaman with some embarrassment  but it iss not fery easy nor pleesant to do so  a man does not like to speak of another mans failins you see but as i am goin away im obleeged to do it  you will hev noticed sir that ivor tonalson iss raither fond of his tram  im afraid that i have observed thatpoor fellow  he is a goot man sir is tonalsona fery goot manwhen he iss sober but he hes got no power to resist the tram  an whiles he goes on the spree an then he gits wild wi dt you know sir  noo ever since we cam here ivor an me hes been great friends an it hes been heavy on my mind to see him like that for hes a fine man a superior person is ivor if he would only let alone the whusky  so i hev spoken to him wance or twiceserious like you know  at first he was not pleased but the last time i spoke he took it kindly an said he would think aboot what i had been sayin  noo its heavy on me the thoucht o goin away an leavin him in that state so i thoucht that maybe ye would tak the metter up sir an see what ye can do wi him  git him if ye can to become a total abstainer nothin less than that wull do wi a man in that condeetion  jackman was greatly surprised not only at the tenor of the skippers remarks but at the evidently deep feeling with which he spoke for up to that time the reticence and quiet coolness of the man had inclined him to think that his mind and feelings were in harmony with his rugged and sluggish exterior  it was therefore with something of warmth that he repliedi shall be only too happy to do as you wish captain all the more that i have had some serious thoughts and feelings in that direction  indeed i have made up my mind as it happens to speak to ivor on that very subject not knowing that you were already in the field  i am particularly sorry for his poor old mother who has suffered a great deal both mentally and physically on his account  ay thats the warst o it said the skipper  it wass the sicht o the poor wumin ailin in body an broken heartit that first set me at ivor  but how comes it captain that you plead so earnestly for total abstinence asked jackman with a smile  have i not heard you defend the idea of moderate drinking although you consented to sail in a teetotal yacht  mr jackman said the skipper with almost stern solemnity it iss all fery weel for men to speak aboot moderate drinkin when their feelins iss easy an their intellecs iss confused wi theories an fancies but men will change their tune when it iss brought home to themselves  let a man only see his brither or his mither or his faither on the high road to destruction wi drink an hell change his opeenion aboot moderate drinkinat least for hard drinkersay an hell change his practice too unless he iss ower auld or his stamick like timothys canna git on withoot it  an that minds me that i would tak it kind if ye would write an tell me how he gets on for i hev promised to become a total abstainer if he wull  that very afternoon while out shooting on the hills jackman opened the campaign by making some delicate approaches to the keeper on the subject in a general and indirect way but with what success he could not tell for ivor was respectfully reserved  about the same time john barret went off alone for a saunter in one of the nearest and most picturesque of the neighbouring glens  he had declined to accompany his comrades that day for reasons best known to himself  after writing a few letters to keep up appearances and to prevent his being regarded as a mere idler he went off as we have said to saunter in the glen  he had not sauntered far when he came upon a sight which is calculated whenever seen to arouse sentiments of interest in the most callous beholdera young lady painting  it would be wrong to say he was surprised but he was decidedly pleased to judge from the expression of his handsome face  he knew who the lady was for by that time he had studied the face and figure of milly moss until they had been indelibly photographed on hiswell on the sensitiveplate of his soul wherever that lay  milly had quite recovered from her accident by that time and had resumed her favourite pursuits  im very glad to have caught you at work at last miss moss he said on coming up to the picturesque spot on which her easel was erected  i wish much to receive that lesson which you so kindly promised to give me  i thought it was just the other way  did you not say that you would teach me some of those perplexing rules of perspective which my book lays down so elaboratelyand to me so incomprehensibly  i did but did not you promise to show me how to manipulate oilsin regard to which i know absolutely nothing  and as practice is of greater importance than theory you must be the teacher and i the pupil  upon this point they carried on a discussion until milly declaring she was wasting her time and losing the effects of light and shade went seriously to work on the canvas before her  barret whose natural colour was somewhat heightened stood at a respectful distance looking on  you are quite sure i hope said the youth that it does not disturb you to be overlooked  you know i would not presume to do so if you had not promised to permit me  my great desire for many a day has been to observe the process of painting in oils by one who understands it  how he reconciled this statement with the fact that he was not looking at the picture at all but at the little white hand that was deftly applying the brush and the beautiful little head that was moving itself so gracefully about while contemplating the work is more than we can explain  soon the painter became still more deeply absorbed in her work and the pupil more deeply still in the painter  it was a magnificent sweep of landscape that lay before thema glen glowing with purple and green alive with flickering sunlight and shadow with richest browns and reds and coolest greys in the foreground precipices crags verdant slopes of bracken pine and birch woods hanging on the hillsides in the middle distance and blue mountains mingling with orange skies in the background with macrummles favourite stream appearing here and there like a silver thread running through it all  but barret saw nothing of it  he only saw a pretty hand a blushing cheek and sunny hair  the picture was not bad  there was a good deal of crude colour in the foreground no doubt without much indication of form and there was also some wonderfully vivid green and purple with impossible forms and amazing perspectiveboth linear and aerialin places and turneresque confusion of yellow in the extreme distance  but barret did not note thatthough by means of some occult powers of comprehension he commented on it freely  he saw nothing but milly moss  it was a glorious chance  he resolved to make the most of it  i had no idea that painting in oils was such a fascinating occupation he remarked without feeling quite sure of what he said  i delight in it returned the painter slowly as she touched in a distant sheep whichmeasured by the rules of perspective and regard being had to surrounding objectsmight have stood for an average cathedral  milly did not paint as freely as usual that afternoon  there was something queer she said about the brushes  i cant get it to look right she said at last wiping out an object for the third time and trying again  no doubt murmured the youth a cottage like that must be difficult to  cottage exclaimed milly laughing outright it is not a cottage at all its a cow  oh  mr barret that is a very poor compliment to my work and to your own powers of discernment  nay miss moss retorted the pupil in some confusion but you have wiped it out twice confessing as you did so that you could not paint it  besides my remark referred to the cottage which i thought you were going to paintnot to your unsuccessful representations of the cow  the poor youth felt that his explanation was so lame that he was somewhat relieved when the current of their thoughts was diverted by a loud shouting in the road farther down the glen  a shade of annoyance however rested for a moment on the face of his companion for she recognised the voices and knew well that the quiet teteatete with her willing and intelligent pupil must now be interrupted  my cousins she remarked putting a touch on the cow that stamped that animal a lusus naturae for all time coming  another whoop told that the cousins were drawing near  in a few minutes they appeared in the path emerging from a clump of hazel bushes  they are evidently bent on a photographic expedition remarked barret as the boys approached junkie waving his hat with hilarious goodwill when he discovered the painters  and flo is with them said milly from which i conclude that they are having what junkie calls a day of it for whenever they are allowed to take flo they go in for a high holiday carrying provisions with them so as to be able to stay out from morning till night  the appearance of the young revellers fully bore out millys statement for they were all more or less burdened with the means or signs of enjoyment  archie carried his box of dry plates in his left hand and his camera and stand over his right shoulder eddie bore a colourbox and sketchingbook junkie wielded a small fishingrod and had a fishingbasket on his back and flo was encircled with daisy chains and crowned with laurel and heather besides which each of the boys had a small bag of provisions slung on his shoulder    hooray hooray   out for the day  sang or rather yelled junkie as he approached    ramble and roam   never go home  added archie setting down his camera and beginning to arrange it    all of us must   eat till we bust  junkie teached me zat said innocent flo with a look of grave surprise at the peals of laughter which her couplet drew from her brothers  yes thats what were goin to do said junkie weve had lunch at the foot of eagle glen and noo we are going up to glen orrack to dine and fish an paint an botanise  after that well cross over the swans neck an finish off the bustin business with supper on the seashore  lots of grub left yet you see  he swung round his little wallet as he spoke and held it up to view  would you like some cousin milly asked eddie opening his bag  all sorts here  bread cheese ginger snaps biscuits jamoh  i say the jampots broken  whatever shall we do  he dipped his fingers into his wallet as he spoke and brought them out magenta  their hilarity was dissipated suddenly and grave looks were bestowed on eddies digits until flos little voice arose like a strain of sweet music to dissipate the clouds  oh never mind she said is got anuzzer pot in my bag  this had been forgotten  the fact was verified by swift examination and felicity was restored  what are you going to photograph asked milly seeing that archie was busy making arrangements  you cousin milly  youve no notion what a splendid couple you and mr barret lookstuck up so picturesquely on that little mound with its rich foreground of bracken and the grey rock beside you and the peep through the bushes with big ben for a background and the easel tooso suggestive  there now im ready  by the way i might take you as a pair of lovers  poor milly became scarlet and suddenly devoted herself to the lusus naturae  barret took refuge in a loud laugh and then said  really one would suppose that you were a professional archie you order your sitters about with such selfsatisfied presumption  yes they always do that said milly recovering herself and looking calmly up from the cowwhich now resembled a megatheriumbut you must remember cousin archie that i am a painter and therefore understand about attitudes and all that much better than a mere photographer so if i condescend to sit you must take your orders from me  fire away then with your orders cried the impatient amateur  see sir i will sit thusas if painting said milly who was desperately anxious to have it over lest archie should make some awkward proposition  mr barret will stand behind me looking earnestly at the picture  admiringly interposed barret  not soearnestly as if getting a lesson said milly with a teachers severity and flo will sit thus at my feet taking care hold it dear of my palette  more likely to make a mess of it said junkie  now are you ready  steady  dont budge a finger cried archie removing the little leather cap  in her uncertainty as to which of her fingers she was not to budge flo nervously moved them all  youre movin flo whispered junkie  no im not said flo looking round indignantly  there i knew you couldnt hold your tongue junkie cried the photographer hastily replacing the cap  however i think i had it done before she moved  and lookyouve got the nigger in cried junkie snatching up the black doll which had been lying unobserved on its owners knee all the time  never mind thatll do no harm  now then soldiers form up an quick march said archie closing up his apparatus  we have got plenty of work before us and no time to waste  obedient to this rather inaccurately given word of command archies troops fell into line and with a whooping farewell continued their march up the glen  during the remainder of that beautiful afternoon the artist and pupil continued at their fascinating work  shall we take advantage of our knowledge to lift the curtain and tell in detail how milly introduced a few more megatheriums into her painting and violated nearly all the rules of perspective to say nothing of colour and chiarooscuro  shall we reveal the multitude of absurd remarks made by the pupil in his wild attempts at criticism of an art about which he knew next to nothing no it would be unwarrantablebase  merely remarking that painter and pupil were exceedingly happy and that they made no advance whatever in the art of painting we turn to another scene in the neighbourhood of kinlossie house  it was a wide grassfield from which the haycocks had recently been removed leaving it bare and uninteresting  nevertheless there were two points of interest in that field which merit special attention  one was a small black bull with magnificent horns the shaggiest of coats and the wickedest of eyes  the other was our friend macrummle taking a short cut through the field with a basket on his back a rod in one hand and an umbrella in the other  we may at once account for the strange presence of the latter article by explaining that on the day beforewhich was rainythe laird had with an umbrella accompanied his friend to his first pool in the river at which point their roads diverged that he had stayed to see macrummle make his first two or three casts during which time the sky cleared inducing the laird to close his umbrella and lean it against the bank after which he went away and forgot it  returning home the next day our angler found and took charge of it  that he had been successful that day was made plain not only by the extra stoop forward which was rendered necessary by the weight of his basket and the beaming satisfaction on his face but by the protruding tail of a grilse which was too large to find room for the whole of itself inside  youre a lucky man today dick murmured the enthusiastic angler to himself as he jogged across the field  had he known what was in store for him however he would have arrived at a very different estimate of his fortunes  the field as we have said was a large one  macrummle had reached the centre of it when the black bull standing beside the wall at its most distant corner seemed to feel resentment at this trespass on its domain  it suddenly bellowed in that low thunderous tone which is so awfully suggestive of conscious power  macrummle stopped short  he was naturally a brave man nevertheless his heart gave his ribs an unwonted thump when he observed the bull in the distance glaring at him  he looked round in alarm  nothing but an unbroken flat for a hundred yards lay around him in all directions unrelieved by bush rock or tree and bounded by a fivefoot wall with only one gate near to where the bull stood pawing the earth and apparently working itself into a rage  now dick murmured the old gentleman seriously its do or die with you if that brute charges for your legs are not much better than pipestems and your wind iseh he comes  turning sharply he caused the pipestems to wag with amazing velocity too fast indeed for his toe catching on something sent him violently to the ground and the basket flew over his head with such force that the strap gave way  he sprang up instantly still unconsciously holding on to rod and umbrella  meanwhile the bull having made up its mind came charging down the field with its eyes flashing and its tail on high  macrummle looked back  he saw that the case was hopeless  he was already exhausted and gasping  a young man could scarcely have reached the wall in time  suddenly he came to a ditch one of those narrow open drains with which inhabitants of wet countries are familiar  the sight of it shot a blaze of hope through his despair  he stopped at once dropped his rod and putting up his umbrella laid it on the ground it was a large cotton one of the gamp description  under the shelter of it he stepped quietly into the ditch which was not much more than kneedeep with very little water in it  placing the umbrella in such a position that it came between himself and the bull he laid himself flat down in the drain  the opening was far too narrow to admit his broad shoulders except when turned sidewise the same treatment was not applicable to other parts of his person but by dint of squeezing and collapsing he got down nestled under the bank and lay still  on came the bull till it reached the basket which with a deft toss it hurled into the air and sent the silvery treasure flying  a moment more and it went head foremost into the umbrella  whether it was surprised at finding its enemy so light and unsubstantial or at the slipping of one of its feet into the drain we cannot tell but the result was that it came down and turned a complete somersault over the drain carrying the umbrella along with it in its mad career  when the bull scrambled to its feet again and looked round in some surprise it found that one of its legs and both its horns were through and entangled with the wrecked article  it was a fine sight to witness the furious battle that immediately ensued between the black bull and that cotton umbrella  rage at the man was evidently transmuted into horror at the article  the bull pranced and shook its head and pawed about in vain efforts to get rid of its tormenter  shreds of the wreck flapped wildly in its eyes  spiderlike ribs clung to its massive limbs and poked its reeking sides while the swaying handle kept tapping its cheeks and ears and nose as if taunting the creature with being held and badgered by a thing so flimsy and insignificant  happily this stirring incident was not altogether unwitnessed  far up the valley it was observed by four living creatures three of whom immediately came tearing down the road at racing speed  gradually their different powers separated them from each other  archie came first eddie next and junkie brought up the rear  on nearing the field the first wrenched a stake out of a fence the second caught up a rake that had been left by the haymakers and the last unscrewing the butt of his rod broke the line and flourished the weapon as a cudgel  they all three leaped into the field one after another and bore courageously down on the bull being well accustomed to deal with animals of the sort  separating as they drew near they attacked him on three sides at once short work would he have made with any of them singly together they were more than his match  when he charged junkie archie ran in and brought the stake down on his skull  when he turned on his assailant eddie combed his sides with the rake  dashing at the new foe he was caught by the tail by junkie who applied the butt of his rod vigorously the reel adding considerable weight to his blows  at last the bull was cowedif we may venture to say soand driven ignominiously into a corner of the field where he vented his rage on the remnants of the umbrella while the victors returned to the field of battle  but whats come of macrummle said the panting junkie as they gathered up the fish and replaced them in the basket  i never saw him get over the wall  did you  no replied archie looking round in surprise  i dare say he ran off while we were thumpin the bull suggested eddie  im here boys  im here junkie cried a strange sepulchral voice as if from the bowels of the earth  where asked the boys gazing down at their feet with expressions of awe  hes i the drain cried junkie with an expanding mouth  aythats it  im in the drain  lend a hand boys i can hardly move  they ran to him instantly but it required the united powers of all three to get him out and when they succeeded he was found to be coated all over one side with thick mud  what a muddle youve made of yourself to be sure exclaimed junkie let me scrape you  but macrummle refused to be scraped until they had placed the fivefoot wall between himself and the black bull  then he submitted with a profound sigh    chapter eleven  peculiar incidents of a sabbath among the western isles  one beautiful sunday morning while the party assembled in kinlossie house was at breakfast a message was brought to the laird that he wass wantit to speak wi the poy tonal  well donald my lad what want ye with me this fine morning asked the laird on going out to the hall  i wass telt to tell ye thell be no kirk the day for the ministers got to preach at drumquaich  very well donald  have you had breakfast  oo ay  go into the kitchen then and they will give you some more  thenkee sir  i find said the laird on returning to his friends that we are to have no service today in our little church as our minister has to take the duty at drumquaich on the other side of the loch  so those of you who are bent on going to church must make up your minds to cross the loch in the boat  is drumquaich the little village close under the pine wood that we see on doubling eagle point asked mabberly  the same  the little church there like our own is not supplied regularly  sometimes a divinity student is sent down to them occasionally they have a great gun from edinburgh  i think some of the students are better than the great guns remarked mrs gordon quietly  true my dear and that is most natural for it stands to reason that some at least of the students must be the great guns of the future in embryo and they have the freshness of youth to set against the weight of erudition  the student who preached to us here last sunday observed barret must surely be an embryo great gun for he treated his subject in a learned and masterly way that amazed me  from the look of him i would not have expected even an average discourse  that was partly owing to his modest air and reticence returned the laird  if you heard him converse on what he would call metapheesical subjects you would perhaps have been still more surprised  well i hope he will preach today said barret  from which i conclude that you will be one of the boat party  my wife and milly make three myself four who else  nodont count me interrupted the hostess i must stay with flo besides i must visit poor mrs donaldson who is again laid up  but ill be glad if you will take aggy anderson  ever since the poor girl came here for a little change of air she has been longing to go out in the boat  i really believe it is a natural craving for the free fresh breezes of the sea  may she go  by all means as many as the boat will hold returned the laird  it was finally arranged that besides those already mentioned mabberly jackman macrummle quin the three boys roderick the groom and ian anderson as boatman in charge should cross over to the little church at drumquaich about eight miles distant by water  while they were getting ready mrs gordon and flo with the beloved black dolly paid a visit to old molly the keepers mother  they found her in her armchair sitting by the large open chimney on the hearth of which a very small fire was burningnot for the sake of warmth but for the boiling of an iron pot which hung over it  the old woman was enveloped in a large warm shawla gift from the hoose  she also wore a closefitting white cap or mutch which was secured to her head by a broad black ribbon  the rims of her spectacles were of tortoiseshell and she had a huge family bible on her knee while her feet rested upon a threelegged stool  she looked up inquiringly as her visitors entered  why molly i thought you were in bed  they told me you were ill  na mem im weel eneuch in body its the speerit thats ill  and ye ken why  she spoke in a faint quavering voice for her old heart had been crushed by her wayward selfindulgent son and a few tears rolled down her wrinkled cheeks but she was too old and feeble to give way to demonstrative grief  little flo whose heart was easily touched went close to the poor old woman and looked up anxiously in her face  my bonny doo  its a pleasure to look at ye said the old woman laying her hand on the childs head  mrs gordon drew in a chair and sat down by her side  tell me about it she said confidentially has he given way again after all his promises to mr jackman  oo ay maister jackmans a fine man but he canna change the hert o my sonthough it is kind o him to try  no the only consolation i hev is here  she laid her hand on the open bible  where is he just now asked the lady  as she spoke a fierce yell was heard issuing from the keepers cottage which as we have said stood close to his mothers abode  ye hear till im said the old woman with a sorrowful shake of the head  he iss fery pad the day  whiles he thinks that horrible craters are crawlin ower him an whiles that fearful bogles are glowerin at him  sometimes he fancies that the foul fiend himsel has gotten haud o him an then he screeches as ye hear  would it do any good molly if i were to go and speak to him think you  na yed better let him lie  hes no hissel the now and theres no sayin what he might do  oh drink drink cried the old creature clasping her hands ye took my man awa an now yere ruinin my son but she added with sudden animation we can pray for him though it iss not possible for you or maister jackman to change my bairns hert the lord can do it for wi him a things are possible  to this mrs gordon gave a hearty assent  sitting still as she was with hand resting on the old womans arm she shut her eyes and prayed fervently for the salvation of the enslaved man  she was still engaged in this act of worship when another shriek was heard  at the same time the door of the keepers cottage was heard to open and ivors feet were heard staggering towards his mothers cottage  poor flo took refuge in great alarm behind mrs donaldson while her mother rising quickly drew back a few paces  next moment the small door was burst open and the keeper plunged almost fell into the room with something like a savage cheer  he was a terrible sight  with wildly dishevelled hair bloodshot eyes and distorted features he stood for a few seconds glaring at his mother his tall figure swaying to and fro while he held a quart bottle aloft in his right hand  he did not appear to observe the visitors but continued to stare at his mother with an expression that perplexed her accustomed though she was to his various moods  see mother he shouted fiercely i have done wi the accursed thing at last  he dashed the bottle on the hearth with tremendous violence as he spoke so that it vanished into minute fragments while its contents spurted about in all directions  happily very little of it went into the fire else the cottage would have been set ablaze  with another wild laugh the man wheeled round staggered out of the cottage and went his way  you are not hurt i trust said the lady anxiously bending down over the poor old creature who had remained calmly seated in her chair without the slightest appearance of alarm  no im not hurt thank the lord she answered  dont you think that that was an answer to our prayer asked the lady with some eagerness  old molly shook her head dubiously  it may be so she replied but i hev often seen im i that mind and he has gone back to it again and again like the soo that was washed to her wallowin i the mire  yet there did seem somethin different aboot im the day she added thoughtfully but it iss not the first time i hev prayed for him without gettin an answer  answers do not always come as we expect them returned her visitor yet they may be granted even while we are asking  i dont know how it is but i feel sure that jesus will save your son  poor little flo who had been deeply affected by the terrible appearance of her favourite ivor and who had never seen him in such a plight before quietly slipped out of old mollys hut and went straight to that of the keeper  she found him seated on a chair with his elbows on his knees his forehead resting on his hands and his strong fingers grasping his hair as if about to tear it out by the roots  flo who was naturally fearless and trustful ran straight to him and placed a hand on his shoulder  he started and looked round  bairn bairn he said grasping her little head and kissing her forehead what brings ye here  muzzer says she is sure jesus will save you so i came to tell you for muzzer never says whats not true  having delivered her consoling message flo ran back at once to mollys cottage with the cheerful remark that it was all right now for she had told ivor that he was going to be saved  while mrs gordon and flo were thus engaged on shore the boat party were rowing swiftly down the loch to the little hamlet of drumquaich the weather was magnificent  not a breath of air stirred the surface of the sea so that every little white cloud in the sky was perfectly reproduced in the concave below  the gulls that floated on the white expanse seemed each to be resting on its own inverted image and the boat would have appeared in similar aspect but for the shivering of the mirror by its oars  most appropriate type of sabbath rest said jackman  ay but like all things here pelow remarked ian anderson who possessed in a high degree the faculty of disputation its not likely to last long  what makes you think so ian asked milly who sat in the stern of the boat between john barret and aggy anderson  well you see muss began ian in his slow nasal tone the gless has bin fallin for some time past antonal poy mind your helm see where youre steerin to  donald who steered was watching with profound interest the operations of junkie who had slily and gravely fastened a piece of twine to a back button of macrummles coat and tied him to the thwart on which he sat being thus sternly asked where he was steering to donald replied oo ay and quickly corrected the course  but surely returned milly there is no sign of a rapid change at least if we may judge from the aspect of nature and i am a fervent believer in nature whatever the glass may predict  i am not sure o that muss said ian  you neednt pull quite so hard muster mabberly we hev plenty o time  tak it easy  well as i wass sayin muss i hev seen it as calm as this i the mornin mony a time an plowin a gale at nicht  let us hope that that wont be our experience today said the laird anyhow we have a good seaboat under us  weel the poats no a pad wan laird but i hev seen petter  you see when the wund iss richt astern she iss given to trinkin  thats like ivor said junkie with a laugh only he is given to drinkin no matter how the wind blows  what do you mean asked milly much perplexed  barret here explained that a boat which takes in much water over the bow is said to be given to drinking  im inclined that way myself said jackman who had been pulling hard at one of the oars up to that time  has any one thought of bringing a bottle of water  heres a bottle cried macrummle laughing  ah sure an there seems to be a bottle o milk or somethin white under the thort remarked quin who pulled the bow oar  but thats millys bottle of milk shouted junkie  and aggys chimed in eddie  yesno one must touch that said junkie  quite right boys said jackman besides milk is not good for quenching thirst  on search being made it was found that water had not been brought with them so that the thirsty rowers had to rest content without it  is that eagle cliff i see just over the knoll there asked barret  it is answered the laird dont you see the eagle himself like a black speck hovering above it  my shepherd would gladly see the bird killed for he and his wife make sad havoc among the lambs sometimes but i cant say that i sympathise with the shepherd  an eagle is a noble bird and there are none too many of them now in this country  i agree with you heartily said barret and i would regard the man who should kill that eagle as little better than a murderer  quite as bad as a murderer said milly with energy  i am glad you speak out so clearly mr barret for i fear there are some among us who would not hesitate to shoot if the poor bird were to come within range  pray dont look so pointedly at me miss moss said jackman i assure you i have no intention of attempting murderat least not in that direction  och an its murder enough youve done already for wan man said quin in an undertone  oh  i say that reminds me  do tell us the rest of the story of the elephant hunt mr jackman cried junkie  not just now my boy  its a long story  besides we are on our way to church  some other time i will tell it you  it would take half the romance away from my mothers visit if the eagle were killed remarked milly who did not overhear the elephant parenthesis  has your mother then decided to come asked barret  yes  in spite of the sea which she dreads and steamers which she hates she has made up her mind to come and take me home  how charming that will be said barret  indeed returned milly with a significant look and smile  of course i did not mean that returned barret laughing  i meant that it would be charming for you to have your mother out here and to return home in her company  is she likely to stay long  i cannot tell  that depends on so many things  but i am sure of one thing that she longs to see and thank you for the great service you rendered me on the day of your arrival here  barret began to protest that the service was a comparatively small one and such as any man might gladly render to any one when the arrival of the boat at the landingplace cut him short  about thirty or forty people had assembled from the surrounding districts some of whom had come four or even six miles to attend church  they formed a quiet grave orderly company of men and women in homespun garments with only a few children among them  the arrival of the lairds party made a very considerable addition to the congregation and as the hour for meeting had already passed by a few minutes they made a general move towards the church  the building was wonderfully small and in the most severely simple style of architecture being merely an oblong structure of grey stone with small square windows and a belfry at one end of the roof  it might have been mistaken for a cottage but for this and the door being protected by a small porch and placed at one end of the structure instead of at the side  a few of the younger men remained outside in conversation awaiting the advent of the minister  after a time however these dropped in and took their seats and people began to wonder why the minister was so late  presently a boy with bare legs and a kilt entered the church and whispered to a very old man who turned out to be an elder  having heard the boys message the elder crossed over to the pew in which the laird was seated and whispered to him not so low however as to prevent giles jackman from hearing all that passed  the ministers horse had fallen he said and bruised the ministers legs so that he could not officiate  very awkward returned the laird knitting his brows  whats to be done  it seems absurd that so many of us should assemble here just to look solemn for a few minutes and then go home  yes sir it iss akward said the elder  could you not gif us a discoorse yoursel sir from the prezenters dask  the latter part of the proposition was to guard himself from the imputation of having asked the laird to mount the pulpit  me preach exclaimed the laird i never did such a thing in my life  maype youll read a chapter whatever persisted the elder  impossible  i never read a chapter since i was bornin public i mean of course  but why not do it yourself man  so i would sir but my throatll not stand it  is there no other elder who could do it  not wan sir  im afraid we will hev to dismiss the congregation  at this point to the lairds relief and no little surprise jackman leaned forward and said in a low voice if you have no objection i will undertake to conduct the service  the elder gave the laird a look which if it had been translated into words would probably have conveyed the ideais he orthodox  by all means mr jackman said the laird you will be doing us a great favour  accordingly jackman went quietly to the precentors desk and mounted it much to the surprise of its proper occupant a man with a voice like a brass trumpet who thereupon took his seat on a chair below the desk  profound was the interest of the congregation when they saw this bronzed broadshouldered bigbearded young man pull a small bible out of his pocket and begin to turn over the leaves  and it was noted with additional interest by several of the people that the bible seemed to be a wellworn one  looking up from it after a few minutes during which it was observed that his eyes had been closed jackman said in an easy conversational tone that quite took the people by surprise  friends it has been my lot in life to wander for some years in wild and distant lands where ministers of the gospel were few and far between and where christians were obliged to conduct the worship of god as best they could  your minister being unable to attend owing to an accident which i trust may not turn out to be serious i shall attempt with the permission of your elder to lead your thoughts godward in dependence on the holy spirit  let us pray  the jealous ears of the rigorously orthodox heard him thus far without being able to detect absolute heresy though they were sensitively alive to the unusual style and very unclerical tone of the speakers voice the same ears listened reverently to the prayer which followed for it was after the pattern of the lords prayer almost startlingly short still it was very earnest extremely simple and all things considered undeniably orthodox  relieved in their minds therefore the people prepared themselves for more and the precentor with the brazen but tuneful voice sang the first line of the psalm which the young preacher gave outi to the hills will lift mine eyeswith rasping energy  at the second line the congregation joined in and sang praise with reverent goodwill so that when a chapter of the word had been read and another psalm sung they were brought to a state of hopeful expectancy  the text still further pleased them when in a quiet voice while turning over the leaves of the wellused bible jackman said in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths  laying down his little bible and looking at the people earnestly and in silence for a few moments the preacher said  i have travelled in italy france germany switzerland and other places and i never yet went in these countries without a guidebook more than that never in all my experience have i seen men or women travelling in these countries without a guidebook  the travellers always carried their guidebooks in their hands or in their pockets and consulted them as they went along  in the evenings round the tables or on the sofas of the salons they would sometimes sit poring over the pages of their guidebooks considering distances and the best routes and the cost of travelling and board  any man who would have travelled without a guidebook or who having one neglected to use it would have been considered weakminded at the least  still further i have noted that such travellers believed in their guidebooks and usually acted on the advice and directions therein given  but one journey i can tell of in which all this seems to be reversed the journey from earth towards heaven  and here is our guidebook for that journey said the preacher holding up the little bible  how do we treat it  i do not ask scoffers who profess not to believe in the bible  i ask those who call themselves christians and who would be highly offended if we ventured to doubt their christianity  is it not true that many of us consult our guidebook very much as a matter of form and habit without much real belief that it will serve us in all the minute details of life  we all wish to get on in life  the most obstinate and contradictory man on earth admits that  even if he denies it with his lips all his actions prove that he admits it  well what says our guidebook in regard to what is called getting on  in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct thy paths  now what could be simplerwe might even say what could be easierthan this him whom we have to acknowledge is defined in the previous verse as the lordthat is jesus immanuel or god with us  from this point the sunburnt preacher diverged into illustration leaning over the desk in a freeandeasy confidential way and thrilling his audience with incidents in his own adventurous career which bore directly on the great truth that as regards the great end of life success and blessedness result from acknowledging the lord and that failure and disaster inevitably await those who ignore him  while jackman proceeded with his discourse the sky had become overcast dark thunderclouds had been gathering in the noreast rain had also begun to descend yet so intently were the people listening to this unusual style of preacher that few of them observed the change until a distant thunderclap awoke them to it  quietly but promptly jackman drew his discourse to a close and stepped out of the desk remarking in the very same voice with which he had preached that he feared he had kept them too long and that he hoped none of the congregation had far to go  we hev that sir said the old elder shaking him warmly by the hand but we dont heed that an we are fery glad that we came whatever  as the wind had also risen and it seemed as if the weather was not likely to improve the laird hurried his party down to the boat waterproofs were put on umbrellas were put up the sails were hoisted and the boat put off  i fear the sea is very rough remarked milly moss drawing close to aggy anderson so as to shelter her somewhat from the driving rain  oo ay it iss a wee rough assented ian who now took the helm but we wull soon rin ower  haud you the main sheet mr mabberly an pe ready to let co when i tell ye  it iss a wee thing squally  it was indeed a little more than a wee thing squally for just then a vivid flash of lightning was seen to glitter among the distant crags of the eagle cliff  this was followed by a loud clap of thunder which leaping from cliff to crag reverberated among the mountains with a succession of crashes that died away in ominous mutterings  at the same time a blue line towards the noreast indicated an approaching squall  had we not better take in a reef ian asked the laird anxiously  we had petter weather the pint first said the boatman efter that the wund wul pe in oor favour anbut yere richt  tak in a reef roderick an tonal  mind the sheet mr mabberly an sit low in the poat poys  these orders were promptly obeyed for the squall was rushing down the loch very rapidly  when it burst on them the boat leaned over till her lee gunwale almost ran under water but ian was a skilful boatman and managed to weather the point in safety  after that as he had said the wind was more favourable enabling them to run before it  still they were not out of danger for a wide stretch of foaming sea lay between them and the shores of kinlossie while a gathering storm was darkening the sky behind them    chapter twelve  stirring events of more kinds than one  the squall which blew the kinlossie boat round the eagle point was but the precursor of a succession of heavy squalls which quickly changed into a furious gale compelling ian anderson to close reef his sails even when this was done the boat rushed through the foaming water with tremendous velocity and exhibited that tendency to drinking to which reference has already been made for every time she plunged into the trough of the sea a little water came over the bow  of course going as they were at such a rate the traversing of six or eight miles of water occupied but little time and they were soon close to the bay at the head of which kinlossie house nestled among its trees  come aft poys shouted ian whose voice strong though it was could scarcely be heard in the bow owing to the roaring of the gale shes trinkin too much come aft an look sherp  the three boys obeyed with alacrity being well accustomed to boats and aware of the necessity of prompt obedience in circumstances of danger  thus lightened the boat ceased drinking at the bow but being rather overweighted at the stern she now and then took in a little water there  unfortunately the point of rocks which formed the southern end of kinlossie bay obliged ian to change his course a little in order to weather them  this was a critical operation  even the girls had some sort of idea of that as their looks bore witness  john barret felt a strong inclination to slip his arm round millys waist and whisper dont be afraid beloved ill take care of you but want of courageto say nothing of a sense of proprietykept his lips silent and his arm still  noo keep stiddy all of ye said ian as he shifted the helm a little  an irrepressible shriek burst from aggy anderson for the boat lay over so much that the hissing water rippled almost into her and seemed about to swallow them up  tak anither haul o the sheet maister mabberly cried ian  assisted by jackman mabberly obeyed and the boat went as quin said snorin past the rocks which were now close under her lee with the waves bursting wildly over them  another minute and the outermost rock was under their port bow  to the eyes of the girls it seemed as if destruction were inevitable  to make matters worse at that moment a vivid flash was succeeded by a loud thunderclap which mingling with the gale seemed to intensify its fury while a deluge of rain came down  but ian knew what he was about  with a firm hand on the tiller he steered past the point yet so closely that it seemed as if an active man might have leaped upon the outermost rock which rose black and solid amid the surging foam  another moment and the boat swept safely round into the bay and was again put before the wind  were a richt noo whatever said ian with a grunt of satisfaction  never before did a selfsufficient boatman have his words more effectually or promptly falsified than on that occasion  the distance between boat and shore at that moment was only a few hundred yards but the water all the way was deep and the waves in consequence were large and wild  there were great possibilities within the brief space of distance and time that lay before them  tak an oar maister quin an help rodereek to fend off cried the boatman  hold ticht to the sheet sir an pe ready to let co the moment i tell ye  are ye ready wi the halyards muster airchie  all right ian replied the boy who stood ready to lower the sail  they could see that several men were standing on the beach ready to render assistance among them duncan the butler and ivor the gamekeeper  the latter who had evidently recovered himself was standing waistdeep in the foam as if anxious to grasp the boat when it grounded  ivor is unusually keen to help us today remarked the laird with a peculiar look but no one was sufficiently disengaged to listen to or answer him  at that critical moment junkie took it into his unaccountable head to scramble to the fore part of the boat in order as he said to lend a hand with a rope  on reaching the bow he stumbled the boat plunged heavily as if to accommodate him and he went overboard with a suddenly checked yell that rose high and sharp above the roaring gale  of course every man near him sprang to the side and made a wild grasp at him  the gunwale went down the sea rushed in and in a space of time brief as the lightningflash all the occupants of the boat were struggling in the waves  a great cry arose from the shore and ivor plunging into the surf was seen to breast the billows with the force of a hercules  in the moment of upsetting john barrets cowardice and scruples vanished  he seized milly by the arm and held her up when they rose from the plunge  and now for the first time in his life our hero found the advantage of having trained himself not only in all manly exercises but in the noble art of rescuing life from the water  instead of rising to the wild discovery of helpless ignorance as to what was the best way of using his great strength he rose with the comfortable knowledge first that he was a powerful swimmer and second that he knew exactly what to doat least to attempt  instead therefore of allowing himself to be hugged and probably drowned by the girl he loved he held her off at arms length until he managed to grasp her by both arms close to the shoulders and with her back towards himtreading water while doing so then swimming on his own back he gently drew her upon his breast so that her head rested close to his chin  thus the girls face was turned upwards and held well out of the water and the youth was able to say almost in her ear trust in god dearest he will save us while he struck out vigorously with his legs  thus swimming on his back he headed for the shore  lest the reader should fancy that we are here merely inventing a mode of action it may be well to state that we have conversed with a man styled the rescue whose duty it was to watch the boys of aberdeen while bathing on the dangerous coast there and who told us that he had saved some hundreds of livesmany of them in the manner above described  every one in the boat was fortunately able to swim more or less except milly and aggie anderson  with the utmost anxiety to save the latter her uncle ian made a desperate plunge when the boat upset at the spot where in the confusion he thought he saw her go down  he grasped something under water which clutched him violently in return  rising to the surface he found that he had got hold of giles jackman who animated by the same desire to rescue the same girl had also made a plunge at her  flinging each other off almost angrily they swam wildly about in search of her for giles had observed that barret was sufficiently intent on milly  but poor aggie was in even better hands  ivor donaldson had kept his eyes on her from the moment that he could distinguish faces in the approaching boat  he was a splendid swimmer  even against wind and waves he made rapid headway and in a few seconds caught the girl by the hair  in his case the absence of a plan of rescue was to some extent remedied by sheer strength of body coupled with determination  the poor girl did her best to choke him as drowning people will but happily she was too weak for the purpose and he too strong  he suffered her to do her worst and with the arm which she left free made his way gallantly to the beach where duncan and all the domestics were ready to receive them  barret and milly had landed just before them  immediately after archie and eddie were swept in amid the foam and junkie himselfwho like his brothers could swim like a corkcame careering in on the top of a wave like a very waterimp  with all the energy of his nature he turned the moment his feet touched ground to lend a hand to his friend tonal who was not far behind him  thus one by one the whole party got safely to land for the laird although old was still vigorous and like the others able to swim macrummle came in last and they had some difficulty in getting him out of the water for he was rather sluggish as well as heavy but he was none the worse for his immersion and to the anxieties afterwards expressed by his friends he replied quietly that he had become pretty well used to the water by that time  it was a trying experience however for all of them and in the opinion of ian anderson as he gave it to his wife when they met it was a queer way o feenishin off a fery extraornar sawbath taywhatever  one morning not long after this incident the gentlemen made up a shooting party to try the summit of the hill for mountain harestheir hostess having twitted them with their inability to keep the household supplied with hare soup  i will accompany you gentlemen to the shoulder of the first hill observed their host as he finished his breakfast but not farther for i am not so young as i once was and cannot be expected to keep pace with a woods and forester  that is not a good reason for your stopping short laird retorted jackman with a smile because it is quite possible for the woods and forester to regulate his pace to that of the western isles  well we shall see returned his host  and what does my reckless milly intend to do with herself  i mean to have a little picnicall by myself said milly that is to say with nobody but me and aggy anderson  dyou think that quite safe so soon after her ducking asked mrs gordon  quite safe auntie for she has not felt a bit the worse for that ducking indeed she seems much the better for it and i am quite sure that hill air is good for her  oh then you mean to have your very select picnic on the hills said the laird  yes but no one shall know to what part we are going for as i have said we mean to have a day of it all to ourselves only we will take junkie to protect us and carry our provisions  there were two of the gentlemen who declined the shooting expedition john barret said he would start with them but would at a certain point drop behind and botanise  macrummle also preferred to make one more effort to catch that grilse which had risen so often to him of late but was still at large in the big pool under the fall  the result of the mornings discussion was that only mabberly and jackman proceeded to assault the hares on the mountaintop accompanied by archie and eddie with ivor donaldson to guide them  up in the nurserythat devastated region which suggested the idea of an hospital for broken furniture and toyspoor little neglected flo sat down on the floor and propping her favourite doll up against the remnant of a drum asked that sable friend what she would like to do receiving no answer she said in a cheery confidential tone which she had acquired from her mother ill tell you what miss blackie you an i will go for a picnic too  zeres plenty places for you an me as well as for cuzn miwy to go to an we will let muzzer go wid usif shes dood  so go like a dood chile an get your things on  as the day was particularly bright and warm this minor picnic was splendidly carried into effect in a little coppice close to the house there mrs gordon knitted and sometimes read and behaved altogether like a particularly dood chile while flo and blackie carried on high jinks around her  the eagle cliff was the spot which milly moss had fixed on for her select little picnic with the niece of the fisherman  strange to say and without the slightest knowledge or suspicion of this fact so he said john barret had selected the very same spot for his botanical ramble  it must be remembered however that it was a wide spot  seated in a secluded nook not long after noon milly and aggy with junkie enjoyed the good things which were spread on a mass of flat rock in front of them  now i call this jolly said junkie as well as he could with a mass of jamtart stopping the way  it is indeed returned milly but i dont feel quite sure whether you refer to the splendour of the scenery or the goodness of the tart  to both returned the boy inarticulately  do you think you could eat any more asked milly with a grave earnest look that made aggy gigglefor aggy was a facile giggler  no i dont said junkie  im stuffed  well then you are at leisure to fill the cup again at the spring so run like a good boy and do it  how hard you are on a fellow cousin milly grumbled the youngster rising to do as he was bid but the expression of his jammy face showed that he was no unwilling slave  how old are you aggy asked milly when he was gone  sixteen last birthday returned the girl  ah how i wish i was sixteen again said milly with a profound sigh as she gazed over the rim of a tartlet she happened to be eating at the glittering sea and the faroff horizon  she was evidently recalling some very sad and ancient memories  why asked her companion who exhibited a very slight tendency to laugh  because i was so lighthearted and happy at that age  how old are you now miss milly asked aggy in a tone of increased respect  nineteen replied the other with a sigh  again aggys pretty round face was rippled by a suppressed giggle and it is highly probable that she would have given way altogether if junkie had not returned at the moment and rescued her  heres the water milly  now aggy have you had enough  yes quite enough laughed the highly convalescent invalid  well then come along wi me and ill show you the place where cousin milly fell down  you neednt come milly  i want to show it to aggy all by herself an we wont be long away  very well junkie as you please  i daresay i shall manage to pass the time pleasantly enough till you return  she leant back on a thick heather bush as she spoke and indulged herself in that most enjoyable and restful of occupations on a bright warm day namely looking straight up into the sunny sky and contemplating the soft fleecy clouds that float there changing their forms slowly but continually  now it so happened that john barret in his botanical wanderings about the eagle cliff in quest of the rare specimens that milly loved discovered milly herself  this was not such a matterofcourse discovery as the reader may suppose for the eagle cliff occupied a vast space of the mountainside among the rugged ramparts and knolls of which several persons might have wandered for hours without much chance of observing each other unless they were to shout or discharge the echodisturbing gun  whether it was the mysterious attraction or the occult discernment of love that drew him we cannot tell but certain it is that when barret standing on the upper edge of the cliff glanced from the eaglewhich was watching him suspiciouslydownward to the base of the cliff where the sheep appeared like little buff spots on the green grass his startled eyes alighted on milly lying on her back contemplating the heavens  at that distance she might have been a mole or a rabbit as far as regards barrets power to discern her face or figure or occupation went nevertheless barret knew at once that it was she as his look and colour instantly indicated  there is something in such matters which we cannot understand and perhaps had better not attempt to comprehend it is sufficient to say that the young man instantly forgot his occupation and began to descend the cliff by breakneck routes in a way that must have surprisedif not alarmedthe very eagle himself  he even trod some exceedingly rare specimens under foot in his haste  in a few minutes he drew near to the spot where milly lay  then he suddenly stopped for he remembered that she had that morning spoken of her picnic as a very private one and was it not taking a base unwarrantable advantage of her thus to intrude on her privacy but thenah how fatally if not fortunately that but then often comes in to seal our fatefix our flints as backwoodsmen are fond of putting itbut then was not the opportunity unsoughtquite accidental  would it not be utterly absurd as well as disingenuous to pass her and pretend not to see her with his botanical box full of her own favourite plants and flowers  love is proverbially blind  the argument was more than sufficient  he shut his eyes metaphorically and rushed upon his fate  milly heard him rushingin reality walkingand knew his step another instance of the amazingwellshe started up in some confusion just in time to appear as if engaged in viewing with interest the majestic landscape spread out before her  swooping downwards and hovering overhead on grand expanded pinions the eagle seemed to watch with keen interest the result of this meeting  pardon this intrusion miss moss  i really did not know you were in this neighbourhood till a few minutes ago said barret sitting down on the heather beside her  i accidentally observed you and i have been so very fortunate in finding rare plants this morning that i thought i might venture just for a few minutes to interrupt the privacy of your picnic  see here he added taking off the botanical box and opening it just look at all this  it is very kind of you to take so much trouble on my account mr barret said milly becoming deeply almost too deeplyinterested in the plants  and oh what a splendid specimen of the heliographipod my dear mother will be so glad to get this for she is quite as fond of botany as i am  indeed  do you expect her soon  yes her last letter leads me to expect her very soon now  milly looked up as she said this but there was an expression on barrets face which induced her instantly to recur to scientific research  now good reader if you think we are going further and expect us rudely to draw aside the curtain here and betray confidences you are mistaken  but there is no reason againstindeed the development of our story supplies every reason in favour ofour taking note of certain facts which bear indirectly on the subject before us  far away on a shoulder of the mountain which rose on the other side of the valley lying between it and the eagle cliff a grey speck might have been seen perched on a rock  even as the crow flies the distance was so great that the unassisted human eye could not have distinguished what it was  it might have been a grey cow or a grew crow or a grey rabbit or a grey excrescence of the rock itself but a telescope would have revealed the fact that it was allan gordon the laird of kinlossie  serenity was stamped on the old mans brow for he was amiable by nature and he had been rendered more amiable that morning by having had a pleasant chat while ascending the mountain with mabberly and jackman  the latter he had begun facetiously to style the woods and forester  the shooting party had left him there according to previous arrangement and the old gentleman had seated himself on the grey rock to rest and commune with nature for a short time before beginning the descent of the steep mountain path and wending his way homeward  from his commanding point of observation the entire range of the eagle cliff lay spread out before him with the sea visible on the extreme of either hand  the great valley lay between with impassable gulfs and gorges caused by its wild torrents and its level patches strewn with the fallen debris of ages out of which the larger masses of rock rose like islands in a grey ocean but these huge masses became almost insignificant owing to the overpowering impression of the cliff itself for some time the laird gazed at it in silent admiration  presently a smile beamed on his countenance  ha my puss is that you he muttered as he took a binocular telescope from his pocket and adjusted it  i guessed as much  the eagle cliff has powerful attractions for you what with its grandeur and the rare plants you are so mad about  i think it is you though at such a distance i might easily mistake a sheep or a deer for you and after all that would be no mistake for you are a dear  he did not condescend to smile at his own mild little joke as he applied the telescope to his eyes  yes im rightand very comfortable you seem too though i cant make out your party  both aggy and junkie seem to have left you  perhaps the rocks may hide them  its so far off thathallo  a sudden frown clouded the lairds face as he gave vent to that hallo  the rascal he muttered between his compressed lips  he heard at breakfast as well as the rest of us that milly wanted no intruders humph  i had given him credit for better taste than this implies  eh come sir this is quite inexcusable  the laird became excited as he continued to gaze and his indignation deepened as he hastily wiped the glasses of the binocular  applying them again to his eyes his frown became still darker  for shame you young scamp he continued to mutter taking advantage of your contemptible botany to bring your two heads together in a way that milly would never have permitted but for that ridiculous science ha theyve let the whole concern fallserves em rightandno dropped it on purpose  what  do you dare to grip my nieces hand andandshe lets you  eh your arm roundstop shouted the wrathful man springing up and almost hurling his binocular at the unconscious pair  but his shout although fifty times louder would have failed to cross the valley  like his anger it was unavailing  thrusting the glass into its case with a bang he strode down the mountainside in rampant fury leaving the solemn eagle to watch the lovers as they plighted their troth under the mighty cliff  happily they brought the momentous transaction to a close just before junkie and the highly convalescent aggy anderson reappeared upon the scene  that afternoon before dinner john barret asked mr gordon to accord him the pleasure of a private interview in the library  certainly sir said the laird sternly and all the more that i had very much desired some private conversation with you  barret was not a little surprised at the old mans tone and manner but took no notice of it and went alone with him into the library where he made a full and frank confession of his love for milly and of his having proposed to her and been acceptedon condition that her mother did not object  and now mr gordon added the youth earnestly i have come to apologise to you to ask your forgiveness in fact and to express my extreme regret at the precipitancy of my conduct  it had been my full intention i do assure you to wait until i had mrs moss sanction to pay my addresses to her daughter but aasudden opportunity which i had not sought for or expectedfor of course i knew nothing of the place where the picnic was to bethisthisopportunity i say took me by surprise and threw me off my guardandandin short loveoh you know well enough the power of love mr gordon and can make allowance for my acting precipitately  the old gentleman was touched on a tenderer spot than the young man was aware of when he made this appeal to his own experience for in days gone by young allan gordon had himself acted precipitately  but although the appeal had touched him he did not allow the fact to be seen nor did he interrupt the youths confession  observe mr gordon continued barret drawing himself up slightly the only wrongdoing for which i ask pardon is undue haste  my position financially and otherwise entitles me to marry and darling milly has a right to accept whom she will  if it be thought that she is too young and does not know her own mind i am willing to wait  if she were to change her mind in the meantime i would accept the inevitable but i have no fear of that  the lairds features had been relaxing while the enthusiastic youth proceeded but the last speech upset his gravity altogether  well well barret he said since you have condemned yourself for acting hastily it would ill become your host to overwhelm you with reproaches and to say truth after what you have said i hope that the course of true love will in your case run smooth  but my young friend he added in more serious tones i must strictly forbid any further reference to this with milly till her mother comes  she is under my care and being responsible for her i must see that nothing further takes place till i am able to hand her and all her affairs over to her mother  i will explain this to milly and give her to understand that you will behave to her in all respects as you did before the occurrence of this unfortunate picnic  meanwhile it may comfort you to know that her mother is already predisposed in your favournaturally too for she would be ungrateful as well as eccentric if she had no regard for the man who has twice saved her childs life  ah there goes the dinnerbell and im glad of it for prolonged speaking fatigues me come along    chapter thirteen  a chapter of catastrophes  it was the very next day after the conversation in the library that the waggonette was sent over to cove to meet the steamer and fetch mrs moss who was expected to arrive  as ian anderson and donald with the ragged head had to return home that day they were offered a lift by their friend roderick  i wad raither waalk rodereek said ian but i dar say i may as weel tak a lift as far as the cluff chump up tonal  donald was not slow to obey  although active and vigorous as a mountain goat he had no objection to repose under agreeable conditions  what think ye o the keeper this time rodereek asked the boatman as they drove away  oo it wull be the same as last time answered the groom  hell haud on for a while an then he wull co pack like the soo to her wallowin i the mire  i doubt yere richt returned ian with a solemn shake of the head hes an unstiddy character an he hes naither the fear o cod nor man pefore his eyes  but hes a pleesnt man when he likes  oo ay but there iss not in him the wull to give up the trink  he hes given it up more than wance before an failed  he will co from pad to worse in my opinion  there iss no hope for him i fear  fery likely and on the strength of that opinion ian drew a flask from his pocket and the two cronies had what the groom called a tram together  farther up the steep road they overtook john barret and giles jackman who saluted them with pleasant platitudes about the weather as they passed  curiously enough these two chanced to be conversing on the very subject that had engaged the thoughts of ian and the groom  they say this is not the first time that poor ivor has dashed his bottle to pieces said barret  i fear it has become a disease in this case and that he has lost the power of selfcontrol  from all i hear i have little hope of him  it is all the more sad that he seems to have gained the affections of that poor little girl aggy anderson  indeed exclaimed giles laughing a fellowfeeling makes you wondrous sharp i suppose for i had not observed that interesting fact but why do you speak in such pitiful tones of aggy  because she is an invalid and her lover is a drunkard  sufficient reasons i should think  no not quite because she has almost recovered her usual health while here and poor ivor is after all only one of the sinners for whom jesus christ died  i have great hopes of him  im glad to hear you say so jackman though i dont see that the fact of our saviours dying for us all proves his case to be hopeful  are there not hundreds of men of whom the same may be said yet they are not delivered from drunkenness and dont seem likely to be  that is unquestionably true rejoined his friend but such men as you refer to have not been brought to the condition of renouncing self and trusting only in our saviour  they want to have some credit in the matter of their own salvationhence they fail  ivor i have good reason to believe has been brought to that conditiona condition which insures successhence my great hopes of him  i became aware of his state of mind partly from having had a long talk with him the other day and partly from the report of his good old mother  she told me yesterday that ivor had come to her laid his hand on her shoulder and said mither ive lost all hope o mysel noo to which the old woman answered thats the best news ive heard for mony a day my son for noo the lord wull let ye see what he can do for ye  ivors reply to that was i believe yere richt mither  now i think that was a great deal to come from two such undemonstrative celts  at this point in the conversation they reached a part of the road where a footpath diverged down to the river the road itself rising abruptly towards the eagle cliff  we separate here said jackman  i need scarcely ask where you are going or what going to do  botany coupled with inaccessible cliffs seems to be your mania just now  oh  john barret my friend may i not with truth in your case paraphrase a wellknown couplet    milly in the heart breeds milly in the brain   and this reciprocally that again  your paraphrases are about equal to your compositions jackman and in saying that i dont compliment you  pray may i ask why you have forsaken your favourite weapon the gun and taken to the rod today  because of amiabilitypure and simple  you know i dont care a rush for fishing but to my surprise this morning macrummle expressed a wish to try my repeating rifle at the rabbits and offered to let me try his rod andi might almost addhis river  wasnt it generous of him so im off to have a try for that salmon and he is off no one knows where to send the terrified rabbits into their holes  goodbye old fellowa pleasant day to you  left alone barret began to devote himself to the cliffs  it was arduous work for the said cliffs were almost perpendicular and plants grew in such highup crevices and on such ungetatable places that it seemed as if rare specimens knew their own value as well as the great demand for them and selected their habitations accordingly  it was pleasant work and our hero revelled in it  to be in such exceptional circumstances with the grand cliffs above and below him with no one near save the lordly eagle himself to watch his doings with the wild sweeps of mountainland everywhere clothed with bracken heather and birch and backed by the islandstudded sea with the fresh air and the bright sun and brawling burns and bleating sheep and the objects of his favourite science around him and the strong muscular frame and buoyant spirits that god had given to enable him to enjoy it all was indeed enough to arouse a feeling of gratitude and enthusiasm but when in addition to this the young man knew that he was not merely botanising on his own account but working at it for milly he felt as though he had all but attained to the topmost pinnacle of felicity  it is sad to think that in human affairs this condition is not unfrequently the precursor of misfortune  it is not necessarily so happily it is not always so  indeed we would fain hope that it is not often so but it was so on this occasion  barret had about half filled his botanical box with what he believed to be an interesting collection of plants that would cause the eyes of milly moss to sparkle when the position of the sun and internal sensations induced him to think of his midday meal  it was tied up in a little square paper package  there was a spring at the bottom of the cliffs  it was near the stone where he had met milly and had given way to precipitancy  not far from the spot also where he had made milly up into a bundle with a plaid and started with her towards kinlossie  no place could be better than that for his solitary luncheon  he would go there  descending the cliffs he gained the road and was walking along towards the selected spot when the sound of wheels arrested him  looking up he saw the waggonette turn sharp round the projecting cliff and approach him at a walk  he experienced a little depression of spirit for there was no one in it only the groom on the box  milly would be sorely disappointed  mrs moss has not come i see he said as the groom reined up  oo ay sir shes come  but she iss a queer leddy  shes been chumpin in an oot o the waginette a the way up like a whutret to admire the scenery as she says  when we cam to the heed o the pass she chumped oot again an telt me to drive on slow an wait at the futt o the first hull for her  shes no far ahint  ill go and meet her  you can drive on slowly  barret hurried forward with feelings of considerable uncertainty as to whether this chance of meeting his motherinlaw to be he hoped alone and in these peculiar circumstances would be an advantage or otherwise  she might be annoyed by a sudden interruption in admiring the scenery  there would be the awkwardness of having to introduce himself and she might be fatigued after all her chumpin in and out of the waggonette  he was still pondering these points while he walked smartly forward turned the projecting cliff above referred to and all but overturned the identical little old lady whom he had run down on his bicycle weeks before in london  to say that these two drew back and gazed at each other intentlythe lady quivering and pale the youth aghast and redis to give but a feeble account of the situation  young man she said indignantly in a low repressed voice you have a peculiar talent for assaulting ladies  madam explained the youth growing desperate you are right  i certainly have a talentat least a misfortuneof that sort  he stopped short for being quite overwhelmed he knew not what to say  it is sad continued the little old lady in a tone of contempt that a youth like you should so much belie your looks  it was so mean of you to run away without a word of apology just like a bad little boy for fear of being scoldednot that i cared much for being run down with that horrid bicycle for i was not hurtthough i might have been killedbut it was the cowardly way in which you left me lying helpless among bakers and sweeps and policemen and dirty boys  oh it was disgraceful  poor barret became more and more overwhelmed as she went on  spare me madam he cried in desperation  oh if you only knew what i have suffered on your account since that unlucky day  believe me it was not cowardicewell i cannot say that exactlybut it was not the fear of your just reproaches that made me fly  it was the approach of the police and the fear of being taken up and a public trial and the disgrace ofofandthen i felt ashamed before i had fled more than a few hundred yards and i returned to the spot but you were gone and i had no means ofof  that will do young man  there is no need to keep me standing in this wild place  you are living somewhere in this neighbourhood i suppose  yes  i am living in the neighbourhood said barret bitterly  well i am going to stay at kinlossie house  you know kinlossie house i suppose  oh yes i know it  there is no occasion to look so fierce or bitter young sir  i am going to be at kinlossie for some time  if you choose to call there i shall be ready to listen to your explanations and apologies for i have no desire to appear either harsh or unforgiving  meanwhile i wish you good morning  saying which and with a sweeping bow of a rather antiquated style the offended lady passed on  for a considerable time barret stood motionless with folded arms admiring the scenery with a stony stare  a stone about the size of his fist lay at his foot  he suddenly kicked that violently into space had it been the size of his head he would probably not have kicked it then he gave vent to a wild laugh became suddenly grave thrust his hands deep into his pockets and walked up the road with clenched teeth and a deadly stride  mrs moss heard the laugh as it echoed among the great cliffs  what a dreadful young man she muttered hurrying forward  she thought of asking her driver who he was but she had found roderick to be a very taciturn highlander  he had not shown much disposition to converse on the way up and his speech had not been very intelligible to her englishor anglicisedears  she reentered the waggonette therefore in silence  roderick drove on also in silence although much surprised that the young shentleman had not returned with the leddy but that was none of his business whatever  as the little old lady brooded over the matter she resolved to say nothing of the meeting to milly  she happened to possess a spice of humour and thought it might be well to wait until the youth should call and then after forgiveness sought and obtained introduce him at kinlossie as the young man who ran her down in london  meanwhile barret walked himself into a better state of mind clambered to a nook on the face of one of the cliffs and sat down to meditate and consider what was best to be done  although he had not gone out that day to shoot but to botanise he carried a light doublebarrelled shot gun in case he might get a chance at a hare which was always acceptable to the lady of kinlossie  while the incidents just described were being enacted at the base of the eagle cliff higher up on a distant part of the same cliff macrummle might have been seen prowling among the grey rocks with the spirit of nimrod and the aspect of bacchus  it was the habit of macrummle being half blind to supplement his vision with that peculiar kind of glasses which supportor refuse to supportthemselves on the human countenance by means of the nose these although admirably adapted for reading and even for quietly fishing by the riverside he found to be miserably unsuited for sporting among the cliffs for they were continually tumbling off as he stumbled along or were twitched off by his rifle when he was in the act of making false points  perseverance was however the strong point in the old mans character if it had a strong point at all  he replaced the glasses perpetually and kept pointing persistently  he did little more than point because the thing that he pointed at whatever it was usually got out of the way before macrummle obtained a reliable aim  with a shot gun he might have done better for that weapon admits of snapshooting with some chance of success even in feeble hands  but the old man was ambitious his object was to pot something as he expressed it with a single ball  of course it was not all pointing  he did fire occasionally with no other result than awaking the echoes and terrifying the rabbits but the memory of his former success with the same weapon was strong upon him and perseverance as we have said was rampant  on the whole the fusillade that he kept up was considerable much to the amusement of barret before meeting mrs moss who rightly guessed the cause of all the noise  about midday like barret he prepared to comfort himself with lunch and unlike our unfortunate hero he enjoyed it in comfort sitting on a green patch or terrace high up near the summit of the cliffs and a full mile distant from the spot where the peculiar meeting took place  like a giant refreshed macrummle rose from lunch a good deal more like bacchus and much less like nimrod  a rabbit had been watching him from the cliff above nearly all the time he was eating  it moved quietly into its burrow when he rose though there was no occasion to do so because although within easy rifle shot macrummle did not see it when the sportsman was past the rabbit came out and looked after him  fixing his glasses firmly he advanced in that stooping posture with the rifle at the ready which is so characteristic of keen sportsmen next moment a rabbit stood before himan easy shot  it sat up on its hind legs even as if inviting its fate and gazed as though uncertain whether the man was going to advance or not  he did not advance but took a steady deadly aim and was on the point of pulling the trigger when the glasses dropped off  macrummle was wonderfully patient  he said nothing  he merely replaced his glasses and looked  the rabbit was gone  several surrounding rabbits saw it go but did not follow its example  they evidently felt themselves safe  proceeding cautiously onward the sportsman again caught sight of one of the multitude that surrounded him  it was seated on the edge of its burrow ready for retreat  alas for that rabbit if macrummle had been an average shot armed with a shot gun  but it was ignorant and with the characteristic presumption of ignorance it sat still  the sportsman took a careful and longvery longaim and fired  the rabbits nose pointed to the worlds centre its tail to the sky and when the smoke cleared away it also was gone  fallen into its hole  dead i suppose was the remark with which the sportsman sought to comfort himself  a bulletmark on a rock however two feet to the left of the hole and about a foot too high shook his faith a little in this view  it was impossible however that a man should expend so much ammunition in a region swarming with his particular prey without experiencing something in the shape of a fluke  he did after a time get one shot which was effectual  a young rabbit sat on the top of a mound looking at him with an air of impudence which is sometimes associated with extreme youth  a fat old kinsmanor womanwas seated in a hollow some distance farther on  macrummle fired at the young one missed it and shot the kinsman through the heart  the disappointment of the old man when he failed to find the young one and his joy on discovering the kinsman we leave to the readers imagination  thus he went on occasionally securing something for the pot continually alarming the whole rabbit fraternity and disgusting the eagle which watched him from a safe distance in the ambient atmosphere above  by degrees he worked his way along till he came to the neighbourhood of the place where poor john barret sat in meditative dejection  although near however the two friends could neither see nor get at each other being separated by an impassable gulfthe one being in a crevice as we have said not far from the foot of the cliff the other hidden among the crags near the summit  thus it came to pass that although barret knew of macrummles position by his noise the latter was quite ignorant of the presence of the former  this is horrible muttered the youth in his crevice below  now i call this charming exclaimed the old man on his perch above  such is lifeviewed from different standpoints  ay and correctly estimated too according to these different standpoints for the old man saw only the sunny surrounding of the present while the young one gazed into the gloomy wreck of the future  being somewhat fatigued macrummle betook himself to a sequestered ledge among the cliffs and sat down under a shrub to rest  it chanced to be a well concealed spot  he remained quietly there for a considerable time discussing with himself the relative advantages of fishing and shooting  it is probable that his sudden disappearance and his prolonged absence induced the eagle to imagine that he had gone away for that watchful bird after several circlings on outstretched and apparently motionless wings made a magnificent swoop downwards and again resumed its floating action in the lower strata of its atmospheric world  there it devoted its exclusive attention to the young man whose position was clearly exposed to its view  as he sat there in gloomy thought barret chanced to raise his eyes and observed the bird high above himfar out of gunshot  fortunate creature he said aloud whatever may be the troubles of your lot you are at least safe from exasperating rencontres with your future motherinlaw  we need not point out to the intelligent reader that barret being quite ignorant of the eagles domestic relations indulged in mere assumptions in the bitterness of his soul  he raised his fowlingpiece as he spoke and took a long deliberate aim at the bird  far beyond range he said lowering the gun again but even if you were only four yards from the muzzle i would not fire poor bird  did not milly say you were noble and that it would be worse than murder to kill you  no you are safe from me at all events even if you were not so wary as to keep yourself safe from everybody  and yet methinks if macrummle were still up there he would have the chance of giving you a severe fright though he has not the skill to bring you down  now it is wellknown to trappers and backwoodsmen generally that the most wary of foxes which cannot by any means be caught by one trap may sometimes be circumvented by two traps  it is the same with decoys whether these be placed intentionally or place themselves accidentally on this occasion barret acted the part of a decoy all unwittingly to that eagle or to macrummle  in its extreme interest in the youths proceedings the great bird soared straight over his head and slowly approached the old mans position macrummle was not on the alert  he never was on the alert but his eyes chanced to be gazing in the right direction and his glasses happened to be on  he saw it comingsomething big and black  he grasped his repeater and knocked his glasses off  a raven i think  ill try it  i should like it as a trophya sort of memorial of  bang  the man who was half blind who had scarcely used gun or rifle all his life achieved that which dead shots and ardent sportsmen had tried in vain for yearshe shot the eagle right through the heart and that too with a single bullet  straight down it fell with a tremendous flutter and disappeared over the edge of its native cliff  macrummle went on his knees and craning his neck replaced his glasses but nothing whatever could be seen save the misty void below shrinking back from the giddy position he rose and pulled out his watch  let me see he muttered it will take me a full hour to go round so as to reach the bottom  no too late  ill go home and send the keeper for it in the morning  the eagle may have picked its bones by that time to be sure but after all a raven is not much of a trophy  while he was thus debating a very different scene was taking place below  barret had been gazing up at the eagle when the shot was fired  he saw the spout of smoke  he heard the crashing shot and echoes and beheld the eagle descending like a thunderbolt  after that he saw and heard no more for in reaching forward to see round a projecting rock that interfered with his vision his foot slipped and he fell headlong from the cliff  he had not far to fall indeed and a whin bush broke the force of the shock when he did strike but he was rendered insensible and rolled down the remainder of the slope to the bottom  there he lay bruised bleeding and motionless on the grass close to the road with his bent and broken gun beneath him and the dead eagle not more than a dozen yards from his side  it is not like barret to be late observed the laird that evening as he consulted his watch  he is punctuality itself as a rule  he must have fallen in with some unusually interesting plants  but we cant wait  order dinner my dear for im sure that my sister must be very hungry after her voyage  indeed i am returned the little old lady with a peculiar smile seasickness is the best tonic i know of but it is an awful medicine to take  almost as good as mountain air remarked macrummle as they filed out of the drawingroom  i do wish i had managed to bring that raven home  at first the party at dinner was as merry as usual  the sportsmen were graphic in recounting the various incidents of the day mrs moss was equally graphic on the horrors of the sea macrummle was eulogistic of repeating rifles and inclined to be boastful about the raven which he hoped to show them on the morrow while milly proved herself as usual a beautiful and interested listener as well as a most hearty laugher  but as the feast went on they became less noisy  then a feeling of uneasiness manifested itself but no one ventured to suggest that anything might have occurred to the absentee until the evening had deepened into night  then the laird started up suddenly  something must have happened to our friend he exclaimed at the same time ringing the bell violently  he has never been late before and however far he may have gone afield there has been more than time for him to return at his slowest pace  duncan as the butler entered turn out all the men and boys as fast as you can  tell roderick to get lanterns readyas many as you have  gentlemen we must all go on this search without another moments delay  there is little need to say that barrets friends and comrades were not slow to respond to the call  in less than a quarter of an hour they were dispersed searching every part of the eagle cliff where he had been last seen by giles jackman  they found him at last pale and bloodstained making ineffectual efforts to crawl from the spot where he had fallen both the eagle and the broken gun being found beside him  no bones broken thank god said giles after having examined him and bound up his wounds  but he is too weak to be questioned  now lads fetch the two poles and the plaid  ill soon contrive a litter  all right old fellow  god bless you said barret faintly as his friend bent over him  roderick and ivor raised him softly and with the eagle at his side bore him towards kinlossie house  soon after their heavy tramp was heard in the hall as they carried him to his room and laid him gently in bed    chapter fourteen  suspicions revelations and other matters  with a swelled and scratched face a discoloured eye a damaged nose and a head swathed in bandagesit is no wonder that mrs moss failed to recognise in john barret the violent young man with the talent for assaulting ladies  she was not admitted to his room until nearly a week after the accident for although he had not been seriously injured he had received a rather severe shock and it was thought advisable to keep him quiet as a matter of precaution  when she did see him at last lying on a sofa in a dressinggown and with his head and face as we have described his appearance did not call to her remembrance the faintest resemblance to the confused wild and altogether incomprehensible youth who had tumbled her over in the streets of london and almost run her down in the eagle pass  of course barret feared that she would recognise him and had been greatly exercised as to his precise duty in the circumstances but when he found that she did not recognise either his face or his voice he felt uncertain whether it would not be perhaps better to say nothing at all about the matter in the meantime  indeed the grateful old lady gave him no time to make a clean breast of it as he had at first intended to do  oh  mr barret she exclaimed sitting down beside him and laying her hand lightly on his arm while the laird sat down on another chair and looked on benignly i cannot tell you how thankful i am that you have not been killed and how very grateful i am to you for all your bravery in saving my darling millys life  now dont say a word about disclaiming credit as i know you are going to do  but dear madam interrupted the invalid allow me to explain  i cannot bear to deceive you or to sail under false colours  sail under false colours  explain repeated mrs moss quickly what nonsense do you talk  has not my daughter explained and she is not given to colouring things falsely  excuse me mrs moss said barret i did not mean that  i only  i dont care what you mean mr barret said the positive little woman its of no use your denying that you have behaved in a noble courageous manner and i wont listen to anything to the contrary so you need not interrupt me  besides i have been told not to allow you to speak much so sir if i am to remain beside you at all i must impose silence  barret sank back on his couch with a sigh and resigned himself to his fate  so much for the mother  later in the same day the daughter sat beside his couch  the laird was not present on that occasion  they were alone  milly said the invalid taking her small hand in his have you mentioned it yet to your mother  yes john replied milly blushing in spite ofnay rather more in consequence ofher efforts not to do so  i spoke to her some days ago  indeed soon after the accident when we were sure you were going to get well  and she did not disapprove  ay but have you spoken since she has seen mesince this morning  yes john  and she is still of the same mindnot shocked or shaken by my appearance  she is still of the same mind returned milly and not shocked in the least  my darling mother is far too wise to be shocked by triflesii mean by scratches and bruises  she judges of people by their hearts  im glad to hear that milly for i have something shocking to tell her about myself that will surprise her if it does nothing else  indeed said milly with the slightest possible rise of her pretty eyebrows  yes  you have heard from your mother about that young rascal who ran into her with his bicycle in london some time ago  yes she wrote to me about it replied milly with an amused smile you mean i suppose the reckless youth who after running her down had the cowardice to run away and leave her lying flat on the pavement mother has more than once written about that event with indignation and rightly i think  but how came you to know about it john  milly said barret holding her hand very tight and speaking solemnly i am that cowardly man  now john you are jesting  indeedindeed i am not  do you really mean to say that it was you who ran against myoh you must be jesting  again i say i am not  i am the manthe coward  well dear john said milly flushing considerably i must believe you but the fact does not in the least reduce my affection for you though it will lower my belief in your prudence unless you can explain  i will explain said barret and we need scarcely add that the explanation tended rather to increase than diminish millys affection for as well as her belief in her lover  but when barret went on further to describe the meeting in the eagle pass she went off into uncontrollable laughter  and you are sure that mother has no idea that you are the man she asked  not the remotest  well now john you must not let her know for some time yet  you must gain her affections sir before you venture to reveal your true character  of course barret agreed to this  he would have agreed to anything that milly proposed except perhaps the giving up of his claim to her own hand  deception however invariably surrounds the deceiver with more or less of difficulty  that same evening while milly was sitting alone with her mother the conversation took a perplexing turn  there had been a pretty long pause after a rather favourable commentary on the character of barret when the thin little old lady had wound up with the observation that the subject of their criticism was a remarkably agreeable man with a playfully humorous and a delightfully serious turn of mindand so modest withal  apparently the last words had turned her mind into the new channel for she resumed  talking of insolence my dear  were we talking of insolence mother said milly with a surprised smile  well my love i was thinking of the opposite of modesty which is the same thing  do you know i had a meeting on the day of my arrival here which surprised me very much  to say truth i did not mention it sooner because i wished to give you a little surprise  why do you change your seat my love  did you feel a draught where you were  nono  ii only want to get the light a little more at my backto keep it off my face  but go on mother  what was the surprise about im anxious to know  if milly did not absolutely know she had at least a pretty good idea of what was coming  well of course you remember about that young manthatthat cowardly young man who  who ran you down in london  yes yes i know interrupted the daughter endeavouring to suppress a laugh and putting her handkerchief suddenly to her face  i remember well  the monster  what about him  you may well call him a monster  can you believe it  i have met him herein this very island where he must be living somewhere of course and he actually ran me down againall but  she added the last two words in order to save her veracity  you dont really mean it exclaimed milly giving way a little in spite of herself  with a bicycle  it was the mothers turn to laugh now  no you foolish thing even i have capacity to understand that it would be impossible to use those hideousfrightful instruments on the bad hillroads of this island  no but it seems to be the nature of this disdisagreeablei had almost said detestableyouth to move only under violent impulse for he came round a corner of the eagle cliff at such a pace that as i have said he all but ran into my arms and knocked me down  dreadful exclaimed milly turning her back still more to the light and working mysteriously with her kerchief  yes dreadful indeed  and when i naturally taxed him with his cowardice and meanness he did not seem at all penitent but went on like a lunatic and although what he said was civil enough his way of saying it was very impolite and strange and after we had parted i heard him give way to fiendish laughter  i could not be mistaken for the cliffs echoed it in all directions like a hundred hyenas  as this savoured somewhat of a joke milly availed herself of it set free the safetyvalve and so to speak saved the boiler  why do you laugh so much child asked the old lady when her daughter had transgressed reasonable limits  well you know mother if you will compare a mans laugh to a hundred hyenas  i didnt compare the mans voice interrupted mrs moss i said that the cliffs  thats worse and worse  now mother dont get into one of your hypercritical moods and insist on reasons for everything but tell me about this wickedthis dreadful young man  what was he like  like an ordinary sportsman dear with one of those hateful guns in his hand and a botanical box on his back  i could not see his face very well for he wore one of those ugly potcaps with a peak before and behind though what the behind one is for i cannot imagine as men have no eyes in the back of their heads to keep the sun out of  no doubt some men would make us believe they have but it was pulled down on the bridge of his nose  what i did see of his face seemed to be handsome enough and his figure was tall and well made unquestionably but his behaviournothing can excuse that  if he had only said he was sorry one might have forgiven him  did he not say he was sorry asked milly in some surprise  oh well i suppose he did and begged pardon after a fashion  but what truth could there be in his protestations when he went away and laughed like a hyena  you said a hundred hyenas mother  no milly i said the cliffs laughed but dont interrupt me you naughty child  well i was going to tell you that my heart softened a little towards the young man for as you know i am not naturally unforgiving  i know it well dear mother  so before we parted i told him that if he had any explanations or apologies to make i should be glad to see him at kinlossie house  then i made up my mind to forgive him and introduce him to you as the man that ran me down in london  this was the little surprise i had in store for you but the ungrateful creature has never come  no and he never will come said milly with a hearty laugh  how do you know that puss asked mrs moss in surprise  fortunately the dinnerbell rang at that moment justifying milly in jumping up  giving her mother a rather violent hug she rushed from the room  strange girl muttered mrs moss as she turned and occupied herself with some mysteriouswe might almost say captiousoperations before the lookingglass  the mountain air seems to have increased her spirits wonderfully  perhaps love has something to do with it  it may be both  she was still engaged with a subtle analysis of this questionin front of the glass which gave her the advantage of supposing that she talked with an opponentwhen sudden and uproarious laughter was heard in the adjoining room  it was barrets sittingroom in which his friends were wont to visit him  she could distinguish that the laughter proceeded from himself milly and giles jackman though the walls were too thick to permit of either words or ordinary tones being heard  milly said mrs moss severely when they met a few minutes later in the drawingroom what were you two and mr jackman laughing at so loudly  surely you did not tell them what we had been speaking about  of course i did mother  i did not know you intended to keep the matter secret  and it did so tickle them  but no one else knows it so i will run back to john and pledge him to secrecy  you can caution mr jackman who will be down directly no doubt  as barret had not at that time recovered sufficiently to admit of his going downstairs his friends were wont to spend much of their time in the snug sittingroom which had been apportioned to him  he usually held his levees costumed in a huge flowered dressinggown belonging to the laird so that although he began to look more like his former self as he recovered from his injuries he was still sufficiently disguised to prevent recognition on the part of mrs moss  nevertheless the old lady felt strangely perplexed about him  one day the greater part of the household was assembled in his room when mrs moss remarked on this curious feeling  i cannot tell what it is mr barret that makes the sound of your voice seem familiar to me she said yet not exactly familiar but a sort of faraway echo you know such as one might have heard in a dream though after all i dont think i ever did hear a voice in a dream  jackman and milly glanced at each other and the latter put the safetyvalve to her mouth while barret replied  i dont know he said with a very grave appearance of profound thought that i ever myself dreamt a voice or indeed a sound of any kind  as to what you say about some voices appearing to be familiar dont you think that has something to do with classes of men  no man i think is a solitary unit in creation  every man is as it were the type of a class to which he belongseach member possessing more or less the complexion tendencies characteristics tones etcetera of his particular class  you are familiar it may be with the tones of the class to which i belong and hence the idea that you have heard my voice before  philosophically put barret said mabberly i had no idea you thought so profoundly  hm  im not so sure of the profundity said the little old lady pursing her lips no doubt you may be right as regards class but then young man i have been familiar with all classes of men and therefore according to your principle i should have some strange memories connected with mr jackmans voice and mr mabberlys and the lairds and everybodys  well said sister you have him there cried the laird with a guffaw but dont lug me into your classes for i claim to be an exception to all mankind inasmuch as i have a sister who belongs to no class and is ready to tackle any man on any subject whatever between metaphysics and baby linen  come now barret do you think yourself strong enough to go out with us in the boat tomorrow  quite  indeed i would have begged leave to go out some days ago but doctor jackman there who is a very stern practitioner forbids me however i have my revenge for i compel him to sit with me a great deal and entertain me with indian stories  oh exclaimed junkie who happened to be in the room he hasnt told you yet about the elephant hunt has he  no not yet junkie returned barret he has been faithful to his promise not to go on with that story till you and your brothers are present  well but tell it now mr jackman and ill go an call eddie and archie pleaded the boy  you will call in vain then said his father for they have both gone up the burn one to photograph and the other to paint  i never saw such a boy as archie is to photograph  i believe he has got every scene in the island worth having on his plates now and he has taken to the cattle of latewhat think ye was the last thing he tried  i found him in the yard yesterday trying to photograph himself  that must indeed have puzzled him how did he manage asked macrummle  well it was ingenious  he tried to get pat quin to manipulate the instrument while he sat but quin is clumsy with his fingers at least for such delicate work and the last time he became nervous in his anxiety to do the thing rightly so when archie cried now for him to cover the glass with its little cap he put it on with a bang that knocked over and nearly smashed the whole concern  so what does the boy do but sets up a chair in the right focus and arranges the instrument with a string tied to the little cap  then he sits down on the chair puts on a heavenly smile and pulls the string  off comes the cap  he counts one twoi dont know how manyand then makes a sudden dash at the camera an shuts it up  what the result may be remains to be seen  oh itll be the same as usual remarked junkie in a tone of contempt theres always something goes wrong in the middle of it  he tried to take boxer the other day and he wagged his tail in the middle of it then he tried the cat and she yawned in the middle  then flo and she laughed in the middle  then me an i forgot and made a face at flo in the middle  its a pity it has got a middle at all two ends would be better i think  but wont you tell about the elephants to us mr jackman  theres plenty of us hereplease  nay junkie you would not have me break my word surely  when we are all assembled together you shall have itsome wet day perhaps  then therell be no more wet days this year if ive to wait for that returned the urchin half sulkily  that same day milly barret and jackman arranged that the mystery of the cowardly young man must be cleared up  perhaps it would be best for miss moss to explain to her mother said giles  that will not i said milly with a laugh  i have decided what to do said barret  i was invited by her to call and explain anything i had to say and apologise  by looks if not by words i accepted that invitation and i shall keep it  if you could only manage somehow milly to get everybody out of the way so that i might find your mother alone in  shes alone now said milly  i left her just a minute ago and she is not likely to be interrupted i know  stay then i will return in a few minutes  barret retired to his room whence he quickly returned with shooting coat knickerbockers potcap and boots all complete  richards himself again  allow me to congratulate you cried jackman shaking his friend by the hand  but i say dont you think it may give the old lady rather a shock as well as a surprise  barret looked at milly  i think not said milly  as uncle often says of dear mother she is tough  well ill go said barret  in a few minutes he walked into the middle of the drawingroom and stood before mrs moss who was reading a book at the time  she laid down the book removed her glasses and looked up  well i declare she exclaimed with the utmost elevation of her eyebrows and distension of her eyes there you are at last  and you have not even the politeness to take your hat off or have yourself announced  you are the most singularly illbred young man for your looks that i ever met with  i thought madam said barret in a low voice that you would know me better with my cap on  he stopped for the old lady had risen at the first sound of his voice and gazed at him in a species of incredulous alarm  forgive me cried barret pulling off his cap but again he stopped abruptly and before he could spring forward to prevent it the little old lady had fallen flat upon the hearthrug  quick hallo  millygiles  ass that i am  ive knocked her down again he shouted as those whom he summoned burst into the room  they had not been far off  in a few more minutes mrs moss was reviving on the sofa and alone with her daughter  milly dear this has been a great surprise indeed i might almost call it a shock she said in a faint voice  indeed it has been darling mother returned milly in sympathetic tones as she smoothed her mothers hair and it was all my fault  but are you quite sure you are not hurt  i dont feel hurt dear returned the old lady with a slight dash of her argumentative tone and dont you think that if i were hurt i should feel it  perhaps mother but sometimes you know people are so much hurt that they cant feel it  true child but in these circumstances they are usually unable to express their views about feeling altogether which i am not you see no thanks to thatthto john barret  oh mother i cannot bear to think of it  no wonder interrupted the old lady  to think of my being violently knocked down twicealmost three timesby a big young man like that and the first time with a horrid bicycle on the top of usi might almost say mixed up with us  but mother he never meant it you know  i should think not interjected mrs moss with a short sarcastic laugh  no indeed continued milly with some warmth and if you only knew what he has suffered on your account  milly cried mrs moss quickly is all that i have suffered on his account to count for nothing  of course not dear mother  i dont mean that you dont understand me  i mean the reproaches that his own conscience has heaped upon his head for what he has inadvertently done  recklessly child not inadvertently  besides you know his conscience is not himself  people cannot avoid what conscience says to them  its remarks are no sign of humility or selfcondemnation one proof of which is that wicked people would gladly get away from conscience if they could instead of agreeing with it as they should and shaking hands with it and saying we are all that you call us and more  well that is exactly what john has done said milly with increasing warmth  he has said all that and more to me  to you interrupted mrs moss yes but you are not his conscience child  yes i am mother at least if im not i am next thing to it for he says everything to me returned milly with a laugh and a blush and you have no idea how sorry how ashamed how selfcondemned how overwhelmed he has been by all that has happened  humph  i have been a good deal more overwhelmed than he has been returned mrs moss  however make your mind easy child for during the last week or two in learning to love and esteem john barret i have unwittingly been preparing the way to forgive and forget the cowardly youth who ran me down in london  now go and send mr jackman to me i have a great opinion of that young mans knowledge of medicine and surgery though he is only an amateur  he will soon tell me whether i have received any hurt that has rendered me incapable of feeling  and at the same time you may convey to that coward john my entire forgiveness  milly kissed her mother of course and hastened away to deliver her double message  after careful examination and much questioning dr jackman pronounced the little old lady to be entirely free from injury of any kind save the smashing of a comb in her backhair and gave it as his opinion that she was as sound in wind and limb as before the accident though there had unquestionably been a considerable shock to the feelings which however seemed to have had the effect of improving rather than deranging her intellectual powers  the jury which afterwards sat upon her returned their verdict in accordance with that opinion  it was impossible of course to prevent some of all this leaking into the kitchen the nursery and the stable  in the firstmentioned spot quin remarked to the housemaidsure its a quare evint entirely with which sentiment the housemaid agreed  aunt moss is a buster was junkies ambiguous opinion in which flo and the black doll coincided  tonal said roderick as he groomed the bay horse the old wumman iss a fery tough person  to which tonal assented she iss whatever    chapter fifteen  elephants againfollowed by something more awful  there came a rainy day at last at kinlossie house  such days will come at times in human experience both in metaphor and fact  at present we state a fact  it will bring up the fush was rodericks remark as he paused in the operation of cleaning harness to look through the stable door on the landscape an that wull please maister macrummle  it will pe good for the gress too an that will please muss mully said donald now permanently appointed to the stables  hm she wull pe carin less for the gress poy than she wass used to do returned the groom  it iss my opeenion that they wull pe all wantin to co away sooth pefore long  we refer to the above opinions because they were shared by the party assembled in barrets room which was still retained as a snuggery although its occupant was fully restored to normal health and vigour  youll be sure to get that salmon next time you try after all this rain macrummle said mabberly  at least i hope you will before we leave  ay and you must have another try with the repeater on the eagle cliff mac  it would never do to leave a lone widdy as quin calls it after murdering the husband  perhaps i may have another day there answered the old gentleman with a pleased smile for although they roasted him a good deal for mistaking an eagle for a raven and only gave him credit for a fluke it was evident that he congratulated himself not a little on his achievement  archie is having an awful time skinning and stuffing it said eddie who sat by the window dressing trout flies  junkie who was occupied at another window mending the top of his rod remarked that nothing seemed to give archie so much pleasure as skinning and stuffing something  hes always doing it said the youngster whatever happens to die from a tomcat to a tomtit he gets hold of i do believe if he was to die he would try to skin and stuff himself  at that moment archie entered the room  ive got it nearly done now he said with a pleased expression while he rubbed his notoverclean hands  ill set him up tonight and photograph him tomorrow with flo under his wings to show his enormous size  oh that minds me o the elephants cried junkie jumping up and running to jackman who was assisting  barret to arrange plants for milly  we are all here nowan you promised you know  a heavy patter of rain on the window seemed to emphasise junkies request by suggesting that nothing better could be done  well junkie i have no objection said the woodsandforester if the rest of the company do not object  as the rest of the company did not object but rather expressed anxiety to hear about the hunt jackman drew his chair near to the fire the boys crowded round him and he began withlet me see  where was i  in india of course said junkie  yes but at what part of the hunt  oh you hadnt begun the hunt at all  you had only made chand somethin or other isri perwhatdeecallit an raj mungthingumy give poor mowla buksh such an awful mauling  just so  well you must know that next day we received news of large herds of elephants away to the eastward of the ganges so we started off with all our forceshunters matchlockmen onlookers etcetera and about eighty tame elephants  chief among these last were the fighting elephants to which junkie gave such appropriate names just now and king of them all was the mighty chand moorut who had never been known to refuse a fight or lose a victory since he was grown up  it was really grand to see this renowned mountain of living flesh towering high above his fellows  like all heroes he was calm and dignified when not in actiona lamb in the drawingroom a lion in the field  even the natives accustomed as they were to these giants came to look at him admiringly that morning as he walked sedately out of camp  he was so big that he seemed to grow bigger while you looked at him and he was absolutely perfect in form and strengththe very hercules of brutes  the trackers had marked down a herd of wild elephants not three miles distant in a narrow valley just suited to our purpose  on reaching the ground we learned that there was in the jungle a rogue elephantthat is an old male which had been expelled from the herd such outcasts are usually very fierce and dangerous  this one was a tusker who had been the terror of the neighbourhood having killed many people among them a forester only a few days before our arrival  as these rogues are always very difficult to overcome and are almost sure to injure the khedda or tame elephants of the hunt if an attempt is made to capture them we resolved to avoid him and devote our attention entirely to the females and young ones  we formed a curious procession as we entered the valleyrajah and civilians military men and mahowts black and white on pads and in howdahsthe last being the little towers that you see on elephants backs in pictures  gunmen had been sent up to the head of the valley to block the way in that direction  the sides were too steep for elephants to climb  thus we had them as it were in a trap and formed up the khedda in battle array  the catching or noncombatant elephants were drawn up in two lines and the big fighting elephants were kept in reserve concealed by bushes  the sides of the valley were crowded with matchlockmen ready to commence shouting and firing at a given signal and drive the herd in the direction of the khedda  it was a beautiful forenoon when we commenced to move forward  all nature seemed to be waiting in silent expectation of the issue of our hunt and not a sound was heard the strictest silence having been enjoined upon all  rich tropical vegetation hung in graceful lines and festoons from the cliffs on either side but there was no sign of the gunmen concealed there  the sun was  oh bother the sun  come on wi the fight exclaimed the impatient junkie  all in good time my boy  the sun was blazing in my eyes i was going to say so you see i could not make out the distant view and therefore cant describe it glad of it murmured the impertinent junkie but i knew that the wild elephants were there somewhere in the dense jungle  suddenly a shot was heard at the head of the valley we afterwards learned that it had been fired over the head of a big tusker elephant that stood under a tree not many yards from the man who fired  being young like junkie and giddy it dashed away down the valley trumpeting wildly and you have no conception how active and agile these creatures can be if you have seen only the slow sluggish things that are in our zoos at home  so terrible was the sound of this elephants approach that the ranks of the khedda elephants were thrown into some confusion and the mahowts had difficulty in preventing them from turning tail and running away  our leader therefore ordered the gladiator chand moorut to the front  indeed chand ordered himself to the front for no sooner did he hear the challenge of the tusker than he dashed forward alone to accept it and his mahowt found it almost impossible to restrain him  fortunately the jungle helped the mahowt by hiding the tusker from view  when the wild elephant caught sight of the line of the khedda he went at it with a mighty rush crashing through bush and brake and overturning small trees like straws until he got into the dry bed of a stream  there he stopped short for the colossal chand moorut suddenly appeared and charged him  the wild tusker however showed the white feather  he could not indeed avoid the shock altogether but yielding to it he managed to keep his legs turned short round and fled past his big foe  chand moorut had no chance with the agile fellow in a race  he was soon left far behind while the tusker charged onward  the matchlockmen tried in vain to check him  as he approached the line the khedda elephants fled in all directions  thrusting aside some and overturning others that came in his way he held on his course amid the din of shouting and rattling of shots and finally got clear away  oh what a pity exclaimed junkie  but that did not matter much continued jackman for news was brought in that the herd we had been after were not in that valley at all but in the next one and had probably heard nothing of all the row we had been making so we collected our forces and went after them  soon we got to the pass leading into the valley and then just beyond it came quite suddenly on a band of somewhere about thirty wild elephants  they were taken quite by surprise for they were feeding at the time on a level piece of ground of considerable extent  as it was impossible to surround them away the whole khedda went helterskelter after them  it was a tremendous sight  the herd had scattered in all directions so that our khedda was also scattered  each hunting elephant had two men on its backone the nooseman sitting on its neck with a strong thick rope in his hands on which was a running noose the other the driver who stood erect on the animals back holding on by a loop with one hand and in the other flourishing an instrument called the mungri with sharp spikes in it wherewith to whip the poor animal over the root of his tail for of course an ordinary whip would have had no more effect than a peacocks feather on an elephants hide  i ordered my mahowt to keep near one of the noosemen whom i knew to be expert in the use of the giantlasso  his name was ramjee  both ramjee and his driver were screaming and yelling at the pitch of their voices and the latter was applying his mungri with tremendous energy  the elephant they were after was a small female  it is always necessary that the chasing elephant should be much heavier than the one chased else evil results follow as we soon found  presently the khedda elephant was alongside  ramjee lifted the great loop in both hands and leaned over till he almost touched the wild animal  frequently this noosing fails from various reasons  for one thing the wild creatures are often very clever at evading the noose sometimes they push it away with their trunks occasionally they step right through it and now and then get only half through it so that it forms a sort of tow rope and the other end of this rope being made fast to the neck of the tame elephant the wild one drags it along violently unless the tame one is much heavier than itself  this is exactly what happened to ramjee  he dropped the noose beautifully over the creatures head but before it could be hauled tightwhich was accomplished by checking the tame animalthe active creature had got its forelegs through  the loop caught however on its hind quarters and away it went dragging the tame elephant after it ramjee shrieking wildly for help  two of the other tame elephants not yet engaged were sent to his assistance these easily threw two more nooses over the wild creature and after a good run she was finally exhausted secured with ropes and driven back to camp there to be subjected to coercive treatment until she should become tame  meanwhile other captures were being made in the field  i was just moving off after seeing this female secured when a tremendous shouting attracted me  it was a party chasing a fine young tusker  he was very cunning and ran about dodging hither and thither taking advantage of every tree and bush and inequality while the mahowts failed again and again to noose him  i made my mahowt drive our animal so as to turn him back  we had no appliances to capture as i was there only to look on and admire  at last a good throw noosed him but he slipped through all except one hind leg  on this the noose luckily held and in a few minutes we had him secure  of course in driving our prisoners to camp the tame elephants were used to guide them stir them up push them on and restrain or punish them as the case might require  this was easy with the smaller females and young ones but it was a very different matter with big males especially with rogues as we found out before the close of that day  we were getting pretty well used up towards the afternoon and had sent ten fullgrown elephants and three calves into camp when we received news that the rogue which had been so long a terror to the district was in the neighbouring valley  so we resolved to go for him  of course there was no possibility of noosing such a monster  the ordinary elephants could never have been brought to face him  our only hope therefore lay in our gladiators and our plan was to make them knock him down repeatedly until at length he should be tired out  i need not waste time with details  it is sufficient to say that after about an hours search we came upon the rogue in a dense part of the jungle  he was as i have said unusually big as well as fierce but our hero chand moorut had never yet met his match so we resolved to risk an encounter  there was the dry bed of a river which the rogue would have to cross when driven down the valley by the gunmen  here our gladiator was placed partially concealed and ready to meet the rogue when he should appear  fifty yards back the other fighting elephants were placed in support and behind these were drawn up the rest of the khedda in three lines  then the spectators many of whom were ladies were placed on a ledge of rock about forty feet above the riverbed which commanded a good view of the proposed field of battle  up to this time perfect silence had been maintained in our ranks  my elephant was stationed near the centre of the line from which point i could see chand moorut standing calmly near the riverbed with what i could almost fancy was a twinkle in his eye as though he suspected what was coming  suddenly a single shot was heard from up the valley  as it came echoing towards us it was mingled with the spattering fire shouting and yelling of the beaters who began to advance  chand moorut became rigid and motionless like a statue  he was evidently thinking another instant and the rogues shrill trumpetnote of defiance rang high above the din  trembling and restive the ordinary khedda elephants showed every symptom of alarm but the fighters stood still with the exception of chand who becoming inflated with the spirit of war made a sudden dash up the valley intent on accepting the challenge  fifty yards were passed before his mahowt with voice limb and prod managed to reduce the welltrained warrior to obedience  solemnly and with stately gait he returned to his position his great heart swelling no doubt with anticipation  scarcely had he taken up his position when the bushes higher up were seen to move and the huge black form of the rogue appeared upon the scene  unlike the lively young elephant that had escaped us in the morning this old rogue marched sedately and leisurely down the hillside apparently as much unconcerned about the uproar of shooting and shouting in his rear as if it had been but the buzzing of a few mosquitoes  i confess that doubts as to the issue of the combat arose in my mind when i first saw him for he appeared to be nearly if not quite as big as chand moorut himself and of course i knew that the hard and welltrained muscles of a wild elephant were sure to be more powerful than those of a tame one  i stupidly forgot at the moment that indomitable pluck counts for much in a trial of mere brute force  ignorant of what was in store for him with head erect and an air of quiet contempt for all animate creation the rogue walked into the dry bed of the river and began to descend  expectation was now on tiptoe when to our disgust he turned sharp to the right and all but walked in amongst the spectators on the ledge above some of whom received him with a volley of rifle balls  as none of these touched a vital spot they might as well have been rhubarb pills  they turned him aside however and breaking through the left flank of the khedda he took refuge in the thickest jungle he could find  the whole khedda followed in hot pursuit crashing through overgrowth of canes creepers and trees in the midst of confusion and rumpus utterly inconceivable therefore beyond my powers of description  we had to look out sharply in this chase for we were passing under branches at times  one of these caught my man quin and swept him clean off his pad  but he fell on his feet unhurt and was quickly picked up and reseated  in a short time we came in sight of the rogue who suddenly turned at bay and confronted us  the entire khedda came to a most inglorious halt for our heavy fighters had been left behind in the race and the others dared not face the foe  seeing this he suddenly dashed into the midst of us and went straight for the elephant on which our director and his wife were seated  fortunately a big tree chancing to come in the rogues way interfered with his progress  he devoted his energies to it for a few moments  then he took to charging furiously at everything that came in his way and was enjoying himself with this little game when chand moorut once more appeared on the scene  the rogue stopped short instantly  it was evident that he recognised a foeman worthy of his steel approaching  chand moorut advanced with alacrity  the rogue eyed him with a sinister expression  there was no hesitation on either side  both warriors were selfconfident nevertheless they did not rush to the battle  like equallymatched veterans they advanced with grim purpose and wary deliberation  with heads erect and curled trunks they met more like wrestlers than swordsmen each seeming to watch for a deadly grip  suddenly they locked their trunks together and began to sway to and fro with awful evidence of power each straining his huge muscles to the uttermostthe conflict of leviathan and behemoth  for only a few minutes did the result seem doubtful to the hundreds of spectators who on elephantback or hillside gazed with glaring eyes and bated breath and in profound silence  the slightly superior bulk and weight of our gladiator soon began to tell  the rogue gave way slightly  chand moorut with the skill of the trained warrior or the practised pugilist took instant advantage of the move  with the rush of a thunderbolt he struck the rogue with his head on the shoulder the effect was terrific  it caused him to turn a complete somersault into the jungle where he fell with a thud and a crash that could be heard far and near and there he lay sprawling for a few moments nothing but struggling legs trunk and tail being visible above the long grass  hooray shouted junkie unable to restrain himself  just what my man quin said continued jackman  only he added musha  thunderanturf and well i niver  and well he might too for none of us ever saw such a sight before  but the victory was not quite gained yet for the rogue sprang up with amazing agility and refusing again to face such a terrible foe he ran away pursued hotly and clamorously by the whole khedda  i made my mahowt keep as close to chand moorut as possible wishing to be in at the death  suddenly a louder uproar in advance and a shrill trumpeting assured me that the rogue had again been brought to bay  although somewhat exhausted and shaken by his flight and the tremendous knock down he fought viciously and kept all his smaller foes at a respectful distance by repeated charges until chand moorut again came up and laid him flat with another irresistible charge  he staggered to his feet again however and now the other fighting elephants raj mungul isri pershad and others were brought into action  these attacked the rogue furiously knocking him down when he attempted to rise and belabouring him with their trunks until he was thoroughly exhausted  then one of the khedda men crept up behind him on foot with thick ropes fitted for the purpose of tying him and fixed them on the rogues hind legs  but the brave man paid heavily for his daring  he was still engaged with the ropes when the animal suddenly kicked out and broke the poor fellows thigh  he was quickly lifted up and taken to camp  not so quickly however was the rogue taken to camp  as it was growing dark some of us resolved to bivouac where the capture had been made and tied our captive to a tree  next morning we let him go with only a hind leg hobbled so that he might find breakfast for himself then having disposed of our own breakfast we proceeded to induce our prisoner to go along with usa dangerous and difficult operation  as long as he believed that he might go where he pleased we could induce him to take a few steps forward but the moment he understood what we were driving at he took the sulks like an enormous spoilt child and refused to move  the koonkies were therefore brought up and raj mungul going behind gave him a shove that was irresistible  he lost temper and turned furiously on raj but received such an awful whack on the exposed flank from isri pershad that he felt his case to be hopeless and sulked again  going down on his knees he stuck his tusks into the ground like a sheet anchor with a determination that expressed move me out o this if you can  chand moorut accepted the unspoken challenge  he gave the rogue a shove that not only raised his hind legs in the air but caused him to stand on his head and finally hurled him on his back  as he rose doggedly he received several admonitory punches and advanced a few paces  spearmen also were brought forward to prick him on but they only induced him to curl his trunk round a friendly tree that came in his way and hold on  neither bumping pricking nor walloping had now any effect  he seemed to have anchored himself there for the remainder of his natural life by an unnatural attachment  in this extremity the khedda men had recourse to their last resource they placed under him some native fireworks specially prepared for such emergencies and as it were blew him up moderately  being thus surprised into letting go his hold of the tree he was urged slowly forward as before  you see we did not want to kill the beast though he richly deserved death having killed so many natives besides keeping a whole neighbourhood in alarm for years  we were anxious to take him to camp and we managed it at last though the difficulty was almost superhuman and may to some extent be conceived when i tell you that although we spent the whole of that day from dawn to sunset struggling with our obstinate captive and with the entire force of the khedda we only advanced to the extent of four or five hundred yards  now while this amazing story was being told by giles jackman to his friends in barrets room a very different story was being told in the room above them  that room was the nursery and its only occupants were little flo and her black doll  the rain had cleared off towards the afternoon and a gleam of sunshine entering the nursery windows had formed a spot of intense light on the nursery floor  this seemed to have suggested something of great interest to flo for after gazing at it with bright eyes for some time she suddenly held the doll before her and said  blackie im goin to tell you a stowya bustingly intewestin stowy  we must remind the reader here that flo was naturally simple and sweet and that as junkie was her chief playmate she was scarcely responsible for her language  the stowy continued flo is all bout doan of ak who was bunt by some naughty men long long ago  dyou hear blackie  it would make your hair stand on endif you had any  thereupon the little one set blackie on a stool propped her against the wall and gave her a fairly correct account of the death of the unfortunate joan of arc as related by mrs gordon that morning  she wound up with the questionnow what you think of zat blackie  as blackie would not answer flo had to draw on her own bank of imagination for further supplies of thought  come she cried suddenly with the eagerness of one whose cheque has just been honoured lets play at doan of ak  you will be doan and i will be the naughty men  ill bun you  you mustnt squeal or kick up a wumpus you know but be dood  having made this stipulation our little heroine placed the black martyr on an oldfashioned strawbottomed chair near the window and getting hold of a quantity of paper and some old cotton dresses she piled the whole round blackie to represent faggots  this done she stepped back and surveyed her work as an artist might study a picture  youve dot your best muslin fock on daling an itll be spoiled but i dont care for zat  now say your pays doan  with this admonitory remark flo screwed up a piece of paper went to the fireplace made a very long arm through the fender and lighted it next moment she applied the flame to the faggots which blazed up with surprising rapidity  stepping quickly back the dear little child gazed at her work with intense delight beaming from every feature  now be dood blackie  dont make a wumpus she said and as she said it the flames caught the window curtains and went up with a flare that caused flo to shout with mingled delight and alarm  i wonder remarked mrs gordon who chanced to be in the drawingroom on the windward side of the nursery what amuses flo so much  she arose and went leisurely to see  roderick the groom being in the harnessroom on the lee side of the nursery at the time made a remark with the same opening words  i wonder said he what that wull pe  a sniffing action of the nose told what that meant  dont you smell a smell tonal  donald sniffed and replied that he didwhatever  it wull pe somethin on fire tonal said the groom dropping the harnessbrush and running out to the yard  donald being of the same opinion followed him  at the same moment a piercing shriek was heard to issue from the house and wild confusion followed  fire fire yelled a voice in the yard outside with that intensity of meaning which is born of thorough conviction  who that has never been roused by fire can imagine the sensations that the cry evokes and who that really has experienced those sensations can hope to explain them to the inexperienced  we cannot we will not try  but let us not plunge with undue haste into a fire  it will be remembered that we left jackman in barrets room having just ended his elephant story to the satisfaction of his friends while mrs gordon was on her way to the nursery bent on investigation  well the voice that shrieked in the nursery was that of mrs gordon and that which yelled in the yard was the voice of the groom supplemented by donalds treble  of course the gentlemen sprang to their feet on hearing the uproar dashed from the room in a body and made straight for the nursery  on the way they met mrs gordon with flo in her armsall safe not a hair of her pretty little head singed but looking rather appalled by the consequences of what she had done  safe thank god exclaimed the laird turning and descending with his wife and child with some vague thoughts that he might be likely to find mrs moss in her favourite place of resort the library  he was right  he found her there in a dead faint on the floor  he also found his three boys there exerting themselves desperately to haul her out of the room by a foot and an arm and the skirt of her dress  we knew she was here daddy gasped eddie and came straight to help her  out o the way cried the laird as he grasped mrs moss in his arms and bore her away  mother and flo are safe boys  look out for yourselves  ill go for the photographs  come help me ted cried archie as he ran up the now smoking stairs  ill go for milly cried the heroic junkie as with flashing eyes he dashed towards her room  but barret had gone for milly before him and without success  she was not in her room  milly  milly he shouted in tones of undisguised anxiety as he burst out of the nursery after finding with his companions that no one was there and that suffocation was imminent then as no milly replied he rushed up to the garret in the belief that she might have taken refuge there or on the roof in her terror  just after he had rushed out of the nursery junkie burst in  the boy was in his element now  we do not mean that he was a salamander and revelled in fire and smoke but he had read of fires and heard of them till his own little soul was ablaze with a desire to save some one from a fireany onesomehow or anyhow  finding like the rest that he could scarcely breathe he made but one swift circuit of the room  in doing so he tumbled on the chair on which the cause of all the mischief still sat smoking but undeniably dood  blackie he gasped and seized hold of her denuded but still unconsumed wooden body  a few moments later he sprang through the entrance door and tumbled out on the lawn where most of the females of the establishment were standing  saved he cried in a voice of choking triumph as he rose and held up the rescued and smoking doll  doan my daling doan cried flo extending her arms eagerly to receive the martyr  by that time the house was fairly alight in its upper storey despite the utmost efforts of all the men to extinguish the fire with buckets of water  no use no use to waste time trying said the laird as he ran out among the females on the lawn  is everybody safe eh  millywheres milly  milly wheres milly echoed a stentorian voice as barret bounded out of the smoking house with singed hair and blackened face  therethere she is cried several of the party as they pointed towards the avenue leading to the house  all eyes were eagerly turned in that direction and a general exclamation of thankfulness escaped as milly was seen running towards the scene of action  she had been down seeing old mrs donaldson and knew nothing of what had occurred till she came in sight of the conflagration    chapter sixteen  two fires subdued  barret half ashamed of the wild anxiety he displayed turned at once sprang back into the burning house and began to expend his energies in helping his companions and the men of the establishment to save as much as possible of the lairds property  while this was being done and the attention of every one was directed exclusively to the work of salvagein which work pat quin shone conspicuous for daring as well as for all but miraculous power to endure heat and swallow smoke roderick the groom retired to the lawn for a few moments respite  he was accompanied by donald his faithful assistant who was almost exhausted by his labours  tonal poy what iss it that muster archie wull pe doin  i think he wull pe takin the hoose  they had not time to make further inquiry for just then the wind changed and blew the flames towards the part of the mansion that had been already burned giving some hope that the other parts might yet be saved and calling for the redoubled efforts of all hands  donald was right in his conjecture  archie was indeed takin the house  he and eddiehaving succeeded in rescuing the photographic apparatus and finding that no lives were in danger and that enough people were already endeavouring to save the propertyhad calmly devoted themselves to taking photographs of the blazing scene from several points of viewa feat that was still possible as daylight had not yet been diminished in power  the change of wind however brought their operations to an abrupt close for no idlers were tolerated  even the women were summoned to stand in a row and pass buckets from a neighbouring pond to the burning house  the proceedings now had been reduced to some degree of order by giles jackman whose experience abroad had tended to develop his powers of organisation  the buckets were passed in uninterrupted succession from the pond to the house where mabberly received them at the front door that being deemed the point where danger and the need for unusual energy began  he passed them in through the smoke of the hall to macrummle who handed them to roderick and the butler  these last stood in the dense smoke of the staircase at the head of which the tall gamekeeper jackman and barret were engaged in close and deadly conflict with the flames intense heat falling debris and partial suffocation  the rest of the people headed by the laird who seemed to have renewed his youth and become ubiquitous continued the work of salvage  by that time the party of warriors who fought the flames was increased by the shepherds and a few small farmers who dwelt in the neighbourhood these being stalwart and willing men were a valuable accession to the force and did good service not only in saving property but in extinguishing the fire  so that before night closed in the flames were finally subdued after about onehalf of the mansion had been consumed  that half however was still a source of great danger the walls being intensely hot and the fallen beams a mass of glowing charcoal which the least breath of wind blew into a flame  a few of the shepherds were therefore stationed to watch these and pour water on them continually but the need for urgent haste was past and most of the people had assembled on the lawn among the furniture when the stars began to glimmer in the darkening sky  my dear said the laird on finding his wife in the group it is all safe now so you had better get off to rest and take all the women with ye  come girls be off to your beds he added turning with kindly smile to the domestics and with the energetic manner that was habitual to him  youve done good service and stand much in need of rest all of you  the men will keep a sharp look out on whats left o the fire so you have nothing to fear  off with you an get to sleep  there was no hesitation in obeying the lairds commands  the female domestics went off at once to their dormitories and these were fortunately in that part of the mansion which had escaped  some of the younger girls however made no effort to conceal a giggle as they glanced at their master who with coat off shirt torn face blackened hair dishevelled and person dripping presented rather an undignified appearance  but as worthy allan gordon had never set up a claim to dignity the giggles only amused him  duncan  duncan man where are ye he called out when the ladies and female domestics had gone  oh there ye arean not much more respectable than myself he added as the butler answered to his summons  go and fetch the whisky bottle  well all be the better of a dram after such a fight  what say you gentlemen  do you not relax your teetotal principles a little on an occasion like this  we never relax our total abstinence principles returned jackman with a smile as he wrung some of the water out of his garments  i think i may speak for my companions as well as myself  friendship has been a sufficient stimulant while we were engaged in the work and gratitude for success will suffice now that the work is done  run donald boy an tell them to get some hot coffee ready at once its all very well gentlemen said the laird turning again to his friends to talk of subsisting on friendship and gratitude but although very good in their way they wont do for present necessities at least it would ill become me to express my gratitude to such good friends without offering something more  for myself he added filling and tossing off a glass of whisky im an old man and not used to this kind of work so ill be the better of a dram  besides the gordonsmy branch of them at leasthave always taken kindly to mountain dew in moderation of course in strict moderation  there was a quiet laugh at this among some of the men who stood near for it was wellknown that not a few of the lairds ancestors had taken kindly to mountain dew without the hampering influence of moderation though the good man himself had never been known to exceedin the celtic acceptation of that term  are ye laughing you rascals he cried turning to the group with a beaming though blackened countenance  come here an have your share as a penalty  nothing loath the men came forward and with a quiet word of thanks each poured the undiluted fiery liquid down his throat with what the boy donald styled a pech of satisfaction  ivor donaldson chanced to be one of the group but he did not come forward with the rest  come ivor man and have a dram said the laird pouring out a glass  but the keeper did not move  he stood with his arms crossed firmly on his broad chest and a stern dogged expression on his handsome face  ivor hi exclaimed the old gentleman in a louder voice supposing that the man had not heard  after work like this a dram will do you good  oo ay remarked one of the shepherds who had probably began to feel the good by that time a tram of whusky iss a fery coot thing at all timesspecially when it is coot whusky  at this profound witticism there was a general laugh among the men in the midst of which the laird repeated his invitation to ivor saying that he seemed knocked up after his exertions which was partially true and adding that surely he was man enough to take a little for his good at such a time without giving way to it  the laird did not mean this as a taunt but it was taken as such by the keeper who came forward quickly seized the glass and drained it having done so he stood for a moment like one awaking from a dream then without a word of thanks he dropped the glass sprang into the shrubbery and disappeared  the laird was surprised and his conscience smote him but he turned the incident off with a laugh  now lads he said go to work again  it will take all your energies to keep the fire down if it comes on to blow and your comrades must be tired by this time  fortunately it did not come on to blow  the night was profoundly calm so that a steady though small supply of water sufficed to quench incipient flames  meanwhile giles jackman had left the group on the lawn almost at the same moment with the gamekeeper for having been accustomed to deal with men in similar circumstances he had a suspicion of what might follow  the poor man having broken the resolve so recently and so seriously formed had probably he thought become desperate  ivor was too active for him however  he disappeared before jackman had followed more than a few yards  after a few moments of uncertainty the latter made straight for old molly donaldsons cottage thinking it possible that her unhappy son might go there  on the way he had to pass the keepers own cottage and was surprised to see a light in it and the door wide open  as he approached the sound of the keepers voice was heard speaking violently mingled with blows as if delivered with some heavy instrument against timber  a loud crash of breaking wood met jackmans ear as he sprang in  ivor was in the act of rending the remains of a door from a corner cupboard while an axe which he had just dropped lay at his feet on the earthen floor  a black quart bottle visible through the opening which had been made showed the reason of his assault on the cupboard  if there had been any uncertainty on the point it would have been dispelled by the wild laugh or yell of fierce exultation with which he seized the bottle drew the cork and raised it to his dry lips  before it reached them however jackmans strong hand seized the keepers arm  a gasp from the roused giant and the deadly pallor of his countenance as he glanced round showed that superstition had suddenly seized on his troubled soul but no sooner did he see who it was that had checked him than the hot blood rebounded to his face and a fierce glare shot from his eyes  thank godnot too late exclaimed jackman fervently  the thanksgiving was addressed to god of course without reference to its influence on ivor but no words apparently could have been used with better effect upon the keepers spirit  his eyes lost their ferocity and he stood irresolute  break it like a good fellow said jackman in a soft kindly voice as he pointed to the bottle  i broke one before sir said ivor in a despairing tone and you see how useless that was  give it to me then  as he spoke he took the bottle from the mans grasp and cast it through the open doorway where it was shivered to atoms on the stones outside  striding towards a pitcher of water which stood in a corner of the room the keeper seized it put it to his lips and almost drained it  there he exclaimed that will drown the devil for a time  no ivor it wont but it will help to drown it said jackman in the same kindly almost cheerful voice  neither cold water nor hottest fire can slay the evils that are around and within us  there is only one saviour from sinjesus who died for the sins of the whole world  he makes use of means however and these means help towards the great end  but it was not the saviour who told you to lock that bottle in that cupboardwas it  an expression of perplexity came over the keepers face  you are right sir it was not  but to my thinkin it was not the devil either  very likely not  i think sometimes we are inclined to put many things on the devils shoulders which ought to rest on our own  you know what the bible says about the deceitfulness of our hearts  i do sir an yet i dont quite see that it was that either  i did not put that bottle there to have it handy when i wanted it  i put it there when i made up my mind to fight this battle in christs name so as i might see if he gave me strength to resist the temptation when it was always before me  just so ivor my friend  that if shows that you doubted him moreover he has put into our mouths that prayer lead us not into temptation and you proposed to keep temptation always before your eyes  no sir no not quite so bad as that cried the keeper growing excited  i shut the door an locked the accursed thing out of my sight and when i found i could not resist the temptation i took the key out and flung it into the sea  would it not have been better to have flung the evil thing itself into the sea  you soon found another key said his friend pointing to the axe  you say truth sir but oh you hev no notion o the fight i hev had wi that drink  the days an nights of torment  the horrors  ay if men could only taste the horrors before they tasted the drink i do believe there would be no drunkards at all  i hev lain on that bed sir he pointed to it as he spoke while large drops stood on his pale brow at the very recollection and i hev seen devils and toads and serpents crawlin round me and over megreat spiders and hairy shapeless things wi slimy legs goin over my face and into my mouth though i gnashed my teeth togetherand glaring into my tight shut eyes an strangling me  oh sir i know not what hell may be but i think that it begins on earth wi some men  from all this jesus came to save us ivor said jackman endeavouring to turn the poor mans mind from the terrible thoughts that seemed about to overwhelm him but god will have us to consent to be saved in his own way  when you put the temptation in the cupboard you disobeyed him and therefore were trying to be saved in your own way disobedience and salvation cannot go together because salvation means deliverance from disobedience  you and i will pray ivor that god would give us his holy spirit and then we shall fight our battles in future with more success  thereupon standing as they were but with bowed spirits and heads they laid the matter in the hands of god in a brief but earnest prayer  while these two were thus engaged the scene at the house had entered upon another phase  the weather which all that day had been extremely changeable suddenly assumed its gloomiest aspect and rain began to fall heavily  gradually the fall increased in volume and at last descended in an absolute deluge rendering the use of waterbuckets quite unnecessary and accomplishing in a very few minutes what all the men at the place could not have done in as many hours  but that which prevented effectually the extension of the fire caused almost as effectually the destruction of much of the property exposed on the lawn  the men were therefore set to work with all their energies to replace in the unburnt part of the mansion all that they had so recently carried out of it  in this work ivor donaldson found a sufficient outlet for the fierce unnatural energies which had been aroused within him  he went about heaving and hauling and staggering under weights that in an ordinary state of body and mind he could scarcely have moved  little notice was taken of him however for every one else was if not doing the same thing at least working up to the utmost extent of his ability  before midnight all was over  the fire was what the cook termed black out  the furniture more than half destroyed was rehoused  the danger of a revival of the flames was past and the warriors in the great battle felt themselves free to put off their armour and seek refreshment  this they didthe males at leastin the gunroom which being farthest from the fire and therefore left untouched had not been damaged either by fire or water  here the thoughtful laird had given orders to have a cold collation spread and here with his guests menservants boys and neighbouring farmers around him he sat down to supper    chapter seventeen  conclusion  we are a queer lot whatever remarked one of the farmers with a deep sigh and a candid smile as he looked round the company  the observation was incontrovertible if charcoaled faces lank hair torn and dripping garments and a general appearance of drownedratiness may be regarded as queer  my friends said the laird digging the carving fork into a cold turkey we are also a hungry lot if i may judge of others by myself so let me advise you to fall to  we cant afford to sit long over our supper in present circumstances  help yourselves and make the most of your opportunities  thank god said giles jackman that we have the opportunity to sit down to sup under a roof at all  amen to that returned the laird and thanks to you all my friends for the help you have rendered  but for you this house and all in it would have been burnt to ashes  i never before felt so strongly how true it is that we know not what a day may bring forth  what you say sir is fery true remarked a neighbouring small farmer who had a sycophantish tendency to echo or approve whatever fell from the lairds lips  it is indeed true returned his host wiping the charcoal from his face with a moist handkerchief but it is the word that says it not i and is it not strange he added turning with a humorous look to barret that after all these years the influence of joan of arc should be still so powerful in the western isles  to think that she should set my house on fire in this nineteenth century  i am very glad she did suddenly exclaimed junkie who having been pretty well ignored or forgotten by everybody was plying his knife and fork among the other heroes of the fight in a state of inexpressible felicity  you rascal exclaimed his father you should have been in bed long ago  but why are you so glad that joan set the house on fire  because she gave me the chance to save blackies life replied junkie with supreme contentment  the company laughed and continued their meal but some of them recalled the proverb which states that the boy is father to the man and secretly prophesied a heroic career for junkie    ten months passed away during which period allan gordon retired to his residence in argyllshire while his mansion in the western island was being restored  during the same period archie produced innumerable hazy photographs of kinlossie house in a state of conflagration eddie painted several good copies of the bad painting into which milly moss had introduced a megatherium cow and other specimens of violent perspective and junkie underwent a few terrible paroxysms of intense hatred of learning in all its aspects in which paroxysms he was much consoled by the approval and sympathy of dear little flo  during this period also mabberly applied himself to his duties in london unaffected by the loss of the fairy and profoundly interested in the success of his friend barret who had devoted himself heart and head to natural history with a view to making that science his profession though his having been left a competence by his father rendered a profession unnecessary from a financial point of view  as for giles jackman that stalwart woodsandforester returned to his adopted land accompanied by the faithful quin and busied himself in the activities of his adventurous career while he sought to commend the religion of jesus alike to native and european both by precept and example proving the great truth that godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life which now is and of that which is to come  macrummle during the same period spent much time in his study writing for publication an elaborate treatise on fishing with a few notes on shooting in the western isles  he was encouraged in this work by a maiden sister who worshipped him and by the presence of an enormous stuffed eagle in a corner of his study  one day towards the close of this period of ten months a beautiful little woman and a handsome young man might have been seen riding in one of the quiet streets of london  they rode neither on horseback nor in a carriage still less in a cab  their vehicle was a tricycle of the form which has obtained the name of sociable  see this is the corner milly said the young man  i told you that one of the very first places i would take you to see after our marriage would be the spot where i had the good fortune to run our mother down so now i have kept my word  there is the very spot by the lamppost where the sweep stood looking at the thin little old lady so pathetically when i was forced to rise and run away  oh john exclaimed milly pointing with eager looks along the street and there is the thin little old lady herself  so it is  well coincidences will never cease said barret as he stepped from the sociable and hurried to meet mrs moss who shook her finger and head at him as she pointed to the pavement near the lamppost  i would read you a lecture now sir she said but will reserve it for here is a letter that may interest you  it did indeed interest all three of them as they sat together that afternoon in the sunshine of millys boudoir for it was a long and wellwritten epistle from old molly donaldson  we will not venture to weary the reader with all that the good old woman had to say but it may perhaps be of interest to transcribe the concluding sentence  it ran thusyou will be glad to hear that my dear ivor is doing well  he was married in march to aggy anderson an they live in the old cottage beside me  ivor has put on the blue ribbon  the laird has put it on too to the surprise o everybody  but i think little o that  i think more o a bit pasteboard that hangs over my sons mantelpiece on which he has written wi his own hand the blessed wordssaved by grace  the end
