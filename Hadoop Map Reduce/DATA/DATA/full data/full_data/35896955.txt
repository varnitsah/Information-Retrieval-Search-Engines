35896955	michael brother of jerry   foreword   very early in my life possibly because of the insatiable curiosity that was born in me i came to dislike the performances of trained animals  it was my curiosity that spoiled for me this form of amusement for i was led to seek behind the performance in order to learn how the performance was achieved  and what i found behind the brave show and glitter of performance was not nice  it was a body of cruelty so horrible that i am confident no normal person exists who once aware of it could ever enjoy looking on at any trainedanimal turn  now i am not a nambypamby  by the book reviewers and the nambypambys i am esteemed a sort of primitive beast that delights in the spilled blood of violence and horror  without arguing this matter of my general reputation accepting it at its current face value let me add that i have indeed lived life in a very rough school and have seen more than the average mans share of inhumanity and cruelty from the forecastle and the prison the slum and the desert the executionchamber and the lazar house to the battlefield and the military hospital  i have seen horrible deaths and mutilations  i have seen imbeciles hanged because being imbeciles they did not possess the hire of lawyers  i have seen the hearts and stamina of strong men broken and i have seen other men by illtreatment driven to permanent and howling madness  i have witnessed the deaths of old and young and even infants from sheer starvation  i have seen men and women beaten by whips and clubs and fists and i have seen the rhinoceroshide whips laid around the naked torsos of black boys so heartily that each stroke stripped away the skin in full circle  and yet let me add finally never have i been so appalled and shocked by the worlds cruelty as have i been appalled and shocked in the midst of happy laughing and applauding audiences when trainedanimal turns were being performed on the stage  one with a strong stomach and a hard head may be able to tolerate much of the unconscious and undeliberate cruelty and torture of the world that is perpetrated in hot blood and stupidity  i have such a stomach and head but what turns my head and makes my gorge rise is the coldblooded conscious deliberate cruelty and torment that is manifest behind ninety nine of every hundred trainedanimal turns  cruelty as a fine art has attained its perfect flower in the trainedanimal world  possessed myself of a strong stomach and a hard head inured to hardship cruelty and brutality nevertheless i found as i came to manhood that i unconsciously protected myself from the hurt of the trainedanimal turn by getting up and leaving the theatre whenever such turns came on the stage  i say unconsciously  by this i mean it never entered my mind that this was a programme by which the possible deathblow might be given to trainedanimal turns  i was merely protecting myself from the pain of witnessing what it would hurt me to witness  but of recent years my understanding of human nature has become such that i realize that no normal healthy human would tolerate such performances did he or she know the terrible cruelty that lies behind them and makes them possible  so i am emboldened to suggest here and now three things  first let all humans inform themselves of the inevitable and eternal cruelty by the means of which only can animals be compelled to perform before revenuepaying audiences  second i suggest that all men and women and boys and girls who have so acquainted themselves with the essentials of the fine art of animaltraining should become members of and ally themselves with the local and national organizations of humane societies and societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals  and the third suggestion i cannot state until i have made a preamble like hundreds of thousands of others i have worked in other fields striving to organize the mass of mankind into movements for the purpose of ameliorating its own wretchedness and misery  difficult as this is to accomplish it is still more difficult to persuade the human into any organised effort to alleviate the ill conditions of the lesser animals  practically all of us will weep red tears and sweat bloody sweats as we come to knowledge of the unavoidable cruelty and brutality on which the trainedanimal world rests and has its being  but not onetenth of one per cent of us will join any organization for the prevention of cruelty to animals and by our words and acts and contributions work to prevent the perpetration of cruelties on animals  this is a weakness of our own human nature  we must recognize it as we recognize heat and cold the opaqueness of the nontransparent and the everlasting downpull of gravity  and still for us for the ninetynine and ninetenths per cent of us under the easy circumstance of our own weakness remains another way most easily to express ourselves for the purpose of eliminating from the world the cruelty that is practised by some few of us for the entertainment of the rest of us on the trained animals who after all are only lesser animals than we on the round worlds surface  it is so easy  we will not have to think of dues or corresponding secretaries  we will not have to think of anything save when in any theatre or place of entertainment a trainedanimal turn is presented before us  then without premeditation we may express our disapproval of such a turn by getting up from our seats and leaving the theatre for a promenade and a breath of fresh air outside coming back when the turn is over to enjoy the rest of the programme  all we have to do is just that to eliminate the trainedanimal turn from all public places of entertainment  show the management that such turns are unpopular and in a day in an instant the management will cease catering such turns to its audiences  jack london  glen ellen sonoma county california  december 8 1915     chapter i   but michael never sailed out of tulagi niggerchaser on the eugenie once in five weeks the steamer makambo made tulagi its port of call on the way from new guinea and the shortlands to australia  and on the night of her belated arrival captain kellar forgot michael on the beach in itself this was nothing for at midnight captain kellar was back on the beach himself climbing the high hill to the commissioners bungalow while the boats crew vainly rummaged the landscape and canoe houses  in fact an hour earlier as the makambos anchor was heaving out and while captain kellar was descending the port gangplank michael was coming on board through a starboard porthole  this was because michael was inexperienced in the world because he was expecting to meet jerry on board this boat since the last he had seen of him was on a boat and because he had made a friend  dag daughtry was a steward on the makambo who should have known better and who would have known better and done better had he not been fascinated by his own particular and peculiar reputation  by luck of birth possessed of a genial but soft disposition and a splendid constitution his reputation was that for twenty years he had never missed his days work nor his six daily quarts of bottled beer even as he bragged when in the german islands where each bottle of beer carried ten grains of quinine in solution as a specific against malaria  the captain of the makambo and before that the captains of the moresby the masena the sir edward grace and various others of the queerly named burns philp company steamers had done the same was used to pointing him out proudly to the passengers as a manthing novel and unique in the annals of the sea  and at such times dag daughtry below on the forard deck feigning unawareness as he went about his work would steal sideglances up at the bridge where the captain and his passengers stared down on him and his breast would swell pridefully because he knew that the captain was saying see him thats dag daughtry the human tank  nevers been drunk or sober in twenty years and has never missed his six quarts of beer per diem  you wouldnt think it to look at him but i assure you its so  i cant understand  gets my admiration  always does his time his timeandahalf and his double time over time  why a single glass of beer would give me heartburn and spoil my next good meal  but he flourishes on it  look at him  look at him  and so knowing his captains speech swollen with pride in his own prowess dag daughtry would continue his shipwork with extra vigour and punish a seventh quart for the day in advertisement of his remarkable constitution  it was a queer sort of fame as queer as some men are and dag daughtry found in it his justification of existence  wherefore he devoted his energy and the soul of him to the maintenance of his reputation as a sixquart man  that was why he made in odd moments of offduty turtleshell combs and hair ornaments for profit and was prettily crooked in such a matter as stealing another mans dog  somebody had to pay for the six quarts which multiplied by thirty amounted to a tidy sum in the course of the month and since that man was dag daughtry he found it necessary to pass michael inboard on the makambo through a starboard porthole  on the beach that night at tulagi vainly wondering what had become of the whaleboat michael had met the squat thick hairgrizzled ships steward  the friendship between them was established almost instantly for michael from a merry puppy had matured into a merry dog  far beyond jerry was he a sociable good fellow and this despite the fact that he had known very few white men  first there had been mister haggin derby and bob of meringe next captain kellar and captain kellars mate of the eugenie and finally harley kennan and the officers of the ariel  without exception he had found them all different and delightfully different from the hordes of blacks he had been taught to despise and to lord it over  and dag daughtry had proved no exception from his first greeting of hello you white mans dog what r you doin herein nigger country michael had responded coyly with an assumption of dignified aloofness that was given the lie by the eager tilt of his ears and the goodhumour that shone in his eyes  nothing of this was missed by dag daughtry who knew a dog when he saw one as he studied michael in the light of the lanterns held by black boys where the whaleboats were landing cargo  two estimates the steward quickly made of michael he was a likable dog genialnatured on the face of it and he was a valuable dog  because of those estimates dag daughtry glanced about him quickly  no one was observing  for the moment only blacks stood about and their eyes were turned seaward where the sound of oars out of the darkness warned them to stand ready to receive the next cargoladen boat  off to the right under another lantern he could make out the resident commissioners clerk and the makambos supercargo heatedly discussing some error in the bill of lading  the steward flung another quick glance over michael and made up his mind he turned away casually and strolled along the beach out of the circle of lantern light  a hundred yards away he sat down in the sand and waited  worth twenty pounds if a penny he muttered to himself  if i couldnt get ten pounds for him just like that with a thankyoumaam im a sucker that dont know a terrier from a greyhoundsure ten pounds in any pub on sydney beach  and ten pounds metamorphosed into quart bottles of beer reared an immense and radiant vision very like a brewery inside his head  a scurry of feet in the sand and low sniffings stiffened him to alertness  it was as he had hoped  the dog had liked him from the start and had followed him  for dag daughtry had a way with him as michael was quickly to learn when the mans hand reached out and clutched him half by the jowl half by the slack of the neck under the ear  there was no threat in that reach nothing tentative nor timorous  it was hearty allconfident and it produced confidence in michael  it was roughness without hurt assertion without threat surety without seduction  to him it was the most natural thing in the world thus to be familiarly seized and shaken about by a total stranger while a jovial voice muttered thats right dog  stick around stick around and youll wear diamonds maybe  certainly michael had never met a man so immediately likable  dag daughtry knew instinctively to be sure how to get on with dogs  by nature there was no cruelty in him  he never exceeded in peremptoriness nor in petting  he did not overbid for michaels friendliness  he did bid but in a manner that conveyed no sense of bidding  scarcely had he given michael that introductory jowlshake when he released him and apparently forgot all about him  he proceeded to light his pipe using several matches as if the wind blew them out  but while they burned close up to his fingers and while he made a simulation of prodigious puffing his keen little blue eyes under shaggy grizzled brows intently studied michael  and michael ears cocked and eyes intent gazed at this stranger who seemed never to have been a stranger at all  if anything it was disappointment michael experienced in that this delightful twolegged god took no further notice of him  he even challenged him to closer acquaintance with an invitation to play with an abrupt movement lifting his paws from the ground and striking them down stretched out well before his body bent down from the rump in such a curve that almost his chest touched the sand his stump of a tail waving signals of good nature while he uttered a sharp inviting bark  and the man was uninterested pulling stolidly away at his pipe in the darkness following upon the third match  never was there a more consummate lovemaking with all the base intent of betrayal than this cavalier seduction of michael by the elderly six quart ships steward  when michael not entirely unwitting of the snub of the mans lack of interest stirred restlessly with a threat to depart he had flung at him gruffly  stick around dog stick around  dag daughtry chuckled to himself as michael advancing sniffed his trousers legs long and earnestly  and the man took advantage of his nearness to study him some more lighting his pipe and running over the dogs excellent lines  some dog some points he said aloud approvingly  say dog you could pull down ribbons like a candykid in any bench show anywheres  only thing against you is that ear and i could almost iron it out myself  a vet could do it  carelessly he dropped a hand to michaels ear and with tips of fingers instinct with sensuous sympathy began to manipulate the base of the ear where its roots bedded in the tightness of skinstretch over the skull and michael liked it  never had a mans hand been so intimate with his ear without hurting it  but these fingers were provocative only of physical pleasure so keen that he twisted and writhed his whole body in acknowledgment  next came a long steady upward pull of the ear the ear slipping slowly through the fingers to the very tip of it while it tingled exquisitely down to its roots  now to one ear now to the other this happened and all the while the man uttered low words that michael did not understand but which he accepted as addressed to him  head all right good n flat dag daughtry murmured first sliding his fingers over it and then lighting a match  an no wrinkles n some jaw good n punishing an not a shade too full in the cheek or too empty  he ran his fingers inside michaels mouth and noted the strength and evenness of the teeth measured the breadth of shoulders and depth of chest and picked up a foot  in the light of another match he examined all four feet  black all black every nail of them said daughtry an as clean feet as ever a dog walked on straightout toes with the proper arch n small n not too small  i bet your daddy and your mother cantered away with the ribbons in their day  michael was for growing restless at such searching examination but daughtry in the midst of feeling out the lines and build of the thighs and hocks paused and took michaels tail in his magic fingers exploring the muscles among which it rooted pressing and prodding the adjacent spinal column from which it sprang and twisting it about in a most daringly intimate way  and michael was in an ecstasy bracing his hindquarters to one side or the other against the caressing fingers  with open hands laid along his sides and partly under him the man suddenly lifted him from the ground  but before he could feel alarm he was back on the ground again  twentysix or sevenyoure over twentyfive right now ill bet you on it shillings to hapennies and youll make thirty when you get your full weight dag daughtry told him  but what of it  lots of the judges fancy the thirtymark  an you could always train off a few ounces  youre all dog n all correct conformation  youve got the racing build and the fighting weight an there aint no feathers on your legs  no sir mr dog your weights to the good and that ear can be ironed out by any respectable dogdoctor  i bet theres a hundred men in sydney right now that would fork over twenty quid for the right of calling you his  and then just that michael should not make the mistake of thinking he was being much made over daughtry leaned back relighted his pipe and apparently forgot his existence  instead of bidding for good will he was bent on making michael do the bidding  and michael did bumping his flanks against daughtrys knee nudging his head against daughtrys hand in solicitation for more of the blissful earrubbing and tailtwisting  daughtry caught him by the jowl instead and slowly moved his head back and forth as he addressed him  what mans dog are you  maybe youre a niggers dog an that aint right  maybe some niggers stole you an thatd be awful  think of the cruel fates that sometimes happens to dogs  its a damn shame  no white mans stand for a nigger ownin the likes of you an heres one white man that aint goin to stand for it  the idea  a nigger ownin you an not knowin how to train you  of course a nigger stole you  if i laid eyes on him right now id up and knock seven bells and the saint paul chimes out of m  sure thing i would  just show m to me thats all an see what id do to him  the idea of you takin orders from a nigger an fetchin n carryin for him  no sir dog you aint goin to do it any more  youre comin along of me an i reckon i wont have to urge you  dag daughtry stood up and turned carelessly along the beach  michael looked after him but did not follow  he was eager to but had received no invitation  at last daughtry made a low kissing sound with his lips so low was it that he scarcely heard it himself and almost took it on faith or on the testimony of his lips rather than of his ears that he had made it  no human being could have heard it across the distance to michael but michael heard it and sprang away after in a great delighted rush     chapter ii   dag daughtry strolled along the beach michael at his heels or running circles of delight around him at every repetition of that strange low lip noise and paused just outside the circle of lantern light where dusky forms laboured with landing cargo from the whaleboats and where the commissioners clerk and the makambos supercargo still wrangled over the bill of lading  when michael would have gone forward the man withstrained him with the same inarticulate almost inaudible kiss  for daughtry did not care to be seen on such dogstealing enterprises and was planning how to get on board the steamer unobserved  he edged around outside the lantern shine and went on along the beach to the native village  as he had foreseen all the ablebodied men were down at the boatlanding working cargo  the grass houses seemed lifeless but at last from one of them came a challenge in the querulous highpitched tones of age  what name  me walk about plenty too much he replied in the bechedemer english of the west south pacific  me belong along steamer  suppose m you take m me along canoe washeewashee me give m you fella boy two stick tobacco  suppose m you give m me ten stick all right along me came the reply  me give m five stick the sixquart steward bargained  suppose m you no like m five stick then you fella boy go to hell close up  there was a silence  you like m five stick daughtry insisted of the dark interior  me like m the darkness answered and through the darkness the body that owned the voice approached with such strange sounds that the steward lighted a match to see  a bleareyed ancient stood before him balancing on a single crutch  his eyes were halffilmed over by a growth of morbid membrane and what was not yet covered shone red and irritated  his hair was mangy standing out in isolated patches of wispy grey  his skin was scarred and wrinkled and mottled and in colour was a purplish blue surfaced with a grey coating that might have been painted there had it not indubitably grown there and been part and parcel of him  a blighted leperwas daughtrys thought as his quick eyes leapt from hands to feet in quest of missing toe and fingerjoints  but in those items the ancient was intact although one leg ceased midway between knee and thigh  my word  what place stop m that fella leg quoth daughtry pointing to the space which the member would have occupied had it not been absent  big fella sharkfish that fella leg stop m along him the ancient grinned exposing a horrible aperture of toothlessness for a mouth  me old fella boy too much the onelegged methuselah quavered  long time too much no smoke m tobacco  suppose m you big fella white marster give m me one fella stick close up me washeewashee you that fella steamer  suppose m me no give the steward impatiently temporized  for reply the old man halfturned and on his crutch swinging his stump of leg in the air began sidling hippityhop into the grass hut  all right daughtry cried hastily  me give m you smoke m quick fella  he dipped into a side coatpocket for the mintage of the solomons and stripped off a stick from the handful of pressed sticks  the old man was transfigured as he reached avidly for the stick and received it  he uttered little crooning noises alternating with sharp cries akin to pain halfecstatic halfpetulant as he drew a black clay pipe from a hole in his earlobe and into the bowl of it with trembling fingers untwisted and crumbled the cheap leaf of spoiled virginia crop  pressing down the contents of the full bowl with his thumb he suddenly plumped upon the ground the crutch beside him the one limb under him so that he had the seeming of a legless torso  from a small bag of twisted coconut hanging from his neck upon his withered and sunken chest he drew out flint and steel and tinder and even while the impatient steward was proffering him a box of matches struck a spark caught it in the tinder blew it into strength and quantity and lighted his pipe from it  with the first full puff of the smoke he gave over his moans and yelps the agitation began to fade out of him and daughtry appreciatively waiting saw the trembling go out of his hands the pendulous lipquivering cease the saliva stop flowing from the corners of his mouth and placidity come into the fiery remnants of his eyes  what the old man visioned in the silence that fell daughtry did not try to guess  he was too occupied with his own vision and vividly burned before him the sordid barrenness of a poorhouse ward where an ancient very like what he himself would become maundered and gibbered and drooled for a crumb of tobacco for his old clay pipe and where of all horrors no sip of beer ever obtained much less six quarts of it  and michael by the dim glows of the pipe surveying the scene of the two old men one squatted in the dark the other standing knew naught of the tragedy of age and was only aware and overwhelmingly aware of the immense likableness of this twolegged white god who with fingers of magic through earroots and tailroots and spinal column had won to the heart of him  the clay pipe smoked utterly out the old black by aid of the crutch with amazing celerity raised himself upstanding on his one leg and hobbled with his hippityhop to the beach  daughtry was compelled to lend his strength to the hauling down from the sand into the water of the tiny canoe  it was a dugout as ancient and dilapidated as its owner and in order to get into it without capsizing daughtry wet one leg to the ankle and the other leg to the knee  the old man contorted himself aboard rolling his body across the gunwale so quickly that even while it started to capsize his weight was across the dangerpoint and counterbalancing the canoe to its proper equilibrium  michael remained on the beach waiting invitation his mind not quite made up but so nearly so that all that was required was that lipnoise dag daughtry made the lipnoise so low that the old man did not hear and michael springing clear from sand to canoe was on board without wetting his feet  using daughtrys shoulder for a steppingplace he passed over him and down into the bottom of the canoe  daughtry kissed with his lips again and michael turned around so as to face him sat down and rested his head on the stewards knees  i reckon i can take my affydavy on a stack of bibles that the dog just up an followed me he grinned in michaels ear  washeewashee quick fella he commanded  the ancient obediently dipped his paddle and started pottering an erratic course in the general direction of the cluster of lights that marked the makambo  but he was too feeble panting and wheezing continually from the exertion and pausing to rest off strokes between strokes  the steward impatiently took the paddle away from him and bent to the work  halfway to the steamer the ancient ceased wheezing and spoke nodding his head at michael  that fella dog he belong big white marster along schooner    you give m me ten stick tobacco he added after due pause to let the information sink in  i give m you bang alongside head daughtry assured him cheerfully white marster along schooner plenty friend along me too much  just now he stop m along makambo  me take m dog along him along makambo  there was no further conversation from the ancient and though he lived long years after he never mentioned the midnight passenger in the canoe who carried michael away with him  when he saw and heard the confusion and uproar on the beach later that night when captain kellar turned tulagi upsidedown in his search for michael the old onelegged one remained discreetly silent  who was he to seek trouble with the strange ones the white masters who came and went and roved and ruled  in this the ancient was in nowise unlike the rest of his darkskinned melanesian race  the whites were possessed of unguessed and unthinkable ways and purposes  they constituted another world and were as a play of superior beings on an exalted stage where was no reality such as black men might know as reality where like the phantoms of a dream the white men moved and were as shadows cast upon the vast and mysterious curtain of the cosmos  the gangplank being on the port side dag daughtry paddled around to the starboard and brought the canoe to a stop under a certain open port  kwaque he called softly once and twice  at the second call the light of the port was obscured apparently by a head that piped down in a thin squeak  me stop m marster  one fella dog stop m along you the steward whispered up  keep m door shut  you wait along me  stand by  now  with a quick catch and lift he passed michael up and into unseen hands outstretched from the iron wall of the ship and paddled ahead to an open cargo port  dipping into his tobacco pocket he thrust a loose handful of sticks into the ancients hand and shoved the canoe adrift with no thought of how its helpless occupant would ever reach shore  the old man did not touch the paddle and he was unregardless of the loftysided steamer as the canoe slipped down the length of it into the darkness astern  he was too occupied in counting the wealth of tobacco showered upon him  no easy task his counting  five was the limit of his numerals  when he had counted five he began over again and counted a second five  three fives he found in all and two sticks over and thus at the end of it he possessed as definite a knowledge of the number of sticks as would be possessed by the average white man by means of the single number seventeen  more it was far more than his avarice had demanded  yet he was unsurprised  nothing white men did could surprise  had it been two sticks instead of seventeen he would have been equally unsurprised since all acts of white men were surprises the only surprise of action they could achieve for a black man would be the doing of an unsurprising thing  paddling wheezing resting oblivious of the shadowworld of the white men knowing only the reality of tulagi mountain cutting its crestline blackly across the dim radiance of the starsprinkled sky the reality of the sea and of the canoe he so feebly urged across it and the reality of his fading strength and of the death into which he would surely end the ancient black man slowly made his shoreward way     chapter iii   in the meanwhile michael  lifted through the air exchanged into invisible hands that drew him through a narrow diameter of brass into a lighted room michael looked about him in expectancy of jerry  but jerry at that moment lay cuddled beside villa kennans sleepingcot on the slant deck of the ariel as that trim craft the shortlands astern and new guinea dead ahead heeled her scuppers awhisper and garrulous to the seawelter alongside as she logged her eleven knots under the press of the freshening trades  instead of jerry from whom he had last parted on board a boat michael saw kwaque  kwaque  well kwaque was kwaque an individual more unlike all other men than most men are unlike one another  no queerer estray ever drifted along the stream of life  seventeen years old he was as men measure time but a century was measured in his leanlined face his wrinkled forehead his hollowed temples and his deepsunk eyes  from his thin legs fragilelooking as windstraws the bones of which were sheathed in withered skin with apparently no muscle padding in betweenfrom such frail stems sprouted the torso of a fat man  the huge and protuberant stomach was amply supported by wide and massive hips and the shoulders were broad as those of a hercules  but beheld sidewise there was no depth to those shoulders and the top of the chest  almost at that part of his anatomy he seemed builded in two dimensions  thin his arms were as his legs and as michael first beheld him he had all the seeming of a bigbellied black spider  he proceeded to dress a matter of moments slipping into duck trousers and blouse dirty and frayed from long usage  two fingers of his left hand were doubled into a permanent bend and to an expert would have advertised that he was a leper  although he belonged to dag daughtry just as much as if the steward possessed a chattel bill of sale of him his owner did not know that his anaesthetic twist of ravaged nerves tokened the dread disease  the manner of the ownership was simple  at king william island in the admiralties kwaque had made in the parlance of the south pacific a pierhead jump  so to speak leprosy and all he had jumped into dag daughtrys arms  strolling along the native runways in the fringe of jungle just beyond the beach as was his custom to see whatever he might pick up the steward had picked up kwaque  and he had picked him up in extremity  pursued by two very active young men armed with firehardened spears tottering along with incredible swiftness on his two spindle legs kwaque had fallen exhausted at daughtrys feet and looked up at him with the beseeching eyes of a deer fleeing from the hounds  daughtry had inquired into the matter and the inquiry was violent for he had a wholesome fear of germs and bacilli and when the two active young men tried to run him through with their filthcorroded spears he caught the spear of one young man under his arm and put the other young man to sleep with a left hook to the jaw  a moment later the young man whose spear he held had joined the other in slumber  the elderly steward was not satisfied with the mere spears  while the rescued kwaque continued to moan and slubber thankfulness at his feet he proceeded to strip them that were naked  nothing they wore in the way of clothing but from around each of their necks he removed a necklace of porpoise teeth that was worth a gold sovereign in mere exchange value from the kinky locks of one of the naked young men he drew a handcarved finetoothed comb the lofty back of which was inlaid with motherofpearl which he later sold in sydney to a curio shop for eight shillings  nose and ear ornaments of bone and turtleshell he also rifled as well as a chestcrescent of pearl shell fourteen inches across worth fifteen shillings anywhere  the two spears ultimately fetched him five shillings each from the tourists at port moresby  not lightly may a ship steward undertake to maintain a sixquart reputation  when he turned to depart from the active young men who back to consciousness were observing him with bright quick wildanimal eyes kwaque followed so close at his heels as to step upon them and make him stumble  whereupon he loaded kwaque with his trove and put him in front to lead along the runway to the beach  and for the rest of the way to the steamer dag daughtry grinned and chuckled at sight of his plunder and at sight of kwaque who fantastically titubated and ambled along barrellike on his pipestems  on board the steamer which happened to be the cockspur daughtry persuaded the captain to enter kwaque on the ships articles as stewards helper with a rating of ten shillings a month  also he learned kwaques story  it was all an account of a pig  the two active young men were brothers who lived in the next village to his and the pig had been theirsso kwaque narrated in atrocious bechedemer english  he kwaque had never seen the pig  he had never known of its existence until after it was dead  the two young men had loved the pig  but what of that  it did not concern kwaque who was as unaware of their love for the pig as he was unaware of the pig itself  the first he knew he averred was the gossip of the village that the pig was dead and that somebody would have to die for it  it was all right he said in reply to a query from the steward  it was the custom whenever a loved pig died its owners were in custom bound to go out and kill somebody anybody  of course it was better if they killed the one whose magic had made the pig sick  but failing that one any one would do  hence kwaque was selected for the bloodatonement  dag daughtry drank a seventh quart as he listened so carried away was he by the sombre sense of romance of this dark jungle event wherein men killed even strangers because a pig was dead  scouts out on the runways kwaque continued brought word of the coming of the two bereaved pigowners and the village had fled into the jungle and climbed treesall except kwaque who was unable to climb trees  my word kwaque concluded me no make m that fella pig sick  my word quoth dag daughtry you devildevil along that fella pig too much  you look m like hell  you make m any fella thing sick look along you  you make m me sick too much  it became quite a custom for the steward as he finished his sixth bottle before turning in to call upon kwaque for his story  it carried him back to his boyhood when he had been excited by tales of wild cannibals in far lands and dreamed some day to see them for himself  and here he was he would chuckle to himself with a real true cannibal for a slave  a slave kwaque was as much as if daughtry had bought him on the auction block  whenever the steward transferred from ship to ship of the burns philp fleet he always stipulated that kwaque should accompany him and be duly rated at ten shillings  kwaque had no say in the matter  even had he desired to escape in australian ports there was no need for daughtry to watch him  australia with her allwhite policy attended to that no darkskinned human whether malay japanese or polynesian could land on her shore without putting into the governments hand a cash security of one hundred pounds  nor at the other islands visited by the makambo had kwaque any desire to cut and run for it  king william island which was the only land he had ever trod was his yardstick by which he measured all other islands and since king william island was cannibalistic he could only conclude that the other islands were given to similar dietary practice  as for king william island the makambo on the former run of the cockspur stopped there every ten weeks but the direst threat daughtry ever held over him was the putting ashore of him at the place where the two active young men still mourned their pig  in fact it was their regular programme each trip to paddle out and around the makambo and make ferocious grimaces up at kwaque who grimaced back at them from over the rail  daughtry even encouraged this exchange of facial amenities for the purpose of deterring him from ever hoping to win ashore to the village of his birth  for that matter kwaque had little desire to leave his master who after all was kindly and just and never lifted a hand to him  having survived seasickness at the first and never setting foot upon the land so that he never again knew seasickness kwaque was certain he lived in an earthly paradise  he never had to regret his inability to climb trees because danger never threatened him  he had food regularly and all he wanted and it was such food  no one in his village could have dreamed of any delicacy of the many delicacies which he consumed all the time  because of these matters he even pulled through a light attack of homesickness and was as contented a human as ever sailed the seas  and kwaque it was who pulled michael through the porthole into dag daughtrys stateroom and waited for that worthy to arrive by the roundabout way of the door  after a quick look around the room and a sniff of the bunk and under the bunk which informed him that jerry was not present michael turned his attention to kwaque  kwaque tried to be friendly  he uttered a clucking noise in advertisement of his friendliness and michael snarled at this black who had dared to lay hands upon hima contamination according to michaels trainingand who now dared to address him who associated only with white gods  kwaque passed off the rebuff with a silly gibbering laugh and started to step nearer the door to be in readiness to open it at his masters coming  but at first lift of his leg michael flew at it  kwaque immediately put it down and michael subsided though he kept a watchful guard  what did he know of this strange black save that he was a black and that in the absence of a white master all blacks required watching kwaque tried slowly sliding his foot along the floor but michael knew the trick and with bristle and growl put a stop to it  it was upon this tableau that daughtry entered and while he admired michael much under the bright electric light he realized the situation  kwaque you make m walk about leg belong you he commanded in order to make sure  kwaques glance of apprehension at michael was convincing enough but the steward insisted  kwaque gingerly obeyed but scarcely had his foot moved an inch when michaels was upon him  the foot and leg petrified while michael stiffleggedly drew a halfcircle of intimidation about him  got you nailed to the floor eh daughtry chuckled  some niggerchaser my word any amount  hey you kwaque go fetch m two fella bottle of beer stop m along iceychestis he commanded in his most peremptory manner  kwaque looked beseechingly but did not stir  nor did he stir at a harsher repetition of the order  my word the steward bullied  suppose m you no fetch m beer close up i knock m eight bells n a dogwatch onta you  suppose m you no fetch m close up me make m you go ashore n walk about along king william island  no can kwaque murmured timidly  eye belong dog look along me too much  me no like m dog kaikai along me  you fright along dog his master demanded  my word me fright along dog any amount  dag daughtry was delighted  also he was thirsty from his trip ashore and did not prolong the situation  hey you dog he addressed michael  this fella boy he all right savvee  he all right  michael bobbed his tail and flattened his ears in token that he was trying to understand  when the steward patted the black on the shoulder michael advanced and sniffed both the legs he had kept nailed to the floor  walk about daughtry commanded  walk about slow fella he cautioned though there was little need  michael bristled but permitted the first timid step  at the second he glanced up at daughtry to make certain  thats right he was reassured  that fella boy belong me  he all right you bet  michael smiled with his eyes that he understood and turned casually aside to investigate an open box on the floor which contained plates of turtleshell hacksaws and emery paper        and now dag daughtry muttered weightily aloud as bottle in hand he leaned back in his armchair while kwaque knelt at his feet to unlace his shoes now to consider a name for you mister dog that will be just to your breeding and fair to my powers of invention     chapter iv   irish terriers when they have gained maturity are notable not alone for their courage fidelity and capacity for love but for their cool headedness and power of selfcontrol and restraint  they are less easily excited off their balance they can recognize and obey their masters voice in the scuffle and rage of battle and they never fly into nervous hysterics such as are common say with foxterriers  michael possessed no trace of hysteria though he was more temperamentally excitable and explosive than his bloodbrother jerry while his father and mother were a sedate old couple indeed compared with him  far more than mature jerry was mature michael playful and rowdyish  his ebullient spirits were always on tap to spill over on the slightest provocation and as he was afterwards to demonstrate he could weary a puppy with play  in short michael was a merry soul  soul is used advisedly  whatever the human soul may beinforming spirit identity personality consciousnessthat intangible thing michael certainly possessed  his soul differing only in degree partook of the same attributes as the human soul  he knew love sorrow joy wrath pride selfconsciousness humour  three cardinal attributes of the human soul are memory will and understanding and memory will and understanding were michaels  just like a human with his five senses he contacted with the world exterior to him  just like a human the results to him of these contacts were sensations  just like a human these sensations on occasion culminated in emotions  still further like a human he could and did perceive and such perceptions did flower in his brain as concepts certainly not so wide and deep and recondite as those of humans but concepts nevertheless  perhaps to let the human down a trifle from such disgraceful identity of the highest lifeattributes it would be well to admit that michaels sensations were not quite so poignant say in the matter of a needlethrust through his foot as compared with a needlethrust through the palm of a hand  also it is admitted when consciousness suffused his brain with a thought that the thought was dimmer vaguer than a similar thought in a human brain  furthermore it is admitted that never never in a million lifetimes could michael have demonstrated a proposition in euclid or solved a quadratic equation  yet he was capable of knowing beyond all peradventure of a doubt that three bones are more than two bones and that ten dogs compose a more redoubtable host than do two dogs  one admission however will not be made namely that michael could not love as devotedly as wholeheartedly unselfishly madly selfsacrificingly as a human  he did so lovenot because he was michael but because he was a dog  michael had loved captain kellar more than he loved his own life  no more than jerry for skipper would he have hesitated to risk his life for captain kellar  and he was destined as time went by and the conviction that captain kellar had passed into the inevitable nothingness along with meringe and the solomons to love just as absolutely this sixquart steward with the understanding ways and the fascinating lipcaress kwaque no for kwaque was black  kwaque he merely accepted as an appurtenance as a part of the human landscape as a chattel of dag daughtry  but he did not know this new god as dag daughtry  kwaque called him marster but michael heard other white men so addressed by the blacks many blacks had he heard call captain kellar marster  it was captain duncan who called the steward steward  michael came to hear him and his officers and all the passengers so call him and thus to michael his gods name was steward and for ever after he was to know him and think of him as steward  there was the question of his own name  the next evening after he came on board dag daughtry talked it over with him  michael sat on his haunches the length of his lower jaw resting on daughtrys knee the while his eyes dilated contracted and glowed his ears ever pricking and repricking to listen his stump tail thumping ecstatically on the floor  its this way son the steward told him  your father and mother were irish  now dont be denying it you rascal  this as michael encouraged by the unmistakable geniality and kindness in the voice wriggled his whole body and thumped double knocks of delight with his tail  not that he understood a word of it but that he did understand the something behind the speech that informed the string of sounds with all the mysterious likeableness that white gods possessed  never be ashamed of your ancestry  an remember god loves the irishkwaque  go fetch m two bottle beer fella stop m along iceychestiswhy the very mug of you my lad sticks out irish all over it  michaels

love you so you can put that in your pipe n smoke it  but as i was about to say when so rudely interrupted by your fectionate ways  here he broke off to tilt to his mouth the opened bottle kwaque handed him  he sighed wiped his lips with the back of his hand and proceeded  tis a strange thing son this silly matter of beer  kwaque the methusalemfaced ape grinnin there belongs to me  but by my faith do i belong to beer bottles n bottles of it n mountains of bottles of it enough to sink the ship  dog truly i envy you settin there comfortablelike inside your body thats untainted of alcohol  i

drained the bottle tossed it to kwaque and made signs for him to open the remaining one  the namin of you son is not lightly to be considered  irish of course but what shall it be  paddy  well may you

boy for you  hows that strike your honourablenesshigh soundin dignified as a earl or    or a retired brewer  manys the one of that gentry ive helped to retire in my day  he finished his bottle caught michael suddenly by both jowls and leaning forward rubbed noses with him  as suddenly released with thumping tail and dancing eyes michael gazed up into the gods face  a definite soul or entity or spiritthing glimmered behind his dogs eyes already fond with affection for this hairgrizzled god who talked with him he knew not what but whose very talking carried delicious and unguessable messages to his heart  hey  kwaque you  kwaque squatted on the floor his hams on his heels paused from the roughpolishing of a shell comb designed and cut out by his master and looked up eager to receive command and serve  kwaque you fella this time now savvee name stop along this fella dog his name belong m him killeny boy  you make m name stop m inside head belong you  all the time you speak m this

daughtry regarded michael with sleepy eyes  ive got you laddy he announced as he stood up and swayed toward bed  ive got your name an heres your numberi got that too high strung but reasonable  it fits you like the paper on the wall  highstrung but reasonable thats what you are killeny boy highstrung but reasonable he continued to mumble as kwaque helped to roll him into his bunk  kwaque returned to his polishing  his lips stammered and halted in the making of noiseless whispers as with corrugated brows of puzzlement he addressed the steward  marster what name stop m along that fella dog  killeny boy you kinkyhead maneater killeny boy killeny boy dag daughtry murmured drowsily  kwaque you black blooddrinker run n fetch m one fella bottle stop m along iceychestis  no stop m marster the black quavered with eyes alert for something to be thrown at him  six fella bottle he finish altogether  the stewards sole reply was a snore  the black with the twisted hand of leprosy and with a barely perceptible infiltration of the same disease thickening the skin of the forehead between the eyes bent over his polishing and ever his lips moved repeating over and over killeny boy     chapter v   for a number of days michael saw only steward and kwaque  this was because he was confined to the stewards stateroom  nobody else knew that he was on board and dag daughtry thoroughly aware that he had stolen a white mans dog hoped to keep his presence secret and smuggle him ashore when the makambo docked in sydney  quickly the steward learned michaels preeminent teachableness  in the course of his careful feeding of him he gave him an occasional chicken bone  two lessons which would scarcely be called lessons since both of them occurred within five minutes and each was not over half a minute in duration sufficed to teach michael that only on the floor of the room in the corner nearest the door could he chew chicken bones  thereafter without prompting as a matter of course when handed a bone he carried it to the corner  and why not  he had the wit to grasp what steward desired of him he had the heart that made it a happiness for him to serve  steward was a god who was kind who loved him with voice and lip who loved him with touch of hand rub of nose or enfolding arm  as all service flourishes in the soil of love so with michael  had steward commanded him to forego the chicken bone after it was in the corner he would have served him by foregoing  which is the way of the dog the only animal that will cheerfully and gladly with leaping body of joy leave its food uneaten in order to accompany or to serve its human master  practically all his waking time off duty dag daughtry spent with the imprisoned michael who at command had quickly learned to refrain from whining and barking  and during these hours of companionship michael learned many things  daughtry found that he already understood and obeyed simple things such as no yes get up and lie down and he improved on them teaching him go into the bunk and lie down go under the bunk bring one shoe bring two shoes  and almost without any work at all he taught him to roll over to say his prayers to play dead to sit up and smoke a pipe with a hat on his head and not merely to stand up on his hind legs but to walk on them  then too was the trick of no can and can do  placing a savoury nose tantalising bit of meat or cheese on the edge of the bunk on a level with michaels nose daughtry would simply say no can  nor would michael touch the food till he received the welcome can do  daughtry with the no can still in force would leave the stateroom and though he remained away half an hour or half a dozen hours on his return he would find the food untouched and michael perhaps asleep in the corner at the head of the bunk which had been allotted him for a bed  early in this trick once when the steward had left the room and michaels eager nose was within an inch of the prohibited morsel kwaque playfully inclined reached for the morsel himself and received a lacerated hand from the quick flash and clip of michaels jaws  none of the tricks that he was ever eager to do for steward would michael do for kwaque despite the fact that kwaque had no touch of meanness or viciousness in him  the point was that michael had been trained from his first dawn of consciousness to differentiate between black men and white men  black men were always the servants of white menor such had been his experience and always they were objects of suspicion ever bent on wreaking mischief and requiring careful watching the cardinal duty of a dog was to serve his white god by keeping a vigilant eye on all blacks that came about  yet michael permitted kwaque to serve him in matters of food water and other offices at first in the absence of steward attending to his ship duties and later at any time  for he realized without thinking about it at all that whatever kwaque did for him whatever food kwaque spread for him really proceeded not from kwaque but from kwaques master who was also his master  yet kwaque bore no grudge against michael and was himself so interested in his lords welfare and comfortthis lord who had saved his life that terrible day on king william island from the two griefstricken pigownersthat he cherished michael for his lords sake seeing the dog growing into his masters affection kwaque himself developed a genuine affection for michaelmuch in the same way that he worshipped anything of the stewards whether the shoes he polished for him the clothes he brushed and cleaned for him or the six bottles of beer he put into the icechest each day for him  in truth there was nothing of the masterquality in kwaque while michael was a natural aristocrat  michael out of love would serve steward but michael lorded it over the kinkyhead  kwaque possessed overwhelmingly the slavenature while in michael there was little more of the slavenature than was found in the north american indians when the vain attempt was made to make them into slaves on the plantations of cuba  all of which was no personal vice of kwaque or virtue of michael michaels heredity rigidly selected for ages by man was chiefly composed of fierceness and faithfulness  and fierceness and faithfulness together invariably produce pride  and pride cannot exist without honour nor can honour without poise  michaels crowning achievement under daughtrys tutelage in the first days in the stateroom was to learn to count up to five  many hours of work were required however in spite of his unusual high endowment of intelligence  for he had to learn first the spoken numerals second to see with his eyes and in his brain differentiate between one object and all other groups of objects up to and including the group of five and third in his mind to relate an object or any group of objects with its numerical name as uttered by steward  in the training dag daughtry used balls of paper tied about with twine he would toss the five balls under the bunk and tell michael to fetch three and neither two nor four but three would michael bring forth and deliver into his hand  when daughtry threw three under the bunk and demanded four michael would deliver the three search about vainly for the fourth then dance pleadingly with bobs of tail and halfleaps about steward and finally leap into the bed and secure the fourth from under the pillow or among the blankets  it was the same with other known objects  up to five whether shoes or shirts or pillowslips michael would fetch the number requested  and between the mathematical mind of michael who counted to five and the mind of the ancient black at tulagi who counted sticks of tobacco in units of five was a distance shorter than that between michael and dag daughtry who could do multiplication and long division  in the same manner up the same ladder of mathematical ability a still greater distance separated dag daughtry from captain duncan who by mathematics navigated the makambo  greatest mathematical distance of all was that between captain duncans mind and the mind of an astronomer who charted the heavens and navigated a thousand million miles away among the stars and who tossed a mere morsel of his mathematical knowledge the few shreds of information to captain duncan that enabled him to know from day to day the place of the makambo on the sea  in one thing only could kwaque rule michael  kwaque possessed a jews harp and whenever the world of the makambo and the servitude to the steward grew wearisome he could transport himself to king william island by thrusting the primitive instrument between his jaws and fanning weird rhythms from it with his hand and when he thus crossed space and time michael sangor howled rather though his howl possessed the same soft mellowness as jerrys  michael did not want to howl but the chemistry of his being was such that he reacted to music as compulsively as elements react on one another in the laboratory  while he lay perdu in stewards stateroom his voice was the one thing that was not to be heard so kwaque was forced to seek the solace of his jews harp in the sweltering heat of the gratings over the fireroom  but this did not continue long for either according to blind chance or to the lines of fate written in the book of life ere ever the foundations of the world were laid michael was scheduled for an adventure that was profoundly to affect not alone his own destiny but the destinies of kwaque and dag daughtry and determine the very place of their death and burial     chapter vi   the adventure that was so to alter the future occurred when michael in no uncertain manner announced to all and sundry his presence on the makambo  it was due to kwaques carelessness to commence with for kwaque left the stateroom without tightclosing the door  as the makambo rolled on an easy sea the door swung back and forth remaining wide open for intervals and banging shut but not banging hard enough to latch itself  michael crossed the high threshold with the innocent intention of exploring no farther than the immediate vicinity  but scarcely was he through when a heavier roll slammed the door and latched it  and immediately michael wanted to get back  obedience was strong in him for it was his hearts desire to serve his lords will and from the few days confinement he sensed or guessed or divined without thinking about it that it was stewards will for him to stay in the stateroom  for a long time he sat down before the closed door regarding it wistfully but being too wise to bark or speak to such inanimate object it had been part of his early puppyhood education to learn that only live things could be moved by plea or threat and that while things not alive did move as the door had moved they never moved of themselves and were deaf to anything life might have to say to them  occasionally he trotted down the short crosshall upon which the stateroom opened and gazed up and down the long hall that ran fore and aft  for the better part of an hour he did this returning always to the door that would not open  then he achieved a definite idea  since the door would not open and since steward and kwaque did not return he would go in search of them  once with this concept of action clear in his brain without timidities of hesitation and irresolution he trotted aft down the long hall  going around the right angle in which it ended he encountered a narrow flight of steps  among many scents he recognized those of kwaque and steward and knew they had passed that way  up the stairs and on the main deck he began to meet passengers  being white gods he did not resent their addresses to him though he did not linger and went out on the open deck where more of the favoured gods reclined in steamerchairs  still no kwaque or steward  another flight of narrow steep stairs invited and he came out on the boatdeck  here under the wide awnings were many more of the godsmany times more than he had that far seen in his life  the forard end of the boatdeck terminated in the bridge which instead of being raised above it was part of it  trotting around the wheelhouse to the shady leeside of it he came upon his fate for be it known that captain duncan possessed on board in addition to two foxterriers a big persian cat and that cat possessed a litter of kittens  her chosen nursery was the wheelhouse and captain duncan had humoured her giving her a box for her kittens and threatening the quartermasters with all manner of dire fates did they so much as step on one of the kittens  but michael knew nothing of this  and the big persian knew of his existence before he did of hers  in fact the first he knew was when she launched herself upon him out of the open wheelhouse doorway  even as he glimpsed this abrupt danger and before he could know what it was he leaped sideways and saved himself  from his point of view the assault was unprovoked  he was staring at her with bristling hair recognizing her for what she was a cat when she sprang again her tail the size of a large mans arm all claws and spitting fury and vindictiveness  this was too much for a selfrespecting irish terrier  his wrath was immediate with her second leap and he sprang to the side to avoid her claws and in from the side to meet her his jaws clamping together on her spinal column with a jerk while she was still in midair  the next moment she lay sprawling and struggling on the deck with a broken back  but for michael this was only the beginning  a shrill yelling rather than yelping of more enemies made him whirl half about but not quick enough  struck in flank by two fullgrown foxterriers he was slashed and rolled on the deck  the two by the way had long before made their first appearance on the makambo as little puppies in dag daughtrys coat pocketsdaughtry in his usual fashion having appropriated them ashore in sydney and sold them to captain duncan for a guinea apiece  by this time scrambling to his feet michael was really angry  in truth it was raining cats and dogs such belligerent shower all unprovoked by him who had picked no quarrels nor even been aware of his enemies until they assailed him  brave the foxterriers were despite the hysterical rage they were in and they were upon him as he got his legs under him  the fangs of one clashed with his cutting the lips of both of them and the lighter dog recoiled from the impact  the other succeeded in taking michael in flank fetching blood and hurt with his teeth  with an instant curve that was almost spasmodic of his body michael flung his flank clear leaving the others mouth full of his hair and at the same moment drove his teeth through an ear till they met  the foxterrier with a shrill yelp of pain sprang back so impetuously as to ribbon its ear as michaels teeth combed through it  the first terrier was back upon him and he was whirling to meet it when a new and equally unprovoked assault was made upon him  this time it was captain duncan in a rage at sight of his slain cat  the instep of his foot caught michael squarely under the chest half knocking the breath out of him and wholly lifting him into the air so that he fell heavily on his side  the two terriers were upon him filling their mouths with his straight wiry hair as they sank their teeth in  still on his side as he was beginning to struggle to his feet he clipped his jaws together on a leg of one who screamed with pain and retreated on three legs holding up the fourth a fore leg the bone of which michaels teeth had all but crushed  twice michael slashed the other fourfooted foe and then pursued him in a circle with captain duncan pursuing him in turn  shortening the distance by leaping across a chord of the arc of the others flight michael closed his jaws on the back and side of the neck  such abrupt arrest in midflight by the heavier dog brought the foxterrier down on deck with a heavy thump  simultaneous with this captain duncans second kick landed communicating such propulsion to michael as to tear his clenched teeth through the flesh and out of the flesh of the foxterrier  and michael turned on the captain  what if he were a white god  in his rage at so many assaults of so many enemies michael who had been peacefully looking for kwaque and steward did not stop to reckon besides it was a strange white god upon whom he had never before laid eyes  at the beginning he had snarled and growled  but it was a more serious affair to attack a god and no sound came from him as he leaped to meet the leg flying toward him in another kick  as with the cat he did not leap straight at it  to the side to avoid and in with a curve of body as it passed was his way  he had learned the trick with many blacks at meringe and on board the eugenie so that as often he succeeded as failed at it  his teeth came together in the slack of the white duck trousers  the consequent jerk on captain duncans leg made that infuriated mariner lose his balance  almost he fell forward on his face part recovered himself with a violent effort stumbled over michael who was in for another bite tottered wildly around and sat down on the deck  how long he might have sat there to recover his breath is problematical for he rose as rapidly as his stoutness would permit spurred on by michaels teeth already sunk into the fleshy part of his shoulder michael missed his calf as he uprose but tore the other leg of the trousers to shreds and received a kick that lifted him a yard above the deck in a halfsomersault and landed him on his back on deck  up to this time the captain had been on the ferocious offensive and he was in the act of following up the kick when michael regained his feet and soared up in the air not for leg or thigh but for the throat  too high it was for him to reach it but his teeth closed on the flowing black scarf and tore it to tatters as his weight drew him back to deck  it was not this so much that turned captain duncan to the pure defensive and started him retreating backward as it was the silence of michael ominous as death it was  there were no snarls nor throatthreats  with eyes straightlooking and unblinking he sprang and sprang again  neither did he growl when he attacked nor yelp when he was kicked  fear of the blow was not in him  as tom haggin had so often bragged of biddy and terrence they bred true in jerry and michael in the matter of not wincing at a blow  alwaysthey were so madethey sprang to meet the blow and to encounter the creature who delivered the blow  with a silence that was invested with the seriousness of death they were wont to attack and to continue to attack  and so michael  as the captain retreated kicking he attacked leaping and slashing  what saved captain duncan was a sailor with a deck mop on the end of a stick  intervening he managed to thrust it into michaels mouth and shove him away  this first time his teeth closed automatically upon it  but spitting it out he declined thereafter to bite it knowing it for what it was an inanimate thing upon which his teeth could inflict no hurt  nor beyond trying to avoid him was he interested in the sailor  it was captain duncan leaning his back against the rail breathing heavily and wiping the streaming sweat from his face who was michaels meat  long as it has taken to tell the battle beginning with the slaying of the persian cat to the thrusting of the mop into michaels jaws so swift had been the rush of events that the passengers springing from their deck chairs and hurrying to the scene were just arriving when michael eluded the mop of the sailor by a successful dodge and plunged in on captain duncan this time sinking his teeth so savagely into a rotund calf as to cause its owner to splutter an incoherent curse and howl of wrathful surprise  a fortunate kick hurled michael away and enabled the sailor to intervene once again with the mop  and upon the scene came dag daughtry to behold his captain frayed and bleeding and breathing apoplectically michael raging in ghastly silence at the end of a mop and a large persian mother cat writhing with a broken back  killeny boy the steward cried imperatively  through no matter what indignation and rage that possessed him his lords voice penetrated his consciousness so that cooling almost instantly michaels ears flattened his bristling hair lay down and his lips covered his fangs as he turned his head to look acknowledgment  come here killeny  michael obeyednot crouching cringingly but trotting eagerly gladly to stewards feet  lie down boy  he turned half around as he flumped himself down with a sigh of relief and with a red flash of tongue kissed stewards foot  your dog steward captain duncan demanded in a smothered voice wherein struggled anger and shortness of breath  yes sir  my dog  whats he been up to sir  the totality of what michael had been up to choked the captain completely  he could only gesture around from the dying cat to his torn clothes and bleeding wounds and the foxterriers licking their injuries and whimpering at his feet  its too bad sir     daughtry began  too bad hell the captain shut him off  bosn  throw that dog overboard  throw the dog overboard sir yes sir the boatswain repeated but hesitated  dag daughtrys face hardened unconsciously with the stiffening of his will to dogged opposition which in its own slow quiet way would go to any length to have its way  but he answered respectfully enough his features by a shrewd effort relaxing into a seeming of his customary goodnature  hes a good dog sir and an unoffending dog  i cant imagine what could amade m break loose this way  he must ahad cause sir  he had one of the passengers a coconut planter from the shortlands interjected  the steward threw him a grateful glance and continued  hes a good dog sir a most obedient dog sirlook at the way he minded me right in the thick of the scrap an come n lay down  hes smart as chainlightnin sir do anything i tell him  ill make him make friends  see     stepping over to the two hysterical terriers daughtry called michael to him  hes all right savvee killeny he all right he crooned at the same time resting one hand on a terrier and the other on michael  the terrier whimpered and backed solidly against captain duncans legs but michael with a slow bob of tail and unbelligerent ears advanced to him looked up to steward to make sure then sniffed his late antagonist and even ran out his tongue in a caress to the side of the others ear  see sir no bad feelings daughtry exulted  he plays the game sir hes a proper dog hes a mandoghere killeny  the other one  he all right  kiss and make up  thats the stuff  the other foxterrier the one with the injured foreleg endured michaels sniff with no more than hysterical growls deep in the throat but the flipping out of michaels tongue was too much  the wounded terrier exploded in a futile snap at michaels tongue and nose  he all right killeny he all right sure steward warned quickly  with a bob of his tail in token of understanding without a shade of resentment michael lifted a paw and with a playful casual stroke dab like brought its weight on the others neck and rolled him headdownward over on the deck  though he snarled wrathily michael turned away composedly and looked up into stewards face for approval  a roar of laughter from the passengers greeted the capsizing of the fox terrier and the goodnatured gravity of michael  but not alone at this did they laugh for at the moment of the snap and the turning over captain duncans unstrung nerves had exploded causing him to jump as he tensed his whole body  why sir the steward went on with growing confidence i bet i can make him friends with you too by this time tomorrow      by this time five minutes hell be overboard the captain answered bosn  over with him  the boatswain advanced a tentative step while murmurs of protest arose from the passengers  look at my cat and look at me captain duncan defended his action  the boatswain made another step and dag daughtry glared a threat at him  go on the captain commanded  hold on spoke up the shortlands planter  give the dog a square deal i saw the whole thing  he wasnt looking for trouble  first the cat jumped him  she had to jump twice before he turned loose  shed have scratched his eyes out  then the two dogs jumped him  he hadnt bothered them  then you jumped him  he hadnt bothered you  and then came that sailor with the mop  and now you want the bosn to jump him and throw him overboard  give him a square deal  hes only been defending himself  what do you expect any dog that is a dog to dolie down and be walked over by every strange dog and cat that comes along play the game skipper  you gave him some mighty hard kicks  he only defended himself  hes some defender captain duncan grinned with a hint of the return of his ordinary geniality at the same time tenderly pressing his bleeding shoulder and looking woefully down at his tattered duck trousers  all right steward  if you can make him friends with me in five minutes he stays on board  but youll have to make it up to me with a new pair of trousers  and gladly sir thank you sir daughtry cried  and ill make it up with a new cat as well sircome on killeny boy  this big fella marster he all right you bet  and michael listened  not with the smouldering smothering choking hysteria that still worked in the foxterriers did he listen nor with quivering of muscles and jumps of overwrought nerves but coolly composedly as if no battle royal had just taken place and no rips of teeth and kicks of feet still burned and ached his body  he could not help bristling however when first he sniffed a trousers leg into which his teeth had so recently torn  put your hand down on him sir daughtry begged  and captain duncan his own good self once more bent and rested a firm unhesitating hand on michaels head  nay more he even caressed the ears and rubbed about the roots of them  and michael the merryhearted who fought like a lion and forgave and forgot like a man laid his neck hair smoothly down wagged his stump tail smiled with his eyes and ears and mouth and kissed with his tongue the hand with which a short time before he had been at war     chapter vii   for the rest of the voyage michael had the run of the ship  friendly to all he reserved his love for steward alone though he was not above many an undignified romp with the foxterriers  the most playfulminded dog without being silly i ever saw was dag daughtrys verdict to the shortlands planter to whom he had just sold one of his turtleshell combs  you see some dogs never get over the playidea an theyre never good for anything else  but not killeny boy  he can come down to seriousness in a second  ill show you and ill show you hes got a brain that counts to five an knows wireless telegraphy  you just watch  at the moment the steward made his faint lipnoiseso faint that he could not hear it himself and was almost for wondering whether or not he had made it so faint that the shortlands planter did not dream that he was making it  at that moment michael was lying squirming on his back a dozen feet away his legs straight up in the air both foxterriers worrying with wellstimulated ferociousness  with a quick outthrust of his four legs he rolled over on his side and with questioning eyes and pricked ears looked and listened  again daughtry made the lipnoise again the shortlands planter did not hear nor guess and michael bounded to his feet and to his lords side  some dog eh the steward boasted  but how did he know you wanted him the planter queried  you never called him  mental telepathy the affinity of souls pitched in the same whateveryou callit harmony the steward mystified  you see killeny an me are made of the same kind of stuff only run into different moulds  he might abeen my full brother or me his only for some mistake in the creation factory somewhere  now ill show you he knows his bit of arithmetic  and drawing the paper balls from his pocket dag daughtry demonstrated to the amazement and satisfaction of the ring of passengers michaels ability to count to five  why sir daughtry concluded the performance if i was to order four glasses of beer in a publichouse ashore an if i was absentminded an didnt notice the waiter d only brought three killeny boy there d raise a row instanter  kwaque was no longer compelled to enjoy his jews harp on the gratings over the fireroom now that michaels presence on the makambo was known and in the stateroom on stolen occasions he made experiments of his own with michael  once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms michael was helpless  he needs must open his mouth and pour forth an unwilling gushing howl  but as with jerry it was not mere howl  it was more akin to a mellow singing and it was not long before kwaque could lead his voice up and down in rough time and tune within a definite register  michael never liked these lessons for looking down upon kwaque he hated in any way to be under the blacks compulsion  but all this was changed when dag daughtry surprised them at a singing lesson  he resurrected the harmonica with which it was his wont ashore in public houses to while away the time between bottles  the quickest way to start michael singing he discovered was with minors and once started he would sing on and on for as long as the music played  also in the absence of an instrument michael would sing to the prompting and accompaniment of stewards voice who would begin by wailing kowkow long and sadly and then branch out on some old song or ballad  michael had hated to sing with kwaque but he loved to do it with steward even when steward brought him on deck to perform before the laughtershrieking passengers  two serious conversations were held by the steward toward the close of the voyage one with captain duncan and one with michael  its this way killeny daughtry began one evening michaels head resting on his lords knees as he gazed adoringly up into his lords face understanding no whit of what was spoken but loving the intimacy the sounds betokened  i stole you for beer money an when i saw you there on the beach that night i knew youd bring ten quid anywheres  ten quids a horrible lot of money  fifty dollars in the way the yankees reckon it an a hundred mex in china fashion  now fifty dollars gold d buy beer to beat the bandenough to drown me if i fell in head first  yet i want to ask you one question  can you see me takin ten quid for you    go on  speak up  can you  and michael with thumps of tail to the floor and a high sharp bark showed that he was in entire agreement with whatever had been propounded  or say twenty quid now  thats a fair offer  would i  eh  would i not on your life  what dye say to fifty quid  that might begin to interest me but a hundred quid would interest me more  why a hundred quid all in beer d come pretty close to floatin this old hooker  but who in sam hilld offer a hundred quid  id like to clap eyes on him once thats all just once  dye want to know what for  all right ill whisper it  so as i could tell him to go to hell  sure killeny boy just like thatoh most polite of course just a kindly directin of his steps where hed never suffer from frigid extremities  michaels love for steward was so profound as almost to be a mad but enduring infatuation  what the stewards regard for michael was coming to be was best evidenced by his conversation with captain duncan  sure sir he must ve followed me on board daughtry finished his unveracious recital  an i never knew it  last i seen of m was on the beach  next i seen of m there he was fast asleep in my bunk  now howd he get there sir  howd he pick out my room  i leave it to you sir  i call it marvellous just plain marvellous  with a quartermaster at the head of the gangway captain duncan snorted  as if i didnt know your tricks steward  theres nothing marvellous about it  just a plain case of steal  followed you on board that dog never came over the side  he came through a porthole and he never came through by himself  that nigger of yours ill wager had a hand in the helping  but lets have done with beating about the bush give me the dog and ill say no more about the cat  seein you believe what you believe then youd be for compoundin the felony daughtry retorted the habitual obstinate tightening of his brows showing which way his will set  me sir im only a ships steward an it wouldnt mean nothin at all bein arrested for dogstealin but you sir a captain of a fine steamer howd it sound for you sir  no sir itd be much wiser for me to keep the dog that followed me aboard  ill give ten pounds in the bargain the captain proffered  no it wouldnt do it wouldnt do at all sir an you a captain the steward continued to reiterate rolling his head sombrely  besides i know wheres a peach of an angora in sydney  the owner is gone to the country an has no further use of it an itd be a kindness to the cat air to give it a good regular home like the makambo     chapter viiii   another trick dag daughtry succeeded in teaching michael so enhanced him in captain duncans eyes as to impel him to offer fifty pounds and never mind the cat  at first daughtry practised the trick in private with the chief engineer and the shortlands planter  not until thoroughly satisfied did he make a public performance of it  now just suppose youre policemen or detectives daughtry told the first and third officers an suppose im guilty of some horrible crime an suppose killeny is the only clue an youve got killeny  when he recognizes his masterme of courseyouve got your man  you go down the deck with him leadin by the rope  then you come back this way with him makin believe this is the street an when he recognizes me you arrest me  but if he dont realize me you cant arrest me  see  the two officers led michael away and after several minutes returned along the deck michael stretched out ahead on the taut rope seeking steward  whatll you take for the dog daughtry demanded as they drew nearthis the cue he had trained michael to know  and michael straining at the rope went by without so much as a wag of tail to steward or a glance of eye  the officers stopped before daughtry and drew michael back into the group  hes a lost dog said the first officer  were trying to find his owner supplemented the third  some dog thatwhatll you take for m daughtry asked studying michael with critical eyes of interest  what kind of a tempers he got  try him was the answer  the steward put out his hand to pat him on the head but withdrew it hastily as michael with bristle and growl viciously bared his teeth  go on go on he wont hurt you the delighted passengers urged  this time the stewards hand was barely missed by a snap and he leaped back as michael ferociously sprang the length of the rope at him  take m away dag daughtry roared angrily  the treacherous beast  i wouldnt take m for gift  and as they obeyed michael strained backward in a paroxysm of rage making fierce short jumps to the end of the tether as he snarled and growled with utmost fierceness at the steward  eh  whod say he ever seen me in his life daughtry demanded triumphantly  its a trick i never seen played myself but ive heard tell about it  the oldtime poachers in england used to do it with their lurcher dogs  if they did get the dog of a strange poacher no gamekeeper or constable could identify m by the dogmum was the word  tell you what he knows things that killeny  he knows english  right now in my room with the door open an so as he can find m is shoes slippers cap towel hairbrush an tobacco pouch  whatll it be  name it an hell fetch it  so immediately and variously did the passengers respond that every article was called for  just one of you choose the steward advised  the rest of you pick m out  slipper said captain duncan selected by acclamation  one or both daughtry asked  both  come here killeny daughtry began bending toward him but leaping back from the snap of jaws that clipped together close to his nose  my mistake he apologized  i aint told him the other game was over now just listen an watch  n see if you can catch on to the tip im goin to give m  no one saw anything heard anything yet michael with a whine of eagerness and joy with laughing mouth and wriggling body was upon the steward licking his hands madly squirming and twisting in the embrace of the loved hands he had so recently threatened making attempts at short upward leaps as he flashed his tongue upward toward his lords face  for hard it was on michael a nerve and mental strain of the severest for him so to control himself as to playact anger and threat of hurt to his beloved steward  takes him a little time to get over a thing like that daughtry explained as he soothed michael down  now killeny  go fetch m slipper  wait  fetch m one slipper fetch m two slipper  michael looked up with pricked ears and with eyes filled with query as all his intelligent consciousness suffused them  two slipper  fetch m quick  he was off and away in a scurry of speed that seemed to flatten him close to the deck and that as he turned the corner of the deckhouse to the stairs made his hind feet slip and slide across the smooth planks  almost in a trice he was back both slippers in his mouth which he deposited at the stewards feet  the more i know dogs the more amazin marvellous they are to me dag daughtry after he had compassed his fourth bottle confided in monologue to the shortlands planter that night just before bedtime  take killeny boy  he dont do things for me mechanically just because hes learned to do m  theres more to it  he does m because he likes me  i cant give you the hang of it but i feel it i know it  maybe this is what im drivin at  killeny cant talk as you n me talk i mean so he cant tell me how he loves me an hes all love every last hair of m  an actions speakin louder n words he tells me how he loves me by doin these things for me  tricks  sure  but they make human speeches of eloquence cheaper n dirt  sure its speech dogtalk thats tonguetied  dont i know  sure as im a livin man born to trouble as the sparks fly upward just as sure am i that it makes m happy to do tricks for me    just as it makes a man happy to lend a hand to a pal in a ticklish place or a lover happy to put his coat around the girl he loves to keep her warm  i tell you      here dag daughtry broke down from inability to express the concepts fluttering in his beerexcited beersodden brain and with a stutter or two made a fresh start  you know its all in the matter of talkin an killeny cant talk hes got thoughts inside that head of hisyou can see m shinin in his lovely brown eyesbut he cant get em across to me  why i see m tryin to tell me sometimes so hard that he almost busts  theres a big hole between him an me an language is about the only bridge and he cant get over the hole though hes got all kinds of ideas an feelings just like mine  but say  the time we get closest together is when i play the harmonica an he yowyows  music comes closest to makin the bridge  its a regular song without words  and    i cant explain how    but just the same when weve finished our song i know weve passed a lot over to each other that dont need words for the passin  why dye know when im playin an hes singin its a regular duet of what the skypilots d call religion an knowin god  sure when we sing together im absorbin religion an gettin pretty close up to god an its big i tell you  big as the earth an ocean an sky an all the stars  i just seem to get hold of a sense that were all the same stuff after allyou me killeny boy mountains sand salt water worms mosquitoes suns an shootin stars an blazin comets      day daughtry left his flight as beyond his own grasp of speech and concluded his half embarrassment masked by braggadocio over michael  oh believe me they dont make dogs like him every day in the week sure i stole m  he looked good to me  an if i had it over knowin as i do known m now id steal m again if i lost a leg doin it  thats the kind of a dog he is     chapter ix   the morning the makambo entered sydney harbour captain duncan had another try for michael  the port doctors launch was coming alongside when he nodded up to daughtry who was passing along the deck  steward ill give you twenty pounds  no sir thank you sir was dag daughtrys answer  i couldnt bear to part with him  twentyfive pounds then  i cant go beyond that  besides there are plenty more irish terriers in the world  thats what im thinkin sir  an ill get one for you  right here in sydney  an it wont cost you a penny sir  but i want killeny boy the captain persisted  an so do i which is the worst of it sir  besides i got him first  twentyfive sovereigns is a lot of money    for a dog captain duncan said  an killeny boys a lot of dog    for the money the steward retorted  why sir cuttin out all sentiment his tricks is worth more n that  him not recognizing me when i dont want m to is worth fifty pounds of itself  an theres his countin an his singin an all the rest of his tricks  now no matter how i got him he didnt have them tricks  them tricks are mine  i taught him them  he aint the dog he was when he come on board  hes a whole lot of me now an sellin him would be like sellin a piece of myself  thirty pounds said the captain with finality  no sir thankin you just the same sir was daughtrys refusal  and captain duncan was forced to turn away in order to greet the port doctor coming over the side  scarcely had the makambo passed quarantine and while on her way up harbour to dock when a trim manofwar launch darted in to her side and a trim lieutenant mounted the makambos boardingladder  his mission was quickly explained  the albatross british cruiser of the second class of which he was fourth lieutenant had called in at tulagi with dispatches from the high commissioner of the english south seas  a scant twelve hours having intervened between her arrival and the makambos departure the commissioner of the solomons and captain kellar had been of the opinion that the missing dog had been carried away on the steamer knowing that the albatross would beat her to sydney the captain of the albatross had undertaken to look up the dog  was the dog an irish terrier answering to the name of michael on board  captain duncan truthfully admitted that it was though he most unveraciously shielded dag daughtry by repeating his yarn of the dog coming on board of itself  how to return the dog to captain kellarwas the next question for the albatross was bound on to new zealand captain duncan settled the matter  the makambo will be back in tulagi in eight weeks he told the lieutenant and ill undertake personally to deliver the dog to its owner  in the meantime well take good care of it  our steward has sort of adopted it so it will be in good hands        seems we dont either of us get the dog daughtry commented resignedly when captain duncan had explained the situation  but when daughtry turned his back and started off along the deck his constitutional obstinacy tightened his brows so that the shortlands planter observing it wondered what the captain had been rowing him about        despite his six quarts a day and all his easygoingness of disposition dag daughtry possessed certain integrities  though he could steal a dog or a cat without a twinge of conscience he could not but be faithful to his salt being so made  he could not draw wages for being a ship steward without faithfully performing the functions of ship steward though his mind was firmly made up during the several days of the makambo in sydney lying alongside the burns philp dock he saw to every detail of the cleaning up after the last crowd of outgoing passengers and to every detail of preparation for the next crowd of incoming passengers who had tickets bought for the passage far away to the coral seas and the cannibal isles  in the midst of this devotion to his duty he took a night off and part of two afternoons  the night off was devoted to the publichouses which sailors frequent and where can be learned the latest gossip and news of ships and of men who sail upon the sea  such information did he gather over many bottles of beer that the next afternoon hiring a small launch at a cost of ten shillings he journeyed up the harbour to jackson bay where lay the loftypoled sweetlined threetopmast american schooner the mary turner  once on board explaining his errand he was taken below into the main cabin where he interviewed and was interviewed by a quartette of men whom daughtry qualified to himself as a rum bunch  it was because he had talked long with the steward who had left the ship that dag daughtry recognized and identified each of the four men  that surely was the ancient mariner sitting back and apart with washed eyes of such palest blue that they seemed a faded white  long thin wisps of silvery unkempt hair framed his face like an aureole  he was slender to emaciation cavernously checked roll after roll of skin no longer encasing flesh or muscle hanging grotesquely down his neck and swathing the adams apple so that only occasionally with queer swallowing motions did it peep out of the mummywrappings of skin and sink back again from view  a proper ancient mariner thought daughtry  might be seventyfive might just as well be a hundred and five or a hundred and seventyfive  beginning at the right temple a ghastly scar split the cheekbone sank into the depths of the hollow cheek notched across the lower jaw and plunged to disappearance among the prodigious skinfolds of the neck  the withered lobes of both ears were perforated by tiny gypsylike circles of gold  on the skeleton fingers of his right hand were no less than five ringsnot mens rings nor womens but foppish ringsthat would fetch a price daughtry adjudged  on the left hand were no rings for there were no fingers to wear them  only was there a thumb and for that matter most of the hand was missing as well as if it had been cut off by the same slicing edge that had cleaved him from temple to jaw and heaven alone knew how far down that skindraped neck  the ancient mariners washed eyes seemed to bore right through daughtry or at least so daughtry felt and rendered him so uncomfortable as to make him casually step to the side for the matter of a yard  this was possible because a servant seeking a servants billet he was expected to stand and face the four seated ones as if they were judges on the bench and he the felon in the dock  nevertheless the gaze of the ancient one pursued him until studying it more closely he decided that it did not reach to him at all  he got the impression that those washed pale eyes were filmed with dreams and that the intelligence the thing that dwelt within the skull fluttered and beat against the dreamfilms and no farther  how much would you expect the captain was askinga most unsealike captain in daughtrys opinion rather a spickandspan brisk little businessman or floorwalker just out of a bandbox  he shall not share spoke up another of the four huge rawboned middleaged whom daughtry identified by his hamlike hands as the california wheatfarmer described by the departed steward  plenty for all the ancient mariner startled daughtry by cackling shrilly  oodles and oodles of it my gentlemen in cask and chest in cask and chest a fathom under the sand  sharewhat sir daughtry queried though well he knew the other steward having cursed to him the day he sailed from san francisco on a blind lay instead of straight wages  not that it matters sir he hastened to add  i spent a whalin voyage once three years of it an paid off with a dollar  wages for mine an sixty gold a month seein theres only four of you  and a mate the captain added  and a mate daughtry repeated  very good sir  an no share  but yourself spoke up the fourth man a hugebulking colossalbodied greasyseeming grossness of fleshthe armenian jew and san francisco pawnbroker the previous steward had warned daughtry about  have you papersletters of recommendation the documents you receive when you are paid off before the shipping commissioners  i might ask sir dag daughtry brazened it for your own papers  this aint no regular cargocarrier or passengercarrier no more than you gentlemen are a regular company of shipowners with regular offices doin business in a regular way  how do i know if you own the ship even or that the charter aint busted long ago or that youre being libelled ashore right now or that you wont dump me on any old beach anywheres without a soomarkee of whats comin to me  howsoeverhe anticipated by a bluff of his own the show of wrath from the jew that he knew would be wind and bluffhowsoever heres my papers      with a swift dip of his hand into his inside coatpocket he scattered out in a wealth of profusion on the cabin table all the papers sealed and stamped that he had collected in fortyfive years of voyaging the latest date of which was five years back  i dont ask your papers he went on  what i ask is cash payment in full the first of each month sixty dollars a month gold  oodles and oodles of it gold and gold and better than gold in cask and chest in cask and chest a fathom under the sand the ancient mariner assured him in beneficent cackles  kings principalities and powersall of us the least of us  and plenty more my gentlemen plenty more  the latitude and longitude are mine and the bearings from the oak ribs on the shoal to lions head and the crossbearings from the points unnamable i only know  i only still live of all that brave mad scallywag ships company      will you sign the articles to that the jew demanded cutting in on the ancients maunderings  what port do you wind up the cruise in daughtry asked  san francisco  ill sign the articles that im to sign off in san francisco then  the jew the captain and the farmer nodded  but theres several other things to be agreed upon daughtry continued in the first place i want my six quarts a day  im used to it and im too old a stager to change my habits  of spirits i suppose the jew asked sarcastically  no of beer good english beer  it must be understood beforehand no matter what long stretches we may be at sea that a sufficient supply is taken along  anything else the captain queried  yes sir daughtry answered  i got a dog that must come along  anything elsea wife or family maybe the farmer asked  no wife or family sir  but i got a nigger a perfectly good nigger thats got to come along  he can sign on for ten dollars a month if he works for the ship all his time  but if he works for me all the time ill let him sign on for two an a half a month  eighteen days in the longboat the ancient mariner shrilled to daughtrys startlement  eighteen days in the longboat eighteen days of scorching hell  my word quoth daughtry the old gentlemand give one the jumps therell sure have to be plenty of beer  sea stewards put on some style i must say commented the wheatfarmer oblivious to the ancient mariner who still declaimed of the heat of the longboat  suppose we dont see our way to signing on a steward who travels in such style the jew asked mopping the inside of his collarband with a coloured silk handkerchief  then youll never know what a good steward youve missed sir daughtry responded airily  i guess theres plenty more stewards on sydney beach the captain said briskly  and i guess i havent forgotten old days when i hired them like so much dirt yes by jinks so much dirt there were so many of them  thank you mr steward for looking us up the jew took up the idea with insulting oiliness  we very much regret our inability to meet your wishes in the matter  and i saw it go under the sand a fathom under the sand on crossbearings unnamable where the mangroves fade away and the coconuts grow and the rise of land lifts from the beach to the lions head  hold your horses the wheatfarmer said with a flare of irritation directed not at the ancient mariner but at the captain and the jew whos putting up for this expedition  dont i get no say so  aint my opinion ever to be asked  i like this steward  strikes me hes the real goods  i notice hes as polite as all getout and i can see he can take an order without arguing  and he aint no fool by a long shot  thats the very point grimshaw the jew answered soothingly considering the unusualness of our    of the expedition wed be better served by a steward who is more of a fool  another point which id esteem a real favour from you is not to forget that you havent put a red copper more into this trip than i have  and whered either of you be if it wasnt for me with my knowledge of the sea the captain demanded aggrievedly  to say nothing of the mortgage on my house and on the nicest little best paying flat building in san francisco since the earthquake  but whos still putting upall of you i ask you  the wheatfarmer leaned forward resting the heels of his hands on his knees so that the fingers hung down his long shins in daughtrys appraisal halfway to his feet  you captain doane cant raise another penny on your properties  my land still grows the wheat that brings the ready  you simon nishikanta wont put up another pennyyet your loanshark offices are doing business at the same old stands at god knows what per cent to drunken sailors  and you hang the expedition up here in this holeinthe wall waiting for my agent to cable more wheatmoney  well i guess well just sign on this steward at sixty a month and all he asks or ill just naturally quit you cold on the next fast steamer to san francisco  he stood up abruptly towering to such height that daughtry looked to see the crown of his head collide with the deck above  im sick and tired of you all yes i am he continued  get busy well lets get busy  my moneys coming  itll be here by tomorrow lets be ready to start by hiring a steward that is a steward  i dont care if he brings two families along  i guess youre right grimshaw simon nishikanta said appeasingly  the trip is beginning to get on all our nerves  forget it if i fly off the handle  of course well take this steward if you want him  i thought he was too stylish for you  he turned to daughtry  naturally the least said ashore about us the better  thats all right sir  i can keep my mouth shut though i might as well tell you theres some pretty tales about you drifting around the beach right now  the object of our expedition the jew queried quickly  daughtry nodded  is that why you want to come was demanded equally quickly  daughtry shook his head  as long as you give me my beer each day sir i aint goin to be interested in your treasurehuntin  it aint no new tale to me  the south seas is populous with treasurehunters  almost could daughtry have sworn that he had seen a flash of anxiety break through the dream films that bleared the ancient mariners eyes  and i must say sir he went on easily though saying what he would not have said had it not been for what he was almost certain he sensed of the ancients anxiousness that the south seas is just naturally lousy with buried treasure theres keelingcocos millions n millions of it pounds sterling i mean waiting for the lucky one with the right steer  this time daughtry could have sworn to having sensed a change toward relief in the ancient mariner whose eyes were again filmy with dreams  but i aint interested in treasure sir daughtry concluded  its beer im interested in  you can chase your treasure an i dont care how long just as long as ive got six quarts to open each day  but i give you fair warning sir before i sign on if the beer dries up im goin to get interested in what youre after  fair play is my motto  do you expect us to pay for your beer in addition simon nishikanta demanded  to daughtry it was too good to be true  here with the jew healing the breach with the wheatfarmer whose agents still cabled money was the time to take advantage  sure its one of our agreements sir  what time would it suit you sir tomorrow afternoon for me to sign on at the shipping commissioners  casks and chests of it casks and chests of it oodles and oodles a fathom under the sand chattered the ancient mariner  youre all touched up under the roof daughtry grinned  which aint got nothing to do with me as long as you furnish the beer pay me due an proper whats comin to me the first of each an every month an pay me off final in san francisco  as long as you keep up your end ill sail with you to the pit n back an watch you sweatin the casks n chests out of the sand  what i want is to sail with you if you want me to sail with you enough to satisfy me  simon nishikanta glanced about  grimshaw and captain doane nodded  at three oclock tomorrow afternoon at the shipping commissioners the jew agreed  when will you report for duty  when will you sail sir daughtry countered  bright and early next morning  then ill be on board and on duty some time tomorrow night sir  and as he went up the cabin companion he could hear the ancient mariner maundering eighteen days in the longboat eighteen days of scorching hell         chapter x   michael left the makambo as he had come on board through a porthole likewise the affair occurred at night and it was kwaques hands that received him  it had been quick work and daring in the dark of early evening  from the boatdeck with a bowline under kwaques arms and a turn of the rope around a pin dag daughtry had lowered his leprous servitor into the waiting launch  on his way below he encountered captain duncan who saw fit to warn him  no shannigan with killeny boy steward  he must go back to tulagi with us  yes sir the steward agreed  an im keepin him tight in my room to make safe  want to see him sir  the very frankness of the invitation made the captain suspicious and the thought flashed through his mind that perhaps killeny boy was already hidden ashore somewhere by the dogstealing steward  yes indeed id like to say howdoyoudo to him captain duncan answered  and his was genuine surprise on entering the stewards room to behold michael just rousing from his curledup sleep on the floor  but when he left his surprise would have been shocking could he have seen through the closed door what immediately began to take place  out through the open porthole in a steady stream daughtry was passing the contents of the room  everything went that belonged to him including the turtle shell and the photographs and calendars on the wall  michael with the command of silence laid upon him went last  remained only a seachest and two suitcases themselves too large for the porthole but bare of contents  when daughtry sauntered along the main deck a few minutes later and paused for a gossip with the customs officer and a quartermaster at the head of the gangplank captain duncan little dreamed that his casual glance was resting on his steward for the last time  he watched him go down the gangplank emptyhanded with no dog at his heels and stroll off along the wharf under the electric lights  ten minutes after captain duncan saw the last of his broad back daughtry in the launch with his belongings and heading for jackson bay was hunched over michael and caressing him while kwaque crooning with joy under his breath that he was with all that was precious to him in the world felt once again in the sidepocket of his flimsy coat to make sure that his beloved jews harp had not been left behind  dag daughtry was paying for michael and paying well  among other things he had not cared to arouse suspicion by drawing his wages from burns philp  the twenty pounds due him he had abandoned and this was the very sum that night on the beach at tulagi he had decided he could realize from the sale of michael  he had stolen him to sell  he was paying for him the sales price that had tempted him  for as one has well said the horse abases the base ennobles the noble likewise the dog  the theft of a dog to sell for a price had been the abasement worked by michael on dag daughtry  to pay the price out of sheer heartlove that could recognize no price too great to pay had been the ennoblement of dag daughtry which michael had worked  and as the launch chugchugged across the quiet harbour under the southern stars dag daughtry would have risked and tossed his life into the bargain in a battle to continue to have and to hold the dog he had originally conceived of as being interchangeable for so many dozens of beer        the mary turner towed out by a tug sailed shortly after daybreak and daughtry kwaque and michael looked their last for ever on sydney harbour  once again these old eyes have seen this fair haven the ancient mariner beside them gazing babbled and daughtry could not help but notice the way the wheatfarmer and the pawnbroker pricked their ears to listen and glanced each to the other with scant eyes  it was in 52 in 1852 on such a day as this all drinking and singing along the decks we cleared from sydney in the wide awake  a pretty craft oh sirs a most clever and pretty craft  a crew a brave crew all youngsters all of us fore and aft no man was forty a mad gay crew  the captain was an elderly gentleman of twentyeight the third officer another of eighteen the down untouched of steel like so much young velvet on his cheek  he too died in the longboat  and the captain gasped out his last under the palm trees of the isle unnamable while the brown maidens wept about him and fanned the air to his parching lungs  dag daughtry heard no more for he turned below to take up his new routine of duty  but while he made up bunks with fresh linen and directed kwaques efforts to cleaning longneglected floors he shook his head to himself and muttered hes a keen un  hes a keen un  all aint fools that look it  the fine lines of the mary turner were explained by the fact that she had been built for sealhunting and for the same reason on board of her was room and to spare  the forecastle with bunkspace for twelve bedded but eight scandinavian seamen  the five staterooms of the cabin accommodated the three treasurehunters the ancient mariner and the matethe latter a largebodied gentlesouled russianfinn known as mr jackson through inability of his shipmates to pronounce the name he had signed on the ships articles  remained the steerage just forard of the cabin separated from it by a stout bulkhead and entered by a companionway on the main deck  on this deck between the break of the poop and the steerage companion stood the galley  in the steerage itself which possessed a far larger livingspace than the cabin were six capacious bunks each double the width of the forecastle bunks and each curtained and with no bunk above it  some fella gloryhole eh kwaque daughtry told his seventeenyears old brownskinned papuan with the withered ancient face of a centenarian the legs of a living skeleton and the hugestomached torso of an elderly japanese wrestler  eh kwaque  what you fella think  and kwaque too awed by the spaciousness to speak eloquently rolled his eyes in agreement  you likee this piecee bunk the cook a little old chinaman asked the steward with eager humility inviting the white mans acceptance of his own bunk with a wave of arm  daughtry shook his head  he had early learned that it was wise to get along well with seacooks since seacocks were notoriously given to going suddenly lunatic and slicing and hacking up their shipmates with butcher knives and meat cleavers on the slightest remembered provocation besides there was an equally good bunk all the way across the width of the steerage from the chinamans  the bunk next on the port side to the cooks and abaft of it daughtry allotted to kwaque  thus he retained for himself and michael the entire starboard side with its three bunks  the next one abaft of his own he named killeny boys and called on kwaque and the cook to take notice  daughtry had a sense that the cook whose name had been quickly volunteered as ah moy was not entirely satisfied with the arrangement but it affected him no more than a momentary curiosity about a chinaman who drew the line at a dog taking a bunk in the same apartment with him  half an hour later returning from setting the cabin aright to the steerage for kwaque to serve him with a bottle of beer daughtry observed that ah moy had moved his entire bunk belongings across the steerage to the third bunk on the starboard side  this had put him with daughtry and michael and left kwaque with half the steerage to himself  daughtrys curiosity recrudesced  what name along that fella chink he demanded of kwaque  he no like m you fella boy stop m along same fella side along him  what for  my word  what name  that fella chink make m me cross along him too much  suppose m that fella chink maybe he think m me kaikai along him kwaque grinned in one of his rare jokes  all right the steward concluded  we find out  you move m along my bunk i move m along that fella chinks bunk  this accomplished so that kwaque michael and ah moy occupied the starboard side and daughtry alone bunked on the port side he went on deck and aft to his duties  on his next return he found ah moy had transferred back to the port side but this time into the last bunk aft  seems the beggars taken a fancy to me the steward smiled to himself  nor was he capable of guessing ah moys reason for bunking always on the opposite side from kwaque  i changee the little old cook explained with anxious eyes to please and placate in response to daughtrys direct question  all the time like that changee plentee changee  you savvee  daughtry did not savvee and shook his head while ah moys slant eyes betrayed none of the anxiety and fear with which he privily gazed on kwaques two permanently bent fingers of the left hand and on kwaques forehead between the eyes where the skin appeared a shade darker a trifle thicker and was marked by the first beginning of three short vertical lines or creases that were already giving him the lionlike appearance the leonine face so named by the experts and technicians of the fell disease  as the days passed the steward took facetious occasions when he had drunk five quarts of his daily allowance to shift his and kwaques bunks about  and invariably ah moy shifted though daughtry failed to notice that he never shifted into a bunk which kwaque had occupied  nor did he notice that it was when the time came that kwaque had variously occupied all the six bunks that ah moy made himself a canvas hammock suspended it from the deck beams above and thereafter swung clear in space and unmolested  daughtry dismissed the matter from his thoughts as no more than a thing in keeping with the general inscrutability of the chinese mind  he did notice however that kwaque was never permitted to enter the galley another thing he noticed which expressed in his own words was thats the alldangdest cleanest chink ive ever clapped my lamps on  clean in galley clean in steerage clean in everything  hes always washing the dishes in boiling water when he isnt washing himself or his clothes or bedding  my word he actually boils his blankets once a week  for there were other things to occupy the stewards mind  getting acquainted with the five men aft in the cabin and lining up the whole situation and the relations of each of the five to that situation and to one another consumed much time  then there was the path of the mary turner across the sea  no old sailor breathes who does not desire to know the casual course of his ship and the next portofcall  we ought to be moving along a line thatll cross somewhere northard of new zealand daughtry guessed to himself after a hundred stolen glances into the binnacle  but that was all the information concerning the ships navigation he could steal for captain doane took the observations and worked them out to the exclusion of the mate and captain doane always methodically locked up his chart and log  that there were heated discussions in the cabin in which terms of latitude and longitude were bandied back and forth daughtry did know but more than that he could not know because it was early impressed upon him that the one place for him never to be at such times of council was the cabin  also he could not but conclude that these councils were real battles wherein messrs doane nishikanta and grimahaw screamed at each other and pounded the table at each other when they were not patiently and most politely interrogating the ancient mariner  hes got their goat the steward early concluded to himself but thereafter try as he would he failed to get the ancient mariners goat  charles stough greenleaf was the ancient mariners name  this daughtry got from him and nothing else did he get save maunderings and ravings about the heat of the longboat and the treasure a fathom deep under the sand  theres some of us plays games an some of us as looks on an admires the games they see the steward made his bid one day  and im sure these days lookin on at a pretty game  the more i see it the more i got to admire  the ancient mariner dreamed back into the stewards eyes with a blank unseeing gaze  on the wide awake all the stewards were young mere boys he murmured  yes sir daughtry agreed pleasantly  from all you say the wide awake with all its youngsters was sure some craft  not like the crowd of old uns on this here hooker  but i doubt sir that them youngsters ever played as clever games as is being played aboard us right now  i just got to admire the fine way its being done sir  ill tell you something the ancient mariner replied with such confidential air that almost daughtry leaned to hear  no steward on the wide awake could mix a highball in just the way i like as well as you we didnt know cocktails in those days but we had sherry and bitters  a good appetizer too a most excellent appetizer  ill tell you something more he continued just as it seemed he had finished and just in time to interrupt daughtry away from his third attempt to ferret out the true inwardness of the situation on the mary turner and of the ancient mariners part in it  it is mighty nigh five bells and i should be very pleased to have one of your delicious cocktails ere i go down to dine  more suspicious than ever of him was daughtry after this episode  but as the days went by he came more and more to the conclusion that charles stough greenleaf was a senile old man who sincerely believed in the abiding of a buried treasure somewhere in the south seas  once polishing the brasswork on the handrails of the cabin companionway daughtry overheard the ancient one explaining his terrible scar and missing fingers to grimshaw and the armenian jew  the pair of them had plied him with extra drinks in the hope of getting more out of him by way of his loosened tongue  it was in the longboat the aged voice cackled up the companion  on the eleventh day it was that the mutiny broke  we in the sternsheets stood together against them  it was all a madness  we were starved sore but we were mad for water  it was over the water it began  for see you it was our custom to lick the dew from the oarblades the gunwales the thwarts and the inside planking  and each man of us had developed property in the dewcollecting surfaces  thus the tiller and the rudderhead and half of the plank of the starboard sternsheet had become the property of the second officer  no one of us lacked the honour to respect his property  the third officer was a lad only eighteen a brave and charming boy  he shared with the second officer the starboard sternsheet plank  they drew a line to mark the division and neither lapping up what scant moisture fell during the nighthours ever dreamed of trespassing across the line  they were too honourable  but the sailorsno  they squabbled amongst themselves over the dew surfaces and only the night before one of them was knifed because he so stole  but on this night waiting for the dew a little of it to become more on the surfaces that were mine i heard the noises of a dewlapper moving aft along the portgunwalewhich was my property aft of the strokethwart clear to the stern  i emerged from a nightmare dream of crystal springs and swollen rivers to listen to this nightdrinker that i feared might encroach upon what was mine  nearer he came to the line of my property and i could hear him making little moaning whimpering noises as he licked the damp wood  it was like listening to an animal grazing pasturegrass at night and ever grazing nearer  it chanced i was holding a boatstretcher in my handto catch what little dew might fall upon it  i did not know who it was but when he lapped across the line and moaned and whimpered as he licked up my precious drops of dew i struck out  the boatstretcher caught him fairly on the noseit was the bosnand the mutiny began  it was the bosns knife that sliced down my face and sliced away my fingers  the third officer the eighteenyearold lad fought well beside me and saved me so that just before i fainted he and i between us hove the bosns carcass overside  a shifting of feet and changing of positions of those in the cabin plunged daughtry back into his polishing which he had for the time forgotten  and as he rubbed the brasswork he told himself under his breath the old partys sure been through the mill  such things just got to happen  no the ancient mariner was continuing in his thin falsetto in reply to a query  it wasnt the wounds that made me faint  it was the exertion i made in the struggle  i was too weak  no so little moisture was there in my system that i didnt bleed much  and the amazing thing under the circumstances was the quickness with which i healed  the second officer sewed me up next day with a needle hed made out of an ivory toothpick and with twine he twisted out of the threads from a frayed tarpaulin  might i ask mr greenleaf if there were rings at the time on the fingers that were cut off daughtry heard simon nishikanta ask  yes and one beauty  i found it afterward in the boat bottom and presented it to the sandalwood trader who rescued me  it was a large diamond  i paid one hundred and eighty guineas for it to an english sailor in the barbadoes  hed stolen it and of course it was worth more  it was a beautiful gem  the sandalwood man did not merely save my life for it  in addition he spent fully a hundred pounds in outfitting me and buying me a passage from thursday island to shanghai        theres no getting away from them rings he wears daughtry overheard simon nishikanta that evening telling grimshaw in the dark on the weather poop  you dont see that kind nowadays  theyre old real old  theyre not mens rings so much as what youd call in the oldfashioned days gentlemens rings  real gentlemen i mean grand gentlemen wore rings like them  i wish collateral like them came into my loan offices these days  theyre worth big money        i just want to tell you killeny boy that maybe ill be wishin before the voyage is over that id gone on a lay of the treasure instead of straight wages dag daughtry confided to michael that night at turning in time as kwaque removed his shoes and as he paused midway in the draining of his sixth bottle  take it from me killeny that old gentleman knows what hes talkin about an has been some hummer in his days  men dont lose the fingers off their hands and get their faces chopped open just for nothingnor sport rings that makes a jew pawnbrokers mouth water     chapter xi   before the voyage of the mary turner came to an end dag daughtry sitting down between the rows of watercasks in the mainhold with a great laugh rechristened the schooner the ship of fools  but that was some weeks after  in the meantime he so fulfilled his duties that not even captain doane could conjure a shadow of complaint  especially did the steward attend upon the ancient mariner for whom he had come to conceive a strong admiration if not affection  the old fellow was different from his cabinmates  they were moneylovers everything in them had narrowed down to the pursuit of dollars  daughtry himself moulded on generously careless lines could not but appreciate the spaciousness of the ancient mariner who had evidently lived spaciously and who was ever for sharing the treasure they sought  youll get your whack steward if it comes out of my share he frequently assured daughtry at times of special kindness on the latters part  theres oodles of it and oodles of it and without kith or kin i have so little time longer to live that i shall not need it much or much of it  and so the ship of fools sailed on all aft fooling and befouling from the guilelesseyed gentlesouled finnish mate who with the scent of treasure pungent in his nostrils with a duplicate key stole the ships daily position from captain doanes locked desk to ah moy the cook who kept kwaque at a distance and never whispered warning to the others of the risk they ran from continual contact with the carrier of the terrible disease  kwaque himself had neither thought nor worry of the matter  he knew the thing as a thing that occasionally happened to human creatures  it bothered him from the pain standpoint scarcely at all and it never entered his kinky head that his master did not know about it  for the same reason he never suspected why ah moy kept him so at a distance  nor had kwaque other worries  his god over all gods of sea and jungle he worshipped and himself ever intimately allowed in the presence paradise was wherever he and his god the steward might be  and so michael  much in the same way that kwaque loved and worshipped did he love and worship the sixquart man  to michael and kwaque the daily even hourly recognition and consideration of dag daughtry was tantamount to resting continuously in the bosom of abraham  the god of messrs doane nishikanta and grimshaw was a graven god whose name was gold  the god of kwaque and michael was a living god whose voice could be always heard whose arms could be always warm the pulse of whose heart could be always felt throbbing in a myriad acts and touches  no greater joy was michaels than to sit by the hour with steward and sing with him all songs and tunes he sang or hummed  with a quantity or pitch even more of genius or unusualness in him than in jerry michael learned more quickly and since the way of his education was singing he came to sing far beyond the best villa kennan ever taught jerry  michael could howl or sing rather because his howling was so mellow and so controlled any air that was not beyond his register that steward elected to sing with him  in addition he could sing by himself and unmistakably such simple airs as home sweet home god save the king and the sweet by and by  even alone prompted by steward a score of feet away from him could he lift up his muzzle and sing shenandoah and roll me down to rio  kwaque on stolen occasions when steward was not around would get out his jews harp and by the sheer compellingness of the primitive instrument make michael sing with him the barbaric and devildevil rhythms of king william island  another master of song but one in whom michael delighted came to rule over him  this masters name was cocky he so introduced himself to michael at their first meeting  cocky he said bravely without a quiver of fear or flight when michael had charged upon him at sight to destroy him  and the human voice the voice of a god issuing from the throat of the tiny snowwhite bird had made michael go back on his haunches while with eyes and nostrils he quested the steerage for the human who had spoken and there was no human    only a small cockatoo that twisted his head impudently and sidewise at him and repeated cocky  the taboo of the chicken michael had been well taught in his earliest days at meringe  chickens esteemed by mister haggin and his whitegod fellows were things that dogs must even defend instead of ever attack but this thing itself no chicken with the seeming of a wild feathered thing of the jungle that was fair game for any dog talked to him with the voice of a god  get off your foot it commanded so peremptorily so humanly as again to startle michael and made him quest about the steerage for the godthroat that had uttered it  get off your foot or ill throw the leg of moses at you was the next command from the tiny feathered thing  after that came a farrago of chinese so like the voice of ah moy that again though for the last time michael sought about the steerage for the utterer  at this cocky burst into such wild and fantastic shrieks of laughter that michael ears pricked head cocked to one side identified in the fibres of the laughter the fibres of the various voices he had just previously heard  and cocky only a few ounces in weight less than half a pound a tiny framework of fragile bone covered with a handful of feathers and incasing a heart that was as big in pluck as any heart on the mary turner became almost immediately michaels friend and comrade as well as ruler minute morsel of daring and courage that cocky was he commanded michaels respect from the first  and michael who with a single careless pawstroke could have broken cockys slender neck and put out for ever the brave brightness of cockys eyes was careful of him from the first  and he permitted him a myriad liberties that he would never have permitted kwaque  ingrained in michaels heredity from the very beginning of fourlegged dogs on earth was the defence of the meat  he never reasoned it automatic and involuntary as his heartbeating and airbreathing was his defence of his meat once he had his paw on it his teeth in it  only to steward by an extreme effort of will and control could he accord the right to touch his meat once he had himself touched it  even kwaque who most usually fed him under stewards instructions knew that the safety of fingers and flesh resided in having nothing further whatever to do with anything of food once in michaels possession  but cocky a bit of feathery down a morselflash of light and life with the throat of a god violated with sheer impudence and daring michaels taboo the defence of the meat  perched on the rim of michaels pannikin this inconsiderable adventurer from out of the dark into the sun of life a mere spark and mote between the darks by a ruffing of his salmonpink crest a swift and enormous dilation of his beadblack pupils and a raucous imperative cry as of all the gods in his throat could make michael give back and permit the fastidious selection of the choicest tidbits of his dish  for cocky had a way with him and ways and ways  he who was sheer bladed steel in the imperious flashing of his will could swashbuckle and bully like any overseas roisterer or wheedle as wickedly winningly as the first woman out of eden or the last woman of that descent  when cocky balanced on one leg the other leg in the air as the foot of it held the scruff of michaels neck leaned to michaels ear and wheedled michael could only lay down silkily the bristly hairwaves of his neck and with silly halfidiotic eyes of bliss agree to whatever was cockys will or whimsey so delivered  cocky became more intimately michaels because very early ah moy washed his hands of the bird  ah moy had bought him in sydney from a sailor for eighteen shillings and chaffered an hour over the bargain  and when he saw cocky one day perched and voluble on the twisted fingers of kwaques left hand ah moy discovered such instant distaste for the bird that not even eighteen shillings coupled with possession of cocky and possible contact had any value to him  you likee him  you wanchee he proffered  changee for changee kwaque queried back taking for granted that it was an offer to exchange and wondering whether the little old cook had become enamoured of his precious jews harp  no changee for changee ah moy answered  you wanchee him all right can do  how fashion can do kwaque demanded who to his bechedemer english was already adding pidgin english  suppose m me fella no got m what you fella likee  no fashion changee ah moy reiterated  you wanchee you likee he stop along you fella all right my word  and so did pass the brave bit of feathered life with the heart of pluck called of men and of himself cocky who had been birthed in the jungle roof of the island of santo in the new hebrides who had been netted by a twolegged black maneater and sold for six sticks of tobacco and a shingle hatchet to a scotch trader dying of malaria and in turn had been traded from hand to hand for four shillings to a blackbirder for a turtleshell comb made by an english coalpasser after an old spanish design for the appraised value of six shillings and sixpence in a poker game in the firemens forecastle for a secondhand accordion worth at least twenty shillings and on for eighteen shillings cash to a little old withered chinamanso did pass cocky as mortal or as immortal as any brave sparkle of life on the planet from the possession of one ah moy a seacock who forty years before had slain his young wife in macao for cause and fled away to sea to kwaque a leprous black papuan who was slave to one dag daughtry himself a servant of other men to whom he humbly admitted yes sir and no sir and thank you sir  one other comrade michael found although cocky was no party to the friendship  this was scraps the awkward young newfoundland puppy who was the property of no one unless of the schooner mary turner herself for no man fore or aft claimed ownership while every man disclaimed having brought him on board  so he was called scraps and since he was nobodys dog was everybodys dogso much so that mr jackson promised to knock ah moys block off if he did not feed the puppy well while sigurd halvorsen in the forecastle did his best to knock off henrik gjertsens block when the latter was guilty of kicking scraps out of his way  yea even more  when simon nishikanta huge and gross as in the flesh he was and for ever painting delicate insipid feministic water colours when he threw his deckchair at scraps for clumsily knocking over his easel he found the hamlike hand of grimshaw so instant and heavy on his shoulder as to whirl him half about almost fling him to the deck and leave him lamemuscled and blackandblued for days  michael full grown mature was so merryhearted an individual that he found all delight in interminable romps with scraps  so strong was the playinstinct in him as well as was his constitution strong that he continually outplayed scraps to abject weariness so that he could only lie on the deck and pant and laugh through airdraughty lips and dab futilely in the air with weak forepaws at michaels continued ferocious acted onslaughts  and this despite the fact that scraps outbullied him and outscaled him at least three times and was as careless and unwitting of the weight of his legs or shoulders as a baby elephant on a lawn of daisies  given his breath back again scraps was as ripe as ever for another frolic and michael was just as ripe to meet him  all of which was splendid training for michael keeping him in the tiptop of physical condition and mental wholesomeness     chapter xii   so sailed the ship of foolsmichael playing with scraps respecting cocky and by cocky being bullied and wheedled singing with steward and worshipping him daughtry drinking his six quarts of beer each day collecting his wages the first of each month and admiring charles stough greenleaf as the finest man on board kwaque serving and loving his master and thickening and darkening and creasing his brow with the growing leprous infiltration ah moy avoiding the black papuan as the very plague washing himself continuously and boiling his blankets once a week captain doane doing the navigating and worrying about his flatbuilding in san francisco grimshaw resting his hamhands on his colossal knees and girding at the pawnbroker to contribute as much to the adventure as he was contributing from his wheatranches simon nishikanta wiping his sweaty neck with the greasy silk handkerchief and painting endless watercolours the mate patiently stealing the ships latitude and longitude with his duplicate key and the ancient mariner solacing himself with scotch highballs smoking fragrant threeforadollar havanas that were charged to the adventure and for ever maundering about the hell of the longboat the crossbearings unnamable and the treasure a fathom under the sand  came a stretch of ocean that to daughtry was like all other stretches of ocean and unidentifiable from them  no land broke the searim  the ship the centre the horizon was the invariable and eternal circle of the world  the magnetic needle in the binnacle was the point on which the mary turner ever pivoted  the sun rose in the undoubted east and set in the undoubted west corrected and proved of course by declination deviation and variation and the nightly march of the stars and constellations proceeded across the sky  and in this stretch of ocean lookouts were mastheaded at daydawn and kept mastheaded until twilight of evening when the mary turner was hoveto to hold her position through the night  as time went by and the scent according to the ancient mariner grow hotter all three of the investors in the adventure came to going aloft  grimshaw contented himself with standing on the main crosstrees  captain doane climbed even higher seating himself on the stump of the foremast with legs astraddle of the butt of the foretopmast  and simon nishikanta tore himself away from his everlasting painting of all colourdelicacies of sea and sky such as are painted by seminary maidens to be helped and hoisted up the ratlines of the mizzen rigging the huge bulk of him by two grinning slimwaisted sailors until they lashed him squarely on the crosstrees and left him to stare with eyes of golden desire across the sunwashed sea through the finest pair of unredeemed binoculars that had ever been pledged in his pawnshops  strange the ancient mariner would mutter strange and most strange this is the very place  there can be no mistake  id have trusted that youngster of a third officer anywhere  he was only eighteen but he could navigate better than the captain  didnt he fetch the atoll after eighteen days in the longboat  no standard compasses and you know what a smallboat horizon is with a big sea for a sextant  he died but the dying course he gave me held good so that i fetched the atoll the very next day after i hove his body overboard  captain doane would shrug his shoulders and defiantly meet the mistrustful eyes of the armenian jew  it cannot have sunk surely the ancient mariner would tactfully carry across the forbidding pause  the island was no mere shoal or reef  the lions head was thirtyeight hundred and thirtyfive feet  i saw the captain and the third officer triangulate it  ive raked and combed the sea captain doane would then break out and the teeth of my comb are not so wide apart as to let slip through a four thousandfoot peak  strange strange the ancient mariner would next mutter half to his cogitating soul half aloud to the treasureseekers  then with a sudden brightening he would add  but of course the variation has changed captain doane  have you allowed for the change in variation for half a century  that should make a grave difference  why as i understand it who am no navigator the variation was not so definitely and accurately known in those days as now  latitude was latitude and longitude was longitude would be the captains retort  variation and deviation are used in setting courses and estimating dead reckoning  all of which was greek to simon nishikanta who would promptly take the ancient mariners side of the discussion  but the ancient mariner was fairminded  what advantage he gave the jew one moment he balanced the next moment with an advantage to the skipper  its a pity he would suggest to captain doane that you have only one chronometer  the entire fault may be with the chronometer  why did you sail with only one chronometer  but i was willing for two the jew would defend  you know that grimshaw  the wheatfarmer would nod reluctantly and captain would snap  but not for three chronometers  but if two was no better than one as you said so yourself and as grimshaw will bear witness then three was no better than two except for an expense  but if you only have two chronometers how can you tell which has gone wrong captain doane would demand  search me would come the pawnbrokers retort accompanied by an incredulous shrug of the shoulders  if you cant tell which is wrong of two then how much harder must it be to tell which is wrong of two dozen with only two its a fiftyfifty split that one or the other is wrong  but dont you realize  i realize that its all a great foolishness all this highbrow stuff about navigation  ive got clerks fourteen years old in my offices that can figure circles all around you and your navigation  ask them that if two chronometers aint better than one then how can two thousand be better than one  and theyd answer quick snap like that that if two dollars aint any better than one dollar then two thousand dollars aint any better than one dollar  thats common sense  just the same youre wrong on general principle grimshaw would oar in  i said at the time that the only reason we took captain doane in with us on the deal was because we needed a navigator and because you and me didnt know the first thing about it  you said yes sure and right away knew more about it than him when you wouldnt stand for buying three chronometers  what was the matter with you was that the expense hurt you  thats about as big an idea as your mind ever had room for you go around looking for to dig out ten million dollars with a second hand spade you call buy for sixtyeight cents  dag daughtry could not fail to overhear some of these conversations which were altercations rather than councils  the invariable ending for simon nishikanta would be what sailors name the seagrouch  for hours afterward the sulky jew would speak to no one nor acknowledge speech from any one  vainly striving to paint he would suddenly burst into violent rage tear up his attempt stamp it into the deck then get out his large calibred automatic rifle perch himself on the forecastlehead and try to shoot any stray porpoise albacore or dolphin  it seemed to give him great relief to send a bullet home into the body of some surging gorgeoushued fish arrest its glorious flashing motion for ever and turn it on its side slowly to sink down into the death and depth of the sea  on occasion when a school of blackfish disported by each one of them a whale of respectable size nishikanta would be beside himself in the ecstasy of inflicting pain  out of the school perhaps he would reach a score of the leviathans his bullets biting into them like whiplashes so that each like a colt surprised by the stockwhip would leap in the air or with a flirt of tail dive under the surface and then charge madly across the ocean and away from sight in a foamchurn of speed  the ancient mariner would shake his head sadly and daughtry who likewise was hurt by the infliction of hurt on unoffending animals would sympathize with him and fetch him unbidden another of the expensive three foradollar cigars so that his feelings might be soothed  grimshaw would curl his lip in a sneer and mutter the cheap skate  the skunk no man with half the backbone of a man would take it out of the harmless creatures  hes that kind that if he didnt like you or if you criticised his grammar or arithmetic hed kick your dog to get even    or poison it  in the good old days up in colusa we used to hang men like him just to keep the air we breathed clean and wholesome  but it was captain doane who protested outright  look at here nishikanta he would say his face white and his lips trembling with anger  thats rough stuff and all you can get back for it is rough stuff  i know what im talking about  youve got no right to risk our lives that way  wasnt the pilot boat annie mine sunk by a whale right in the golden gate  didnt i sail in as a youngster second mate on the brig berncastle into hakodate pumping double watches to keep afloat just because a whale took a smash at us  didnt the full rigged ship the whaler essex sink off the west coast of south america twelve hundred miles from the nearest land for the small boats to cover and all because of a big cow whale that butted her into kindlingwood  and simon nishikanta in his grouch disdaining to reply would continue to pepper the last whale into flight beyond the circle of the sea their vision commanded  i remember the whaleship essex the ancient mariner told dag daughtry  it was a cow with a calf that did for her  her barrels were twothirds full too  she went down in less than an hour  one of the boats never was heard of  and didnt another one of her boats get to hawaii sir daughtry queried with all due humility of respect  leastwise thirty years ago when i was in honolulu i met a man an old geezer who claimed hed been a harpooner on a whaleship sunk by a whale off the coast of south america  that was the first and last i heard of it until right now you speaking of it sir  it must abeen the same ship sir dont you think  unless two different ships were whalesunk off the west coast the ancient mariner replied  and of the one ship the essex there is no discussion  it is historical  the chance is likely steward that the man you mentioned was from the essex     chapter xiii   captain doane worked hard pursuing the sun in its daily course through the sky by the equation of time correcting its aberrations due to the earths swinging around the great circle of its orbit and charting sumner lines innumerable working assumed latitudes for position until his head grew dizzy  simon nishikanta sneered openly at what he considered the captains inefficient navigation and continued to paint watercolours when he was serene and to shoot at whales seabirds and all things hurtable when he was downhearted and seasore with disappointment at not sighting the lions head peak of the ancient mariners treasure island  ill show i aint a pincher nishikanta announced one day after having broiled at the masthead for five hours of seasearching  captain doane how much could we have bought extra chronometers for in san franciscogood secondhand ones i mean  say a hundred dollars the captain answered  very well  and this aint a pikers proposition  the cost of such a chronometer would have been divided between the three of us  i stand for its total cost  you just tell the sailors that i simon nishikanta will pay one hundred dollars gold money for the first one that sights land on mr greenleafs latitude and longitude  but the sailors who swarmed the mastheads were doomed to disappointment in that for only two days did they have opportunity to stare the ocean surface for the reward  nor was this due entirely to dag daughtry despite the fact that his own intention and act would have been sufficient to spoil their chance for longer staring  down in the lazarette under the maincabin floor it chanced that he took toll of the cases of beer which had been shipped for his especial benefit  he counted the cases doubted the verdict of his senses lighted more matches counted again then vainly searched the entire lazarette in the hope of finding more cases of beer stored elsewhere  he sat down under the trap door of the maincabin floor and thought for a solid hour  it was the jew again he concludedthe jew who had been willing to equip the mary turner with two chronometers but not with three the jew who had ratified the agreement of a sufficient supply to permit daughtry his daily six quarts  once again the steward counted the cases to make sure  there were three  and since each case contained two dozen quarts and since his whack each day was half a dozen quarts it was patent that the supply that stared him in the face would last him only twelve days  and twelve days were none too long to sail from this unidentifiable naked seastretch to the nearest possible port where beer could be purchased  the steward once his mind was made up wasted no time  the clock marked a quarter before twelve when he climbed up out of the lazarette replaced the trapdoor and hurried to set the table  he served the company through the noon meal although it was all he could do to refrain from capsizing the big tureen of splitpea soup over the head of simon nishikanta  what did effectually withstrain him was the knowledge of the act which in the lazarette he had already determined to perform that afternoon down in the main hold where the watercasks were stored  at three oclock while the ancient mariner supposedly drowned in his room and while captain doane grimshaw and half the watch on deck clustered at the mastheads to try to raise the lions head from out the sapphire sea dag daughtry dropped down the ladder of the open hatchway into the main hold  here in long tiers with alleyways between the watercasks were chocked safely on their sides  from inside his shirt the steward drew a brace and to it fitted a half inch bit from his hippocket  on his knees he bored through the head of the first cask until the water rushed out upon the deck and flowed down into the bilge  he worked quickly boring cask after cask down the alleyway that led to deeper twilight  when he had reached the end of the first row of casks he paused a moment to listen to the gurglings of the many halfinch streams running to waste  his quick ears caught a similar gurgling from the right in the direction of the next alleyway  listening closely he could have sworn he heard the sounds of a bit biting into hard wood  a minute later his own brace and bit carefully secreted his hand was descending on the shoulder of a man he could not recognize in the gloom but who on his knees and wheezing was steadily boring into the head of a cask  the culprit made no effort to escape and when daughtry struck a match he gazed down into the upturned face of the ancient mariner  my word the steward muttered his amazement softly  what in hell are you running water out for  he could feel the old mans form trembling with violent nervousness and his own heart smote him for gentleness  its all right he whispered  dont mind me  how many have you bored  all in this tier came the whispered answer  you will not inform on me to the    the others  inform daughtry laughed softly  i dont mind telling you that were playing the same game though i dont know why you should play it  ive just finished boring all of the starboard row  now i tell you sir you skin out right now quietly while the goin is good  everybodys aloft and you wont be noticed  ill go ahead and finish this job    all but enough water to last us say a dozen days  i should like to talk with you    to explain matters the ancient mariner whispered  sure sir an i dont mind sayin sir that im just plain mad curious to hear  ill join you down in the cabin say in ten minutes and we can have a real gam  but anyway whatever your game is im with you because it happens to be my game to get quick into port and because sir i have a great liking and respect for you  now shoot along  ill be with you inside ten minutes  i like you steward very much the old man quavered  and i like you sirand a damn sight more than them moneysharks aft but well just postpone this  you beat it out of here while i finish scuppering the rest of the water  a quarter of an hour later with the three moneysharks still at the mast heads charles stough greenleaf was seated in the cabin and sipping a highball and dag daughtry was standing across the table from him drinking directly from a quart bottle of beer  maybe you havent guessed it the ancient mariner said but this is my fourth voyage after this treasure  you mean     daughtry asked  just that  there isnt any treasure  there never was oneany more than the lions head the longboat or the bearings unnamable  daughtry rumpled his grizzled thatch of hair in his perplexity as he admitted  well you got me sir  you sure got me to believin in that treasure  and i acknowledge steward that i am pleased to hear it  it shows that i have not lost my cunning when i can deceive a man like you  it is easy to deceive men whose souls know only money  but you are different  you dont live and breathe for money  ive watched you with your dog  ive watched you with your nigger boy  ive watched you with your beer  and just because your heart isnt set on a great buried treasure of gold you are harder to deceive  those whose hearts are set are most astonishingly easy to fool  they are of cheap kidney  offer them a proposition of one hundred dollars for one and they are like hungry pike snapping at the bait  offer a thousand dollars for one or ten thousand for one and they become sheer lunatic  i am an old man a very old man i like to live until i diei mean to live decently comfortably respectably  and you like the voyages long  i begin to see sir  just as theyre getting near to where the treasure aint a little accident like the loss of their watersupply sends them into port and out again to start hunting all over  the ancient mariner nodded and his sunwashed eyes twinkled  there was the emma louisa  i kept her on the long voyage over eighteen months with water accidents and similar accidents  and besides they kept me in one of the best hotels in new orleans for over four months before the voyage began and advanced to me handsomely yes bravely handsomely  but tell me more sir i am most interested dag daughtry concluded his simple matter of the beer   its a good game  i might learn it for my old age though i give you my word sir i wont butt in on your game  i wouldnt tackle it until you are gone sir good game that it is  first of all you must pick out men with moneywith plenty of money so that any loss will not hurt them  also they are easier to interest  because they are more hoggish the steward interrupted  the more money theyve got the more they want  precisely the ancient mariner continued  and at least they are repaid  such seavoyages are excellent for their health  after all i do them neither hurt nor harm but only good and add to their health  but them scarsthat gouge out of your faceall them fingers missing on your hand  you never got them in the fight in the longboat when the bosn carved you up  then where in sam hill did you get the them  wait a minute sir  let me fill your glass first  and with a freshbrimmed glass charles stough greanleaf narrated the history of his scars  first you must know steward that i amwell a gentleman  my name has its place in the pages of the history of the united states even back before the time when they were the united states  i graduated second in my class in a university that it is not necessary to name  for that matter the name i am known by is not my name  i carefully compounded it out of names of other families  i have had misfortunes  i trod the quarterdeck when i was a young man though never the deck of the wide awake which is the ship of my fancyand of my livelihood in these latter days  the scars you asked about and the missing fingers  thus it chanced  it was the morning at late gettingup times in a pullman when the accident happened  the car being crowded i had been forced to accept an upper berth  it was only the other day  a few years ago  i was an old man then  we were coming up from florida  it was a collision on a high trestle  the train crumpled up and some of the cars fell over sideways and fell off ninety feet into the bottom of a dry creek  it was dry though there was a pool of water just ten feet in diameter and eighteen inches deep  all the rest was dry boulders and i bullseyed that pool  this is the way it was  i had just got on my shoes and pants and shirt and had started to get out of the bunk  there i was sitting on the edge of the bunk my legs dangling down when the locomotives came together the berths upper and lower on the opposite side had already been made up by the porter  and there i was sitting legs dangling not knowing where i was on a trestle or a flat when the thing happened  i just naturally left that upper berth soared like a bird across the aisle went through the glass of the window on the opposite side clean headfirst turned over and over through the ninety feet of fall more times than i like to remember and by some sort of miracle was mostly flatout in the air when i bullseyed that pool of water  it was only eighteen inches deep  but i hit it flat and i hit it so hard that it must have cushioned me  i was the only survivor of my car  it struck forty feet away from me off to the side  and they took only the dead out of it  when they took me out of the pool i wasnt dead by any means  and when the surgeons got done with me there were the fingers gone from my hand that scar down the side of my face    and though youd never guess it ive been three ribs short of the regular complement ever since  oh i had no complaint coming  think of the others in that carall dead  unfortunately i was riding on a pass and so could not sue the railroad company  but here i am the only man who ever dived ninety feet into eighteen inches of water and lived to tell the talesteward if you dont mind replenishing my glass      dag daughtry complied and in his excitement of interest pulled off the top of another quart of beer for himself  go on go on sir he murmured huskily wiping his lips and the treasurehunting graft  im straight dying to hear  sir i salute you  i may say steward the ancient mariner resumed that i was born with a silver spoon that melted in my mouth and left me a proper prodigal son also that i was born with a backbone of pride that would not melt  not for a paltry railroad accident but for things long before as well as after my family let me die and i    i let it live  that is the story  i let my family live  furthermore it was not my familys fault i never whimpered  i never let on  i melted the last of my silver spoonsouth sea cotton an it please you cacao in tonga rubber and mahogany in yucatan  and do you know at the end i slept in bowery lodginghouses and ate scrapple in eastside feedingdens and on more than one occasion stood in the breadline at midnight and pondered whether or not i should faint before i fed  and you never squealed to your family dag daughtry murmured admiringly in the pause  the ancient mariner straightened up his shoulders threw his head back then bowed it and repeated no i never squealed  i went into the poor house or the county poorfarm as they call it  i lived sordidly  i lived like a beast  for six months i lived like a beast and then i saw my way out  i set about building the wide awake  i built her plank by plank and copperfastened her selected her masts and every timber of her and personally signed on her full ships complement foreandaft and outfitted her amongst the jews and sailed with her to the south seas and the treasure buried a fathom under the sand  you see he explained all this i did in my mind for all the time i was a hostage in the poorfarm of broken men  the ancient mariners face grew suddenly bleak and fierce and his right hand flashed out to daughtrys wrist prisoning it in withered fingers of steel  it was a long hard way to get out of the poorfarm and finance my miserable little pitiful little adventure of the wide awake  do you know that i worked in the poorfarm laundry for two years for one dollar and a half a week with my one available hand and what little i could do with the other sorting dirty clothes and folding sheets and pillowslips until i thought a thousand times my poor old back would break in two and until i knew a million times the location in my chest of every fraction of an inch of my missing ribs  you are a young man yet  daughtry grinned denial as he rubbed his grizzled mat of hair  you are a young man yet steward the ancient mariner insisted with a show of irritation  you have never been shut out from life  in the poorfarm one is shut out from life  there is no respectno not for age alone but for human life in the poorhouse  how shall i say it  one is not dead  nor is one alive  one is what once was alive and is in process of becoming dead  lepers are treated that way  so are the insane  i know it  when i was young and on the sea a brotherlieutenant went mad  sometimes he was violent and we struggled with him twisting his arms bruising his flesh tying him helpless while we sat and panted on him that he might not do harm to us himself or the ship  and he who still lived died to us  dont you understand  he was no longer of us like us  he was something other  that is itother  and so in the poorfarm we who are yet unburied are other  you have heard me chatter about the hell of the longboat  that is a pleasant diversion in life compared with the poorfarm  the food the filth the abuse the bullying thethe sheer animalness of it  for two years i worked for a dollar and a half a week in the laundry and imagine me who had melted a silver spoon in my moutha sizable silver spoon stewardimagine me my old sore bones my old belly reminiscent of youths delights my old palate ticklish yet and not all withered of the deviltries of taste learned in younger daysas i say steward imagine me who had ever been freehanded lavish saving that dollar and a half intact like a miser never spending a penny of it on tobacco never mitigating by purchase of any little delicacy the sad condition of my stomach that protested against the harshness and indigestibility of our poor fare  i cadged tobacco poor cheap tobacco from poor doddering old chaps trembling on the edge of dissolution  ay and when samuel merrivale i found dead in the morning next cot to mine i first rummaged his poor old trousers pocket for the halfplug of tobacco i knew was the total estate he left then announced the news  oh steward i was careful of that dollar and a half  dont you seei was a prisoner sawing my way out with a tiny steel saw  and i sawed out  his voice rose in a shrill cackle of triumph  steward i sawed out  dag daughtry held forth and up his beerbottle as he said gravely and sincerely  sir i salute you  and i thank you siryou understand the ancient mariner replied with simple dignity to the toast touching his glass to the bottle and drinking with the steward eyes to eyes  i should have had one hundred and fiftysix dollars when i left the poor farm the ancient one continued  but there were the two weeks i lost with influenza and the one week from a confounded pleurisy so that i emerged from that place of the living dead with but one hundred and fifty one dollars and fifty cents  i see sir daughtry interrupted with honest admiration  the tiny saw had become a crowbar and with it you were going back to break into life again  all the scarred face and washed eyes of charles stough greenleaf beamed as he held his glass up  steward i salute you  you understand  and you have said it well  i was going back to break into the house of life  it was a crowbar that pitiful sum of money accumulated by two years of crucifixion  think of it  a sum that in the days ere the silver spoon had melted i staked in careless moods of an instant on a turn of the cards  but as you say a burglar i came back to break into life and i came to boston  you have a fine turn for a figure of speech steward and i salute you  again bottle and glass tinkled together and both men drank eyes to eyes and each was aware that the eyes he gazed into were honest and understanding  but it was a thin crowbar steward  i dared not put my weight on it for a proper pry  i took a room in a small but respectable hotel european plan  it was in boston i think i said  oh how careful i was of my crowbar  i scarcely ate enough to keep my frame inhabited  but i bought drinks for others most carefully selectedbought drinks with an air of prosperity that was as a credential to my story and in my cups my apparent cups steward spun an old mans yarn of the wide awake the longboat the bearings unnamable and the treasure under the sanda fathom under the sand that was literary it was psychological it smacked of the salt sea and daring rovers and the loot of the spanish main  you have noticed this nugget i wear on my watchchain steward  i could not afford it at that time but i talked golden instead california gold nuggets and nuggets oodles and oodles from the diggings of fortynine and fifty  that was literary  that was colour  later after my first voyage out of boston i was financially able to buy a nugget  it was so much bait to which men rose like fishes  and like fishes they nibbled these rings alsobait  you never see such rings now  after i got in funds i purchased them too  take this nugget i am talking  i toy with it absently as i am telling of the great gold treasure we buried under the sand  suddenly the nugget flashes fresh recollection into my mind  i speak of the longboat of our thirst and hunger and of the third officer the fair lad with cheeks virgin of the razor and that he it was who used it as a sinker when we strove to catch fish  but back in boston  yarns and yarns when seemingly i was gone in drink i told my apparent croniesmen whom i despised stupid dolts of creatures that they were  but the word spread until one day a young man a reporter tried to interview me about the treasure and the wide awake  i was indignant angryoh softly steward softly in my heart was great joy as i denied that young reporter knowing that from my cronies he already had a sufficiency of the details  and the morning paper gave two whole columns and headlines to the tale i began to have callers  i studied them out well  many were for adventuring after the treasure who themselves had no money  i baffled and avoided them and waited on eating even less as my little capital dwindled away  and then he came my gay young doctordoctor of philosophy he was for he was very wealthy  my heart sang when i saw him  but twentyeight dollars remained to meafter it was gone the poorhouse or death  i had already resolved upon death as my choice rather than go back to be of that dolorous company the living dead of the poorfarm  but i did not go back nor did i die  the gay young doctors blood ran warm at thought of the south seas and in his nostrils i distilled all the scents of the flowerdrenched air of that faroff land and in his eyes i builded him the fairy visions of the tradewind clouds the monsoon skies the palm isles and the coral seas  he was a gay mad young dog grandly careless of his largess fearless as a lions whelp lithe and beautiful as a leopard and mad a trifle mad of the deviltries and whimsies that tickled in that fine brain of his  look you steward  before we sailed in the gloucester fishing schooner purchased by the doctor and that was like a yacht and showed her heels to most yachts he had me to his house to advise about personal equipment  we were overhauling in a gearroom when suddenly he spoke  i wonder how my lady will take my long absence  what say you  shall she go along  and i had not known that he had any wife or lady  and i looked my surprise and incredulity  just that you do not believe i shall take her on the cruise he laughed wickedly madly in my astonished face  come you shall meet her  straight to his bedroom and his bed he led me and turning down the covers showed there to me asleep as she had slept for many a thousand years the mummy of a slender egyptian maid  and she sailed with us on the long vain voyage to the south seas and back again and steward on my honour i grew quite fond of the dear maid myself  the ancient mariner gazed dreamily into his glass and dag daughtry took advantage of the pause to ask  but the young doctor  how did he take the failure to find the treasure  the ancient mariners face lighted with joy  he called me a delectable old fraud with his arm on my shoulder while he did it  why steward i had come to love that young man like a splendid son  and with his arm on my shoulder and i know there was more than mere kindness in it he told me we had barely reached the river plate when he discovered me  with laughter and with more than one slap of his hand on my shoulder that was more caress than jollity he pointed out the discrepancies in my tale which i have since amended steward thanks to him and amended well and told me that the voyage had been a grand success making him eternally my debtor  what could i do  i told him the truth  to him even did i tell my family name and the shame i had saved it from by forswearing it  he put his arm on my shoulder i tell you and      the ancient mariner ceased talking because of a huskiness in his throat and a moisture from his eyes trickled down both cheeks  dag daughtry pledged him silently and in the draught from his glass he recovered himself  he told me that i should come and live with him and to his great lonely house he took me the very day we landed in boston  also he told me he would make arrangements with his lawyersthe idea tickled his fancyi shall adopt you he said  i shall adopt you along with istharisthar was the little maids name the little mummys name  here was i back in life steward and legally to be adopted  but life is a fond betrayer  eighteen hours afterward in the morning we found him dead in his bed the little mummy maid beside him  heartfailure the burst of some bloodvessel in the braini never learned  i prayed and pleaded with them for the pair to be buried together  but they were a hard cold new england lot his cousins and his aunts and they presented isthar to the museum and me they gave a week to be quit of the house  i left in an hour and they searched my small baggage before they would let me depart  i went to new york  it was the same game there only that i had more money and could play it properly  it was the same in new orleans in galveston  i came to california  this is my fifth voyage  i had a hard time getting these three interested and spent all my little store of money before they signed the agreement  they were very mean  advance any money to me  the very idea of it was preposterous  though i bided my time ran up a comfortable hotel bill and at the very last ordered my own generous assortment of liquors and cigars and charged the bill to the schooner  such a todo  all three of them raged and all but tore their hair    and mime  they said it could not be  i fell promptly sick  i told them they got on my nerves and made me sick  the more they raged the sicker i got  then they gave in  as promptly i grew better and here we are out of water and heading soon most likely for the marquesas to fill our barrels  then they will return and try for it again  you think so sir  i shall remember even more important data steward the ancient mariner smiled  without doubt they will return  oh i know them well  they are meagre narrow grasping fools  fools all fools a ship of fools dag daughtry exulted repeating what he had expressed in the hold as he bored the last barrel listened to the good water gurgling away into the bilge and chuckled over his discovery of the ancient mariner on the same lay as his own     chapter xiv   early next morning the morning watch of sailors whose custom was to fetch the days supply of water for the galley and cabin discovered that the barrels were empty  mr jackson was so alarmed that he immediately called captain doane and not many minutes elapsed ere captain doane had routed out grimshaw and nishikanta to tell them the disaster  breakfast was an excitement shared in peculiarly by the ancient mariner and dag daughtry while the trio of partners raged and bewailed  captain doane particularly wailed  simon nishikanta was fiendish in his descriptions of whatever miscreant had done the deed and of how he should be made to suffer for it while grimshaw clenched and repeatedly clenched his great hands as if throttling some throat  i remember it was in fortysevennay fortysixyes fortysix the ancient mariner chattered  it was a similar and worse predicament  it was in the longboat sixteen of us  we ran on glister reef  so named it was after our pretty little craft discovered it one dark night and left her bones upon it  the reef is on the admiralty charts  captain doane will verify me      no one listened save dag daughtry serving hot cakes and admiring  but simon nishikanta becoming suddenly aware that the old man was babbling bellowed out ferociously  oh shut up  close your jaw  you make me tired with your everlasting i remember  the ancient mariner was guilelessly surprised as if he had slipped somewhere in his narrative  no i assure you he continued  it must have been some error of my poor old tongue  it was not the wide awake but the brig glister did i say wide awake  it was the glister a smart little brig almost a toy brig in fact copperbottomed lines like a dolphin a sea cutter and a windeater  handled like a top  on my honour gentlemen it was lively work for both watches when she went about  i was super cargo  we sailed out of new york ostensibly for the northwest coast with sealed orders  in the name of god peace peace  you drive me mad with your drivel so nishikanta cried out in nervous pain that was real and quivering  old man have a heart  what do i care to know of your glister and your sealed orders  ah sealed orders the ancient mariner went on beamingly  a magic phrase sealed orders  he rolled it off his tongue with unction  those were the days gentlemen when ships did sail with sealed orders  and as supercargo with my trifle invested in the adventure and my share in the gains i commanded the captain  not in him but in me were reposed the sealed orders  i assure you i did not know myself what they were  not until we were around old cape stiff fifty to fifty and in fifty in the pacific did i break the seal and learn we were bound for van diemans land  they called it van diemans land in those days      it was a day of discoveries  captain doane caught the mate stealing the ships position from his desk with the duplicate key  there was a scene but no more for the finn was too huge a man to invite personal encounter and captain dome could only stigmatize his conduct to a running reiteration of yes sir and no sir and sorry sir  perhaps the most important discovery although he did not know it at the time was that of dag daughtry  it was after the course had been changed and all sail set and after the ancient mariner had privily informed him that taiohae in the marquesas was their objective that daughtry gaily proceeded to shave  but one trouble was on his mind  he was not quite sure in such an outoftheway place as taiohae that good beer could be procured  as he prepared to make the first stroke of the razor most of his face white with lather he noticed a dark patch of skin on his forehead just between the eyebrows and above  when he had finished shaving he touched the dark patch wondering how he had been sunburned in such a spot  but he did not know he had touched it in so far as there was any response of sensation  the dark place was numb  curious he thought wiped his face and forgot all about it  no more than he knew what horror that dark spot represented did he know that ah moys slant eyes had long since noticed it and were continuing to notice it day by day with secret growing terror  closehauled on the southeast trades the mary turner began her long slant toward the marquesas  forard all were happy  being only seamen on seamens wages they hailed with delight the news that they were bound in for a tropic isle to fill their waterbarrels  aft the three partners were in bad temper and nishikanta openly sneered at captain doane and doubted his ability to find the marquesas  in the steerage everybody was happydag daughtry because his wages were running on and a further supply of beer was certain kwaque because he was happy whenever his master was happy and ah moy because he would soon have opportunity to desert away from the schooner and the two lepers with whom he was domiciled  michael shared in the general happiness of the steerage and joined eagerly with steward in learning by heart a fifth song  this was lead kindly light  in his singing which was no more than trained howling after all michael sought for something he knew not what  in truth it was the lost pack the pack of the primeval world before the dog ever came in to the fires of men and for that matter before men built fires and before men were men  he had been born only the other day and had lived but two years in the world so that of himself he had no knowledge of the lost pack  for many thousands of generations he had been away from it yet deep down in the crypts of being tied about and wrapped up in every muscle and nerve of him was the indelible record of the days in the wild when dim ancestors had run with the pack and at the same time developed the pack and themselves  when michael was asleep then it was that packmemories sometimes arose to the surface of his subconscious mind  these dreams were real while they lasted but when he was awake he remembered them little if at all  but asleep or singing with steward he sensed and yearned for the lost pack and was impelled to seek the forgotten way to it  waking michael had another and real pack  this was composed of steward kwaque cocky and scraps and he ran with it as ancient forbears had ran with their own kind in the hunting  the steerage was the lair of this pack and out of the steerage it ranged the whole world which was the mary turner ever rocking heeling reeling on the surface of the unstable sea  but the steerage and its company meant more to michael than the mere pack  it was heaven as well where dwelt god  man early invented god often of stone or clod or fire and placed him in trees and mountains and among the stars  this was because man observed that man passed and was lost out of the tribe or family or whatever name he gave to his group which was after all the human pack  and man did not want to be lost out of the pack  so of his imagination he devised a new pack that would be eternal and with which he might for ever run  fearing the dark into which he observed all men passed he built beyond the dark a fairer region a happier huntingground a jollier and robuster feastinghall and wassailingplace and called it variously heaven  like some of the earliest and lowest of primitive men michael never dreamed of throwing the shadow of himself across his mind and worshipping it as god  he did not worship shadows  he worshipped a real and indubitable god not fashioned in his own fourlegged haircovered image but in the fleshandblood image twolegged hairless upstanding of steward     chapter xv   had the trade wind not failed on the second day after laying the course for the marquesas had captain doane at the midday meal not grumbled once again at being equipped with only one chronometer had simon nishikanta not become viciously angry thereat and gone on deck with his rifle to find some seadenizen to kill and had the seadenizen that appeared close alongside been a bonita a dolphin a porpoise an albacore or anything else than a great eightyfoot cow whale accompanied by her nursing calfhad any link been missing from this chain of events the mary turner would have undoubtedly reached the marquesas filled her waterbarrels and returned to the treasurehunting and the destinies of michael daughtry kwaque and cocky would have been quite different and possibly less terrible  but every link was present for the occasion  the schooner in a dead calm was rolling over the huge smooth seas her boom sheets and tackles crashing to the hollow thunder of her great sails when simon nishikanta put a bullet into the body of the little whale calf  by an almost miracle of chance the shot killed the calf  it was equivalent to killing an elephant with a pearifle  not at once did the calf die  it merely immediately ceased its gambols and for a while lay quivering on the surface of the ocean  the mother was beside it the moment after it was struck and to those on board looking almost directly down upon her her dismay and alarm were very patent  she would nudge the calf with her huge shoulder circle around and around it then range up alongside and repeat her nudgings and shoulderings  all on the mary turner fore and aft lined the rail and stared down apprehensively at the leviathan that was as long as the schooner  if she should do to us sir what that other one did to the essex dag daughtry observed to the ancient mariner  it would be no more than we deserve was the response  it was uncalledfora wanton cruel act  michael aware of the excitement overside but unable to see because of the rail leaped on top of the cabin and at sight of the monster barked defiantly  every eye turned on him in startlement and fear and steward hushed him with a whispered command  this is the last time grimshaw muttered in a low voice tense with anger to nishikanta  if ever again on this voyage you take a shot at a whale ill wring your dirty neck for you  get me  i mean it  ill choke your eyeballs out of you  the jew smiled in a sickly way and whined there aint nothing going to happen  i dont believe that essex ever was sunk by a whale  urged on by its mother the dying calf made spasmodic efforts to swim that were futile and caused it to veer and wallow from side to side  in the course of circling about it the mother accidentally brushed her shoulder under the port quarter of the mary turner and the mary turner listed to starboard as her stern was lifted a yard or more  nor was this unintentional gentle impact all  the instant after her shoulder had touched startled by the contact she flailed out with her tail  the blow smote the rail just forard of the foreshrouds splintering a gap through it as if it were no more than a cigarbox and cracking the covering board  that was all and an entire ships company stared down in silence and fear at a seamonster griefstricken over its dying progeny  several times in the course of an hour during which the schooner and the two whales drifted farther and farther apart the calf strove vainly to swim  then it set up a great quivering which culminated in a wild wallowing and lashing about of its tail  it is the deathflurry said the ancient mariner softly  by damn its dead was captain doanes comment five minutes later whod believe it  a rifle bullet  i wish to heaven we could get half an hours breeze of wind to get us out of this neighbourhood  a close squeak said grimshaw  captain doane shook his head as his anxious eyes cast aloft to the empty canvas and quested on over the sea in the hope of windruffles on the water  but all was glassy calm each great sea of all the orderly procession of great seas heaving up roundtopped and mountainous like so much quicksilver  its all right grimahaw encouraged  there she goes now beating it away from us  of course its all right always was all right nishikanta bragged as he wiped the sweat from his face and neck and looked with the others after the departing whale  youre a fine brave lot you are losing your goat to a fish  i noticed your face was less yellow than usual grimshaw sneered  it must have gone to your heart  captain doane breathed a great sigh  his relief was too strong to permit him to join in the squabbling  youre yellow grimshaw went on yellow clean through  he nodded his head toward the ancient mariner  now theres the real thing as a man no yellow in him  he never batted an eye and i reckon he knew more about the danger than you did  if i was to choose being wrecked on a desert island with him or you id take him a thousand times first  if  but a cry from the sailors interrupted him  merciful god captain doane breathed aloud  the great cow whale had turned about and on the surface was charging straight back at them  such was her speed that a bore was raised by her nose like that which a dreadnought or an atlantic liner raises on the sea  hold fast all captain doane roared  every man braced himself for the shock  henrik gjertsen the sailor at the wheel spread his legs crouched down and stiffened his shoulders and arms to handgrips on opposite spokes of the wheel  several of the crew fled from the waist to the poop and others of them sprang into the mainrigging  daughtry one hand on the rail with his free arm clasped the ancient mariner around the waist  all held  the whale struck the mary turner just aft of the foreshroud  a score of things which no eye could take in simultaneously happened  a sailor in the main rigging carried away a ratline in both hands fell headdownward and was clutched by an ankle and saved headdownward by a comrade as the schooner cracked and shuddered uplifted on the port side and was flung down on her starboard side till the ocean poured level over her rail  michael on the smooth roof of the cabin slithered down the steep slope to starboard and disappeared clawing and snarling into the runway  the port shrouds of the foremast carried away at the chainplates and the foretopmast leaned over drunkenly to starboard  my word quoth the ancient mariner  we certainly felt that  mr jackson captain doane commanded the mate will you sound the well  the mate obeyed although he kept an anxious eye on the whale which had gone off at a tangent and was smoking away to the eastward  you see thats what you get grimshaw snarled at nishikanta  nishikanta nodded as he wiped the sweat away and muttered and im satisfied  i got all i want  i didnt think a whale had it in it  ill never do it again  maybe youll never have the chance the captain retorted  were not done with this one yet  the one that charged the essex made charge after charge and i guess whale nature hasnt changed any in the last few years  dry as a bone sir mr jackson reported the result of his sounding  there she turns daughtry called out  half a mile away the whale circled about sharply and charged back  stand from under forard there captain doane shouted to one of the sailors who had just emerged from the forecastle scuttle seabag in hand and over whom the foretopmast was swaying giddily  hes packed for the getaway daughtry murmured to the ancient mariner like a rat leaving a ship  were all rats was the reply  i learned just that when i was a rat among the mangy rats of the poorfarm  by this time all men on board had communicated to michael their contagion of excitement and fear  back on top of the cabin so that he might see he snarled at the cow whale when the men seized fresh grips against the impending shock and when he saw her close at hand and oncoming  the mary turner was struck aft of the mizzen shrouds  as she was hurled down to starboard whither michael was ignominiously flung the crack of shattered timbers was plainly heard  henrik gjertsen at the wheel clutching the wheel with all his strength was spun through the air as the wheel was spun by the fling of the rudder  he fetched up against captain doane whose grip had been torn loose from the rail  both men crumpled down on deck with the wind knocked out of them  nishikanta leaned cursing against the side of the cabin the nails of both hands torn off at the quick by the breaking of his grip on the rail  while daughtry was passing a turn of rope around the ancient mariner and the mizzen rigging and giving the turn to him to hold captain doane crawled gasping to the rail and dragged himself erect  that fetched her he whispered huskily to the mate hand pressed to his side to control his pain  sound the well again and keep on sounding  more of the sailors took advantage of the interval to rush forard under the toppling foretopmast dive into the forecastle and hastily pack their seabags  as ah moy emerged from the steerage with his own rotund seabag daughtry dispatched kwaque to pack the belongings of both of them  dry as a bone sir came the mates report  keep on sounding mr jackson the captain ordered his voice already stronger as he recovered from the shock of his collision with the helmsman  keep right on sounding  here she comes again and the schooner aint built thatd stand such hammering  by this time daughtry had michael tucked under one arm his free arm ready to anticipate the next crash by swinging on to the rigging  in making its circle to come back the cow lost her bearings sufficiently to miss the stern of the mary turner by twenty feet  nevertheless the bore of her displacement lifted the schooners stern gently and made her dip her bow to the sea in a stately curtsey  if shed ahit     captain doane murmured and ceased  itd aben good night daughtry concluded for him  shes aknocked our stern clean off of us sir  again wheeling this time at no more than two hundred yards the whale charged back not completing her semicircle sufficiently so that she bore down upon the schooners bow from starboard  her back hit the stem and seemed just barely to scrape the martingale yet the mary turner sat down till the sea washed level with her sternrail  nor was this all  martingale bobstays and all parted as well as all starboard stays to the bowsprit so that the bowsprit swung out to port at right angles and uplifted to the drag of the remaining topmast stays  the topmast anticked high in the air for a space then crashed down to deck permitting the bowsprit to dip into the sea go clear with the butt of it of the forecastle head and drag alongside  shut up that dog nishikanta ordered daughtry savagery  if you dont      michael in stewards arms was snarling and growling intimidatingly not merely at the cow whale but at all the hostile and menacing universe that had thrown panic into the twolegged gods of his floating world  just for that daughtry snarled back ill let m sing  you made this mess and if you lift a hand to my dog youll miss seeing the end of the mess you started you dirty pawnbroker you  perfectly right perfectly right the ancient mariner nodded approbation  do you think steward you could get a width of canvas or a blanket or something soft and broad with which to replace this rope it cuts me too sharply in the spot where my three ribs are missing  daughtry thrust michael into the old mans arm  hold him sir the steward said  if that pawnbroker makes a move against killeny boy spit in his face bite him anything  ill be back in a jiffy sir before he can hurt you and before the whale can hit us again  and let killeny boy make all the noise he wants  one hair of hims worth more than a worldfull of skunks of moneylenders  daughtry dashed into the cabin came back with a pillow and three sheets and using the first as a pad and knotting the last together in swift weavers knots he left the ancient mariner safe and soft and took michael back into his own arms  shes making water sir the mate called  six inchesno seven inches sir  there was a rush of sailors across the wreckage of the foretopmast to the forecastle to pack their bags  swing out that starboard boat mr jackson the captain commanded staring after the foaming course of the cow as she surged away for a fresh onslaught  but dont lower it  hold it overside in the falls or that damned fishll smash it  just swing it out ready and waiting let the men get their bags then stow food and water aboard of her  lashings were cast off the boat and the falls attached when the men fled to holdingvantage just ere the whale arrived  she struck the mary turner squarely amidships on the port beam so that from the poop one saw as well as heard her long side bend and spring back like a limber fabric  the starboard rail buried under the sea as the schooner heeled to the blow and as she righted with a violent lurch the water swashed across the deck to the knees of the sailors about the boat and spouted out of the port scuppers  heave away captain doane ordered from the poop  up with her  swing her out  hold your turns  make fast  the boat was outboard its gunwale resting against the mary turners rail  ten inches sir and making fast was the mates information as he gauged the soundingrod  im going after my tools captain doane announced as he started for the cabin  half into the scuttle he paused to add with a sneer for nishikantas benefit and for my one chronometer  a foot and a half and making the mate shouted aft to him  wed better do some packing ourselves grimshaw following on the captain said to nishikanta  steward nishikanta said go below and pack my bedding  ill take care of the rest  mr nishikanta you can go to hell sir and all the rest as well was daughtrys quiet response although in the same breath he was saying respectfully and assuringly to the ancient mariner you hold killeny sir  ill take care of your dunnage  is there anything special you want to save sir  jackson joined the four men below and as the five of them in haste and trepidation packed articles of worth and comfort the mary turner was struck again  caught below without warning all were flung fiercely to port and from simon nishikantas room came wailing curses of announcement of the hurt to his ribs against his bunkrail  but this was drowned by a prodigious smashing and crashing on deck  kindling woodthere wont be anything else left of her captain doane commented in the ensuing calm as he crept gingerly up the companionway with his chronometer cuddled on an even keel to his breast  placing it in the custody of a sailor he returned below and was helped up with his seachest by the steward  in turn he helped the steward up with the ancient mariners seachest  next aided by anxious sailors he and daughtry dropped into the lazarette through the cabin floor and began breaking out and passing up a stream of suppliescases of salmon and beef of marmalade and biscuit of butter and preserved milk and of all sorts of the tinned desiccated evaporated and condensed stuff that of modern times goes down to the sea in ships for the nourishment of men  daughtry and the captain emerged last from the cabin and both stared upward for a moment at the gaps in the slender skyscraping tophamper where only minutes before the main and mizzentopmasts had been  a second moment they devoted to the wreckage of the same on deckthe mizzentopmast thrust through the spanker and supported vertically by the stout canvas thrashing back and forth with each thrash of the sail the maintopmast squarely across the ruined companionway to the steerage  while the motherwhale expressing her bereavement in terms of violence and destruction was withdrawing the necessary distance for another charge all hands of the mary turner gathered about the starboard boat swung outboard ready for lowering  a respectable hill of case goods waterkegs and personal dunnage was piled on the deck alongside  a glance at this and at the many men of fore and aft demonstrated that it was to be a perilously overloaded boat  we want the sailors with us at any ratethey can row said simon nishikanta  but do we want you grimshaw queried gloomily  you take up too much room for your size and youre a beast anyway  i guess ill be wanted the pawnbroker observed as he jerked open his shirt tearing out the four buttons in his impetuousness and showing a colts 44 automatic strapped in its holster against the bare skin of his side under his left arm the butt of the weapon most readily accessible to any hasty dip of his right hand  i guess ill be wanted but just the same we can dispense with the undesirables  if you will have your will the wheatfarmer conceded sardonically although his big hand clenched involuntarily as if throttling a throat besides if we should run short of food you will prove desirablefor the quantity of you i mean and not otherwise  now just who would you consider undesirablethe black nigger  he aint got a gun  but his pleasantries were cut short by the whales next attackanother smash at the stern that carried away the rudder and destroyed the steering gear  how much water captain doane queried of the mate  three feet siri just sounded came the answer  i think sir it would be advisable to partload the boat then right after the next time the whale hits us lower away on the run chuck the rest of the dunnage in and ourselves and get clear  captain doane nodded  it will be lively work he said  stand ready all of you  steward you jump aboard first and ill pass the chronometer to you  nishikanta bellicosely shouldered his vast bulk up to the captain opened his shirt and exposed his revolver  theres too many for the boat he said and the stewards one of em that dont go along  get that  hold it in your head  the stewards one of em that dont go along  captain doane coolly surveyed the big automatic while at the fore of his consciousness burned a vision of his flat buildings in san francisco  he shrugged his shoulders  the boat would be overloaded with all this truck anyway  go ahead if you want to make it your party but just bear in mind that im the navigator and that if you ever want to lay eyes on your string of pawnshops youd better see that gentle care is taken of mesteward  daughtry stepped close  there wont be room for you    and for one or two others im sorry to say  glory be said daughtry  i was just fearin youd be wantin me along sirkwaque you take m my fella dunnage belong me put m in other fella boat along other side  while kwaque obeyed the mate sounded the well for the last time reporting three feet and a half and the lighter freightage of the starboard boat was tossed in by the sailors  a rangy gangly scandinavian youth of a sailor droopshouldered six feet six and slender as a lath with pallid eyes of palest blue and skin and hair attuned to the same colour scheme joined kwaque in his work  here you big john the mate interfered  this is your boat  you work here  the lanky one smiled in embarrassment as he haltingly explained i tank i lak go along cooky  sure let him go the more the easier nishikanta took charge of the situation  anybody else  sure dag daughtry sneered to his face  i reckon whats left of the beer goes with my boat    unless you want to argue the matter  for two cents nishikanta spluttered in affected rage  not for two billion cents would you risk a scrap with me you moneysweater you was daughtrys retort  youve got their goats but ive got your number  not for two billion billion cents would you excite me into callin it right nowbig john  just carry that case of beer across an that half case and store in my boatnishikanta just start something if youve got the nerve  simon nishikanta did not dare nor did he know what to do but he was saved from his perplexity by the shout  here she comes  all rushed to holdingground and held while the whale broke more timbers and the mary turner rolled sluggishly down and back again  lower away  on the run  lively  captain doanes orders were swiftly obeyed  the starboard boat fended off by sailors rose and fell in the water alongside while the remainder of the dunnage and provisions showered into her  might as well lend a hand sir seein youre bent on leaving in such a hurry said daughtry taking the chronometer from captain doanes hand and standing ready to pass it down to him as soon as he was in the boat  come on greenleaf grimshaw called up to the ancient mariner  no thanking you very kindly sir came the reply  i think therell be more room in the other boat  we want the cook nishikanta cried out from the stern sheets  come on you yellow monkey  jump in  little old shrivelled ah moy debated  he visibly thought although none knew the intrinsicness of his thinking as he stared at the gun of the fat pawnbroker and at the leprosy of kwaque and daughtry and weighed the one against the other and tossed the light and heavy loads of the two boats into the balance  me go other boat said ah moy starting to drag his bag away across the deck  cast off captain doane commanded  scraps the big newfoundland puppy who had played and pranced about through all the excitement seeing so many of the mary turners humans in the boat alongside sprang over the rail low and close to the water and landed sprawling on the mass of seabags and goods cases  the boot rocked and nishikanta his automatic in his hand cried out  back with him  throw him on board  the sailors obeyed and the astounded scraps after a brief flight through the air found himself arriving on his back on the mary turners deck  at any rate he took it for no more than a rough joke and rolled about ecstatically squirming vermicularly in anticipation of what new delights of play were to be visited upon him  he reached out with an enticing growl of good fellowship for michael who was now free on deck and received in return a forbidding and crusty snarl  guess well have to add him to our collection eh sir daughtry observed sparing a moment to pat reassurance on the big puppys head and being rewarded with a caressing lick on his hand from the puppys blissful tongue  no firstclass ships steward can exist without possessing a more than average measure of executive ability  dag daughtry was a firstclass ships steward  placing the ancient mariner in a nook of safety and setting big john to unlashing the remaining boat and hooking on the falls he sent kwaque into the hold to fill kegs of water from the scant remnant of supply and ah moy to clear out the food in the galley  the starboard boat cluttered with men provisions and property and being rapidly rowed away from the danger centre which was the mary turner was scarcely a hundred yards away when the whale missing the schooner clean turned at full speed and close range churning the water and all but collided with the boat  so near did she come that the rowers on the side next to her pulled in their oars  the surge she raised heeled the loaded boat gunwale under so that a degree of water was shipped ere it righted  nishikanta automatic still in hand standing up in the sternsheets by the comfortable seat he had selected for himself was staggered by the lurch of the boat  in his instinctive spasmodic effort to maintain balance he relaxed his clutch on the pistol which fell into the sea  haah daughtry girded  what price nishikanta  i got his number and hes lost you fellows goats  hes your meat now  easy meat  i should say  and when it comes to the eating eat him first  sure hes a skunk and will taste like one but manys the honest man thats eaten skunk and pulled through a tight place  but youd better soak im all night in salt water first  grimshaw whose seat in the sternsheets was none of the best grasped the situation simultaneously with daughtry and with a quick upstanding and hooking outreach of hand caught the fat pawnbroker around the back of the neck and with anything but gentle suasion jerked him half into the air and flung him face downward on the bottom boards  haah said daughtry across the hundred yards of ocean  next and without hurry grimshaw took the more comfortable seat for himself  want to come along he called to daughtry  no thank you sir was the latters reply  theres too many of us an well make out better in the other boat  with some bailing and with others bending to the oars the boat rowed frantically away while daughtry took ah moy with him down into the lazarette beneath the cabin floor and broke out and passed up more provisions  it was when he was thus below that the cow grazed the schooner just forard of amidships on the port side lashed out with her mighty tail as she sounded and ripped clean away the chain plates and rail of the mizzenshrouds  in the next roll of the huge glassy sea the mizzen mast fell overside  my word some whale daughtry said to ah moy as they emerged from the cabin companionway and gazed at this latest wreckage  ah moy found need to get more food from the galley when daughtry kwaque and big john swung their weight on the falls one at a time and hoisted the port boat one end at a time over the rail and swung her out  well wait till the next smash then lower away throw everything in an get outa this the steward told the ancient mariner  lots of time the schoonerll sink no faster when shes awash than shes sinkin now  even as he spoke the scuppers were nearly level with the ocean and her rolling in the big sea was sluggish  hey he called with sudden forethought across the widening stretch of sea to captain doane  whats the course to the marquesas  right now and how far away sir  nornoreastquartereast came the faint reply  will fetch nuka hiva  about two hundred miles  haul on the southeast trade with a good full and youll make it  thank you sir was the stewards acknowledgment ere he ran aft disrupted the binnacle and carried the steering compass back to the boat  almost from the whales delay in renewing her charging did they think she had given over  and while they waited and watched her rolling on the sea an eighth of a mile away the mary turner steadily sank  we might almost chance it daughtry was debating aloud to big john when a new voice entered the discussion  cockycocky came plaintive tones from below out of the steerage companion  devil be damned was the next uttered in irritation and anger  devil be damned  devil be damned  of course not was daughtrys judgment as he dashed across the deck crawled through the confusion of the maintopmast and its many stays that blocked the way and found the tiny white morsel of life perched on a bunkedge ruffling its feathers erecting and flattening its rosy crest and cursing in honest human speech the waywardness of the world and of ships and humans upon the sea  the cockatoo stepped upon daughtrys inviting index finger swiftly ascended his shirt sleeve and on his shoulder claws sunk into the flimsy shirt fabric till they hurt the flesh beneath leaned head to ear and uttered in gratitude and relief and in selfidentification cocky cocky  you son of a gun daughtry crooned  glory be cooky replied in tones so like daughtrys as to startle him  you son of a gun daughtry repeated cuddling his cheek and ear against the cockatoos feathered and crested head  and some folks thinks its only folks that count in this world  still the whale delayed and with the ocean washing their toes on the level deck daughtry ordered the boat lowered away  ah moy was eager in his haste to leap into the bow  nor was daughtrys judgment correct that the little chinamans haste was due to fear of the sinking ship  what ah moy sought was the place in the boat remotest from kwaque and the steward  shoving clear they roughly stored the supplies and dunnage out of the way of the thwarts and took their places ah moy pulling bowoar next in order big john and kwaque with daughtry cocky still perched on his shoulder at stroke  on top of the dunnage in the sternsheets michael gazed wistfully at the mary turner and continued to snarl crustily at scraps who idiotically wanted to start a romp  the ancient mariner stood up at the steering sweep and gave the order when all was ready for the first dip of the oars  a growl and a bristle from michael warned them that the whale was not only coming but was close upon them  but it was not charging  instead it circled slowly about the schooner as if examining its antagonist  ill bet its heads sore from all that banging an its beginnin to feel it daughtry grinned chiefly for the purpose of keeping his comrades unafraid  barely had they rowed a dozen strokes when an exclamation from big john led them to follow his gaze to the schooners forecastlehead where the forecastle cat flashed across in pursuit of a big rat  other rats they saw evidently driven out of their lairs by the rising water  we just cant leave that cat behind daughtry soliloquized in suggestive tones  certainly not the ancient mariner responded swinging his weight on the steeringsweep and heading the boat back  twice the whale gently rolled them in the course of its leisurely circling ere they bent to their oars again and pulled away  of them the whale seemed to take no notice  it was from the huge thing the schooner that death had been wreaked upon her calf and it was upon the schooner that she vented the wrath of her grief  even as they pulled away the whale turned and headed across the ocean at a halfmile distance she curved about and charged back  with all that water in her the schoonerll have a real kickback in her when shes hit daughtry said  lordy me rest on your oars an watch  delivered squarely amidships it was the hardest blow the mary turner had received  stays and splinters of rail flew in the air as she rolled so far over as to expose half her copper wetglistening in the sun  as she righted sluggishly the mainmast swayed drunkenly in the air but did not fall  a knockout daughtry cried at sight of the whale flurrying the water with aimless gigantic splashings  it must asmashed both of em  schooner he finish close up altogether kwaque observed as the mary turners rail disappeared  swiftly she sank and no more than a matter of moments was it when the stump of her mainmast was gone  remained only the whale floating and floundering on the surface of the sea  its nothing to brag about daughtry delivered himself of the mary turners epitaph  nobodyd believe us  a stout little craft like that sunk deliberately sunk by an old cowwhale  no sir  i never believed that old mossback in honolulu when he claimed he was a survivor of the sinkin of the essex an no more will anybody believe me  the pretty schooner the pretty clever craft mourned the ancient mariner  never were there more dainty and lovable topmasts on a three masted schooner and never was there a threemasted schooner that worked like the witch she was to windward  dag daughtry who had kept always footloose and never married surveyed the boatload of his responsibilities to which he was anchoredkwaque the black papuan monstrosity whom he had saved from the bellies of his fellows ah moy the little old seacook whose age was problematical only by decades the ancient mariner the dignified the beloved and the respected gangly big john the youthful scandinavian with the inches of a giant and the mind of a child killeny boy the wonder of dogs scraps the outrageously silly and fatrolling puppy cocky the whitefeathered mite of life imperious as a steelblade and wheedlingly seductive as a charming child and even the forecastle cat the lithe and tawny slayer of rats sheltering between the legs of ah moy  and the marquesas were two hundred miles distant fullhauled on the tradewind which had ceased but which was as sure to live again as the morning sun in the sky  the steward heaved a sigh and whimsically shot into his mind the memory picture in his nurserybook of the old woman who lived in a shoe  he wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand and was dimly aware of the area of the numbness that bordered the centre that was sensationless between his eyebrows as he said  well children rowing wont fetch us to the marquesas  well need a stretch of wind for that  but its up to us right now to put a mile or so between us an that peevish old cow  maybe shell revive and maybe she wont but just the same i cant help feelin leary about her     chapter xvi   two days later as the steamer mariposa plied her customary route between tahiti and san francisco the passengers ceased playing deck quoits abandoned their card games in the smoker their novels and deck chairs and crowded the rail to stare at the small boat that skimmed to them across the sea before a light following breeze  when big john aided by ah moy and kwaque lowered the sail and unstepped the mast titters and laughter arose from the passengers  it was contrary to all their preconceptions of midocean rescue of shipwrecked mariners from the open boat  it caught their fancy that this boat was the ark what of its freightage of bedding dry goods boxes beercases a cat two dogs a white cockatoo a chinaman a kinkyheaded black a gangly pallidhaired giant a grizzled dag daughtry and an ancient mariner who looked every inch the part  him a facetious vacationing architects clerk dubbed noah and so greeted him  i say noah he called  some flood eh  located ararat yet  catch any fish bawled another youngster down over the rail  gracious  look at the beer  good english beer  put me down for a case  never was a more popular wrecked crew more merrily rescued at sea  the young blades would have it that none other than old noah himself had come on board with the remnants of the lost tribes and to elderly female passengers spun hairraising accounts of the sinking of an entire tropic island by volcanic and earthquake action  im a steward dag daughtry told the mariposas captain and ill be glad and grateful to berth along with your stewards in the gloryhole big john theres a sailorman an the focsle ll do him  the chink is a ships cook and the nigger belongs to me  but mr greenleaf sir is a gentleman and the best of cabin fare and stateroomsll be none too good for him sir  and when the news went around that these were part of the survivors of the threemasted schooner mary turner smashed into kindling wood and sunk by a whale the elderly females no more believed than had they the yarn of the sunken island  captain hayward one of them demanded of the steamers skipper could a whale sink the mariposa  she has never been so sunk was his reply  i knew it she declared emphatically  its not the way of ships to go around being sunk by whales is it captain  no madam i assure you it is not was his response  nevertheless all the five men insist upon it  sailors are notorious for their unveracity are they not the lady voiced her flat conclusion in the form of a tentative query  worst liars i ever saw madam  do you know after forty years at sea i couldnt believe myself under oath        nine days later the mariposa threaded the golden gate and docked at san francisco  humorous halfcolumns in the local papers written in the customary silly way by unlicked cub reporters just out of grammar school tickled the fancy of san francisco for a fleeting moment in that the steamship mariposa had rescued some seawaifs possessed of a cockand bull story that not even the reporters believed  thus silly reportorial unveracity usually proves extraordinary truth a liar  it is the way of cub reporters city newspapers and flatfloor populations which get their thrills from moving pictures and for which the real world and all its spaciousness does not exist  sunk by a whale demanded the average flatfloor person  nonsense thats all  just plain rotten nonsense  now in the adventures of eleanor which is some film believe me ill tell you what i saw happen      so daughtry and his crew went ashore into frisco town uheralded and unsung the second following mornings lucubrations of the sea reporters being varied disportations upon the attack on an italian crab fisherman by an enormous jellyfish  big john promptly sank out of sight in a sailors boardinghouse and within the week joined the sailors union and shipped on a steam schooner to load redwood ties at bandon oregon ah moy got no farther ashore than the detention sheds of the federal immigration board whence he was deported to china on the next pacific mail steamer  the mary turners cat was adopted by the sailors forecastle of the mariposa and on the mariposa sailed away on the back trip to tahiti  scraps was taken ashore by a quartermaster and left in the bosom of his family  and ashore went dag daughtry with his small savings to rent two cheap rooms for himself and his remaining responsibilities namely charles stough greenleaf kwaque michael and not least cocky  but not for long did he permit the ancient mariner to live with him  its not playing the game sir he told him  what we need is capital weve got to interest capital and youve got to do the interesting  now this very day youve got to buy a couple of suitcases hire a taxicab go sailing up to the front door of the bronx hotel like good pay and be damned  shes a real stylish hotel but reasonable if you want to make it so  a little room an inside room european plan of course and then you can economise by eatin out  but steward i have no money the ancient mariner protested  thats all right sir ill back you for all i can  but my dear man you know im an old impostor  i cant stick you up like the others  you    why    why youre a friend dont you see  sure i do and i thank you for sayin it sir  and thats why im with you  and when youve nailed another crowd of treasurehunters and got the ship ready youll just ship me along as steward with kwaque and killeny boy and the rest of our family  youve adopted me now an im your grownup son an youve got to listen to me  the bronx is the hotel for youfinesoundin name aint it  thats atmosphere  folkll listen half to you an more to your hotel  i tell you you leaning back in a big leather chair talkin treasure with a twobit cigar in your mouth an a twentycent drink beside you why thats like treasure  they just got to believe  an if youll come along now sir well trot out an buy them suitcases  right bravely the ancient mariner drove to the bronx in a taxi registered his charles stough greenleaf in an oldfashioned hand and took up anew the activities which for years had kept him free of the poor farm  no less bravely did dag daughtry set out to seek work  this was most necessary because he was a man of expensive luxuries  his family of kwaque michael and cocky required food and shelter more costly than that was maintenance of the ancient mariner in the highclass hotel and in addition was his sixquart thirst  but it was a time of industrial depression  the unemployed problem was bulking bigger than usual to the citizens of san francisco  and as regarded steamships and sailing vessels there were three stewards for every stewards position  nothing steady could daughtry procure while his occasional odd jobs did not balance his various running expenses even did he do pickandshovel work for the municipality for three days when he had to give way according to the impartial procedure to another needy one whom three days work would keep afloat a little longer  daughtry would have put kwaque to work except that kwaque was impossible  the black who had only seen sydney from steamers decks had never been in a city in his life  all he knew of the world was steamers faroutlying southsea isles and his own island of king william in melanesia  so kwaque remained in the two rooms cooking and housekeeping for his master and caring for michael and cocky  all of which was prison for michael who had been used to the run of ships of coral beaches and plantations  but in the evenings sometimes accompanied a few steps in the rear by kwaque michael strolled out with steward  the multiplicity of mangods on the teeming sidewalks became a real bore to michael so that mangods in general underwent a sharp depreciation  but steward the particular god of his fealty and worship appreciated  amongst so many gods michael felt bewildered while stewards abrahamic bosom became more than ever the one sure haven where harshness and danger never troubled  mind your step is the last word and warning of twentiethcentury city life  michael was not slow to learn it as he conserved his own feet among the countless thousands of leathershod feet of men ever hurrying always unregarding of the existence and right of way of a lowly four legged irish terrier  the evening outings with steward invariably led from saloon to saloon where at long bars standing on sawdust floors or seated at tables men drank and talked  much of both did men do and also did steward do ere his daily sixquart stint accomplished he turned homeward for bed  many were the acquaintances he made and michael with him  coasting seamen and bay sailors they mostly were although there were many longshoremen and waterfront workmen among them  from one of these a scowschooner captain who plied up and down the bay and the san joaquin and sacramento rivers daughtry had the promise of being engaged as cook and sailor on the schooner howard  eighty tons of freight including deckload she carried and in all democracy captain jorgensen the cook and the two other sailors loaded and unloaded her at all hours and sailed her night and day on all times and tides one man steering while three slept and recuperated  it was time and double time and overtime beyond that but the feeding was generous and the wages ran from fortyfive to sixty dollars a month  sure you bet said captain jorgensen  this cookfeller hanson pretty quick i smash him up an fire him then you can come along    and the bowwow too  here he dropped a hearty wholesome hand of toil down to a caress of michaels head  thats one fine bowwow  a bowwow is good on a scow when all hands sleep alongside the dock or in an anchor watch  fire hanson now dag daughtry urged  but captain jorgensen shook his slow head slowly  first i smash him up  then smash him now and fire him daughtry persisted  there he is right now at the corner of the bar  no  he must give me reason  i got plenty of reason  but i want reason all hands can see  i want him make me smash him so that all hands say hurrah captain you done right  then you get the job daughtry  had captain jorgensen not been dilatory in his contemplated smashing and had not hanson delayed in giving sufficient provocation for a smashing michael would have accompanied steward upon the schooner howard and all michaels subsequent experiences would have been totally different from what they were destined to be  but destined they were by chance and by combinations of chance events over which michael had no control and of which he had no more awareness than had steward himself  at that period the subsequent stage career and nightmare of cruelty for michael was beyond any wildest forecast or apprehension  and as to forecasting dag daughtrys fate along with kwaque no maddest drugdream could have approximated it     chapter xvii   one night dag daughtry sat at a table in the saloon called the piledrivers home  he was in a parlous predicament  harder than ever had it been to secure odd jobs and he had reached the end of his savings  earlier in the evening he had had a telephone conference with the ancient mariner who had reported only progress with an exceptionally strong nibble that very day from a retired quack doctor  let me pawn my rings the ancient mariner had urged not for the first time over the telephone  no sir had been daughtrys reply  we need them in the business theyre stock in trade  theyre atmosphere  theyre what you call a figure of speech  ill do some thinking tonight an see you in the morning sir  hold on to them rings an dont be no more than casual in playin that doctor  make m come to you  its the only way  now youre all right an everythings hunkydory an the goose hangs high dont you worry sir  dag daughtry never fell down yet  but as he sat in the piledrivers home it looked as if his falldown was very near  in his pocket was precisely the roomrent for the following week the advance payment of which was already three days overdue and clamorously demanded by the hardfaced landlady  in the rooms with care was enough food with which to pinch through for another day  the ancient mariners modest hotel bill had not been paid for two weeksa prodigious sum under the circumstances being a firstclass hotel while the ancient mariner had no more than a couple of dollars in his pocket with which to make a sound like prosperity in the ears of the retired doctor who wanted to go atreasuring  most catastrophic of all however was the fact that dag daughtry was three quarts short of his daily allowance and did not dare break into the rent money which was all that stood between him and his family and the street  this was why he sat at the beer table with captain jorgensen who was just returned with a schoonerload of hay from the petaluma flats  he had already bought beer twice and evinced no further show of thirst  instead he was yawning from long hours of work and waking and looking at his watch  and daughtry was three quarts short  besides hanson had not yet been smashed so that the cookjob on the schooner still lay ahead an unknown distance in the future  in his desperation daughtry hit upon an idea with which to get another schooner of steam beer  he did not like steam beer but it was cheaper than lager  look here captain he said  you dont know how smart that killeny boy is  why he can count just like you and me  hoh rumbled captain jorgensen  i seen em do it in side shows  its all tricks  dogs an horses cant count  this dog can daughtry continued quietly  you cant fool m  i bet you right now i can order two beers loud so he can hear and notice and then whisper to the waiter to bring one an when the one comes killeny boyll raise a roar with the waiter  hoh  hoh  how much will you bet  the steward fingered a dime in his pocket  if killeny failed him it meant that the rentmoney would be broken in upon  but killeny couldnt and wouldnt fail him he reasoned as he answered  ill bet you the price of two beers  the waiter was summoned and when he had received his secret instructions michael was called over from where he lay at kwaques feet in a corner  when steward placed a chair for him at the table and invited him into it he began to key up  steward expected something of him wanted him to show off  and it was not because of the showing off that he was eager but because of his love for steward  love and service were one in the simple processes of michaels mind  just as he would have leaped into fire for stewards sake so would he now serve steward in any way steward desired  that was what love meant to him  it was all love meant to himservice  waiter steward called and when the waiter stood close at hand two beersdid you get that killeny  two beers  michael squirmed in his chair placed an impulsive paw on the table and impulsively flashed out his ribbon of tongue to stewards closebending face  he will remember daughtry told the scowschooner captain  not if we talk was the reply  now we will fool your bowwow  i will say that the job is yours when i smash hanson  and you will say it is for me to smash hanson now  and i will say hanson must give me reason first to smash him  and then we will argue like two fools with mouths full of much noise  are you ready  daughtry nodded and thereupon ensued a loudvoiced discussion that drew michaels earnest attention from one talker to the other  i got you captain jorgensen announced as he saw the waiter approaching with but a single schooner of beer  the bowwow has forgot if he ever remembered  he thinks you an me is fighting  the place in his mind for one beer and two is wiped out like a wave on the beach wipes out the writing in the sand  i guess he aint goin to forget arithmetic no matter how much noise you shouts daughtry argued aloud against his sinking spirits  an i aint goin to butt in he added hopefully  you just watch m for himself  the tall schoonerglass of beer was placed before the captain who laid a swift containing hand around it  and michael strung as a taut string knowing that something was expected of him on his toes to serve remembered his ancient lessons on the makambo vainly looked into the impassive face of steward for a sign then looked about and saw not two glasses but one glass  so well had he learned the difference between one and two that it came to himhow the profoundest psychologist can no more state than can he state what thought is in itselfthat there was one glass only when two glasses had been commanded  with an abrupt upspring his throat half harsh with anger he placed both forepaws on the table and barked at the waiter  captain jorgensen crashed his fist down  you win he roared  i pay for the beer waiter bring one more  michael looked to steward for verification and stewards hand on his head gave adequate reply  we try again said the captain very much awake and interested with the back of his hand wiping the beerfoam from his moustache  maybe he knows one an two  how about three  and four  just the same skipper  he counts up to five and knows more than five when it is more than five though he dont know the figures by name after five  oh hanson captain jorgensen bellowed across the barroom to the cook of the howard  hey you squarehead  come and have a drink  hanson came over and pulled up a chair  i pay for the drinks said the captain but you order daughtry  see now hanson this is a trick bowwow  he can count better than you  we are three  daughtry is ordering three beers  the bowwow hears three  i hold up two fingers like this to the waiter  he brings two  the bowwow raises hell with the waiter  you see  all of which came to pass michael blissfully unappeasable until the order was filled properly  he cant count was hansons conclusion  he sees one man without beer  thats all  he knows every man should ought to have a glass thats why he barks  better than that daughtry boasted  there are three of us  we will order four  then each man will have his glass but killeny will talk to the waiter just the same  true enough now thoroughly aware of the game michael made outcry to the waiter till the fourth glass was brought  by this time many men were about the table all wanting to buy beer and test michael  glory be dag daughtry solloquized  a funny world  thirsty one moment  the next moment theyd fair drown you in beer  several even wanted to buy michael offering ridiculous sums like fifteen and twenty dollars  i tell you what captain jorgensen muttered to daughtry whom he had drawn away into a corner  you give me that bowwow and ill smash hanson right now and you got the job right awaycome to work in the morning  into another corner the proprietor of the piledrivers home drew daughtry to whisper to him  you stick around here every night with that dog of yourn  it makes trade  ill give you free beer any time and fifty cents cash money a night  it was this proposition that started the big idea in daughtrys mind  as he told michael back in the room while kwaque was unlacing his shoes  its this way killeny  if youre worth fifty cents a night and free beer to that saloon keeper then youre worth that to me    and more my son more  cause hes lookin for a profit  thats why he sells beer instead of buyin it  an killeny you wont mind workin for me i know  we need the money  theres kwaque an mr greenleaf an cocky not even mentioning you an me an we eat an awful lot  an room rents hard to get an jobs is harder  what dye say son tomorrow night you an me hustle around an see how much coin we can gather  and michael seated on stewards knees eyes to eyes and nose to nose his jowls held in stewards hands wriggled and squirmed with delight flipping out his tongue and bobbing his tail in the air  whatever it was it was good for it was steward who spoke     chapter xviii   the grizzled ships steward and the roughcoated irish terrier quickly became conspicuous figures in the night life of the barbary coast of san francisco  daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing cocky along  thus when a waiter did not fetch the right number of glasses michael would remain quite still until cocky at a privy signal from steward standing on one leg with the free claw would clutch michaels neck and apparently talk into michaels ear  whereupon michael would look about the glasses on the table and begin his usual expostulation with the waiter  but it was when daughtry and michael first sang roll me down to rio together that the tenstrike was made  it occurred in a sailors dance hall on pacific street and all dancing stopped while the sailors clamoured for more of the singing dog  nor did the place lose money for no one left and the crowd increased to standing room as michael went through his repertoire of god save the king sweet bye and bye lead kindly light home sweet home and shenandoah  it meant more than free beer to daughtry for when he started to leave the proprietor of the place thrust three silver dollars into his hand and begged him to come around with the dog next night  for that daughtry demanded looking at the money as if it were contemptible  hastily the proprietor added two more dollars and daughtry promised  just the same killeny my son he told michael as they went to bed i think you an me are worth more than five dollars a turn  why the like of you has never been seen before  a real singing dog that can carry most any air with me and that can carry half a dozen by himself  an they say caruso gets a thousand a night  well you aint caruso but youre the dogcaruso of the entire world  son im goin to be your business manager  if we cant make a twentydollar goldpiece a nightsay son were goin to move into better quarters  an the old gent up at the hotel de bronx is goin to move into an outside room  an kwaques goin to get a real outfit of clothes  killeny my boy were goin to get so rich that if he cant snare a sucker well put up the cash ourselves n buy a schooner for m n send him out atreasure huntin on his own  well be the suckers eh just you an me an love to        the barbary coast of san francisco once the oldtime sailortown in the days when san francisco was reckoned the toughest port of the seven seas had evolved with the city until it depended for at least half of its earnings on the slumming parties that visited it and spent liberally  it was quite the custom after dinner for many of the better classes of society especially when entertaining curious easterners to spend an hour or several in motoring from dancehall to dancehall and cheap cabaret to cheap cabaret  in short the coast was as much a sightseeing place as was chinatown and the cliff house  it was not long before dag daughtry was getting his twenty dollars a night for two twentyminute turns and was declining more beer than a dozen men with thirsts equal to his could have accommodated  never had he been so prosperous nor can it be denied that michael enjoyed it enjoy it he did but principally for stewards sake  he was serving steward and so to serve was his highest hearts desire  in truth michael was the breadwinner for quite a family each member of which fared well  kwaque blossomed out resplendent in russetbrown shoes a derby hat and a gray suit with trousers immaculately creased also he became a devotee of the movingpicture shows spending as much as twenty and thirty cents a day and resolutely sitting out every repetition of programme  little time was required of him in caring for daughtry for they had come to eating in restaurants  not only had the ancient mariner moved into a more expensive outside room at the bronx but daughtry insisted on thrusting upon him more spending money so that on occasion he could invite a likely acquaintance to the theatre or a concert and bring him home in a taxi  we wont keep this up for ever killeny steward told michael  for just as long as it takes the old gent to land another bunch of goldpouched retrieversnouted treasurehunters and no longer  then its hey for the ocean blue my son an the roll of a good craft under our feet an smash of wet on the deck an a spout now an again of the scuppers  we got to go rollin down to rio as well as sing about it to a lot of cheap skates  they can take their rotten cities  the seas the life for usyou an me killeny son an the old gent an kwaque an cocky too  we aint made for city ways  it aint healthy  why son though you maybe wont believe it im losin my spring  the rubbers goin outa me  im kind o languid with all night in an nothin to do but sit around  it makes me fair sick at the thought of hearin the old gent say once again i think steward one of those prime cocktails would be just the thing before dinner  well take a little icemachine along next voyage an give m the best  an look at kwaque killeny my boy  this aint his climate  hes positively ailin  if he sits around them pictureshows much more hell develop the tb  for the good of his health an mine an yours an all of us we got to get up anchor pretty soon an hit out for the home of the trade winds that kiss you through an through with the salt an the life of the sea        in truth kwaque who never complained was ailing fast  a swelling slow and sensationless at first under his right armpit had become a mild and unceasing pain  no longer could he sleep a night through although he lay on his left side never less than twice and often three and four times the hurt of the swelling woke him  ah moy had he not long since been delivered back to china by the immigration authorities could have told him the meaning of that swelling just as he could have told dag daughtry the meaning of the increasing area of numbness between his eyes where the tiny vertical lionlines were cutting more conspicuously  also could he have told him what was wrong with the little finger on his left hand  daughtry had first diagnosed it as a sprain of a tendon  later he had decided it was chronic rheumatism brought on by the damp and foggy sun francisco climate  it was one of his reasons for desiring to get away again to sea where the tropic sun would warm the rheumatism out of him  as a steward daughtry had been accustomed to contact with men and women of the upper world  but for the first time in his life here in the underworld of san francisco in all equality he met such persons from above  nay more they were eager to meet him  they sought him  they fawned upon him for an invitation to sit at his table and buy beer for him in whatever garish cabaret michael was performing  they would have bought wine for him at enormous expense had he not stubbornly stuck to his beer  they were some of them for inviting him to their homesan bring the wonderful dog along for a singsong but daughtry proud of michael for being the cause of such invitations explained that the professional life was too arduous to permit of such diversions  to michael he explained that when they proffered a fee of fifty dollars the pair of them would come arunnin  among the host of acquaintances made in their cabaretlife two were destined very immediately to play important parts in the lives of daughtry and michael  the first a politician and a doctor by name emorywalter merritt emorywas several times at daughtrys table where michael sat with them on a chair according to custom  among other things in gratitude for such kindnesses from daughtry doctor emory gave his office card and begged for the privilege of treating free of charge either master or dog should they ever become sick  in daughtrys opinion dr walter merritt emory was a keen clever man undoubtedly able in his profession but passionately selfish as a hungry tiger  as he told him in the brutal candour he could afford under such changed conditions doc youre a wonder  anybody can see it with half an eye what you want you just go and get  nothingd stop you except      except  oh except that it was nailed down or locked up or had a policeman standing guard over it  id sure hate to have anything you wanted  well you have doctor assured him with a significant nod at michael on the chair between them  brrr daughtry shivered  you give me the creeps  if i thought you really meant it san francisco couldnt hold me two minutes  he meditated into his beerglass a moment then laughed with reassurance no man could get that dog away from me  you see id kill the man first  id just up an tell m as im tellin you now id kill m first  an hed believe me as youre believin me now  you know i mean it  sod he know i meant it  why that dog      in sheer inability to express the profundity of his emotion dag daughtry broke off the sentence and drowned it in his beerglass  of quite different type was the other person of destiny  harry del mar he called himself and harry del mar was the name that appeared on the programmes when he was doing orpheum time  although daughtry did not know it because del mar was laying off for a vacation the man did trainedanimal turns for a living  he too bought drinks at daughtrys table  young not over thirty dark of complexion with large longlashed brown eyes that he fondly believed were magnetic cherubic of lip and feature he belied all his appearance by talking business in direct business fashion  but you aint got the money to buy m daughtry replied when the other had increased his first offer of five hundred dollars for michael to a thousand  ive got the thousand if thats what you mean  no daughtry shook his head  i mean he aint for sale at any price besides what do you want m for  i like him del mar answered  why do i come to this joint  why does the crowd come here  why do men buy wine run horses sport actresses become priests or bookworms  because they like to  thats the answer we all do what we like when we can go after the thing we want whether we can get it or not  now i like your dog i want him  i want him a thousand dollars worth  see that big diamond on that womans hand over there  i guess she just liked it and wanted it and got it never mind the price  the price didnt mean as much to her as the diamond  now that dog of yours  dont like you dag daughtry broke in  which is strange  he likes most everybody without fussin about it  but he bristled at you from the first  no mand want a dog that dont like him  which isnt the question del mar stated quietly  i like him  as for him liking or not liking me thats my lookout and i guess i can attend to that all right  it seemed to daughtry that he glimpsed or sensed under the others unfaltering cherubicness of expression a steelness of cruelty that was abysmal in that it was of controlled intelligence  not in such terms did daughtry think his impression  at the most it was a feeling and feelings do not require words in order to be experienced or comprehended  theres an allnight bank the other went on  we can stroll over ill cash a cheque and in half an hour the cash will be in your hand  daughtry shook his head  even as a business proposition nothing doing he said  look you heres the dog earnin twenty dollars a night  say he works twentyfive days in the month  thats five hundred a month or six thousand a year now say thats five per cent because its easier to count it represents the interest on a capital value of one hundred an twenty thousanddollars  then well suppose expenses and salary for me is twenty thousand  that leaves the dog worth a hundred thousand  just to be fair cut it in halfa fiftythousand dog  and youre offerin a thousand for him  i suppose you think hell last for ever like so much land del mar smiled quietly  daughtry saw the point instantly  give m five years of workthats thirty thousand  give m one year of workits six thousand  an youre offerin me one thousand for six thousand  that aint no kind of businessfor me    an him  besides when he cant work any more an aint worth a cent hell be worth just a plumb million to me an if anybody offered it id raise the price     chapter xix   ill see you again harry del mar told daughtry at the end of his fourth conversation on the matter of michaels sale  wherein harry del mar was mistaken  he never saw daughtry again because daughtry saw doctor emory first  kwaques increasing restlessness at night due to the swelling under his right armpit had began to wake daughtry up  after several such experiences he had investigated and decided that kwaque was sufficiently sick to require a doctor  for which reason one morning at eleven taking kwaque along he called at walter merritt emorys office and waited his turn in the crowded receptionroom  i think hes got cancer doc daughtry said while kwaque was pulling off his shirt and undershirt  he never squealed you know never peeped  thats the way of niggers  i didnt find our till he got to wakin me up nights with his tossin about an groanin in his sleepthere  whatd you call it  cancer or tumourno two ways about it eh  but the quick eye of walter merritt emory had not missed in passing the twisted fingers of kwaques left hand  not only was his eye quick but it was a leper eye  a volunteer surgeon in the first days out in the philippines he had made a particular study of leprosy and had observed so many lepers that infallibly except in the incipient beginnings of the disease he could pick out a leper at a glance  from the twisted fingers which was the anaesthetic form produced by nervedisintegration to the corrugated lion forehead again anaesthetic his eyes flashed to the swelling under the right armpit and his brain diagnosed it as the tubercular form  just as swiftly flashed through his brain two thoughts the first the axiom whenever and wherever you find a leper look for the other leper the second the desired irish terrier who was owned by daughtry with whom kwaque had been long associated  and here all swiftness of eye flashing ceased on the part of walter merritt emory  he did not know how much if anything the steward knew about leprosy and he did not care to arouse any suspicions  casually drawing his watch to see the time he turned and addressed daughtry  i should say his blood is out of order  hes run down  hes not used to the recent life hes been living nor to the food  to make certain i shall examine for cancer and tumour although theres little chance of anything like that  and as he talked with just a waver for a moment his gaze lifted above daughtrys eyes to the area of forehead just above and between the eyes it was sufficient  his lepereye had seen the lion mark of the leper  youre run down yourself he continued smoothly  youre not up to snuff ill wager  eh  cant say that i am daughtry agreed  i guess i got to get back to the sea an the tropics and warm the rheumatics outa me  where queried doctor emory almost absently so well did he feign it as if apparently on the verge of returning to a closer examination of kwaques swelling  daughtry extended his left hand with a little wiggle of the little finger advertising the seat of the affliction  walter merritt emory saw with seeming careless look out from under carelessdrooping eyelids the little finger slightly swollen slightly twisted with a smooth almost shiny silkiness of skintexture  again in the course of turning to look at kwaque his eyes rested an instant on the lionlines of daughtrys brow  rheumatism is still the great mystery doctor emory said returning to daughtry as if deflected by the thought  its almost individual there are so many varieties of it  each man has a kind of his own  any numbness  daughtry laboriously wiggled his little finger  yes sir he answered  it aint as lively as it used to was  ah walter merritt emory murmured with a vastitude of confidence and assurance  please sit down in that chair there  maybe i wont be able to cure you but i promise you i can direct you to the best place to live for whats the matter with youmiss judson  and while the trainednurseapparelled young woman seated dag daughtry in the enamelled surgeons chair and leaned him back under direction and while doctor emory dipped his fingertips into the strongest antiseptic his office possessed behind doctor emorys eyes in the midst of his brain burned the image of a desired irish terrier who did turns in sailortown cabarets was roughcoated and answered to the full name of killeny boy  youve got rheumatism in more places than your little finger he assured daughtry  theres a touch right here ill wager on your forehead  one moment please  move if i hurt you otherwise sit still because i dont intend to hurt you  i merely want to see if my diagnosis is correctthere thats it  move when you feel anything  rheumatism has strange freakswatch this miss judson and ill wager this form of rheumatism is new to you  see  he does not resent  he thinks i have not begun yet      and as he talked steadily interestingly he was doing what dag daughtry never dreamed he was doing and what made kwaque looking on almost dream he was seeing because of the unrealness and impossibleness of it for with a large needle doctor emory was probing the dark spot in the midst of the vertical lionlines  nor did he merely probe the area thrusting into it from one side under the skin and parallel to it he buried the length of the needle from sight through the insensate infiltration  this kwaque beheld with bulging eyes for his master betrayed no sign that the thing was being done  why dont you begin dag daughtry questioned impatiently  besides my rheumatism dont count  its the niggerboys swelling  you need a course of treatment doctor emory assured him  rheumatism is a tough proposition  it should never be let grow chronic  ill fix up a course of treatment for you  now if youll get out of the chair well look at your black servant  but first before kwaque was leaned back doctor emory threw over the chair a sheet that smelled of having been roasted almost to the scorching point  as he was about to examine kwaque he looked with a slight start of recollection at his watch  when he saw the time he startled more and turned a reproachful face upon his assistant  miss judson he said coldly emphatic you have failed me  here it is twenty before twelve and you knew i was to confer with doctor hadley over that case at eleventhirty sharp  how he must be cursing me  you know how peevish he is  miss judson nodded with a perfect expression of contrition and humility as if she knew all about it although in reality she knew only all about her employer and had never heard till that moment of his engagement at eleventhirty  doctor hadleys just across the hall doctor emory explained to daughtry  it wont take me five minutes  he and i have a disagreement he has diagnosed the case as chronic appendicitis and wants to operate  i have diagnosed it as pyorrhea which has infected the stomach from the mouth and have suggested emetine treatment of the mouth as a cure for the stomach disorder  of course you dont understand but the point is that ive persuaded doctor hadley to bring in doctor granville who is a dentist and a pyorrhea expert  and theyre all waiting for me these ten minutes  i must run  ill return inside five minutes he called back as the door to the hall was closing upon himmiss judson please tell those people in the receptionroom to be patient  he did enter doctor hadleys office although no sufferer from pyorrhea or appendicitis awaited him  instead he used the telephone for two calls one to the president of the board of health the other to the chief of police  fortunately he caught both at their offices addressing them familiarly by their first names and talking to them most emphatically and confidentially  back in his own quarters he was patently elated  i told him so he assured miss judson but embracing daughtry in the happy confidence  doctor granville backed me up  straight pyorrhea of course  that knocks the operation  and right now theyre jolting his gums and the pussacs with emetine  whew  a fellow likes to be right  i deserve a smoke  do you mind mr daughtry  and while the steward shook his head doctor emory lighted a big havana and continued audibly to luxuriate in his fictitious triumph over the other doctor  as he talked he forgot to smoke and leaning quite casually against the chair with arrant carelessness allowed the live coal at the end of his cigar to rest against the tip of one of kwaques twisted fingers  a privy wink to miss judson who was the only one who observed his action warned her against anything that might happen  you know mr daughtry walter merritt emory went on enthusiastically while he held the stewards eyes with his and while all the time the live end of the cigar continued to rest against kwaques finger the older i get the more convinced i am that there are too many illadvised and hasty operations  still fire and flesh pressed together and a tiny spiral of smoke began to arise from kwaques fingerend that was different in colour from the smoke of a cigarend  now take that patient of doctor hadleys  ive saved him not merely the risk of an operation for appendicitis but the cost of it and the hospital expenses  i shall charge him nothing for what i did  hadleys charge will be merely nominal  doctor granville at the outside will cure his pyorrhea with emetine for no more than a paltry fifty dollars yes by george besides the risk to his life and the discomfort ive saved that man all told a cold thousand dollars to surgeon hospital and nurses  and while he talked on holding daughtrys eyes a smell of roast meat began to pervade the air  doctor emory smelled it eagerly  so did miss judson smell it but she had been warned and gave no notice  nor did she look at the juxtaposition of cigar and finger although she knew by the evidence of her nose that it still obtained  whats burning daughtry demanded suddenly sniffing the air and glancing around  pretty rotten cigar doctor emory observed having removed it from contact with kwaques finger and now examining it with critical disapproval  he held it close to his nose and his face portrayed disgust  i wont say cabbage leaves  ill merely say its something i dont know and dont care to know  thats the trouble  they get out a good new brand of cigar advertise it put the best of tobacco into it and when it has taken with the public put in inferior tobacco and ride the popularity of it  no more in mine thank you  this day i change my brand  so speaking he tossed the cigar into a cuspidor  and kwaque leaning back in the queerest chair in which he had ever sat was unaware that the end of his finger had been burned and roasted half an inch deep and merely wondered when the medicine doctor would cease talking and begin looking at the swelling that hurt his side under his arm  and for the first time in his life and for the ultimate time dag daughtry fell down  it was an irretrievable falldown  life in its freedom of come and go by heaving sea and reeling deck through the home of the tradewinds back and forth between the ports ceased there for him in walter merritt emorys office while the calmbrowed miss judson looked on and marvelled that a mans flesh should roast and the man wince not from the roasting of it  doctor emory continued to talk and tried a fresh cigar and despite the fact that his receptionroom was overflowing delivered not merely a long but a live and interesting dissertation on the subject of cigars and of the tobacco leaf and filler as grown and prepared for cigars in the tobaccofavoured regions of the earth  now as regards this swelling he was saying as he began a belated and distant examination of kwaques affliction i should say at a glance that it is neither tumour nor cancer nor is it even a boil  i should say      a knock at the private door into the hall made him straighten up with an eagerness that he did not attempt to mask  a nod to miss judson sent her to open the door and entered two policemen a police sergeant and a professionally whiskered person in a business suit with a carnation in his buttonhole  good morning doctor masters emory greeted the professional one and to the others howdy sergeant hello tim hello johnsonwhen did they shift you off the chinatown squad  and then continuing his suspended sentence walter merritt emory held on looking intently at kwaques swelling  i should say as i was saying that it is the finest ripest perforating ulcer of the bacillus leprae order that any san francisco doctor has had the honour of presenting to the board of health  leprosy exclaimed doctor masters  and all started at his pronouncement of the word  the sergeant and the two policemen shied away from kwaque miss judson with a smothered cry clapped her two hands over her heart and dag daughtry shocked but sceptical demanded  what are you givin us doc  stand still dont move walter merritt emory said peremptorily to daughtry  i want you to take notice he added to the others as he gently touched the liveend of his fresh cigar to the area of dark skin above and between the stewards eyes  dont move he commanded daughtry  wait a moment  i am not ready yet  and while daughtry waited perplexed confused wondering why doctor emory did not proceed the coal of fire burned his skin and flesh till the smoke of it was apparent to all as was the smell of it  with a sharp laugh of triumph doctor emory stepped back  well go ahead with what you was goin to do daughtry grumbled the rush of events too swift and too hidden for him to comprehend  an when youre done with that i just want you to explain what you said about leprosy an that niggerboy there  hes my boy an you cant pull anything like that off on him    or me  gentlemen you have seen doctor emory said  two undoubted cases of it master and man the man more advanced with the combination of both forms the master with only the anaesthetic formhe has a touch of it too on his little finger  take them away  i strongly advise doctor masters a thorough fumigation of the ambulance afterward  look here     dag daughtry began belligerently  doctor emory glanced warningly to doctor masters and doctor masters glanced authoritatively at the sergeant who glanced commandingly at his two policemen  but they did not spring upon daughtry  instead they backed farther away drew their clubs and glared intimidatingly at him more convincing than anything else to daughtry was the conduct of the policemen  they were manifestly afraid of contact with him  as he started forward they poked the ends of their extended clubs towards his ribs to ward him off  dont you come any closer one warned him flourishing his club with the advertisement of braining him  you stay right where you are until you get your orders  put on your shirt and stand over there alongside your master doctor emory commanded kwaque having suddenly elevated the chair and spilled him out on his feet on the floor  but what under the sun     daughtry began but was ignored by his quondam friend who was saying to doctor masters  the pesthouse has been vacant since that japanese died  i know the gang of cowards in your department so id advise you to give the dope to these here so that they can disinfect the premises when they go in  for the love of mike daughtry pleaded all of stunned belligerence gone from him in his state of stunned conviction that the dread disease possessed him  he touched his finger to his sensationless forehead then smelled it and recognized the burnt flesh he had not felt burning  for the love of mike dont be in such a rush  if ive got it ive got it but that aint no reason we cant deal with each other like white men give me two hours an ill get outa the city  an in twentyfour ill be outa the country  ill take ship  and continue to be a menace to the public health wherever you are doctor masters broke in already visioning a column in the evening papers with scareheads in which he would appear the hero the st george of san francisco standing with poised lance between the people and the dragon of leprosy  take them away said waiter merritt emory avoiding looking daughtry in the eyes  ready  march commanded the sergeant  the two policemen advanced on daughtry and kwaque with extended clubs  keep away an keep movin one of the policemen growled fiercely  an do what we say or get your head cracked  out you go now  out the door with you  better tell that coon to stick right alongside you  doc wont you let me talk a moment daughtry begged of emory  the time for talking is past was the reply  this is the time for segregationdoctor masters dont forget that ambulance when youre quit of the load  so the procession led by the boardofheath doctor and the sergeant and brought up in the rear by the policemen with their protectively extended clubs started through the doorway  whirling about on the threshold at the imminent risk of having his skull cracked dag daughtry called back  doc  my dog  you know m  ill get him for you doctor emory consented quickly  whats the address  room eightseven clay street the bowhead lodging house you know the place entrance just around the corner from the bowhead saloon  have m sent out to me wherever they put mewill you  certainly i will said doctor emory and youve got a cockatoo too  you bet cocky  send m both along please sir        my said miss judson that evening at dinner with a certain young interne of st josephs hospital  that doctor emory is a wizard  no wonder hes successful  think of it  two filthy lepers in our office to day  one was a coon  and he knew what was the matter the moment he laid eyes on them  hes a caution  when i tell you what he did to them with his cigar  and he was cute about it  he gave me the wink first  and they never dreamed what he was doing  he took his cigar and         chapter xx   the dog like the horse abases the base  being base waiter merritt emory was abased by his desire for the possession of michael  had there been no michael his conduct would have been quite different  he would have dealt with daughtry as daughtry had described as between white men he would have warned daughtry of his disease and enabled him to take ship to the south seas or to japan or to other countries where lepers are not segregated  this would have worked no hardship on those countries since such was their law and procedure while it would have enabled daughtry and kwaque to escape the hell of the san francisco pesthouse to which because of his baseness he condemned them for the rest of their lives  furthermore when the expense of the maintenance of armed guards over the pesthouse day and night throughout the years is considered walter merritt emory could have saved many thousands of dollars to the taxpayers of the city and county of san francisco which thousands of dollars had they been spent otherwise could have been diverted to the reduction of the notorious crowding in schoolrooms to purer milk for the babies of the poor or to an increase of breathingspace in the park system for the people of the stifling ghetto  but had walter merritt emory been thus considerate not only would daughtry and kwaque have sailed out and away over the sea but with them would have sailed michael  never was a receptionroomful of patients rushed through more expeditiously than was doctor emorys the moment the door had closed upon the two policemen who brought up daughtrys rear  and before he went to his late lunch doctor emory was away in his machine and down into the barbary coast to the door of the bowhead lodging house  on the way by virtue of his political affiliations he had been able to pick up a captain of detectives  the addition of the captain proved necessary for the landlady put up a stout argument against the taking of the dog of her lodger  but milliken captain of detectives was too well known to her and she yielded to the law of which he was the symbol and of which she was credulously ignorant  as michael started out of the room on the end of a rope a plaintive call of reminder came from the windowsill where perched a tiny snowwhite cockatoo  cocky he called  cocky  walter merritt emory glanced back and for no more than a moment hesitated  well send for the bird later he told the landlady who still mildly expostulating as she followed them downstairs failed to notice that the captain of the detectives had carelessly left the door to daughtrys rooms ajar        but walter merritt emory was not the only base one abased by desire of possession of michael  in a deep leather chair his feet resting in another deep leather chair at the indoor yacht club harry del mar yielded to the somniferous digestion of lunch which was for him breakfast as well and glanced through the first of the early editions of the afternoon papers  his eyes lighted on a big headline with a brief five lines under it  his feet were instantly drawn down off the chair and under him as he stood up erect upon them  on swift second thought he sat down again pressed the electric button and while waiting for the club steward reread the headline and the brief five lines  in a taxi and away heading for the barbary coast harry del mar saw visions that were golden  they took on the semblance of yellow twenty dollar gold pieces of yellowbacked paper bills of the government stamping of the united states of bank books and of rich coupons ripe for the clippingand all shot through the flashings of the form of a roughcoated irish terrier on a galaxy of brilliantlylighted stages mouth open nose upward to the drops singing ever singing as no dog had ever been known to sing in the world before        cocky himself was the first to discover that the door was ajar and was looking at it with speculation if by speculation may be described the mental processes of a bird in some mysterious way absorbing into its consciousness a fresh impression of its environment and preparing to act or not act according to which way the fresh impression modifies its conduct  humans do this very thing and some of them call it free will  cocky staring at the open door was in just the stage of determining whether or not he should more closely inspect that crack of exit to the wider world which inspection in turn would determine whether or not he should venture out through the crack when his eyes beheld the eyes of the second discoverer staring in  the eyes were bestial yellowgreen the pupils dilating and narrowing with sharp swiftness as they sought about among the lights and glooms of the room  cocky knew danger at the first glimpsedanger to the uttermost of violent death  yet cocky did nothing  no panic stirred his heart  motionless one eye only turned upon the crack he focused that one eye upon the head and eyes of the gaunt guttercat whose head had erupted into the crack like an apparition  alert dilating and contracting as swift as cautious and infinitely apprehensive the pupils vertically slitted in jet into the midmost of amazing opals of greenish yellow the eyes roved the room  they alighted on cocky  instantly the head portrayed that the cat had stiffened crouched and frozen  almost imperceptibly the eyes settled into a watching that was like to the stony stare of a sphinx across aching and eternal desert sands  the eyes were as if they had so stared for centuries and millenniums  no less frozen was cocky  he drew no film across his one eye that showed his head cocked sideways nor did the passion of apprehension that whelmed him manifest itself in the quiver of a single feather  both creatures were petrified into the mutual stare that is of the hunter and the hunted the preyer and the prey the meateater and the meat  it was a matter of long minutes that stare until the head in the doorway with a slight turn disappeared  could a bird sigh cocky would have sighed  but he made no movement as he listened to the slow dragging steps of a man go by and fade away down the hall  several minutes passed and just as abruptly the apparition reappearednot alone the head this time but the entire sinuous form as it glided into the room and came to rest in the middle of the floor  the eyes brooded on cocky and the entire body was still save for the long tail which lashed from one side to the other and back again in an abrupt angry but monotonous manner  never removing its eyes from cocky the cat advanced slowly until it paused not six feet away  only the tail lashed back and forth and only the eyes gleamed like jewels in the full light of the window they faced the vertical pupils contracting to scarcely perceptible black slits  and cocky who could not know death with the clearness of concept of a human nevertheless was not altogether unaware that the end of all things was terribly impending  as he watched the cat deliberately crouch for the spring cocky gallant mote of life that he was betrayed his one and forgivable panic  cocky  cocky he called plaintively to the blind insensate walls  it was his call to all the world and all powers and things and twolegged mencreatures and steward in particular and kwaque and michael  the burden of his call was it is i cocky  i am very small and very frail and this is a monster to destroy me and i love the light bright world and i want to live and to continue to live in the brightness and i am so very small and im a good little fellow with a good little heart and i cannot battle with this huge furry hungry thing that is going to devour me and i want help help help  i am cocky  everybody knows me  i am cocky  this and much more was contained in his two calls of cocky  cocky  and there was no answer from the blind walls from the hall outside nor from all the world and his moment of panic over cocky was his brave little self again  he sat motionless on the windowsill his head cocked to the side with one unwavering eye regarding on the floor so perilously near the eternal enemy of all his kind  the human quality of his voice had startled the guttercat causing her to forgo her spring as she flattened down her ears and bellied closer to the floor  and in the silence that followed a bluebottle fly buzzed rowdily against an adjacent windowpane with occasional loud bumps against the glass tokening that he too had his tragedy a prisoner pent by baffling transparency from the bright world that blazed so immediately beyond  nor was the guttercat without her ill and hurt of life  hunger hurt her and hurt her meagre breasts that should have been full for the seven feeble and mewing little ones replicas of her save that their eyes were not yet open and that they were grotesquely unsteady on their soft young legs  she remembered them by the hurt of her breasts and the prod of her instinct also she remembered them by vision so that by the subtle chemistry of her brain she could see them by way of the broken screen across the ventilator hole down into the cellar in the dark rubbishcorner under the stairway where she had stolen her lair and birthed her litter  and the vision of them and the hurt of her hunger stirred her afresh so that she gathered her body and measured the distance for the leap  but cocky was himself again  devil be damned  devil be damned he shouted his loudest and most belligerent as he ruffled like a bravo at the guttercat beneath him so that he sent her crouching with startlement lower to the floor her ears wilting rigidly flat and down her tail lashing her head turning about the room so that her eyes might penetrate its obscurest corners in quest of the human whose voice had so cried out  all of which the guttercat did despite the positive evidence of her senses that this human noise had proceeded from the white bird itself on the windowsill  the bottle fly bumped once again against its invisible prison wall in the silence that ensued  the guttercat prepared and sprang with sudden decision landing where cocky had perched the fraction of a second before  cocky had darted to the side but even as he darted and as the cat landed on the sill the cats paw flashed out sidewise and cocky leaped straight up beating the air with his wings so little used to flying  the guttercat reared on her hindlegs smote upward with one paw as a child might strike with its hat at a butterfly  but there was weight in the cats paw and the claws of it were outspread like so many hooks  struck in midair a trifle of a flying machine all its delicate gears tangled and disrupted cocky fell to the floor in a shower of white feathers which like snowflakes eddied slowly down after and after the plummetlike descent of the cat so that some of them came to rest on her back startling her tense nerves with their gentle impact and making her crouch closer while she shot a swift glance around and overhead for any danger that might threaten     chapter xxi   harry del mar found only a few white feathers on the floor of dag daughtrys room in the bowhead lodging house and from the landlady learned what had happened to michael  the first thing harry del mar did still retaining his taxi was to locate the residence of doctor emory and make sure that michael was confined in an outhouse in the back yard  next he engaged passage on the steamship umatilla sailing for seattle and puget sound ports at daylight  and next he packed his luggage and paid his bills  in the meantime a wordy war was occurring in walter merritt emorys office  the mans yelling his head off doctor masters was contending  the police had to rap him with their clubs in the ambulance  he was violent he wanted his dog  it cant be done  its too raw  you cant steal his dog this way  hell make a howl in the papers  huh quoth walter merritt emory  id like to see a reporter with backbone enough to go within talking distance of a leper in the pesthouse  and id like to see the editor who wouldnt send a pesthouse letter granting itd been smuggled past the guards out to be burned the very second he became aware of its source  dont you worry doc  there wont be any noise in the papers  but leprosy  public health  the dog has been exposed to his master the dog itself is a peripatetic source of infection  contagion is the better and more technical word doc walter merritt emory soothed with the sting of superior knowledge  contagion then doctor masters took him up  the public must be considered  it must not run the risk of being infected  of contracting the contagion the other corrected smoothly  call it what you will  the public  poppycock said walter merritt emory  what you dont know about leprosy and what the rest of the board of health doesnt know about leprosy would fill more books than have been compiled by the men who have expertly studied the disease  the one thing they have eternally tried and are eternally trying is to inoculate one animal outside man with the leprosy that is peculiar to man  horses rabbits rats donkeys monkeys mice and dogsheavens they have tried it on them all tens of thousands of times and a hundred thousand times ten thousand times and never a successful inoculation  they have never succeeded in inoculating it on one man from another  herelet me show you  and from his shelves waiter merritt emory began pulling down his authorities  amazing    most interesting     doctor masters continued to emit from time to time as he followed the expert guidance of the other through the books  i never dreamed    the amount of work they have done is astounding      but he said in conclusion there is no convincing a layman of the matter contained on your shelves  nor can i so convince my public  nor will i try to  besides the man is consigned to the living death of life long imprisonment in the pesthouse  you know the beastly hole it is  he loves the dog  hes mad over it  let him have it  i tell you its rotten unfair and cruel and i wont stand for it  yes you will walter merritt emory assured him coolly  and ill tell you why  he told him  he said things that no doctor should say to another but which a politician may well say and has often said to another politicianthings which cannot bear repeating if for no other reason because they are too humiliating and too little conducive to pride for the average american citizen to know things of the inside secret governments of imperial municipalities which the average american citizen voting free as a king at the polls fondly thinks he manages things which are on rare occasion partly unburied and promptly reburied in the tomes of reports of lexow committees and federal commissions        and walter merritt emory won his desire of michael against doctor masters had his wife dine with him at jules that evening and took her to see margaret anglin in celebration of the victory returned home at one in the morning in his pyjamas went out to take a last look at michael and found no michael        the pesthouse of san francisco as is naturally the case with pesthouses in all american cities was situated on the bleakest remotest forlornest cheapest space of land owned by the city  poorly protected from the pacific ocean chill winds and dense fogbanks whistled and swirled sadly across the sanddunes  picnicking parties never came there nor did small boys hunting birds nests or playing at being wild indians  the only class of frequenters was the suicides who sad of life sought the saddest landscape as a fitting scene in which to end  and because they so ended they never repeated their visits  the outlook from the windows was not inspiriting  a quarter of a mile in either direction looking out along the shallow canyon of the sandhills dag daughtry could see the sentryboxes of the guards themselves armed and more prone to kill than to lay hands on any escaping pestman much less persuavively discuss with him the advisability of his return to the prison house  on the opposing sides of the prospect from the windows of the four walls of the pesthouse were trees  eucalyptus they were but not the royal monarchs that their brothers are in native habitats  poorly planted by politics illy attended by politics decimated and many times repeatedly decimated by the hostile forces of their environment a straggling corporals guard of survivors they thrust their branches twisted and distorted as if writhing in agony into the air  scrub of growth they were expending the major portion of their meagre nourishment in their roots that crawled seaward through the insufficient sand for anchorage against the prevailing gales  not even so far as the sentryboxes were daughtry and kwaque permitted to stroll  a hundred yards inside was the deadline  here the guards came hastily to deposit foodsupplies medicines and written doctors instructions retreating as hastily as they came  here also was a blackboard upon which daughtry was instructed to chalk up his needs and requests in letters of such size that they could be read from a distance and on this board for many days he wrote not demands for beer although the sixquart daily custom had been broken sharply off but demands like     where is my dog     he is an irish terrier     he is roughcoated     his name is killeny boy     i want my dog     i want to talk to doc emory     tell doc emory to write to me about my dog  one day dag daughtry wrote     if i dont get my dog i will kill doc emory  whereupon the newspapers informed the public that the sad case of the two lepers at the pesthouse had become tragic because the white one had gone insane  publicspirited citizens wrote to the papers declaiming against the maintenance of such a danger to the community and demanding that the united states government build a national leprosarium on some remote island or isolated mountain peak  but this tiny ripple of interest faded out in seventytwo hours and the reportercubs proceeded variously to interest the public in the alaskan husky dog that was half a bear in the question whether or not crispi angelotti was guilty of having cut the carcass of giuseppe bartholdi into small portions and thrown it into the bay in a grainsack off fishermans wharf and in the overt designs of japan upon hawaii the philippines and the pacific coast of north america  and outside of imprisonment nothing happened of interest to dag daughtry and kwaque at the pesthouse until one night in the late fall  a gale was not merely brewing  it was coming on to blow  because in a basket of fruit stated to have been sent by the young ladies of miss footes seminary daughtry had read a note artfully concealed in the heart of an apple telling him on the forthcoming friday night to keep a light burning in his window  daughtry received a visitor at five in the morning  it was charles stough greenleaf the ancient mariner himself  having wallowed for two hours through the deep sand of the eucalyptus forest he fell exhausted against the penthouse door  when daughtry opened it the ancient one blew in upon him along with a gusty wet splatter of the freshening gale  daughtry caught him first and supported him toward a chair  but remembering his own affliction he released the old man so abruptly as to drop him violently into the chair  my word sir said daughtry  you must a ben havin a time of ithere you fella kwaque this fella wringin wet  you fella take m off shoe stop along him  but before kwaque immediately kneeling could touch hand to the shoelaces daughtry remembering that kwaque was likewise unclean had thrust him away  my word i dont know what to do daughtry murmured staring about helplessly as he realised that it was a leperhouse that the very chair in which the old man sat was a leperchair that the very floor on which his exhausted feet rested was a leperfloor  im glad to see you most exceeding glad the ancient mariner panted extending his hand in greeting  dag daughtry avoided it  how goes the treasurehunting he queried lightly  any prospects in sight  the ancient mariner nodded and with returning breath at first whispering gasped out  were all cleared to sail on the first of the ebb at seven this morning shes out in the stream now a tidy bit of a schooner the bethlehem with good lines and hull and large cabin accommodations  she used to be in the tahiti trade before the steamers ran her out  provisions are good  everything is most excellent  i saw to that  i cannot say i like the captain  ive seen his type before  a splendid seaman i am certain but a bully hayes grown old  a natural born pirate a very wicked old man indeed  nor is the backer any better  he is middleaged has a bad record and is not in any sense of the word a gentleman but he has plenty of moneymade it first in california oil then grubstaked a prospector in british columbia cheated him out of his share of the big lode he discovered and doubled his own wealth half a dozen times over  a very undesirable unlikeable sort of a man  but he believes in luck and is confident that hell make at least fifty millions out of our adventure and cheat me out of my share  hes as much a pirate as is the captain hes engaged  mr greenleaf i congratulate you sir daughtry said  and you have touched me sir touched me to the heart coming all the way out here on such a night and running such risks just to say goodbye to poor dag daughtry who always meant somewhat well but had bad luck  but while he talked so heartily daughtry saw in a resplendent visioning all the freedom of a schooner in the great south seas and felt his heart sink in realisation that remained for him only the pest house the sanddunes and the sad eucalyptus trees  the ancient mariner sat stiffly upright  sir you have hurt me  you have hurt me to the heart  no offence sir no offence daughtry stammered in apology although he wondered in what way he could have hurt the old gentlemans feelings  you are my friend sir the other went on gravely censorious  i am your friend sir  and you give me to understand that you think i have come out here to this hellhole to say goodbye  i came out here to get you sir and your nigger sir  the schooner is waiting for you  all is arranged  you are signed on the articles before the shipping commissioner  both of you  signed on yesterday by proxies i arranged for myself  one was a barbadoes nigger  i got him and the white man out of a sailors boardinghouse on commercial street and paid them five dollars each to appear before the commissioner and sign on  but my god mr greenleaf you dont seem to grasp it that he and i are lepers  almost with a galvanic spring the ancient mariner was out of the chair and on his feet the anger of age and of a generous soul in his face as he cried  my god sir what you dont seem to grasp is that you are my friend and that i am your friend  abruptly still under the pressure of his wrath he thrust out his hand  steward daughtry  mr daughtry friend sir or whatever i may name you this is no fairystory of the open boat the crossbearings unnamable and the treasure a fathom under the sand  this is real  i have a heart  that sirhere he waved his extended hand under daughtrys noseis my hand  there is only one thing you may do must do right now  you must take that hand in your hand and shake it with your heart in your hand as mine is in my hand  but    but    daughtry faltered  if you dont then i shall not depart from this place  i shall remain here die here  i know you are a leper  you cant tell me anything about that  theres my hand  are you going to take it  my heart is there in the palm of it in the pulse in every fingerend of it  if you dont take it i warn you ill sit right down here in this chair and die i want you to understand i am a man sir a gentleman  i am a friend a comrade  i am no poltroon of the flesh  i live in my heart and in my head sirnot in this feeble carcass i cursorily inhabit  take that hand  i want to talk with you afterward  dag daughtry extended his hand hesitantly but the ancient mariner seized it and pressed it so fiercely with his agelean fingers as to hurt  now we can talk he said  i have thought the whole matter over  we sail on the bethlehem  when the wicked man discovers that he can never get a penny of my fabulous treasure we will leave him  he will be glad to be quit of us  we you and i and your nigger will go ashore in the marquesas  lepers roam about free there  there are no regulations  i have seen them  we will be free  the land is a paradise  and you and i will set up housekeeping  a thatched hutno more is needed  the work is trifling  the freedom of beach and sea and mountain will be ours  for you there will be sailing swimming fishing hunting  there are mountain goats wild chickens and wild cattle  bananas and plantains will ripen over our headsavocados and custard apples also  the red peppers grow by the door and there will be fowls and the eggs of fowls kwaque shall do the cooking  and there will be beer  i have long noted your thirst unquenchable  there will be beer six quarts of it a day and more more  quick  we must start now  i am sorry to tell you that i have vainly sought your dog  i have even paid detectives who were robbers  doctor emory stole killeny boy from you but within a dozen hours he was stolen from doctor emory  i have left no stone unturned  killeny boy is gone as we shall be gone from this detestable hole of a city  i have a machine waiting  the driver is paid well  also i have promised to kill him if he defaults on me  it bears just a bit north of east over the sandhill on the road that runs along the other side of the funny forest    that is right  we will start now  we can discuss afterward  look  daylight is beginning to break  the guards must not see us      out into the storm they passed kwaque with a heart wild with gladness bringing up the rear  at the beginning daughtry strove to walk aloof but in a trice in the first heavy gust that threatened to whisk the frail old man away dag daughtrys hand was grasping the others arm his own weight behind and under supporting and impelling forward and up the hill through the heavy sand  thank you steward thank you my friend the ancient mariner murmured in the first lull between the gusts     chapter xxii   not altogether unwillingly in the darkness of night despite that he disliked the man did michael go with harry del mar  like a burglar the man came with infinite caution of silence to the outhouse in doctor emorys back yard where michael was a prisoner  del mar knew the theatre too well to venture any hackneyed melodramatic effect such as an electric torch  he felt his way in the darkness to the door of the outhouse unlatched it and entered softly feeling with his hands for the wire haired coat  and michael a mandog and a liondog in all the stuff of him bristled at the instant of intrusion but made no outcry  instead he smelled out the intruder and recognised him  disliking the man nevertheless he permitted the tying of the rope around his neck and silently followed him out to the sidewalk down to the corner and into the waiting taxi  his reasoningunless reason be denied himwas simple  this man he had met more than once in the company of steward  amity had existed between him and steward for they had sat at table and drunk together steward was lost  michael knew not where to find him and was himself a prisoner in the back yard of a strange place  what had once happened could again happen  it had happened that steward del mar and michael had sat at table together on divers occasions  it was probable that such a combination would happen again was going to happen now and once more in the brightlighted cabaret he would sit on a chair del mar on one side and on the other side beloved steward with a glass of beer before himall of which might be called leaping to a conclusion for conclusion there was and upon the conclusion michael acted  now michael could not reason to this conclusion nor think to this conclusion in words  amity as an instance was no word in his consciousness  whether or not he thought to the conclusion in swiftrelated images and pictures and swiftwelded composites of images and pictures is a problem that still waits human solution  the point is he did think  if this be denied him then must he have acted wholly by instinctwhich would seem more marvellous on the face of it than if in dim ways he had performed a vague thoughtprocess  however into the taxi and away through the maze of san franciscos streets michael lay alertly on the floor near del mars feet making no overtures of friendliness by the same token making no demonstration of the repulsion of the mans personality engendered in him  for harry del mar who was base and who had been further abased by his moneymaking desire for the possession of michael had had his baseness sensed by michael from the beginning  that first meeting in the barbary coast cabaret michael had bristled at him and stiffened belligerently when he laid his hand on michaels head  nor had michael thought about the man at all much less attempted any analysis of him  something had been wrong with that handthe perfunctory way in which it had touched him under a show of heartiness that could well deceive the onlooker  the feel of it had not been right  there had been no warmth in it no heart no communication of genuine good approach from the brain and the soul of the man of which it was the telegraphic tentacle and transmitter in short the message or feel had not been a good message or feel and michael had bristled and stiffened without thinking but by mere knowing which is what men call intuition  electric lights a shedcovered wharf mountains of luggage and freight the noisy toil of longshoremen and sailors the staccato snorts of donkey engines and the whining sheaves as running lines ran through the blocks a crowd of whitecoated stewards carrying handbaggage the quartermaster at the gangway foot the gangway sloping steeply up to the umatillas promenade deck more quartermasters and goldlaced ships officers at the head of the gangway and more crowd and confusion blocking the narrow deckthus michael knew beyond all peradventure that he had come back to the sea and its ships where he had first met steward where he had been always with steward save for the recent nightmare period in the great city  nor was there absent from the flashing visions of his consciousness the images and memories of kwaque and cocky  whining eagerly he strained at the leash risking his tender toes among the many inconsiderate restless leathershod feet of the humans as he quested and scented for cocky and kwaque and most of all for steward  michael accepted his disappointment in not immediately meeting them for from the dawn of consciousness the limitations and restrictions of dogs in relation to humans had been hammered into him in the form of concepts of patience  the patience of waiting when he wanted to go home and when steward continued to sit at table and talk and drink beer was his as was the patience of the rope around the neck the fence too high to scale the narrowedwalled room with the closed door which he could never unlatch but which humans unlatched so easily  so that he permitted himself to be led away by the ships butcher who on the umatilla had the charge of all dog passengers  immured in a tiny betweendecks cubby which was filled mostly with boxes and bales tied as well by the rope around his neck he waited from moment to moment for the door to open and admit realised in the flesh the resplendent vision of steward which blazed through the totality of his consciousness  instead although michael did not guess it then and only later divined it as a vague manifestation of power on the part of del mar the well tipped ships butcher opened the door untied him and turned him over to the welltipped stateroom steward who led him to del mars stateroom  up to the last michael was convinced that he was being led to steward instead in the stateroom he found only del mar  no steward might be described as michaels thought but by patience as his mood and key might be described his acceptance of further delay in meeting up with his god his best beloved his steward who was his own human god amidst the multitude of human gods he was encountering  michael wagged his tail flattened his ears even his crinkled ear a trifle and smiled all in a casual way of recognition smelled out the room to make doubly sure that there was no scent of steward and lay down on the floor  when del mar spoke to him he looked up and gazed at him  now my boy times have changed del mar addressed him in cold brittle tones  im going to make an actor out of you and teach you whats what  first of all come here    come here  michael obeyed without haste without lagging and patently without eagerness  youll get over that my lad and put pep into your motions when i talk to you del mar assured him and the very manner of his utterance was a threat that michael could not fail to recognise  now well just see if i can pull off the trick  you listen to me and sing like you did for that leper guy  drawing a harmonica from his vest pocket he put it to his lips and began to play marching through georgia  sit down he commanded  again michael obeyed although all that was michael was in protest  he quivered as the shrillsweet strains from the silver reeds ran through him  all his throat and chest was in the impulse to sing but he mastered it for he did not care to sing for this man  all he wanted of him was steward  oh youre stubborn eh del mar sneered at him  the matter with you is youre thoroughbred  well my boy it just happens i know your kind and i reckon i can make you get busy and work for me just as much as you did for that other guy  now get busy  he shifted the tune on into georgia camp meeting  but michael was obdurate  not until the melting strains of old kentucky home poured through him did he lose his selfcontrol and lift his mellowthroated howl that was the call for the lost pack of the ancient millenniums under the prodding hypnosis of this music he could not but yearn and burn for the vague forgotten life of the pack when the world was young and the pack was the pack ere it was lost for ever through the endless centuries of domestication  ah ha del mar chuckled coldly unaware of the profound history and vast past he evoked by his silver reeds  a loud knock on the partition wall warned him that some sleepy passenger was objecting  that will do he said sharply taking the harmonica from his lips  and michael ceased and hated him  i guess ive got your number all right and you neednt think youre going to sleep here scratching fleas and disturbing my sleep  he pressed the callbutton and when his roomsteward answered turned michael over to him to be taken down below and tied up in the crowded cubbyhole        during the several days and nights on the umatilla michael learned much of what manner of man harry del mar was  almost might it be said he learned del mars pedigree without knowing anything of his history for instance he did not know that del mars real name was percival grunsky and that at grammar school he had been called brownie by the girls and blackie by the boys  no more did he know that he had gone from halfwaythrough grammar school directly into the industrial reform school nor that after serving two years he had been paroled out by harris collins who made a living and an excellent one by training animals for the stage  much less could he know the training that for six years del mar as assistant had been taught to give the animals and thereby had received for himself  what michael did know was that del mar had no pedigree and was a scrub as compared with thoroughbreds such as steward captain kellar and mister haggin of meringe  and he learned it swiftly and simply  in the day time fetched by a steward michael would be brought on deck to del mar who was always surrounded by effusive young ladies and matrons who lavished caresses and endearments upon michael  this he stood although much bored but what irked him almost beyond standing were the feigned caresses and endearments del mar lavished on him  he knew the coldblooded insincerity of them for at night when he was brought to del mars room he heard only the cold brittle tones sensed only the threat and the menace of the others personality felt when touched by the others hand only a stiffness and sharpness of contact that was like to so much steel or wood in so far as all subtle tenderness of heart and spirit was absent  this man was twofaced twomannered  no thoroughbred was anything but singlefaced and singlemannered  a thoroughbred hotblooded as it might be was always sincere  but in this scrub was no sincerity only a positive insincerity  a thoroughbred had passion because of its hot blood but this scrub had no passion  its blood was cold as its deliberateness and it did nothing save deliberately  these things he did not think  he merely realized them as any creature realizes itself in liking and in not liking  to cap it all the last night on board michael lost his thoroughbred temper with this man who had no temper  it came to a fight  and michael had no chance  he raged royally and fought royally leaping to the attack after being knocked over twice by openhanded blows under his ear  quick as michael was slashing south sea niggers by virtue of his quickness and cleverness he could not touch his teeth to the flesh of this man who had been trained for six years with animals by harris collins  so that when he leaped openmouthed for the bite del mars right hand shot out gripped his underjaw as he was in the air and flipped him over in a somersaulting fall to the floor on his back  once again he leapt openmouthed to the attack and was filliped to the floor so hard that almost the last particle of breath was knocked out of him the next leap was nearly his last  he was clutched by the throat  two thumbs pressed into his neck on either side of the windpipe directly on the carotid arteries shutting off the blood to his brain and giving him most exquisite agony at the same time rendering him unconscious far more swiftly than the swiftest anaesthetic  darkness thrust itself upon him and quivering on the floor glimmeringly he came back to the light of the room and to the man who was casually touching a match to a cigarette and cautiously keeping an observant eye on him  come on del mar challenged  i know your kind  you cant get my goat and maybe i cant get yours entirely but i can keep you under my thumb to work for me  come on you  and michael came  being a thoroughbred despite that he knew he was beaten by this twolegged thing which was not warm human but was so alien and hard that he might as well attack the wall of a room with his teeth or a treetrunk or a cliff of rock michael leapt barefanged for the throat  and all that he leapt against was training formula  the experience was repeated  his throat was gripped the thumbs shut off the blood from his brain and darkness smote him  had he been more than a normal thoroughbred dog he would have continued to assail his impregnable enemy until he burst his heart or fell in a fit  but he was normal  here was something unassailable adamantine  as little might he win victory from it as from the cementpaved sidewalk of a city  the thing was a devil with the hardness and coldness the wickedness and wisdom of a devil  it was as bad as steward was good  both were two legged  both were gods  but this one was an evil god  he did not reason all this nor any of it  yet transmuted into human terms of thought and understanding it adequately describes the fulness of his state of mind toward del mar  had michael been entangled in a fight with a warm god he could have raged and battled blindly inflicting and receiving hurt in the chaos of conflict as such a god being warm would have likewise received and given hurt being only a fleshandblood living breathing entity after all  but this twolegged goddevil did not rage blindly and was incapable of passional heat  he was like so much cunning massive steel machinery and he did what michael could never dream he didand for that matter which few humans do and which all animal trainers do he kept one thought ahead of michaels thought all the time and therefore was able to have ready one action always in anticipation of michaels next action  this was the training he had received from harris collins who withal he was a sentimental and doting husband and father was the archdevil when it came to animals other than human ones and who reigned in an animal hell which he had created and made lucrative        michael went ashore in seattle all eagerness straining at his leash until he choked and coughed and was coldly cursed by del mar  for michael was mastered by his expectation that he would meet steward and he looked for him around the first corner and around all corners with undiminished zeal  but amongst the multitudes of men there was no steward  instead down in the basement of the new washington hotel where electric lights burned always under the care of the baggage porter he was tied securely by the neck in the midst of alpine ranges of trunks which were for ever being heaped up sought over taken down carried away or added to  three days of this dolorous existence he passed  the porters made friends with him and offered him prodigious quantities of cooked meats from the leavings of the diningroom  michael was too disappointed and griefstricken over steward to overeat himself while del mar accompanied by the manager of the hotel raised a great row with the porters for violating the feeding instructions  that guys no good said the head porter to assistant when del mar had departed  hes greasy  i never liked greasy brunettes anyway  my wifes a brunette but thank the lord she aint greasy  sure agreed the assistant  i know his kind  why if youd stick a knife into him he wouldnt bleed blood  itd be straight liquid lard  whereupon the pair of them immediately presented michael with vaster quantities of meat which he could not eat because the desire for steward was too much with him  in the meantime del mar sent off two telegrams to new york the first to harris collins animal training school where his troupe of dogs was boarding through his vacation     sell my dogs  you know what they can do and what they are worth  am    done with them  deduct the board and hold the balance for me until i    see you  i have the limit here of a dog  every turn i ever pulled is    put in the shade by this one  hes a ten strike  wait till you see    him  the second to his booking agent     get busy  book me over the best  talk it up  i have the turn  a    winner  nothing like it  dont talk up top price but way over top    price  prepare them for the dog when i give them the chance for the    once over  you know me  i am giving it straight  this will head the    bill anywhere all the time     chapter xxiii   came the crate  because del mar brought it into the baggageroom michael was suspicious of it  a minute later his suspicion was justified  del mar invited him to go into the crate and he declined with a quick deft clutch on the collar at the back of his neck del mar jerked him off his footing and thrust him in or partly in rather because he had managed to get a hold on the edge of the crate with his two forepaws  the animal trainer wasted no time  he brought the clenched fist of his free hand down in two blows rattat on michaels paws  and michael at the pain relaxed both holds  the next instant he was thrust inside snarling his indignation and rage as he vainly flung himself at the open bars while del mar was locking the stout door  next the crate was carried out to an express wagon and loaded in along with a number of trunks  del mar had disappeared the moment he had locked the door and the two men in the wagon which was now bouncing along over the cobblestones were strangers  there was just room in the crate for michael to stand upright although he could not lift his head above the level of his shoulders  and so standing his head pressed against the top a rut in the road jolting the wagon and its contents caused his head to bump violently  the crate was not quite so long as michael so that he was compelled to stand with the end of his nose pressing against the end of the crate  an automobile darting out from a crossstreet caused the driver of the wagon to pull in abruptly and apply the brake  with the crate thus suddenly arrested michaels body was precipitated forward  there was no brake to stop him unless the soft end of his nose be considered the brake for it was his nose that brought his body to rest inside the crate  he tried lying down confined as the space was and made out better although his lips were cut and bleeding by having been forced so sharply against his teeth  but the worst was to come  one of his forepaws slipped out through the slats or bars and rested on the bottom of the wagon where the trunks were squeaking screeching and jigging  a rut in the roadway made the nearest trunk tilt one edge in the air and shift position so that when it tilted back again it rested on michaels paw the unexpectedness of the crushing hurt of it caused him to yelp and at the same time instinctively and spasmodically to pull back with all his strength  this wrenched his shoulder and added to the agony of the imprisoned foot  and blind fear descended upon michael the fear that is implanted in all animals and in man himselfthe fear of the trap  utterly beside himself though he no longer yelped he flung himself madly about straining the tendons and muscles of his shoulder and leg and further and severely injuring the crushed foot  he even attacked the bars with his teeth in his agony to get at the monster thing outside that had laid hold of him and would not let him go  another rut saved him however tilting the trunk just sufficiently to enable his violent struggling to drag the foot clear  at the railroad station the crate was handled not with deliberate roughness but with such carelessness that it halfslipped out of a baggagemans hands capsized sidewise and was caught when it was past the mans knees but before it struck the cement floor  but michael sliding helplessly down the perpendicular bottom of the crate fetched up with his full weight on the injured paw  huh said del mar a little later to michael having strolled down the platform to where the crate was piled on a truck with other baggage destined for the train  got your foot smashed  well itll teach you a lesson to keep your feet inside  that claw is a goner one of the station baggagemen said straightening up from an examination of michael through the bars  del mar bent to a closer scrutiny  sos the whole toe he said drawing his pocketknife and opening a blade  ill fix it in half a jiffy if youll lend a hand  he unlocked the box and dipped michael out with the customary strangle hold on the neck  he squirmed and struggled dabbing at the air with the injured as well as the uninjured forepaw and increasing his pain  you hold the leg del mar commanded  hes safe with that grip  it wont take a second  nor did it take longer  and michael back in the box and raging was one toe short of the number which he had brought into the world  the blood ran freely from the crude but effective surgery and he lay and licked the wound and was depressed with apprehension of he knew not what terrible fate awaited him and was close at hand  never in his experience of men had he been so treated while the confinement of the box was maddening with its suggestion of the trap  trapped he was and helpless and the ultimate evil of life had happened to steward who had evidently been swallowed up by the nothingness which had swallowed up meringe the eugenie the solomon islands the makambo australia and the mary turner  suddenly from a distance came a bedlam of noise that made michael prick up his ears and bristle with premonition of fresh disaster  it was a confused yelping howling and barking of many dogs  holy smokeits them damned acting dogs growled the baggageman to his mate  there ought to be a law against dogacts  it aint decent  its petersons troupe said the other  i was on when they come in last week  one of em was dead in his box and from what i could see of him it looked mighty like hed had the tar knocked outa him  got a wollopin from peterson most likely in the last town and then was shipped along with the bunch and left to die in the baggage car  the bedlam increased as the animals were transferred from the wagon to a platform truck and when the truck rolled up and stopped alongside michaels he made out that it was piled high with crated dogs  in truth there were thirtyfive dogs of every sort of breed and mostly mongrel and that they were far from happy was attested by their actions  some howled some whimpered others growled and raged at one another through the slots and many maintained a silence of misery  several licked and nursed bruised feet  smaller dogs that did not fight much were crammed two or more into single crates  half a dozen greyhounds were crammed into larger crates that were anything save large enough  thems the highjumpers said the first baggageman  an look at the way theyre packed  peterson aint going to pay any more excess baggage than he has to  not half room enough for them to stand up  it must be hell for them from the time they leave one town till they arrive at the next  but what the baggageman did not know was that in the towns the hell was not mitigated that the dogs were still confined in their toonarrow prisons that in fact they were lifeprisoners  rarely except for their acts were they taken out from their cages  from a business standpoint good care did not pay  since mongrel dogs were cheap it was cheaper to replace them when they died than so to care for them as to keep them from dying  what the baggageman did not know and what peterson did know was that of these thirtyfive dogs not one was a surviving original of the troupe when it first started out four years before  nor had there been any originals discarded  the only way they left the troupe and its cages was by dying  nor did michael know even as little as the baggageman knew  he knew nothing save that here reigned pain and woe and that it seemed he was destined to share the same fate  into the midst of them when with more howlings and yelpings they were loaded into the baggage car was michaels cage piled  and for a day and a part of two nights travelling eastward he remained in the dog inferno  then they were loaded off in some large city and michael continued on in greater quietness and comfort although his injured foot still hurt and was bruised afresh whenever his crate was moved about in the car  what it was all aboutwhy he was kept in his cramped prison in the cramped carhe did not ask himself  he accepted it as unhappiness and misery and had no more explanation for it than for the crushing of the paw  such things happened  it was life and life had many evils  the why of things never entered his head  he knew things and some small bit of the how of things  what was was  water was wet fire hot iron hard meat good  he accepted such things as he accepted the everlasting miracles of the light and of the dark which were no miracles to him any more than was his wire coat a miracle or his beating heart or his thinking brain  in chicago he was loaded upon a track carted through the roaring streets of the vast city and put into another baggagecar which was quickly in motion in continuation of the eastward journey  it meant more strange men who handled baggage as it meant in new york where from railroad baggageroom to express wagon he was exchanged for ever a crated prisoner and dispatched to one harris collins on long island  first of all came harris collins and the animal hell over which he ruled but the second event must be stated first  michael never saw harry del mar again  as the other men he had known had stepped out of life which was a way they had so harry del mar stepped out of michaels purview of life as well as out of life itself  and his stepping out was literal  a collision on the elevated a panic scramble of the uninjured out upon the trestle over the street a step on the third rail and harry del mar was engulfed in the nothingness which men know as death and which is nothingness in so far as such engulfed ones never reappear nor walk the ways of life again     chapter xxiv   harris collins was fiftytwo years of age  he was slender and dapper and in appearance and comportment was so sweet and gentlespirited that the impression he radiated was almost of sissyness  he might have taught a sundayschool presided over a girls seminary or been a president of a humane society  his complexion was pink and white his hands were as soft as the hands of his daughters and he weighed a hundred and twelve pounds  moreover he was afraid of his wife afraid of a policeman afraid of physical violence and lived in constant dread of burglars  but the one thing he was not afraid of was wild animals of the most ferocious sorts such as lions tigers leopards and jaguars  he knew the game and could conquer the most refractory lion with a broomhandlenot outside the cage but inside and locked in  it was because he knew the game and had learned it from his father before him a man even smaller than himself and more fearful of all things except animals  this father noel collins had been a successful animal trainer in england before emigrating to america and in america he had continued the success and laid the foundation of the big animal training school at cedarwild which his son had developed and built up after him so well had harris collins built on his fathers foundation that the place was considered a model of sanitation and kindness  it entertained many visitors who invariably went away with their souls filled with ecstasy over the atmosphere of sweetness and light that pervaded the place  never however were they permitted to see the actual training on occasion performances were given them by the finished products which verified all their other delightful and charming conclusions about the school  but had they seen the training of raw novices it would have been a different story  it might even have been a riot  as it was the place was a zoo and free at that for in addition to the animals he owned and trained and bought and sold a large portion of the business was devoted to boarding trained animals and troupes of animals for owners who were out of engagements or for estates of such owners which were in process of settlement  from mice and rats to camels and elephants and even on occasion to a rhinoceros or a pair of hippopotamuses he could supply any animal on demand  when the circling brothers big threering show on a hard winter went into the hands of the receivers he boarded the menagerie and the horses and in three months turned a profit of fifteen thousand dollars  morehe mortgaged all he possessed against the day of the auction bought in the trained horses and ponies the giraffe herd and the performing elephants and in six months more was quit of an of them save the pony repeater who turned airsprings at another profit of fifteen thousand dollars  as for repeater he sold the pony several months later for a sheer profit of two thousand  while this bankruptcy of the circling brothers had been the greatest financial achievement of harris collins life nevertheless he enjoyed no mean permanent income from his plant and in addition split fees with the owners of his board animals when he sent them to the winter hippodrome shows and more often than not failed to split any fee at all when he rented the animals to movingpicture companies  animal men the country over acknowledged him to be not only the richest in the business but the king of trainers and the grittiest man who ever went into a cage  and those who from the inside had seen him work were agreed that he had no soul  yet his wife and children and those in his small social circle thought otherwise  they never seeing him at work were convinced that no softerhearted more sentimental man had ever been born  his voice was low and gentle his gestures were delicate his views on life the world religion and politics the mildest  a kind word melted him  a plea won him  he gave to all local charities and was gravely depressed for a week when the titanic went down  and yetthe men in the trainedanimal game acknowledged him the nerviest and most nerveless of the profession  and yethis greatest fear in the world was that his large stout wife at table should crown him with a plate of hot soup  twice in a tantrum she had done this during their earlier married life  in addition to his fear that she might do it again he loved her sincerely and devotedly as he loved his children seven of them for whom nothing was too good or too expensive  so well did he love them that the four boys from the beginning he forbade from seeing him work and planned gentler careers for them john the oldest in yale had elected to become a man of letters and in the meantime ran his own automobile with the corresponding standard of living such ownership connoted in the college town of new haven harold and frederick were down at a millionaires sons academy in pennsylvania and clarence the youngest at a prep school in massachusetts was divided in his choice of career between becoming a doctor or an aviator  the three girls two of them twins were pledged to be cultured into ladies  elsie was on the verge of graduating from vassar  mary and madeline the twins in the most select and most expensive of seminaries were preparing for vassar  all of which required money which harris collins did not grudge but which strained the earning capacity of his animaltraining school  it compelled him to work the harder although his wife and the four sons and three daughters did not dream that he actually worked at all  their idea was that by virtue of superior wisdom he merely superintended and they would have been terribly shocked could they have seen him club in hand thrashing forty mongrel dogs in the process of training which had become excited and out of hand  a great deal of the work was done by his assistants but it was harris collins who taught them continually what to do and how to do it and who himself on more important animals did the work and showed them how  his assistants were almost invariably youths from the reform schools and he picked them with skilful eye and intuition  control of them under their paroles with intelligence and coldness on their part were the conditions and qualities he sought and such combination as a matter of course carried with it cruelty  hot blood generous impulses sentimentality were qualities he did not want for his business and the cedarwild animal school was business from the first tick of the clock to the last bite of the lash  in short harris collins in the totality of results was guilty of causing more misery and pain to animals than all laboratories of vivisection in christendom  and into this animal hell michael descendedalthough his arrival was horizontal across three thousand five hundred miles in the same crate in which he had been placed at the new washington hotel in seattle  never once had he been out of the crate during the entire journey and filthiness as well as wretchedness characterized his condition  thanks to his general good health the wound of the amputated toe was in the process of uneventful healing  but dirt clung to him and he was infested with fleas  cedarwild to look at was anything save a hell  velvet lawns gravelled walks and drives and flowers formally growing led up to the group of long low buildings some of frame and some of concrete  but michael was not received by harris collins who at the moment sat in his private office harry del mars last telegram on his desk writing a memorandum to his secretary to query the railroad and the express companies for the whereabouts of a dog crated and shipped by one harry del mar from seattle and consigned to cedarwild  it was a pallideyed youth of eighteen in overalls who received michael receipted for him to the expressman and carried his crate into a slopefloored concrete room that smelled offensively and chemically clean  michael was impressed by his surroundings but not attracted by the youth who rolled up his sleeves and encased himself in large oilskin apron before he opened the crate  michael sprang out and staggered about on legs which had not walked for days  this particular twolegged god was uninteresting  he was as cold as the concrete floor as methodical as a machine and in such fashion he went about the washing scrubbing and disinfecting of michael  for harris collins was scientific and antiseptic to the last word in his handling of animals and michael was scientifically made clean without deliberate harshness but without any slightest hint of gentleness or consideration  naturally he did not understand  on top of all he had already experienced not even knowing executioners and execution chambers for all he knew this bare room of cement and chemical smell might well be the place of the ultimate lifedisaster and this youth the god who was to send him into the dark which had engulfed all he had known and loved what michael did know beyond the shadow of any doubt was that it was all coldly ominous and terribly strange  he endured the hand of the youth god on the scruff of his neck after the collar had been unbuckled but when the hose was turned on him he resented and resisted  the youth merely working by formula tightened the safe grip on the scruff of michaels neck and lifted him clear of the floor at the same time with the other hand directing the stream of water into his mouth and increasing it to full force by the nozzle control  michael fought and was well drowned for his pains until he gasped and strangled helplessly  after that he resisted no more and was washed out and scrubbed out and cleansed out with the hose a big bristly brush and much carbolic soap the lather of which got into and stung his eyes and nose causing him to weep copiously and sneeze violently  apprehensive of what might at any moment happen to him but by this time aware that the youth was neither positive nor negative for kindness or harm michael continued to endure without further battling until clean and comfortable he was put away into a pen sweet and wholesome where he slept and for the time being forgot  the place was the hospital or segregation ward and a week of imprisonment was spent therein in which nothing happened in the way of development of germ diseases and nothing happened to him except regular good food pure drinkingwater and absolute isolation from contact with all life save the youthgod who like an automaton attended on him  michael had yet to meet harris collins although from a distance often he heard his voice not loud but very imperative  that the owner of this voice was a high god michael knew from the first sound of it  only a high god a master over ordinary gods could be so imperative  will was in that voice and accustomedness to command  any dog would have so decided as quickly as michael did  and any dog would have decided that there was no love nor lovableness in the god behind the voice nothing to warm ones heart nor to adore     chapter xxv   it was at eleven in the morning that the pale youthgod put collar and chain on michael led him out of the segregation ward and turned him over to a dark youthgod who wasted no time of greeting on him and manifested no friendliness  a captive at the end of a chain on the way michael quickly encountered other captives going in his direction  there were three of them and never had he seen the like  three slouching ambling monsters of bears they were and at sight of them michael bristled and uttered the lowest of growls for he knew them out of his heredity as a domestic cow knows her first wolf as immemorial enemies from the wild  but he had travelled too far seen too much and was altogether too sensible to attack them  instead walking stifflegged and circumspectly but smelling with all his nose the strange scent of the creatures he followed at the end of his chain his own captor god  continually a multitude of strange scents invaded his nostrils  although he could not see through walls he got the smells he was later to identify of lions leopards monkeys baboons and seals and sealions all of which might have stunned an ordinary dog but the effect on him was to make him very alert and at the same time very subdued  it was as if he walked in a new and monstrously populous jungle and was unacquainted with its ways and denizens  as he was entering the arena he shied off to the side more stiffleggedly than ever bristled all along his neck and back and growled deep and low in his throat  for emerging from the arena came five elephants  small elephants they were but to him they were the hugest of monsters in his mind comparable only with the cowwhale of which he had caught fleeting glimpses when she destroyed the schooner mary turner  but the elephants took no notice of him each with its trunk clutching the tail of the one in front of it as it had been taught to do in making an exit  into the arena he came the bears following on his heels  it was a sawdust circle the size of a circus ring contained inside a square building that was roofed over with glass  but there were no seats about the ring since spectators were not tolerated  only harris collins and his assistants and buyers and sellers of animals and men in the profession were ever permitted to behold how animals were tormented into the performance of tricks to make the public open its mouth in astonishment or laughter  michael forgot about the bears who were quickly at work on the other side of the circle from that to which he was taken  some men rolling out stout brightpainted barrels which elephants could not crush by sitting on attracted his attention for a moment  next in a pause on the part of the man who led him he regarded with huge interest a piebald shetland pony  it lay on the ground  a man sat on it  and ever and anon it lifted its head from the sawdust and kissed the man  this was all michael saw yet he sensed something wrong about it  he knew not why had no evidence why but he felt cruelty and power and unfairness what he did not see was the long pin in the mans hand  each time he thrust this in the ponys shoulder the pony stung by the pain and reflex action lifted its head and the man was deftly ready to meet the ponys mouth with his own mouth  to an audience the impression would be that in such fashion the pony was expressing its affection for the master  not a dozen feet away another shetland a coalblack one was behaving as peculiarly as it was being treated  ropes were attached to its forelegs each rope held by an assistant who jerked on the same stoutly when a third man standing in front of the pony tapped it on the knees with a short stiff whip of rattan  whereupon the pony went down on its knees in the sawdust in a genuflection to the man with the whip  the pony did not like it sometimes so successfully resisting with spread taut legs and mutinous headtossings as to overcome the jerk of the ropes and at the same time wheeling to fall heavily on its side or to uprear as the pull on the ropes was relaxed  but always it was lined up again to face the man who rapped its knees with the rattan  it was being taught merely how to kneel in the way that is ever a delight to the audiences who see only the results of the schooling and never dream of the manner of the schooling  for as michael was quickly sensing knowledge was here learned by pain  in short this was the college of pain this cedarwild animal school  harris collins himself nodded the dark youthgod up to him and turned an inquiring and estimating gaze on michael  the del mar dog sir said the youthgod  collinss eyes brightened and he looked michael over more carefully  do you know what he can do he queried  the youth shook his head  harry was a keen one collins went on apparently to the youthgod but mostly for his own benefit being given to thinking aloud  he picked this dog as a winner  and now what can he do  thats the question  poor harrys gone and we dont know what he can dotake off the chain  released michael regarded the mastergod and waited for what might happen  a squall of pain from one of the bears across the ring hinted to him what he might expect  come here collins commanded in his cold hard tones  michael came and stood before him  lie down  michael lay down although he did it slowly with advertised reluctance  damned thoroughbred collins sneered at him  wont put any pep into your motions eh  well well take care of thatget uplie downget uplie downget up  his commands were staccato like revolver shots or the cracks of whips and michael obeyed them in his same slow reluctant way  understands english at any rate said collins  wonder if he can turn the double flip he added expressing the golden dream of all dogtrainers  come on well try him for a flip  put the chain on him  come over here jimmy  put another lead on him  another reformschool graduate youth obeyed snapping a girth about michaels loins to which was attached a thin rope  line him up collins commanded  readygo  and the most amazing astounding indignity was wreaked upon michael  at the word go simultaneously the chain on his collar jerked him up and back in the air the rope on his hindquarters jerked that portion of him under forward and up and the still short stick in collinss hand hit him under the lower jaw  had he had any previous experience with the manoeuvre he would have saved himself part of the pain at least by springing and whirling backward in the air  as it was he felt as if being torn and wrenched apart while at the same time the blow under his jaw stung him and almost dazed him  and at the same time whirled violently into the air he fell on the back of his head in the sawdust  out of the sawdust he soared in rage neckhair erect throat asnarl teeth bared to bite and he would have sunk his teeth into the flesh of the mastergod had he not been the slave of cunning formula  the two youths knew their work  one tightened the lead ahead the other to the rear and michael snarled and bristled his impotent wrath  nothing could he do neither advance nor retreat nor whirl sideways  the youth in front by the chain prevented him from attacking the youth behind and the youth behind with the rope prevented him from attacking the youth in front and both prevented him from attacking collins whom he knew incontrovertibly to be the master of evil and hurt  michaels wrath was as superlative as was his helplessness  he could only bristle and tear his vocal chords with his rage  but it was a very ancient and boresome experience to collins  he was even taking advantage of the moment to glance across the arena and size up what the bears were doing  oh you thoroughbred he sneered at michael returning his attention to him  slack him  let go  the instant his bonds were released michael soared at collins and collins timing and distancing with the accuracy of long years kicked him under the jaw and whirled him back and down into the sawdust  hold him collins ordered  line him out  and the two youths pulling in opposite directions with chain and rope stretched him into helplessness  collins glanced across the ring to the entrance where two teams of heavy drafthorses were entering followed by a woman dressed to overdressedness in the last word of a stylish streetcostume  i fancy hes never done any flipping collins remarked coming back to the problem of michael for a moment  take off your lead jimmy and go over and help smithjohnny hold him to one side there and mind your legs  here comes miss marie for her first lesson and that mutt of a husband of hers cant handle her  michael did not understand the scene that followed which he witnessed for the youth led him over to look on at the arranging of the woman and the four horses  yet from her conduct he sensed that she too was captive and illtreated  in truth she was herself being trained unwillingly to do a trick  she had carried herself bravely right to the moment of the ordeal but the sight of the four horses ranged two and two opposing her with the thing patent that she was to hold in her hands the hooks on the doubletrees and form the link that connected the two spans which were to pull in opposite directionsat the sight of this her courage failed her and she shrank back drooping and cowering her face buried in her hands  no no billikens she pleaded to the stout though youthful man who was her husband  i cant do it  im afraid  im afraid  nonsense madam collins interposed  the trick is absolutely safe and its a good one a moneymaker  straighten up a moment  with his hands he began feeling out her shoulders and back under her jacket  the apparatus is all right  he ran his hands down her arms  now  drop the hooks  he shook each arm and from under each of the fluffy lace cuffs fell out an iron hook fast to a thin cable of steel that evidently ran up her sleeves  not that way  nobody must see  put them back  try it again  they must come down hidden in your palms  like this seethats it  thats the idea  she controlled herself and strove to obey though ever and anon she cast appealing glances to billikens who stood remote and aloof his brows wrinkled with displeasure  each of the men driving the harnessed spans lifted up the doubletrees so that the girl could grasp the hooks  she tried to take hold but broke down again  if anything breaks my arms will be torn out of me she protested  on the contrary collins reassured her  you will lose merely most of your jacket  the worst that can happen will be the exposure of the trick and the laugh on you  but the apparatus isnt going to break  let me explain again  the horses do not pull against you  they pull against each other  the audience thinks that they are pulling against younow try once more  take hold the doubletrees and at the same moment slip down the hooks and connectnow  he spoke sharply  she shook the hooks down out of her sleeves but drew back from grasping the doubletrees  collins did not betray his vexation  instead he glanced aside to where the kissing pony and the kneeling pony were leaving the ring  but the husband raged at her  by god julia if you throw me down this way  oh ill try billikens she whimpered  honestly ill try  see  im not afraid now  she extended her hands and clasped the doubletrees  with a thin writhe of a smile collins investigated the insides of her clenched hands to make sure that the hooks were connected  now brace yourself  spread your legs  and straighten out  with his hands he manipulated her arms and shoulders into position  remember youve got to meet the first of the strain with your arms straight out after the strain is on you couldnt bend em if you wanted to  but if the strain catches them bent the wirell rip the hide off of you remember straight out extended so that they form a straight line with each other and with the flat of your back and shoulders  thats it ready now  oh wait a minute she begged forsaking the position  ill do itoh i will do it but billikens kiss me first and then i wont care if my arms are pulled out  the dark youth who held michael and others looking on grinned  collins dissembled whatever grin might have troubled for expression and murmured  all the time in the world madam  the point is the first time must come off right  after that youll have the confidencebill youd better love her up before she tackles it  and billikens very angry very disgusted very embarrassed obeyed putting his arms around his wife and kissing her neither too perfunctorily nor very long  she was a pretty young thing of a woman perhaps twenty years old with an exceedingly childish girlish face and a slenderwaisted generously moulded body of fully a hundred and forty pounds  the embrace and kiss of her husband put courage into her  she stiffened and steeled herself and with compressed lips as he stepped clear of her muttered ready  go collins commanded  the four horses under the urge of the drivers pressed lazily into their collars and began pulling  give em the whip collins barked his eyes on the girl and noting that the pull of the apparatus was straight across her  the lashes fell on the horses rumps and they leaped and surged and plunged with their huge steelshod hoofs the size of soupplates tearing up the sawdust into smoke  and billikens forgot himself  the terribleness of the sight painted the honest anxiety for the woman on his face  and her face was a kaleidoscope  at the first tense and fearful it was like that of a christian martyr meeting the lions or of a felon falling through the trap  next and quickly came surprise and relief in that there was no hurt  and finally her face was proudly happy with a smile of triumph she even smiled to billikens her pride at making good her love to him and billikens relaxed and looked love and pride back until on the spur of the second harris collins broke in  this aint a smiling act  get that smile off your face  the audience has got to think youre carrying the pull  show that you are  make your face stiff till it cracks  show determination willpower  show great muscular effort  spread your legs more  bring up the muscles through your skirt just as if you was really working  let em pull you this way a bit and that way a bit  give em to  spread your legs more  make a noise on your face as if you was being pulled to pieces an that all that holds you is willpowerthats the idea  thats the stuff  its a winner bill  its a winnerthrow the leather into em  make m jump make m get right down and pull the daylights out of each other  the whips fell on the horses and the horses struggled in all their hugeness and might to pull away from the pain of the punishment  it was a spectacle to win approval from any audience  each horse averaged eighteen hundredweight thus to the eye of the onlooker seven thousand two hundred pounds of straining horseflesh seemed wrenching and dragging apart the slimwaisted delicately bodied hundredandforty pound woman in her fancy street costume  it was a sight to make women in circus audiences scream with terror and turn their faces away  slack down collins commanded the drivers  the lady wins he announced after the manner of a ringmasterbill youve got a mint in that turnunhook madam unhook  marie obeyed and the hooks still dangling from her sleeves made a short run to billikens into whose arms she threw herself her own arms folding him about the neck as she exclaimed before she kissed him  oh billikens i knew i could do it all the time  i was brave wasnt i  a giveaway collinss dry voice broke in on her ecstasy  letting all the audience see the hooks  they must go up your sleeves the moment you let gotry it again  and another thing  when you finish the turn no chestiness  no making out how easy it was  make out it was the very devil  show yourself weak just about to collapse from the strain  give at the knees  make your shoulders cave in  the ringmaster will half step forward to catch you before you faint  thats your cue  beat him to it  stiffen up and straighten up with an effort of willpowerwill powers the idea gameness and all that and kiss your hands to the audience and make a weak pitiful sort of a smile as though your hearts been pulled most out of you and youll have to go to the hospital but for right then that youre game an smiling and kissing your hands to the audience thats riping the seats up and loving youget me madam  you bill get the idea  and see she does itnow ready  be a bit wistful as you look at the horsesthats it  nobodyd guess youd palmed the hooks and connected themstraight outlet her go  and again the thirtysixhundredweight of horses on either side pitted its strength against the similar weight on the other side and the seeming was that marie was the link of womanflesh being torn asunder  a third and a fourth time the turn was rehearsed and between turns collins sent a man to his office for the del mar telegram  you take her now bill he told maries husband as telegram in hand he returned to the problem of michael  give her half a dozen tries more  and dont forget any time any jay farmer thinks hes got a span that can pull bet him on the side your best span can beat him  that means advance advertising and some paper  itll be worth it  the ringmasterll favour you and your span can get the first jump  if i was young and footloose id ask nothing better than to go out with your turn  harris collins in the pauses gazing down at michael read del mars seattle telegram     sell my dogs  you know what they can do and what they are worth  am    done with them  deduct the board and hold the balance until i see    you  i have the limit of a dog  every turn i ever pulled is put in    the shade by this one  hes a ten strike  wait till you see him  over to one side in the busy arena collins contemplated michael  del mar was the limit himself he told johnny who held michael by the chain  when he wired me to sell his dogs it meant he had a better turn and heres only one dog to show for it a damned thoroughbred at that  he says its the limit  it must be but in heavens name what is its turn its never done a flip in its life much less a double flip  what do you think johnny  use your head  suggest something  maybe it can count johnny advanced  and countingdogs are a drug on the market  well anyway lets try  and michael who knew unerringly how to count refused to perform  if he was a regular dog he could walk anyway was collins next idea well try him  and michael went through the humiliating ordeal of being jerked erect on his hind legs by johnny while collins with the stick cracked him under the jaw and across the knees  in his wrath michael tried to bite the mastergod and was jerked away by the chain  when he strove to retaliate on johnny that imperturbable youth with extended arm merely lifted him into the air on his chain and strangled him  thats off quoth collins wearily  if he cant stand on his hind legs he cant barreljumpyouve heard about ruth johnny  she was a winner jump in and out of nailkegs on her hind legs without ever touching with her front ones  she used to do eight kegs in one and out into the next  remember when she was boarded here and rehearsed  she was a gold mine but carson didnt know how to treat her and she croaked off with penumonia at cripple creek  wonder if he can spin plates on his nose johnny volunteered  cant stand up on hind legs collins negatived  besides nothing like the limit in a turn like that  this dogs got a specially  he aint ordinary  he does some unusual thing unusually well and its up to us to locate it  that comes of harry dying so inconsiderately and leaving this puzzlebox on my hands  i see i just got to devote myself to him take him away johnny  number eighteen for him  later on we can put him in the single compartments     chapter xxvi   number eighteen was a big compartment or cage in the dog row large enough with due comfort for a dozen irish terriers like michael  for harris collins was scientific  dogs on vacation boarding at the cedarwild animal school were given every opportunity to recuperate from the hardships and wear and tear of from six months to a year and more on the road  it was for this reason that the school was so popular a boardingplace for performing animals when the owners were on vacation or out of time  harris collins kept his animals clean and comfortable and guarded from germ diseases  in short he renovated them against their next trips out on vaudeville time or circus engagement  to the left of michael in number seventeen were five grotesquely clipped french poodles  michael could not see them save when he was being taken out or brought back but he could smell them and hear them and in his loneliness he even started a feud of snarling bickeringness with pedro the biggest of them who acted as clown in their turn  they were aristocrats among performing animals and michaels feud with pedro was not so much real as playacted  had he and pedro been brought together they would have made friends in no time  but through the slow monotonous drag of the hours they developed a fictitious excitement and interest in mouthing their quarrel which each knew in his heart of hearts was no quarrel at all  in number nineteen on michaels right was a sad and tragic company they were mongrels kept spotlessly and germicidally clean who were unattached and untrained  they composed a sort of reserve of raw material to be worked into established troupes when an extra one or a substitute was needed  this meant the hell of the arena where the training went on  also in spare moments collins or his assistants were for ever trying them out with all manner of tricks in the quest of special aptitudes on their parts  thus a mongrel semblance to a cooker spaniel of a dog was tried out for several days as a ponyrider who would leap through paper hoops from the ponys back and return upon the back again  after several falls and painful injuries it was rejected for the feat and tried out as a platebalancer  failing in this it was made into a seesaw dog who for the rest of the turn filled into the background of a troupe of twenty dogs  number nineteen was a place of perpetual quarrelling and pain  dogs hurt in the training licked their wounds and moaned or howled or were irritable to excess on the slightest provocation  always when a new dog enteredand this was a regular happening for others were continually being taken away to hit the roadthe cage was vexed with quarrels and battles until the new dog by fighting or by non resistance had commanded or been taught its proper place  michael ignored the denizens of number nineteen  they could sniff and snarl belligerently across at him but he took no notice reserving his companionship for the playacted and perennial quarrel with pedro  also michael was out in the arena more often and far longer hours than any of them  trust harry not to make a mistake on a dog was collinss judgment and constantly he strove to find in michael what had made del mar declare him a ten strike and the limit  every indignity in the attempt to find out was wreaked upon michael they tried him at hurdlejumping at walking on forelegs at ponyriding at forward flips and at clowning with other dogs  they tried him at waltzing all his legs cordfastened and dragged and jerked and slacked under him  they spiked his collar in some of the attempted tricks to keep him from lurching from side to side or from falling forward or backward  they used the whip and the rattan stick and twisted his nose they attempted to make a goalkeeper of him in a football game between two teams of paindriven and painbitten mongrels  and they dragged him up ladders to make him dive into a tank of water  even they essayed to make him loop the looprushing him down an inclined trough at so high speed of his legs accelerated by the slash of whips on his hindquarters that with such initial momentum had he put his heart and will into it he could have successfully run up the inside of the loop and across the inside of the top of it backdownward like a fly on the ceiling and on and down and around and out of the loop  but he refused the will and the heart and every time when he was unable at the beginning to leap sideways out of the inclined trough he fell grievously from the inside of the loop bruising and injuring himself  it isnt that i expect these things are what harry had in mind collins would say for always he was training his assistants but that through them i may get a cue to his specially whatever in gods name it is that poor harry must have known  out of love at the wish of his lovegod steward michael would have striven to learn these tricks and in most of them would have succeeded but here at cedarwild was no love and his own thoroughbred nature made him stubbornly refuse to do under compulsion what he would gladly have done out of love  as a result since collins was no thoroughbred of a man the clashes between them were for a time frequent and savage  in this fighting michael quickly learned he had no chance  he was always doomed to defeat  he was beaten by stereotyped formula before he began never once could he get his teeth into collins or johnny  he was too commonsensed to keep up the battling in which he would surely have broken his heart and his body and gone dumb mad  instead he retired into himself became sullen undemonstrative and though he never cowered in defeat and though he was always ready to snarl and bristle his hair in advertisement that inside he was himself and unconquered he no longer burst out in furious anger  after a time scarcely ever trying him out on a new trick the chain and johnny were dispensed with and with collins he spent all collinss hours in the arena  he learned by bitter lessons that he must follow collins around and follow him he did hating him perpetually and in his own body slowly and subtly poisoning himself by the juices of his glands that did not secrete and flow in quite their normal way because of the pressure put upon them by his hatred  the effect of this on his body was not perceptible  this was because of his splendid constitution and health  wherefore since the effect must be produced somewhere it was his mind or spirit or nature or brain or processes of consciousness that received it  he drew more and more within himself became morose and brooded much  all of which was spiritually unhealthful  he who had been so merryhearted even merrier hearted than his brother jerry began to grow saturnine and peevish and illtempered  he no longer experienced impulses to play to romp around to run about  his body became as quiet and controlled as his brain human convicts in prisons attain this quietude  he could stand by the hour to heel to collins uninterested infinitely bored while collins tortured some mongrel creature into the performance of a trick  and much of this torturing michael witnessed  there were the greyhounds the highjumpers and wideleapers  they were willing to do their best but collins and his assistants achieved the miracle if miracle it may be called of making them do better than their best  their best was natural  their better than best was unnatural and it killed some and shortened the lives of all  rushed to the springboard and the leap always after the takeoff in midair they had to encounter an assistant who stood underneath an extraordinarily long buggywhip in hand and lashed them vigorously  this made them leap from the springboard beyond their normal powers hurting and straining and injuring them in their desperate attempt to escape the whiplash to beat the whiplash in the air and be past ere it could catch their flying flanks and sting them like a scorpion  never will a jumping dog jump his hardest collins told his assistants unless hes made to  thats your job  thats the difference between the jumpers i turn out and some of these dub amateurjumping outfits that fail to make good even on the bush circuits  collins continually taught  a graduate from his school an assistant who received from him a letter of recommendation carried a high credential of a sheepskin into the trainedanimal world  no dog walks naturally on its hind legs much less on its forelegs collins would say  dogs aint built that way  they have to be made to thats all  thats the secret of all animal training  they have to  youve got to make them  thats your job  make them  anybody who cant cant make good in this factory  put that in your pipe and smoke it and get busy  michael saw without fully appreciating the use of the spiked saddle on the bucking mule  the mule was fat and goodnatured the first day of its appearance in the arena  it had been a pet mule in a family of children until collinss keen eyes rested on it and it had known only love and kindness and much laughter for its foolish mulishness  but collinss eyes had read health vigour and long life as well as laughableness of appearance and action in the longeared hybrid  barney barnato he was renamed that first day in the arena when also he received the surprise of his life  he did not dream of the spike in the saddle nor while the saddle was empty did it press against him  but the moment samuel bacon a negro tumbler got into the saddle the spike sank home  he knew about it and was prepared  but barney taken by surprise arched his back in the first buck he had ever made  it was so prodigious a buck that collins eyes snapped with satisfaction while sam landed a dozen feet away in the sawdust  make good like that collins approved and when i sell the mule youll go along as part of the turn or i miss my guess  and it will be some turn  therell be at least two more like you wholl have to be nervy and know how to fall  get busy  try him again  and barney entered into the hell of education that later won his purchaser more time than he could deliver over the best vaudeville circuits in canada and the united states  day after day barney took his torture  not for long did he carry the spiked saddle  instead bare back he received the negro on his back and was spiked and set bucking just the same for the spike was now attached to sams palm by means of leather straps  in the end barney became so touchy about his back that he almost began bucking if a person as much as looked at it certainly aware of the stab of pain he started bucking whirling and kicking whenever the first signal was given of some one trying to mount him  at the end of the fourth week two other tumblers white youths being secured the complete builded turn was performed for the benefit of a slender frenchlooking gentleman with waxed moustaches  in the end he bought barney without haggling at collinss own terms and engaged sammy and the other two tumblers as well  collins staged the trick properly as it would be staged in the theatre even had ready and set up all the necessary apparatus and himself acted as ringmaster while the prospective purchaser looked on  barney fat as butter humorouslooking was led into the square of cloth covered steel cables and clothcovered steel uprights  the halter was removed and he was turned loose  immediately he became restless the ears were laid back and he was a picture of viciousness  remember one thing collins told the man who might buy  if you buy him youll be ringmaster and you must never never spike him  when he comes to know that you can always put your hands on him any time and control him  hes goodnatured at heart and hes the gratefullest mule ive ever seen in the business  hes just got to love you and hate the other three  and one warning if he goes real bad and starts biting youll have to pull out his teeth and feed him soft mashes and crushed grain thats steamed  ill give you the recipe for the digestive dope youll have to put in  nowwatch  collins stopped into the ring and caressed barney who responded in the best of tempers and tried affectionately to nudge and shove past on the way out of the ropes to escape what he knew was coming  see collins exposited  hes got confidence in me  he trusts me  he knows ive never spiked him and that i always save him in the end  im his good samaritan and youll have to be the same to him if you buy himnow ill give you your spiel  of course you can improve on it to suit yourself  the mastertrainer walked out of the rope square stepped forward to an imaginary line and looked down and out and up as if he were gazing at the pit of the orchestra beneath him across at the body of the house and up into the galleries  ladies and gentlemen he addressed the sawdust emptiness before him as if it were a packed audience this is barney barnato the biggest joker of a mule ever born  hes as affectionate as a newfoundland puppyjust watch  stepping back to the ropes collins extended his hand across them saying come here barney and show all these people who you love best  and barney twinkled forward on his small hoofs nozzled the open hand and came closer nozzling up the arm nudging collinss shoulders with his nose halfrearing as if to get across the ropes and embrace him what he was really doing was begging and entreating collins to take him away out of the squared ring from the torment he knew awaited him  thats what it means by never spiking him collins shot at the man with the waxed moustaches as he stepped forward to the imaginary line in the sawdust above the imaginary pit of the orchestra and addressed the imaginary house  ladies and gentlemen barney barnato is a josher  hes got forty tricks up each of his four legs and the man dont live that hell let stick on big back for sixty seconds  im telling you this in fair warning before i make my proposition  looks easy doesnt itone minute the sixtieth part of an hour to be precise sixty seconds to stick on the back of an affectionate josher mule like barney  well come on you boys and broncho riders  to anybody who sticks on for one minute i shall immediately pay the sum of fifty dollars for two whole entire minutes the sum of five hundred dollars  this was the cue for samuel bacon who advanced across the sawdust awkward and grinning and embarrassed and apparently was helped up to the stage by the extended hand of collins  is your life insured collins demanded  sam shook his head and grinned  then what are you tackling this for  for the money said sam  i jes naturally needs it in my business  what is your business  none of your business mister  here sam grinned ingratiating apology for his impertinence and shuffled on his legs  i might be investin in lottery tickets only i aint  do i get the moneythats our business  sure you do collins replied  when you earn it  stand over there to one side and wait a momentladies and gentlemen if you will forgive the delay i must ask for more volunteersany more takers  fifty dollars for sixty seconds  almost a dollar a second    if you win better  ill make it a dollar a second  sixty dollars to the boy man woman or girl who sticks on barneys back for one minute  come on ladies  remember this is the day of equal suffrage  heres where you put it over on your husbands brothers sons fathers and grandfathers age is no limitgrandma do i get you he uttered directly to what must have been a very elderly lady in a near front rowyou see to the prospective buyer ive got the entire patter for you  you could do it with two rehearsals and you can do them right here free of charge part of the purchase  the next two tumblers crossed the sawdust and were helped by collins up to the imaginary stage  you can change the patter according to the cities youre in he explained to the frenchman  its easy to find out the names of the most despised and toughest neighbourhoods or villages and have the boys hail from them  continuing the patter collins put the performance on  sams first attempt was brief  he was not half on when he was flung to the ground half a dozen attempts quickly repeated were scarcely better the last one permitting him to remain on barneys back nearly ten seconds and culminating in a ludicrous fall over barneys head  sam withdrew from the ring shaking his head dubiously and holding his side as if in pain the other lads followed  expert tumblers they executed most amazing and sidesplitting fails  sam recovered and came back  toward the last all three made a combined attack on barney striving to mount him simultaneously from different slants of approach  they were scattered and flung like chaff sometimes falling heaped together  once the two white boys standing apart as if recovering breath were mowed down by sams flying body  remember this is a real mule collins told the man with the waxed moustaches  if any outsiders butt in for a hack at the money all the better  theyll get theirs quick  the man dont live who can stay on his back a minute    if you keep him rehearsed with the spike  he must live in fear of the spike  never let him slow up on it  never let him forget it  if you lay off any time for a few days rehearse him with the spike a couple of times just before you begin again or else he might forget it and queer the turn by ambling around with the first outside rube that mounts him  and just suppose some rube all hooks of arms and legs and hands is managing to stick on anyway and the minute is getting near up  just have sam here or any of your three slide in and spike him from the palm  thatll be good night for mr rube  you cant lose and the audiencell laugh its fool head off  now for the climax  watch  this always brings the house down  get busy you twosam  ready  while the white boys threatened to mount barney from either side and kept his attention engaged sam from outside in a sudden fit of rage and desperation made a flying dive across the ropes and from in front locked arms and legs about barneys neck tucking his own head close against barneys head  and barney reared up on his hind legs as he had long since learned from the many palmspikings he had received on head and neck  its a corker collins announced as barney on his hind legs striking vainly with his fore struggled about the ring  theres no danger hell never fall over backwards  hes a mule and hes too wise besides even if he does all sam has to do is let go and fall clear  the turn over barney gladly accepted the halter and was led out of the square ring and up to the frenchman  long life therelook him over collins continued to sell  its a full turn including yourself four performers besides the mule and besides any suckers from the audience  its all ready to put on the boards and dirt cheap at five thousand  the frenchman winced at the sum  listen to arithmetic collins went on  you can sell at twelve hundred a week at least and you can net eight hundred certain  six weeks of the net pays for the turn and you can book a hundred weeks right off the bat and have them yelling for more  wish i was young and footloose  id take it out on the road myself and coin a fortune  and barney was sold and passed out of the cedarwild animal school to the slavery of the spike and to be provocative of much joy and laughter in the pleasuretheatre of the world     chapter xxvii   the thing is johnny you cant love dogs into doing professional tricks which is the difference between dogs and women collins told his assistant  you know how it is with any dog  you love it up into lying down and rolling over and playing dead and all such dub tricks  and then one day you show him off to your friends and the conditions are changed and he gets all excited and foolish and you cant get him to do a thing children are like that  lose their heads in company forget all their training and throw you down  now on the stage they got real tricks to do tricks they dont do tricks they hate  and they mightnt be feeling goodgot a touch of cold or mange or are sourballed  what are you going to do  apologize to the audience  besides on the stage the programme runs like clockwork  got to start performing on the tick of the clock and anywhere from one to seven turns a day all depending what kind of time youve got  the point is your dogs have got to get right up and perform  no loving them no begging them no waiting on them  and theres only the one way  theyve got to know when you start you mean it  and dogs aint fools johnny opined  they know when you mean anything an when you dont  sure thing collins nodded approbation  the moment you slack up on them is the moment they slack up in their work  you get soft and see how quick they begin making mistakes in their tricks  youve got to keep the fear of god over them  if you dont they wont and youll find yourself begging for spotted time on the bush circuits  half an hour later michael heard though he understood no word of it the mastertrainer laying another law down to another assistant  crossbreds and mongrels are whats needed charles  not one thoroughbred in ten makes good unless hes got the heart of a coward and thats just what distinguishes them from mongrels and crossbreds like racehorses theyre hotblooded  theyve got sensitiveness and pride  prides the worst  you listen to me  i was born into the business and ive studied it all my life  im a success  theres only one reason im a successi know  get that  i know  another thing is that crossbreds and mongrels are cheap  you neednt be afraid of losing them or working them out  you can always get more and cheap  and they aint the trouble in teaching  you can throw the fear of god into them  thats whats the matter with the thoroughbreds you cant throw the fear of god into them  give a mongrel a real licking and whats he do  hell kiss your hand and be obedient and crawl on his belly to do what you want him to do theyre slave dogs thats what mongrels are  they aint got courage and you dont want courage in a performing dog  you want fear  now you give a thoroughbred a licking and see what happens  sometimes they die ive known them to die  and if they dont die what do they do  either they go stubborn or vicious or both  sometimes they just go to biting and foaming  you can kill them but you cant keep them from biting and foaming  or theyll go straight stubborn  theyre the worst  theyre the passive resistersthats what i call them  they wont fight back you can flog them to death but it wont buy you anything  theyre like those christians that used to be burned at the stake or boiled in oil theyve got their opinions and nothing you can do will change them theyll die first    and they do  ive had them  i was learning myself    and i learned to leave the thoroughbred alone  they beat you out  they get your goat  you never get theirs  and theyre time wasters and patiencewasters and theyre expensive  take this terrier here collins nodded at michael who stood several feet back of him morosely regarding the various activities of the arena hes both kinds of a thoroughbred and therefore no good  ive never given him a real licking and i never will  it would be a waste of time hell fight if you press him too hard  and hell die fighting you  hes too sensible to fight if you dont press him too hard  and if you dont press him too hard hell just stay as he is and refuse to learn anything  id chuck him right now except del mar couldnt make a mistake  poor harry knew he had a specially and a crackerjack and its up to me to find it  wonder if hes a lion dog charles suggested  hes the kind that aint afraid of lions collins concurred  but what sort of a specially trick could he do with lions  stick his head in their mouths  i never heard of a dog doing that and its an idea  but we can try him  weve tried him at most everything else  theres old hannibal said charles  he used to take a womans head in his mouth with the old salessinker shows  but old hannibals getting cranky collins objected  ive been watching him and trying to get rid of him  any animal is liable to go off its nut any time especially wild ones  you see the life aint natural  and when they do its good night  you lose your investment and if you dont know your business maybe your life  and michael might well have been tried out on hannibal and have lost his head inside that animals huge mouth had not the good fortune of apropos ness intervened  for the next moment collins was listening to the hasty report of his lionandtiger keeper  the man who reported was possibly forty years of age although he looked half as old again  he was a witheredfaced man whose facelines deep and vertical looked as if they had been clawed there by some beast other than himself  old hannibal is going crazy was the burden of his report  nonsense said harris collins  its you thats getting old  hes got your goat thats all  ill show it to youcome on along all of you well take fifteen minutes off of the work and ill show you a show never seen in the showring  itd be worth ten thousand a week anywhere    only it wouldnt last  old hannibal would turn up his toes out of sheer hurt feelingscome on everybody  all hands  fifteen minutes recess  and michael followed at the heels of his latest and most terrible master the twain leading the procession of employees and visiting professional animal men who trooped along behind  as was well known when harris collins performed he performed only for the elite for the hoipolloi of the trainedanimal world  the lionandtiger man who had clawed his own face with the beastclaws of his nature whimpered protest when he saw his employers preparation to enter hannibals cage for the preparation consisted merely in equipping himself with a broomhandle  hannibal was old but he was reputed the largest lion in captivity and he had not lost his teeth  he was pacing up and down the length of his cage heavily and swaying after the manner of captive animals when the unexpected audience erupted into the space before his cage  yet he took no notice whatever merely continuing his pacing swinging his head from side to side turning lithely at each end of his cage with all the air of being bent on some determined purpose  thats the way hes been goin on for two days whimpered his keeper an when you go near m he just reaches for you  look what he done to me  the man held up his right arm the shirt and undershirt ripped to shreds and red parallel grooves slightly clotted with blood showing where the claws had broken the skin  an i wasnt inside  he did it through the bars with one swipe when i was startin to clean his cage now if hed only roar or something  but he never makes a sound just keeps on goin up an down  wheres the key collins demanded  good  now let me in  and lock it afterward and take the key out  lose it forget it throw it away  ill have all the time in the world to wait for you to find it to let me out  and harris collins a sliver of a less than a lightweight man who lived in mortal fear that at table the mother of his children would crown him with a plate of hot soup went into the cage before the critical audience of his employees and professional visitors armed only with a broomhandle  further the door was locked behind him and the moment he was in keeping a casual but alert eye on the pacing hannibal he reiterated his order to lock the door and remove the key  half a dozen times the lion paced up and down declining to take any notice of the intruder  and then when his back was turned as he went down the cage collins stepped directly in the way of his return path and stood still  coming back and finding his way blocked hannibal did not roar  his muscular movements sliding each into the next like so much silk of tawny hide he struck at the obstacle that confronted his way but collins knowing ahead of the lion what the lion was going to do struck first with the broomhandle rapping the beast on its tender nose hannibal recoiled with a flash of snarl and flashed back a second sweeping stroke of his mighty paw  again he was anticipated and the rap on his nose sent him into recoil  got to keep his head downthat way lies safety the mastertrainer muttered in a low tense voice  ah would you  take it then  hannibal in wrath crouching for a spring had lifted his head  the consequent blow on his nose forced his head down to the floor and the king of beasts nose still to floor backed away with mouthsnarls and throatandchest noises  follow up collins enunciated himself following rapping the nose again sharply and accelerating the lions backward retreat  man is the boss because hes got the head that thinks collins preached the lesson and hes just got to make his head boss his body thats all so that he can think one thought ahead of the animal and act one act ahead  watch me get his goat  he aint the hard case hes trying to make himself believe he is  and that idea which hes just starting has got to be taken out of him  the broomstick will do it  watch  he backed the animal down the length of the cage continually rapping at the nose and keeping it down to the floor  now im going to pile him into the corner  and hannibal snarling growling and spitting ducking his head and with short pawstrokes trying to ward off the insistent broomstick backed obediently into the corner crumpled up his hindparts and tried to withdraw his corporeal body within itself in a painurged effort to make it smaller  and always he kept his nose down and himself harmless for a spring  in the thick of it he slowly raised his nose and yawned  nor because it came up slowly and because collins had anticipated the yawn by being one thought ahead of hannibal in hannibals own brain was the nose rapped  thats the goat collins announced for the first time speaking in a hearty voice in which was no vibration of strain  when a lion yawns in the thick of a fight you know he aint crazy  hes sensible  hes got to be sensible or hed be springing or lashing out instead of yawning he knows hes licked and that yawn of his merely says i quit  for the i love of mike leave me alone  my nose is awful sore  id like to get you but i cant  ill do anything you want and ill be dreadful good but dont hit my poor sore nose  but man is the boss and he cant afford to be so easy  drive the lesson home that youre boss  rub it in  dont stop when he quits  make him swallow the medicine and lick the spoon  make him kiss your foot on his neck holding him down in the dirt  make him kiss the stick thats beaten himwatch  and hannibal the largest lion in captivity with all his teeth captured out of the jungle after he was fullgrown a veritable king of beasts before the menacing broomstick in the hand of a sliver of a man backed deeper and more crumpled together into the corner  his back was bowed up the very opposite muscular position to that for a spring while he drew his head more and more down and under his chest in utter abjectness resting his weight on his elbows and shielding his poor nose with his massive paws a single stroke of which could have ripped the life of collins quivering from his body  now he might be tricky collins announced but hes got to kiss my foot and the stick just the same  watch  he lifted and advanced his left foot not tentatively and hesitantly but quickly and firmly bringing it to rest on the lions neck  the stick was poised to strike one act ahead of the lions next possible act as collinss mind was one thought ahead of the lions next thought  and hannibal did the forecasted and predestined  his head flashed up huge jaws distended fangs gleaming to sink into the slender silken hosed ankle above the tan lowcut shoes  but the fangs never sank  they were scarcely started a fifth of the way of the distance when the waiting broomstick rapped on his nose and made him sink it in the floor under his chest and cover it again with his paws  he aint crazy said collins  he knows from the little he knows that i know more than him and that ive got him licked to a fareyouwell  if he was crazy he wouldnt know and i wouldnt know his mind either and i wouldnt be that one jump ahead of him and hed get me and mess the whole cage up with my insides  he prodded hannibal with the end of the broomhandle after each prod poising it for a stroke  and the great lion lay and roared in helplessness and at each prod exposed his nose more and lifted it higher until at the end his red tongue ran out between his fangs and licked the boot resting none too gently on his neck and after that licked the broomstick that had administered all the punishment  going to be a good lion now collins demanded roughly rubbing his foot back and forth on hannibals neck  hannibal could not refrain from growling his hatred  going to be a good lion collins repeated rubbing his foot back and forth still more roughly  and hannibal exposed his nose and with his red tongue licked again the tan shoe and the slender tansilken ankle that he could have destroyed with one crunch     chapter xxviii   one friend michael made among the many animals he encountered in the cedarwild school and a strange sad friendship it was  sara she was called a small green monkey from south america who seemed to have been born hysterical and indignant and with no appreciation of humour sometimes following collins about the arena michael would meet her while she waited to be tried out on some new turn  for unable or unwilling to try she was for ever being tried out on turns or with little herself to do as a fillerin for more important performers  but she always caused confusion either chattering and squealing with fright or bickering at the other animals  whenever they attempted to make her do anything she protested indignantly and if they tried force her squalls and cries excited all the animals in the arena and set the work back  never mind said collins finally  shell go into the next monkey band we make up  this was the last and most horrible fate that could befall a monkey on the stage to be a helpless marionette compelled by unseen sticks and wires poked and jerked by concealed men to move and act throughout an entire turn  but it was before this doom was passed upon her that michael made her acquaintance  their first meeting she sprang suddenly at him a screaming chattering little demon threatening him with nails and teeth and michael already deepsunk in habitual moroseness merely looked at her calmly not a ripple to his neckhair nor a prick to his ears  the next moment her fuss and fury quite ignored she saw him turn his head away  this gave her pause  had he sprung at her or snarled or shown any anger or resentment such as did the other dogs when so treated by her she would have screamed and screeched and raised a hubbub of expostulation crying for help and calling all men to witness how she was being unwarrantably attacked  as it was michaels unusual behaviour seemed to fascinate her  she approached him tentatively without further racket and the boy who had her in charge slacked the thin chain that held her  hope he breaks her back for her was his unholy wish for he hated sara intensely desiring to be with the lions or elephants rather than dancing attendance on a cantankerous female monkey there was no reasoning with  and because michael took no notice of her she made up to him  it was not long before she had her hands on him and quickly after that an arm around his neck and her head snuggled against his  then began her interminable tale  day after day catching him at odd times in the ring she would cling closely to him and in a low voice running on and on never pausing for breath tell him for all he knew the story of her life  at any rate it sounded like the story of her woes and of all the indignities which had been wreaked upon her  it was one long complaint and some of it might have been about her health for she sniffed and coughed a great deal and her chest seemed always to hurt her from the way she had of continually and gingerly pressing the palm of her hand to it sometimes however she would cease her complaining and love and mother him uttering occasional series of gentle mellow sounds that were like croonings  hers was the only hand of affection that was laid on him at cedarwild and she was ever gentle never pinching him never pulling his ears  by the same token he was the only friend she had and he came to look forward to meeting her in the course of the morning workand this despite that every meeting always concluded in a scene when she fought with her keeper against being taken away  her cries and protests would give way to whimperings and wailings while the men about laughed at the strangeness of the loveaffair between her and the irish terrier  but harris collins tolerated even encouraged their friendship  the two sourballs get along best together he said  and it does them good  gives them something to live for and that way lies health  but some day mark my words shell turn on him and give him what for and their friendship will get a terrible smash  and half of it he spoke with the voice of prophecy and though she never turned on michael the day in the world was written when their friendship would truly receive a terrible smash  now seals are too wise collins explained one day in a sort of extempore lecture to several of his apprentice trainers  youve just got to toss fish to them when they perform  if you dont they wont and theres an end of it  but you cant depend on feeding dainties to dogs for instance though you can make a young untrained pig perform creditably by means of a nursing bottle hidden up your sleeve  all you have to do is think it over  do you think you can make those greyhounds extend themselves with the promise of a bite of meat  its the whip that makes them extendlook over there at billy green  there aint another way to teach that dog that trick  you cant love her into doing it  you cant pay her to do it  theres only one way and thats make her  billy green at the moment was training a tiny nondescript frizzly haired dog  always on the stage he made a hit by drawing from his pocket a tiny dog that would do this particular trick  the last one had died from a wrenched back and he was now breaking in a new one  he was catching the little mite by the hindlegs and tossing it up in the air where making a halfflip and descending head first it was supposed to alight with its forefeet on his hand and there balance itself its hind feet and body above it in the air  again and again he stooped caught her hindlegs and flung her up into the halfturn  almost frozen with fear she vainly strove to effect the trick  time after time and every time she failed to make the balance  sometimes she fell crumpled several times she all but struck the ground and once she did strike on her side and so hard as to knock the breath out of her  her master taking advantage of the moment to wipe the sweat from his streaming face nudged her about with his toe till she staggered weakly to her feet  the dog was never born thatd learn that trick for the promise of a bit of meat collins went on  any more than was the dog ever born thatd walk on its forelegs without having its hindlegs rapped up in the air with the stick a thousand times  yet you take that trick there  its always a winner especially with the womenso cunning you know so adorable cute to be yanked out of its beloved masters pocket and to have such trust and confidence in him as to allow herself to be tossed around that way  trust and confidence hell  hes put the fear of god into her thats what  just the same to dig a dainty out of your pocket once in a while and give an animal a nibble always makes a hit with the audience  thats about all its good for yet its a good stunt  audiences like to believe that the animals enjoy doing their tricks and that they are treated like pampered darlings and that they just love their masters to death  but god help all of us and our meal tickets if the audiences could see behind the scenes  every trainedanimal turn would be taken off the stage instanter and wed be all hunting for a job  yes and theres rough stuff no end pulled off on the stage right before the audiences eyes  the best fooler i ever saw was lotties  she had a bunch of trained cats  she loved them to death right before everybody especially if a trick wasnt going good  whatd she do  shed take that cat right up in her arms and kiss it  and when she put it down itd perform the trick all right all right while the audience applauded its silly head off for the kindness and humaneness shed shown  kiss it  did she  ill tell you what she did  she bit its nose  eleanor pavalo learned the trick from lottie and used it herself on her toy dogs  and many a dog works on the stage in a spiked collar and a clever man can twist a dogs nose and nobody in the audience any the wiser  but its the fear that counts  its what the dog knows hell get afterward when the turns over that keeps most of them straight  remember captain roberts and his great danes  they werent purebreds though  he must have had a dozen of themtoughest bunch of brutes i ever saw  he boarded them here twice  you couldnt go among them without a club in your hand  i had a mexican lad laid up by them  he was a tough one too  but they got him down and nearly ate him  the doctors took over forty stitches in him and shot him full of that pasteur dope for hydrophobia  and he always will limp with his right leg from what the dogs did to him  i tell you they were the limit  and yet every time the curtain went up captain roberts brought the house down with the first stunt  those dogs just flocked all over him loving him to death from the looks of it  and were they loving him  they hated him  ive seen him right here in the cage at cedarwild wade into them with a club and whale the stuffing impartially out of all of them  sure they loved him not  just a bit of the same old aniseed was what he used hed soak small pieces of meat in aniseed oil and stick them in his pockets  but that stunt would only work with a bunch of giant dogs like his  it was their size that got it across  had they been a lot of ordinary dogs it would have looked silly  and besides they didnt do their regular tricks for aniseed  they did it for captain robertss club  he was a tough bird himself  he used to say that the art of training animals was the art of inspiring them with fear  one of his assistants told me a nasty one about him afterwards  they had an off month in los angeles and captain roberts got it into his head he was going to make a dog balance a silver dollar on the neck of a champagne bottle  now just think that over and try to see yourself loving a dog into doing it  the assistant said he wore out about as many sticks as dogs and that he wore out half a dozen dogs  he used to get them from the public pound at two and a half apiece and every time one died he had another ready and waiting  and he succeeded with the seventh dog  im telling you it learned to balance a dollar on the neck of a bottle  and it died from the effects of the learning within a week after he put it on the stage  abscesses in the lungs from the stick  there was an englishman came over when i was a youngster  he had ponies monkeys and dogs  he bit the monkeys ears so that on the stage all he had to do was to make a move as if he was going to bite and theyd quit their fooling and be good  he had a big chimpanzee that was a winner  it could turn four somersaults as fast as you could count on the back of a galloping pony and he used to have to give it a real licking about twice a week  and sometimes the lickings were too stiff and the monkeyd get sick and have to lay off  but the owner solved the problem  he got to giving him a little licking a mere taste of the stick regular just before the turn came on  and that did it in his case though with some other case the monkey most likely would have got sullen and not acted at all  it was on that day that harris collins sold a valuable bit of information to a lion man who needed it  it was off time for him and his three lions were boarding at cedarwild  their turn was an exciting and even terrifying one when viewed from the audience for jumping about and roaring they were made to appear as if about to destroy the slender little lady who performed with them and seemed to hold them in subjection only by her indomitable courage and a small ridingswitch in her hand  the trouble is theyre getting too used to it the man complained isadora cant prod them up any more  they just wont make a showing  i know them collins nodded  theyre pretty old now and theyre spiritbroken besides  take old sark there  hes had so many blank cartridges fired into his ears that hes stone deaf  and selimhe lost his heart with his teeth  a portuguese fellow who was handling him for the barnum and bailey show did that for him  youve heard  ive often wondered the man shook his head  it must have been a smash  it was  the portuguese did it with an iron bar  selim was sulky and took a swipe at him with his paw and he whopped it to him full in the mouth just as he opened it to let out a roar  he told me about it himself  said selims teeth rattled on the floor like dominoes  but he shouldnt have done it  it was destroying valuable property  anyway they fired him for it  well all three of them aint worth much to me now said their owner they wont play up to isadora in that roaring and rampaging at the end it really made the turn  it was our finale and we always got a great hand for it  say what am i going to do about it anyway  ditch it  or get some young lions  isadora would be safer with the old ones collins said  too safe isadoras husband objected  of course with younger lions the work and responsibility piles up on me  but weve got to make our living and this turns about busted  harris collins shook his head  what dye meanwhats the idea the man demanded eagerly  theyll live for years yet seeing how captivity has agreed with them collins elucidated  if you invest in young lions you run the risk of having them pass out on you  and you can go right on pulling the trick off with what youve got  all youve got to do is to take my advice      the mastertrainer paused and the lion man opened his mouth to speak  which will cost you collins went on deliberately say three hundred dollars  just for some advice the other asked quickly  which i guarantee will work  what would you have to pay for three new lions  heres where you make money at three hundred  and its the simplest of advice  i can tell it to you in three words which is at the rate of a hundred dollars a word and one of the words is the  too steep for me the other objected  ive got a make a living  so have i collins assured him  thats why im here  im a specialist and youre paying a specialists fee  youll be as mad as a hornet when i tell you its that simple and for the life of me i cant understand why you dont already know it  and if it dont work was the dubious query  if it dont work you dont pay  well shoot it along the lion man surrendered  wire the cage said collins  at first the man could not comprehend then the light began to break on him  you mean      just that collins nodded  and nobody need be the wiser  dry batteries will do it beautifully  you can install them nicely under the cage floor  all isadora has to do when shes ready is to step on the button and when the electricity shoots through their feet if they dont go up in the air and rampage and roar around to beat the band not only can you keep the three hundred but ill give you three hundred more  i know  ive seen it done and it never misses fire  its just as though they were dancing on a redhot stove  up they go and every time they come down they burn their feet again  but youll have to put the juice into them slowly collins warned ill show you how to do the wiring  just a weak battery first so as they can work up to it and then stronger and stronger to the curtain and they never get used to it  as long as they live theyll dance just as lively as the first time  what do you think of it  its worth three hundred all right the man admitted  i wish i could make my money that easy     chapter xxix   guess ill have to wash my hands of him collins told johnny  i know del mar must have been right when he said he was the limit but i cant get a clue to it  this followed upon a fight between michael and collins  michael more morose than ever had become even crustytempered and scarcely with provocation at all had attacked the man he hated failing as ever to put his teeth into him and receiving in turn a couple of smashing kicks under his jaw  hes like a goldmine all right all right collins meditated but im hanged if i can crack it and hes getting grouchier every day  look at him  whatd he want to jump me for  i wasnt rough with him  hes piling up a sourball thatll make him fight a policeman some day  a few minutes later one of his patrons a towheaded young man who was boarding and rehearsing three performing leopards at cedarwild was asking collins for the loan of an airedale  ive only got one left now he explained and i aint safe without two  whats happened to the other one the mastertrainer queried  alphonsothats the big buck leopardgot nasty this morning and settled his hash  i had to put him out of his misery  he was gutted like a horse in the bullring  but he saved me all right  if it hadnt been for him id have got a mauling  alphonso gets these bad streaks just about every so often  thats the second dog hes killed for me  collins shook his head  havent got an airedale he said and just then his eyes chanced to fall on michael  try out the irish terrier he suggested  theyre like the airedale in disposition  pretty close cousins at any rate  i pin my faith on the airedale when it comes to lion dogs the leopard man demurred  sos an irish terrier a lion dog  take that one there  look at the size and weight of him  also take it from me hes all spunk  hell stand up to anything  try him out  ill lend him to you  if he makes good ill sell him to you cheap  an irish terrier for a leopard dog will be a novelty  if he gets fresh with them cats hell find his finish johnny told collins as michael was led away by the leopard man  then maybe the stage will lose a star collins answered with a shrug of shoulders  but ill have him off my chest anyway  when a dog gets a perpetual sourball like that hes finished  never can do a thing with them  ive had them on my hands before        and michael went to make the acquaintance of jack the surviving airedale and to do his daily turn with the leopards  in the big spotted cats he recognized the hereditary enemy and even before he was thrust into the cage his neck was all aprickle as the skin nervously tightened and the hair uprose stiffended  it was a nervous moment for all concerned the introduction of a new dog into the cage  the towheaded leopard man who was billed on the boards as raoul castlemon and was called ralph by his intimates was already in the cage  the airedale was with him while outside stood several men armed with iron bars and long steel forks  these weapons ready for immediate use were thrust between the bars as a menace to the leopards who were very much against their wills to be made to perform  they resented michaels intrusion on the instant spitting lashing their long tails and crouching to spring  at the same instant the trainer spoke with sharp imperativeness and raised his whip while the men on the outside lifted their irons and advanced them intimidatingly into the cage  and the leopards bitterwise of the taste of the iron remained crouched although they still spat and whipped their tails angrily  michael was no coward  he did not slink behind the man for protection on the other hand he was too sensible to rush to attack such formidable creatures  what he did do with bristling neckhair was to stalk stiff leggedly across the cage turn about with his face toward the danger and stalk stiffly back coming to a pause alongside of jack who gave him a goodnatured sniff of greeting  hes the stuff the trainer muttered in a curiously tense voice  they dont get his goat  the situation was deservedly tense and ralph developed it with cautious care making no abrupt movements his eyes playing everywhere over dogs and leopards and the men outside with the prods and bars  he made the savage cats come out of their crouch and separate from one another  at his word of command jack walked about among them  michael on his own initiative followed  and like jack he walked very stiffly on his guard and very circumspectly  one of them alphonso spat suddenly at him  he did not startle though his hair rippled erect and he bared his fangs in a silent snarl  at the same moment the nearest iron bar was shoved in threateningly close to alphonso who shifted his yellow eyes from michael to the bar and back again and did not strike out  the first day was the hardest  after that the leopards accepted michael as they accepted jack  no love was lost on either side nor were friendly overtures ever offered  michael was quick to realize that it was the men and dogs against the cats and that the men and does must stand together  each day he spent from an hour to two hours in the cage watching the rehearsing with nothing for him and jack to do save stand vigilantly on guard  sometimes when the leopards seemed better natured ralph even encouraged the two dogs to lie down  but on bad mornings he saw to it that they were ever ready to spring in between him and any possible attack  for the rest of the time michael shared his large pen with jack  they were well cared for as were all animals at cedarwild receiving frequent scrubbings and being kept clean of vermin  for a dog only three years old jack was very sedate  either he had never learned to play or had already forgotten how  on the other hand he was sweettempered and equable and he did not resent the early shows of crustiness which michael made  and michael quickly ceased from being crusty and took pleasure in their quiet companionship  there were no demonstrations they were content to lie awake by the hour merely pleasantly aware of each others proximity  occasionally michael could hear sara making a distant scene or sending out calls which he knew were for him  once she got away from her keeper and located michael coming out of the leopard cage  with a shrill squeal of joy she was upon him clinging to him and chattering the hysterical tale of all her woes since they had been parted  the leopard man looked on tolerantly and let her have her few minutes  it was her keeper who tore her away in the end cling as she would to michael screaming all the while like a harridan  when her hold was broken she sprang at the man in a fury and before he could throttle her to subjection sank her teeth into his thumb and wrist  all of which was provocative of great hilarity to the onlookers while her squalls and cries excited the leopards to spitting and leaping against their bars  and as she was borne away she set up a soft wailing like that of a heartbroken child        although michael proved a success with the leopards raoul castlemon never bought him from collins  one morning several days later the arena was vexed by uproar and commotion from the animal cages  the excitement starting with revolver shots was communicated everywhere the various lions raised a great roaring and the many dogs barked frantically  all tricks in the arena stopped the animals temporarily unstrung and unable to continue  several men among them collins ran in the direction of the cages  saras keeper dropped her chain in order to follow  its alphonsoshillings to pence it is collins called to one of his assistants who was running beside him  hell get ralph yet  the affair was all but over and leaping to its culmination when collins arrived  castlemon was just being dragged out and as collins ran he could see the two men drop him to the ground so that they might slam the cagedoor shut  inside in so wildly struggling a tangle on the floor that it was difficult to discern what animals composed it were alphonso jack and michael looked together  men danced about outside thrusting in with iron bars and trying to separate them  in the far end of the cage were the other two leopards nursing their wounds and snarling and striking at the iron rods that kept them out of the combat  saras arrival and what followed was a matter of seconds  trailing her chain behind her the little green monkey the tailed female who knew love and hysteria and was remote cousin to human women flashed up to the narrow cagebars and squeezed through  simultaneously the tangle underwent a violent upheaval  flung out with such force as to be smashed against the near end of the cage michael fell to the floor tried to spring up but crumpled and sank down his right shoulder streaming blood from a terrible mauling and crushing  to him sara leaped throwing her arms around him and mothering him up to her flat little hairy breast  she uttered solicitous cries and as michael strove to rise on his ruined foreleg scolded him with sharp gentleness and with her arms tried to hold him away from the battle  also in an interval her eyes malevolent in her rage she chattered piercing curses at alphonso  a crowbar shoved into his side distracted the big leopard  he struck at the weapon with his paw and when it was poked into him again flung himself upon it biting the naked iron with his teeth  with a second fling he was against the cage bars with a single slash of paw ripping down the forearm of the man who had poked him  the crowbar was dropped as the man leaped away  alphonso flung back on jack a sorry antagonist by this time who could only pant and quiver where he lay in the welter of what was left of him  michael had managed to get up on his three legs and was striving to stumble forward against the restraining arms of sara  the mad leopard was on the verge of springing upon them when deflected by another prod of the iron  this time he went straight at the man fetching up against the cagebars with such fierceness as to shake the structure  more men began thrusting with more rods but alphonso was not to be balked  sara saw him coming and screamed her shrillest and savagest at him  collins snatched a revolver from one of the men  dont kill him castlemon cried seizing collinss arm  the leopard man was in a bad way himself  one arm dangled helplessly at his side while his eyes filling with blood from a scalp wound he wiped on the mastertrainers shoulder so that he might see  hes my property he protested  and hes worth a hundred sick monkeys and sourballed terriers  anyway well get them out all right  give me a chancesomebody mop my eyes out please  i cant see  ive used up my blank cartridges  has anybody any blanks  one moment sara would interpose her body between michael and the leopard which was still being delayed by the prodding irons and the next moment she would turn to screech at the fanged cat is if by very advertisement of her malignancy she might intimidate him into keeping back  michael dragging her with him growling and bristling staggered forward a couple of threelegged steps gave at the ruined shoulder and collapsed  and then sara did the great deed  with one last scream of utmost fury she sprang full into the face of the monstrous cat tearing and scratching with hands and feet her mouth buried into the roots of one of its stubby ears  the astounded leopard upreared with his forepaws striking and ripping at the little demon that would not let go  the fight and the life in the little green monkey lasted a short ten seconds  but this was sufficient for collins to get the door ajar and with a quick clutch on michaels hindleg jerk him out and to the ground     chapter xxx   no roughandready surgery of the del mar sort obtained at cedarwild else michael would not have lived  a real surgeon skilful and audacious came very close to vivisecting him as he radically repaired the ruin of a shoulder doing things he would not have dared with a human but which proved to be correct for michael  hell always be lame the surgeon said wiping his hands and gazing down at michael who lay for the most part of him a motionless prisoner set in plaster of paris  all the healing and theres plenty of it will have to be by first intention  if his temperature shoots up well have to put him out of his misery  whats he worth  he has no tricks collins answered  possibly fifty dollars and certainly not that now  lame dogs are not worth teaching tricks to  time was to prove both men wrong  michael was not destined to permanent lameness although in afteryears his shoulder was always tender and on occasion when the weather was damp he was compelled to ease it with a slight limp  on the other hand he was destined to appreciate to a great price and to become the star performer harry del mar had predicted of him  in the meantime he lay for many weary days in the plaster and abstained from raising a dangerous temperature  the care taken of him was excellent  but not out of love and affection was it given  it was merely a part of the system at cedarwild which made the institution such a success  when he was taken out of the plaster he was still denied that instinctive pleasure which all animals take in licking their wounds for shrewdly arranged bandages were wrapped and buckled on him  and when they were finally removed there were no wounds to lick though deep in the shoulder was a pain that required months in which to die out  harris collins bothered him no more with trying to teach him tricks and one day loaned him as a fillerin to a man and woman who had lost three of their dogtroupe by pneumonia  if he makes out you can have him for twenty dollars collins told the man wilton davis  and if he croaks davis queried  collins shrugged his shoulders  i wont sit up nights worrying about him  hes unteachable  and when michael departed from cedarwild in a crate on an express wagon he might well have never returned for wilton davis was notorious among trainedanimal men for his cruelty to dogs  some care he might take of a particular dog with a particularly valuable trick but mere fillersin came too cheaply  they cost from three to five dollars apiece  worse than that so far as he was concerned michael had cost nothing  and if he died it meant nothing to davis except the trouble of finding another dog  the first stage of michaels new adventure involved no unusual hardship despite the fact that he was so cramped in his crate that he could not stand up and that the jolting and handling of the crate sent countless twinges of pain shooting through his shoulder  the journey was only to brooklyn where he was duly delivered to a secondrate theatre wilton davis being so indifferent a secondrate animal man that he could never succeed in getting time with the big circuits  the hardship of the cramped crate began after michael had been carried into a big room above the stage and deposited with nearly a score of similarly crated dogs  a sorry lot they were all of them scrubs and most of them spiritbroken and miserable  several had bad sores on their heads from being knocked about by davis  no care was taken of these sores and they were not improved by the whitening that was put on them for concealment whenever they performed  some of them howled lamentably at times and every little while as if it were all that remained for them to do in their narrow cells all of them would break out into barking  michael was the only one who did not join in these choruses  long since as one feature of his developing moroseness he had ceased from barking he had become too unsociable for any such demonstrations nor did he pattern after the example of some of the sourertempered dogs in the room who were for ever bickering and snarling through the slats of their cages  in fact michaels sourness of temper had become too profound even for quarrelling  all he desired was to be let alone and of this he had a surfeit for the first fortyeight hours  wilton davis had assembled his troupe ahead of time so that the change of programme was five days away  having taken advantage of this to go to see his wifes people over in new jersey he had hired one of the stage hands to feed and water his dogs  this the stagehand would have done had he not had the misfortune to get into an altercation with a barkeeper which culminated in a fractured skull and an ambulance ride to the receiving hospital  to make the situation perfect for what followed the theatre was closed for three days in order to make certain alterations demanded by the fire commissioners  no one came near the room and after several hours michael grew aware of hunger and thirst  the time passed and the desire for food was supplanted by the desire for water  by nightfall the barking and yelping became continuous changing through the long night hours to whimpering and whining  michael alone made no sound suffering dumbly in the bedlam of misery  morning of the second day dawned the slow hours dragged by to the second night and the darkness of the second night drew down upon a scene behind the scenes sufficient of itself to condemn all trainedanimal acts in all theatres and showtents of all the world  whether michael dreamed or was in semidelirium there is no telling but whichever it was he lived most of his past life over again  again he played as a puppy on the broad verandas of mister haggins plantation bungalow at meringe or with jerry stalked the edges of the jungle down by the riverbank to spy upon the crocodiles or learning from mister haggin and bob and patterning after biddy and terrence to consider black men as lesser and despised gods who must for ever be kept strictly in their places  on the schooner eugenie he sailed with captain kellar his second master and on the beach at tulagi lost his heart to steward of the magic fingers and sailed away with him and kwaque on the steamer makambo steward was most in his visions against a hazy background of vessels and of individuals like the ancient mariner simon nishikanta grimshaw captain doane and little old ah moy  nor least of all did scraps appear and cocky the valianthearted little fluff of life gallantly bearing himself through his brief adventure in the sun  and it would seem to michael that on one side clinging to him cocky talked farrago in his ear and on the other side sara clung to him and chattered an interminable and incommunicable tale  and then deep about the roots of his ears would seem to prod the magic caressing fingers of steward the beloved  i just dont i have no luck wilton davis mourned gazing about at his dogs the air still vibrating with the string of oaths he had at first ripped out  that comes of trusting a drunken stagehand his wife remarked placidly  i wouldnt be surprised if half of them died on us now  well this is no time for talk davis snarled proceeding to take off his coat  get busy my love and learn the worst  waters what they need  ill give them a tub of it  bucketful by bucketful from the tap at the sink in the corner he filled a large galvanizediron tub  at sound of the running water the dogs began whimpering and yelping and moaning  some tried to lick his hands with their swollen tongues as he dragged them roughly out of their cages the weaker ones crawled and bellied toward the tub and were overtrod by the stronger ones  there was not room for all and the stronger ones drank first with much fighting and squabbling and slashing of fangs into the foremost of this was michael slashing and being slashed but managing to get hasty gulps of the lifesaving fluid  davis danced about among them kicking right and left so that all might have a chance  his wife took a hand laying about her with a mop  it was a pandemonium of pain for their parched throats softened by the water they were again able to yelp and cry out loudly all their hurt and woe  several were too weak to get to the water so it was carried to them and doused and splashed into their mouths  it seemed that they would never be satisfied  they lay in collapse all about the room but every little while one or another would crawl over to the tub and try to drink more in the meantime davis had started a fire and filled a caldron with potatoes  the place stinks like a den of skunks mrs davis observed pausing from dabbing the end of her nose with a powderpuff  dearest well just have to wash them  all right sweetheart her husband agreed  and the quicker the better  we can get through with it while the potatoes are boiling and cooling  ill scrub them and you dry them  remember that pneumonia and do it thoroughly  it was quick rough bathing  reaching out for the dogs nearest him he flung them in turn into the tub from which they had drunk  when they were frightened or when they objected in any way he rapped them on the head with the scrubbing brush or the bar of yellow laundry soap with which he was lathering them  several minutes sufficed for a dog  drink damn you drinkhave some more he would say as he shoved their heads down and under the dirty soapy water  he seemed to hold them responsible for their horrible condition to look upon their filthiness as a personal affront  michael yielded to being flung into the tub  he recognized that baths were necessary and compulsory although they were administered in much better fashion at cedarwild while kwaque and steward had made a sort of love function of it when they bathed him  so he did his best to endure the scrubbing and all might have been well had not davis soused him under  michael jerked his head up with a warning growl  davis suspended halfway the blow he was delivering with the heavy brush and emitted a low whistle of surprise  hello he said  and look whos herelovey this is the irish terrier i got from collins  hes no good  collins said so  just a fill inget out he commanded michael  thats all you get now mr fresh dog  but take it from me pretty soon youll be getting it fast enough to make you dizzy  while the potatoes were cooling mrs davis kept the hungry dogs warned away by sharp cries  michael lay down sullenly to one side and took no part in the rush for the trough when permission was given  again davis danced among them kicking away the stronger and the more eager  if they get to fighting after all weve done for them kick in their ribs lovey he told his wife  there  you would would youthis to a large black dog accompanied by a savage kick in the side  the animal yelped its pain as it fled away and from a safe distance looked on piteously at the steaming food  well after this they cant say i dont never give my dogs a bath davis remarked from the sink where he was rinsing his arms  what dye say we call it a days work my dear  mrs davis nodded agreement  we can rehearse them tomorrow and next day  that will be plenty of time ill run in tonight and boil them some bran  theyll need an extra meal after fasting two days  the potatoes finished the dogs were put back in their cages for another twentyfour hours of close confinement  water was poured into their drinkingtins and in the evening still in their cages they were served liberally with boiled bran and dogbiscuit  this was michaels first food for he had sulkily refused to go near the potatoes        the rehearsing took place on the stage and for michael trouble came at the very start  the dropcurtain was supposed to go up and reveal the twenty dogs seated on chairs in a semicircle  because while they were being thus arranged the preceding turn was taking place in front of the dropcurtain it was imperative that rigid silence should be kept  next when the curtain rose on full stage the dogs were trained to make a great barking  as a fillerin michael had nothing to do but sit on a chair  but he had to get upon the chair first and when davis so ordered him he accompanied the order with a clout on the side of the head  michael growled warningly  oh ho eh the man sneered  its fresh dog looking for trouble well you might as well get it over with now so your name can be changed to good dogmy dear just keep the rest of them in order while i teach fresh dog lesson number one  of the beating that followed the least said the better  michael put up a fight that was hopeless and was thoroughly beaten in return  bruised and bleeding he sat on the chair taking no part in the performance and only sullenly engendering a deeper and bitterer sourness  to keep silent before the curtain went up was no hardship for him  but when the curtain did go up he declined to join the rest of the dogs in their frantic barking and yelping  the dogs sometimes alone and sometimes in couples and trios and groups left their chairs at command and performed the conventional dog tricks such as walking on hindlegs hopping limping waltzing and throwing somersaults  wilton daviss temper was short and his hand heavy throughout the rehearsal as the shrill yelps of pain from the lagging and stupid attested  in all during that day and the forenoon of the next three long rehearsals took place  michaels troubles ceased for the time being  at command he silently got on the chair and silently sat there  which shows dearest what a bit of the stick will do davis bragged to his wife  nor did the pair of them dream of the scandalizing part michael was going to play in their first performance  behind the curtain all was ready on the full stage  the dogs sat on their chairs in abject silence with davis and his wife menacing them to remain silent while in front of the curtain dick and daisy bell delighted the matinee audience with their singing and dancing  and all went well and no one in the audience would have suspected the full stage of dogs behind the curtain had not dick and daisy accompanied by the orchestra begun to sing roll me down to rio  michael could not help it  even as kwaque had long before mastered him by the jews harp and steward by love and harry del mar by the harmonica so now was he mastered by the strains of the orchestra and the voices of the man and woman lifting the old familiar rhythm taught him by steward of roll me down to rio  despite himself despite his sullenness the forces compulsive opened his jaws and set all his throat vibrating in accompaniment  from beyond the curtain came a titter of children and women that grew into a roar and drowned out the voices of dick and daisy  wilton davis cursed unbelievably as he sprang down the stage to michael  but michael howled on and the audience laughed on  michael was still howling when the short club smote him  the shock and hurt of it made him break off and yelp an involuntary cry of pain  knock his block off dearest mrs davis counselled  and then ensued battle royal  davis struck shrewd blows that could be heard as were heard the snarls and growls of michael  the audience under the sway of the comic ignored dick and daisy bell  their turn was spoiled  the davis turn was queered as wilton impressed it  michaels block was knocked off within the meaning of the term  and the audience on the other side of the curtain was edified and delighted  dick and daisy could not continue  the audience wanted what was behind the curtain not in front of it  michael was taken off stage thoroughly throttled by one of the stagehands and the curtain arose on the full setfull save for the one empty chair  the boys in the audience first realized the connection between the empty chair and the previous uproar and began clamouring for the absent dog  the audience took up the cry the dogs barked more excitedly and five minutes of hilarity delayed the turn which when at last started was marked by rustiness and erraticness on the part of the dogs and by great peevishness on the part of wilton davis  never mind honey his imperturbable wife assured him in a stage whisper  well just ditch that dog and get a regular one  and anyway weve put one over on that daisy bell  i aint told you yet what she said about me only last week to some of my friends  several minutes later still on the stage and handling his animals the husband managed a chance to mutter to his wife its the dog  its him im after  im going to lay him out  yes dearest she agreed  the curtain down with a gleeful audience in front and with the dogs back in the room over the stage wilton davis descended to look for michael who instead of cowering in some corner stood between the legs of the stagehand quivering yet from his mishandling and threatening to fight as hard as ever if attacked  on his way davis encountered the songand dance couple  the woman was in a tearful rage the man in a dry one  youre a peach of a dog man you are he announced belligerently heres where you get yours  you keep away from me or ill lay you out wilton davis responded desperately brandishing a short iron bar in his right hand  besides you just wait if you want to and ill lay you out afterward  but first of all im going to lay out that dog  come on along and seedamn him how was i to know  he was a new one  he never peeped in rehearsal  how was i to know he was going to yap when we arranged the set behind you  youve raised hell the manager of the theatre greeted davis as the latter trailed by dick bell came upon michael bristling from between the legs of the stagehand  nothing to what im going to raise davis retorted shortening his grip on the iron bar and raising it  im going to kill m  im going to beat the life out of him  you just watch  michael snarled acknowledgment of the threat crouched to spring and kept his eyes on the iron weapon  i just guess you aint goin to do anything of the sort the stagehand assured davis  its my property the latter asserted with an air of legal convincingness  and against it im goin to stack up my common sense was the stage hands reply  you tap him once and see what youll get  dogs is dogs and men is men but im damned if i know what you are  you cant pull off rough stuff on that dog  first time he was on a stage in his life after being starved and thirsted for two days  oh i know mr manager  if you kill the dog itll cost you a dollar to the garbage man to get rid of the carcass the manager took up  ill pay it gladly davis said again lifting the iron bar  ive got some comeback aint i  you animal guys make me sick the stagehand uttered  you just make me draw the line somewheres  and here it is you tap him once with that baby crowbar and ill tap you hard enough to lose me my job and to send you to hospital  now look here jackson     the manager began threateningly  you cant say nothin to me was the retort  my minds made up  if that cheap guy lays a finger on that dog im just sure goin to lose my job  im gettin tired anyway of seein these skates beatin up their animals  theyve made me sick clean through  the manager looked to davis and shrugged his shoulders helplessly  theres no use pulling off a roughhouse he counselled  i dont want to lose jackson and hell put you into hospital if he ever gets started send the dog back where you got him  your wifes told me about him stick him into a box and send him back collect  collins wont mind hell take the singing out of him and work him into something  davis with another glance at the truculent jackson wavered  ill tell you what the manager went on persuasively  jackson will attend to the whole thing box him up ship him everythingwont you jackson  the stagehand nodded curtly then reached down and gently caressed michaels bruised head  well davis gave in turning on his heel they can make fools of themselves over dogs them that wants to  but when theyve been in the business as long as i have         chapter xxxi   a post card from davis to collins explained the reasons for michaels return  he sings too much to suit my fancy was daviss way of putting it thereby unwittingly giving the clue to what collins had vainly sought and which collins as unwittingly failed to grasp  as he told johnny  from the looks of the beatings hes got no wonder hes been singing thats the trouble with these animal people  they dont know how to take care of their property  they hammer its head off and get grouched because it aint an angel of obedienceput him away johnny  wash him clean and put on the regular dressing wherever the skins broken  i give him up myself but ill find some place for him in the next bunch of dogs  two weeks later by sheerest accident harris collins made the discovery for himself of what michael was good for  in a spare moment in the arena he had sent for him to be tried out by a dog man who needed several fillersin  beyond what he knew such as at command to stand up to lie down to come here and go there michael had done nothing  he had refused to learn the most elementary things a showdog should know and collins had left him to go over to another part of the arena where a monkey band on a sort of mimic stage was being arranged and broken in  frightened and mutinous nevertheless the monkeys were compelled to perform by being tied to their seats and instruments and by being pulled and jerked from off stage by wires fastened to their bodies  the leader of the orchestra an irascible elderly monkey sat on a revolving stool to which he was securely attached  when poked from off the stage by means of long poles he flew into ecstasies of rage  at the same time by a rope arrangement his chair was whirled around and around  to an audience the effect would be that he was angered by the blunders of his fellowmusicians  and to an audience such anger would be highly ludicrous  as collins said  a monkey band is always a winner  it fetches the laugh and the moneys in the laugh  humans just have to laugh at monkeys because theyre so similar and because the human has the advantage and feels himself superior  suppose were walking along the street you and me and you slip and fall down  of course i laugh  thats because im superior to you  i didnt fall down  same thing if your hat blows off  i laugh while you chase it down the street  im superior  my hats still on my head  same thing with the monkey band  all the fool things of it make us feel so superior  we dont see ourselves as foolish  thats why we pay to see the monkeys behave foolish  it was scarcely a matter of training the monkeys  rather was it the training of the men who operated the concealed mechanisms that made the monkeys perform  to this harris collins was devoting his effort  there isnt any reason why you fellows cant make them play a real tune its up to you just according to how you pull the wires  come on  its worth going in for  lets try something you all know  and remember the regular orchestra will always help you out  now what do you all know something simple and something the audiencell know too  he became absorbed in trying out the idea and even borrowed a circus rider whose act was to play the violin while standing on the back of a galloping horse and to throw somersaults on such precarious platform while still playing the violin  this man he got merely to play simple airs in slow time so that the assistants could keep the time and the air and pull the wires accordingly  of course if you make a howling mistake collins told them thats when you all pull the wires like mad and poke the leader and whirl him around  that always brings down the house  they think hes got a real musical ear and is mad at his orchestra for the discord  in the midst of the work johnny and michael came along  that guy says he wouldnt take him for a gift johnny reported to his employer  all right all right put him back in the kennels collins ordered hurriedlynow you fellows all ready  home sweet home  go to it fisher  now keep the time the rest of you    thats it  with a full orchestra youre making motions like the tunefaster you simmons  you drag behind all the time  and the accident happened  johnny instead of immediately obeying the order and taking michael back to the kennels lingered in the hope of seeing the orchestra leader whirled chattering around on his stool  the violinist within a yard of where michael sat squatted on his haunches played the notes of home sweet home with loud slow exactitude and emphasis  and michael could not help it  no more could he help it than could he help responding with a snarl when threatened by a club no more could he help it than when he had spoiled the turn of dick and daisy bell when swept by the strains of roll me down to rio no more could he help it than could jerry on the deck of the ariel help singing when villa kennan put her arms around him smothered him deliciously in her cloud of hair and sang his memory back into time and the fellowship of the ancient pack  as with jerry was it with michael  music was a drug of dream  he too remembered the lost pack and sought it seeing the bare hills of snow and the stars glimmering overhead through the frosty darkness of night hearing the faint answering howls from other hills as the pack assembled  lost the pack was through the thousands of years michaels ancestors had lived by the fires of men yet remembered always it was when the magic of rhythm poured through him and flooded his being with visions and sensations of that otherwhere which in his own life he had never known  compounded with the waking dream of otherwhere was the memory of steward and the love of steward with whom he had learned to sing the very series of notes that now were being reproduced by the circusrider violinist and michaels jaw dropped down his throat vibrated his forefeet made restless little movements as if in the body he were running as truly he was running in the mind back to steward back through all the ages to the lost pack and with the shadowy lost pack itself across the snowy wastes and through the forest aisles in the hunt of the meat  the spectral forms of the lost pack were all about him as he sang and ran in openeyed dream the violinist paused in surprise the men poked the monkey leader of the monkey orchestra and whirled him about wildly raging on his revolving stool and johnny laughed  but harris collins took note  he had heard michael accurately follow the air  he had heard him singnot merely howl but sing  silence fell  the monkey leader ceased revolving and chattering  the men who had poked him held poles and wires suspended in their hands  the rest of the monkey orchestra merely shivered in apprehension of what next atrocity should be perpetrated  the violinist stared  johnny still heaved from his laughter  but harris collins pondered scratched his head and continued to ponder  you cant tell me     he began vaguely  i know it  i heard it that dog carried the tune  didnt he now  i leave it to all of you didnt he  the damned dog sang  ill stake my life on ithold on you fellows rest the monkeys off  this is worth following upmr violinist play that over again now home sweet homelet her go press her strong and loud and slownow watch all of you and listen and tell me if im crazy or if that dog aint carrying the tunethere what dye call it  aint it  there was no discussion  michaels jaw dropped and his forefeet began their restless lifting after several measures had been played  and harris collins stepped close to him and sang with him and in accord  harry del mar was right when he said that dog was the limit and sold his troupe  he knew  the dogs a dog caruso  no howling chorus of mutts such as kingman used to carry around with him but a real singer a soloist  no wonder he wouldnt learn tricks  he had his specially all the time  and just to think of it  i as good as gave him away to that dogkilling wilton davis  only he came backjohnny take extra care of him after this  bring him up to the house this afternoon and ill give him a real tryout  my daughter plays the violin  well see what music hell sing with her  theres a mint of money in him take it from me        thus was michael discovered  the afternoons tryout was partially successful  after vainly attempting strange music on him collins found that he could sing and would sing god save the king and sweet bye and bye  many hours of many days were spent in the quest  vainly he tried to teach michael new airs  michael put no heart of love in the effort and sullenly abstained  but whenever one of the songs he had learned from steward was played he responded  he could not help responding  the magic was stronger than he  in the end collins discovered five of the six songs he knew god save the king sweet bye and bye lead kindly light home sweet home and roll me down to rio  michael never sang shenandoah because collins and collinss daughter did not know the old seachanty and therefore were unable to suggest it to him  five songs are enough if he wont never learn another note collins concluded  theyll make him a billtopper anywhere  theres a mint in him  hang me if i wouldnt take him out on the road myself if only i was young and footloose     chapter xxxii   and so michael was ultimately sold to one jacob henderson for two thousand dollars  and im giving him away to you at that said collins  if you dont refuse five thousand for him before six months i dont know anything about the show game  hell skin that last arithmetic dog of yours to a finish and you wont have to show yourself and work every minute of the turn  and if you dont insure him for fifty thousand as soon as hes made good youll be a fool  why i wouldnt ask anything better if i was young and footloose than to take him out on the road myself  henderson proved totally different from any master michael had had  the man was a neutral sort of creature  he was neither good nor evil  he neither drank smoked nor swore nor did he go to church or belong to the ymca  he was a vegetarian without being a bigoted one liked moving pictures when they were concerned with travel and spent most of his spare time in reading swedenborg  he had no temper whatever  nobody had ever witnessed anger in him and all said he had the patience of job he was even timid of policemen freight agents and conductors though he was not afraid of them  he was not afraid of anything any more than was he enamoured of anything save swedenborg  he was as colourless of character as the neutralcoloured clothes he wore as the neutralcoloured hair that sprawled upon his crown as the neutralcoloured eyes with which he observed the world  nor was he a fool any more than was he a wise man or a scholar  he gave little to life asked little of life and in the show business was a recluse in the very heart of life  michael neither liked nor disliked him but rather merely accepted him they travelled the united states over together and they never had a quarrel  not once did henderson raise his voice sharply to michael and not once did michael snarl a warning at him  they simply endured together existed together because the currents of life had drifted them together  of course there was no heartbond between them  henderson was master  michael was hendersons chattel  michael was as dead to him as he was himself dead to all things  yet jacob henderson was fair and square businesslike and methodical once each day when not travelling on the interminable trains he gave michael a thorough bath and thoroughly dried him afterward  he was never harsh nor hasty in the bathing  michael never was aware whether he liked or disliked the bathing function  it was all one part of his own fate in the world as it was part of hendersons fate to bathe him every so often  michaels own work was tolerably easy though monotonous  leaving out the eternal travelling the neverending jumps from town to town and from city to city he appeared on the stage once each night for seven nights in the week and for two afternoon performances in the week  the curtain went up leaving him alone on the stage in the full set that befitted a billtopper  henderson stood in the wings unseen by the audience and looked on  the orchestra played four of the pieces michael had been taught by steward and michael sang them for his modulated howling was truly singing  he never responded to more than one encore which was always home sweet home  after that while the audience clapped and stamped its approval and delight of the dog caruso jacob henderson would appear on the stage bowing and smiling in stereotyped gladness and gratefulness rest his right hand on michaels shoulders with a playacted assumption of comradeliness whereupon both henderson and michael would bow ere the final curtain went down  and yet michael was a prisoner a lifeprisoner  fed well bathed well exercised well he never knew a moment of freedom  when travelling days and nights he spent in the cage which however was generous enough to allow him to stand at full height and to turn around without too uncomfortable squirming  sometimes in hotels in country towns out of the crate he shared hendersons room with him  otherwise unless other animals were hewing on the same circuit time he had outside his cage the freedom of the animal room attached to the particular theatre where he performed for from three days to a week  but there was never a chance never a moment when he might run free of a cage about him of the walls of a room restricting him of a chain shackled to the collar about his throat  in good weather in the afternoons henderson often took him for a walk  but always it was at the end of a chain  and almost always the way led to some park where henderson fastened the other end of the chain to the bench on which he sat and browsed swedenborg  not one act of free agency was left to michael  other dogs ran free playing with one another or behaving bellicosely  if they approached him for purposes of investigation or acquaintance henderson invariably ceased from his reading long enough to drive them away  a life prisoner to a lifeless gaoler life was all grey to michael  his moroseness changed to a deepseated melancholy  he ceased to be interested in life and in the freedom of life  not that he regarded the play of life about him with a jaundiced eye but rather that his eyes became unseeing  debarred from life he ignored life  he permitted himself to become a sheer puppet slave eating taking his baths travelling in his cage performing regularly and sleeping much  he had pridethe pride of the thoroughbred the pride of the north american indian enslaved on the plantations of the west indies who died uncomplaining and unbroken  so michael  he submitted to the cage and the iron of the chain because they were too strong for his muscles and teeth  he did his slavetask of performance and rendered obedience to jacob henderson but he neither loved nor feared that master  and because of this his spirit turned in on itself  he slept much brooded much and suffered unprotestingly a great loneliness  had henderson made a bid for his heart he would surely have responded but henderson had a heart only for the fantastic mental gyrations of swedenborg and merely made his living out of michael  sometimes there were hardships  michael accepted them  especially hard did he find railroad travel in wintertime when on occasion fresh from the last nights performance in a town he remained for hours in his crate on a truck waiting for the train that would take him to the next town of performance  there was a night on a station platform in minnesota when two dogs of a troupe on the next truck to his froze to death  he was himself well frosted and the cold bit abominably into his shoulder wounded by the leopard but a better constitution and better general care of him enabled him to survive  compared with other show animals he was well treated  and much of the illtreatment accorded other animals on the same turn with him he did not comprehend or guess  one turn with which he played for three months was a scandal amongst all vaudeville performers  even the hardiest of them heartily disliked the turn and the man although duckworth and duckworths trained cats and rats were an invariable popular success  trained cats sniffed dainty little pearl la pearle the bicyclist crushed cats thats what they are  all the cat has been beaten out of their blood and theyve become rats  you cant tell me  i know  trained rats manuel fonseca the contortionist exploded in the bar room of the hotel annandale after refusing to drink with duckworth doped rats believe me  why dont they jump off when they crawl along the tight rope with a cat in front and a cat behind  because they aint got the life in m to jump  theyre doped straight doped when theyre fresh and starved afterward so as to making a saving on the dope  they never are fed  you cant tell me  i know  else why does he use up anywhere to forty or fifty rats a week  i know his express shipments when he cant buy m in the towns  my gawd protested miss merle merryweather the accordion girl who looked like sixteen on the stage but who in private life among her grandchildren acknowledged fortyeight  my gawd how the public can fall for it gets my honesttogawd goat  i looked myself yesterday morning early  out of thirty rats there were seven deadstarved to death  he never feeds them  theyre dying rats dying of starvation when they crawl along that rope  thats why they crawl  if they had a bit of bread and cheese in their tummies theyd jump and run to get away from the cats  theyre dying theyre dying right there on the rope trying to crawl as a dying man would try to crawl away from a tiger that was eating him  and my gawd  the bonehead audience sits there and applauds the show as an educational act  but the audience  wonderful things kindness will do with animals said a member of one a banker and a deacon  even human love can be taught to them by kindness  the cat and the rat have been enemies since the world began  yet here tonight we have seen them doing highly trained feats together and neither a cat committed one hostile or overt act against a rat nor ever a rat showed it was afraid of a cat  human kindness  the power of human kindness  the lion and the lamb said another  we have it that when the millennium comes the lion and the lamb will lie down togetherand outside each other my dear outside each other  and this is a forecast a proving up by man ahead of the day  cats and rats  think of it  and it shows conclusively the power of kindness  i shall see to it at once that we get pets for our own children our palm branches  they shall learn kindness early to the dog the cat yes even the rat and the pretty linnet in its cage  but said his dear beside him you remember what blake said     a robin redbreast in a cage    puts all heaven in a rage  ahbut not when it is treated truly with kindness my dear  i shall immediately order some rabbits and a canary or two andwhat sort of a dog would you prefer our dear little ones to have to play with my sweet  and his dear looked at him in all his imperturbable complacent selfconsciousness of kindness and saw herself the little rural school teacher who with ella wheeler wilcox and lord byron as her idols and with the dream of herself writing poems of passion had come up to topeka town to be beaten by the game into marrying the solid substantial business man beside her who enjoyed delight in the spectacle of cats and rats walking the tightrope in amity and who was blissfully unaware that she was the robin redbreast in a cage that put all heaven in a rage  the rats are bad enough said miss merle merryweather  but look how he uses up the cats  hes had three die on him in the last two weeks to my certain knowledge  theyre only alleycats but theyve got feelings its that boxing match that does for them  the boxing match sure always of a great hand from the audience invariably concluded duckworths turn  two cats with small boxinggloves were put on a table for a friendly bout  naturally the cats that performed with the rats were too cowed for this  it was the fresh cats he used the ones with spunk and spirit    until they lost all spunk and spirit or sickened and died  to the audience it was a side splitting playful encounter between fourlegged creatures who thus displayed a ridiculous resemblance to superior twolegged man  but it was not playful to the cats  they were always excited into starting a real fight with each other off stage just before they were brought on  in the blows they struck were anger and pain and bewilderment and fear  and the gloves just would come off so that they were ripping and tearing at each other biting as well as making the fur fly like furies when the curtain went down  in the eyes of the audience this apparent impromptu was always the ultimate scream and the laughter and applause would compel the curtain up again to reveal duckworth and an assistant stage hand as if caught by surprise fanning the two belligerents with towels  but the cats themselves were so continually torn and scratched that the wounds never had a chance to heal and became infected until they were a mass of sores  on occasion they died or when they had become too abjectly spiritless to attack even a rat were set to work on the tight rope with the doped starved rats that were too near dead to run away from them  and as miss merle merryweather said the bonehead audiences tickled to death applauded duckworths trained cats and rats as an educational act  a big chimpanzee that covered one of the circuits with michael had an antipathy for clothes  like a horse that fights the putting on of the bridle and after it is on takes no further notice of it so the big chimpanzee fought the putting on the clothes  once on it was ready to go out on the stage and through its turn  but the rub was in putting on the clothes  it took the owner and two stagehands pulling him up to a ring in the wall and throttling him to dress himand this despite the fact that the owner had long since knocked out his incisors  all this cruelty michael sensed without knowing  and he accepted it as the way of life as he accepted the daylight and the dark the bite of the frost on bleak and windy station platforms the mysterious land of otherwhere that he knew in dreams and song the equally mysterious nothingness into which had vanished meringe plantation and ships and oceans and men and steward     chapter xxxiii   for two years michael sang his way over the united states to fame for himself and to fortune for jacob henderson  there was never any time off  so great was his success that henderson refused flattering offers to cross the atlantic to show in europe  but offtime did come to michael when henderson fell ill of typhoid in chicago  it was a threemonths vacation for michael who well treated but still a prisoner spent it in a caged kennel in mulcachys animal home mulcachy one of harris collinss brightest graduates had emulated his master by setting up in business in chicago where he ran everything with the same rigid cleanliness sanitation and scientific cruelty  michael received nothing but the excellent food and the cleanliness but a solitary and brooding prisoner in his cage he could not help but sense the atmosphere of pain and terror about him of the animals being broken for the delight of men  mulcachy had originated aphorisms of his own which he continually enunciated among which were  take it from me when an animal wont give way to pain it cant be broke  pain is the only schoolteacher  just as you got to take the buck out of a broncho youve got to take the bite out of a lion  you cant break animals with a feather duster  the thicker the skull the thicker the crowbar  theyll always beat you in argument  first thing is to club the argument out of them  heartbonds between trainers and animals  son thats dope for the newspaper interviewer  the only heartbond i know is a stout stick with some iron on the end of it  sure you can make m eat outa your hand  but the thing to watch out for is that they dont eat your hand  a blank cartridge in the nose just about that time is the best preventive i know  there were days when all the air was vexed with roars and squalls of ferocity and agony from the arena until the last animal in the cages was excited and ill at ease  in truth since it was mulcachys boast that he could break the best animal living no end of the hardest cases fell to his hand  he had built a reputation for succeeding where others failed and endowed with fearlessness callousness and cunning he never let his reputation wane  there was nothing he dared not tackle and when he gave up an animal the last word was said  for it remained nothing but to be a cageanimal in solitary confinement pacing ever up and down embittered with all the world of man and roaring its bitterness to the most delicious enthrillment of the payspectators  during the three months spent by michael in mulcachys animal home occurred two especially hard cases  of course the daily chant of ordinary pain of training went on all the time through the working hours such as of good bears and lions and tigers that were made amenable under stress and of elephants derricked and gaffed into making the head stand or into the beating of a bass drum  but the two cases that were exceptional put a mood of depression and fear into all the listening animals such as humans might experience in an anteroom of hell listening to the flailing and the flaying of their fellows who had preceded them into the torturechamber  the first was of the big indian tiger  freeborn in the jungle and free all his days master according to his nature and prowess of all other living creatures including his fellowtigers he had come to grief in the end and from the trap to the cramped cage by elephantback and railroad and steamship ever in the cramped cage he had journeyed across seas and continents to mulcachys animal home  prospective buyers had examined but not dared to purchase  but mulcachy had been undeterred his own fighting blood leapt hot at sight of the magnificent striped cat it was a challenge of the brute in him to excel  and two weeks of hell for the great tiger and for all the other animals were required to teach him his first lesson  ben bolt he had been named and he arrived indomitable and irreconcilable though almost paralysed from eight weeks of cramp in his narrow cage which had restricted all movement  mulcachy should have undertaken the job immediately but two weeks were lost by the fact that he had got married and honeymooned for that length of time  and in that time in a large cage of concrete and iron ben bolt had exercised and recovered the use of his muscles and added to his hatred of the twolegged things puny against him in themselves who by trick and wile had so helplessly imprisoned him  so on this morning when hell yawned for him he was ready and eager to meet all comers  they came equipped with formulas nooses and forked iron bars  five of them tossed nooses in through the bars upon the floor of his cage  he snarled and struck at the curling ropes and for ten minutes was a grand and impossible wild creature lacking in nothing save the wit and the patience possessed by the miserable twolegged things and then impatient and careless of the inanimate ropes he paused snarling at the men with one hind foot resting inside a noose  the next moment craftily lifted up about the girth of his leg by an iron fork the noose tightened and the bite of it sank home into his flesh and pride  he leaped he roared he was a maniac of ferocity  again and again almost burning their palms he tore the rope smoking through their hands  but ever they took in the slack and paid it out again until ere he was aware a similar noose tightened on his foreleg  what he had done was nothing to what he now did  but he was stupid and impatient  the mancreatures were wise and patient and a third leg and a fourth leg were finally noosed so that with many men tailing on to the ropes he was dragged ignominiously on his side to the bars and ignominiously through the bars were hauled his four legs his chiefest weapons of offence after his terribly fanged jaws  and then a puny mancreature mulcachy himself dared openly and brazenly to enter the cage and approach him  he sprang to be at him or rather strove so to spring but was withstrained by his four legs through the bars which he could not draw back and get under him  and mulcachy knelt beside him dared kneel beside him and helped the fifth noose over his head and round his neck  then his head was drawn to the bars as helplessly as his legs had been drawn through  next mulcachy laid hands on him on his head on his ears on his very nose within an inch of his fangs and he could do nothing but snarl and roar and pant for breath as the noose shut off his breathing  quivering not with fear but with rage ben bolt perforce endured the buckling around his throat of a thick broad collar of leather to which was attached a very stout and a very long trailing rope  after that when mulcachy had left the cage one by one the five nooses were artfully manipulated off his legs and his neck  again after this prodigious indignity he was freewithin his cage  he went up into the air  with returning breath he roared his rage  he struck at the trailing rope that offended his nerves clawed at the trap of the collar that encased his neck fell rolled over offended his bodynerves more and more by entangling contacts with the rope and for half an hour exhausted himself in the futile battle with the inanimate thing  thus tigers are broken  at the last wearied even with sensations of sickness from the nervous strain put upon himself by his own anger he lay down in the middle of the floor lashing his tail hating with his eyes and accepting the clinging thing about his neck which he had learned he could not get rid of  to his amazement if such a thing be possible in the mental processes of a tiger the rear door to his cage was thrown open and left open  he regarded the aperture with belligerent suspicion  no one and no threatening danger appeared in the doorway  but his suspicion grew always among these mananimals occurred what he did not know and could not comprehend  his preference was to remain where he was but from behind through the bars of the cage came shouts and yells the lash of whips and the painful thrusts of the long iron forks  dragging the rope behind him with no thought of escape but in the hope that he would get at his tormentors he leaped into the rear passage that ran behind the circle of permanent cages  the passage way was deserted and dark but ahead he saw light  with great leaps and roars he rushed in that direction arousing a pandemonium of roars and screams from the animals in the cages  he bounded through the light and into the light dazzled by the brightness of it and crouched down with long lashing tail to orient himself to the situation  but it was only another and larger cage that he was in a very large cage a big bright performingarena that was all cage  save for himself the arena was deserted although overhead suspended from the roofbars were blockandtackle and seven strong iron chairs that drew his instant suspicion and caused him to roar at them  for half an hour he roamed the arena which was the greatest area of restricted freedom he had known in the ten weeks of his captivity  then a hooked iron rod thrust through the bars caught and drew the bight of his trailing rope into the hands of the men outside  immediately ten of them had hold of it and he would have charged up to the bars at them had not at that moment mulcachy entered the arena through a door on the opposite side  no bars stood between ben bolt and this creature and ben bolt charged him  even as he charged he was aware of suspicion in that the small fragile mancreature before him did not flee or crouch down but stood awaiting him  ben bolt never reached him  first with an access of caution he craftily ceased from his charge and crouching with lashing tail studied the man who seemed so easily his  mulcachy was equipped with a longlashed whip and a sharppronged fork of iron  in his belt loaded with blank cartridges was a revolver  bellying closer to the ground ben bolt advanced upon him creeping slowly like a cat stalking a mouse  when he came to his next pause which was within certain leaping distance he crouched lower gathered himself for the leap then turned his head to regard the men at his back outside the cage  the trailing rope in their hands to his neck he had forgotten  now you might as well be good old man mulcachy addressed him in soft caressing tones taking a step toward him and holding in advance the iron fork  this merely incensed the huge magnificent creature  he rumbled a low tense growl flattened his ears back and soared into the air his paws spread so that the claws stood out like talons his tail behind him as stiff and straight as a rod  neither did the man crouch or flee nor did the beast attain to him  at the height of his leap the rope tightened taut on his neck causing him to describe a somersault and fall heavily to the floor on his side  before he could regain his feet mulcachy was upon him shouting to his small audience heres where we pound the argument out of him  and pound he did on the nose with the butt of the whip and jab he did with the iron fork to the ribs  he rained a hurricane of blows and jabs on the animals most sensitive parts  ever ben bolt leaped to retaliate but was thrown by the ten men tailed on to the rope and each time even as he struck the floor on his side mulcachy was upon him pounding smashing jabbing  his pain was exquisite especially that of his tender nose  and the creature who inflicted the pain was as fierce and terrible as he even more so because he was more intelligent  in but few minutes dazed by the pain appalled by his inability to rend and destroy the man who inflicted it ben bolt lost his courage  he fled ignominiously before the little twolegged creature who was more terrible than himself who was a fullgrown royal bengal tiger  he leaped high in the air in sheer panic he ran here and there with lowered head to avoid the rain of pain  he even charged the sides of the arena springing up and vainly trying to climb the slippery vertical bars  ever like an avenging devil mulcachy pursued and smashed and jabbed gritting through his teeth you will argue will you  ill teach you what argument is  there  take that  and that  and that  now ive got him afraid of me and the rest ought to be easy he announced resting off and panting hard from his exertions while the great tiger crouched and quivered and shrank back from him against the base of the arenabars  take a fiveminute spell you fellows and well got our breaths  lowering one of the iron chairs and attaching it firmly in its place on the floor mulcachy prepared for the teaching of the first trick  ben bolt jungleborn and junglereared was to be compelled to sit in the chair in ludicrous and tragic imitation of mancreatures  but mulcachy was not quite ready  the first lesson of fear of him must be reiterated and driven home  stepping to a near safe distance he lashed ben bolt on the nose  he repeated it  he did it a score of times and scores of times  turn his head as he would ever ben bolt received the bite of the whip on his fearfully bruised nose for mulcachy was as expert as a stagedriver in his manipulation of the whip and unerringly the lash snapped and cracked and stung ben bolts nose wherever ben bolt at the moment might have it  when it became maddeningly unendurable he sprang only to be jerked back by the ten strong men who held the rope to his neck  and wrath and ferocity and intent to destroy passed out utterly from the tigers inflamed brain until he knew fear again and again always fear and only fear utter and abject fear of this human mite who searched him with such pain  then the lesson of the first trick was taken up  mulcachy tapped the chair sharply with the butt of the whip to draw the animals attention to it then flicked the whiplash sharply on his nose  at the same moment an attendant through the bars behind drove an iron fork into his ribs to force him away from the bars and toward the chair  he crouched forward then shrank back against the sidebars  again the chair was rapped his nose was lashed his ribs were jabbed and he was forced by pain toward the chair  this went on interminablyfor a quarter of an hour for half an hour for an hour for the menanimals had the patience of gods while he was only a junglebrute  thus tigers are broken  and the verb means just what it means  a performing animal is broken something breaks in an animal of the wild ere such an animal submits to do tricks before payaudiences  mulcachy ordered an assistant to enter the arena with him  since he could not compel the tiger directly to sit in the chair he must employ other means  the rope about ben bolts neck was passed up through the bars and rove through the blockandtackle  at signal from mulcachy the ten men hauled away  snarling struggling choking in a fresh madness of terror at this new outrage ben bolt was slowly hoisted by his neck up from the floor until quite clear of it whirling squirming battling suspended by his neck like a man being hanged his wind was shut off and he began to suffocate  he coiled and twisted the splendid muscles of his body enabling him almost to tie knots in it  the blockandtackle running like a trolley on the overhead track made it possible for the assistant to seize his tail and drag him through the air till he was above the chair  his helpless body guided thus by the tail his chest jabbed by the iron fork in mulcachys hands the rope was suddenly lowered and ben bolt with swimming brain found himself seated in the chair  on the instant he leaped for the floor received a blow on the nose from the heavy whiphandle and had a blank cartridge fired straight into his nostril  his madness of pain and fear was multiplied he sprang away in flight but mulcachys voice rang out hoist him and he slowly rose in the air again hanging by his neck and began to strangle  once more he was swung into position by his tail jabbed in the chest and lowered suddenly on the runbut so suddenly with a frantic twist of his body on his part that he fell violently across the chair on his belly  what little wind was left him from the strangling seemed to have been ruined out of him by the violence of the fall  the glare in his eyes was maniacal and swimming  he panted frightfully and his head rolled back and forth  slaver dripped from his mouth blood ran from his nose  hoist away mulcachy shouted  and again struggling frantically as the tightening collar shut off his wind ben bolt was slowly lifted into the air  so wildly did he struggle that ere his hind feet were off the floor he pranced back and forth so that when he was heaved clear his body swung like a huge pendulum  over the chair he was dropped and for a fraction of a second the posture was his of a man sitting in a chair  then he uttered a terrible cry and sprang  it was neither snarl nor growl nor roar that cry but a sheer scream as if something had broken inside of him  he missed mulcachy by inches as another blank cartridge exploded up his other nostril and as the men with the rope snapped him back so abruptly as almost to break his neck  this time lowered quickly he sank into the chair like a halfempty sack of meal and continued so to sink until crumpling at the middle his great tawny head falling forward he lay on the floor unconscious  his tongue black and swollen lolled out of his mouth  as buckets of water were poured on him he groaned and moaned  and here ended the first lesson  its all right mulcachy said day after day as the teaching went on patience and hard work will pull off the trick  ive got his goat  hes afraid of me  all thats required is time and time adds to value with an animal like him  not on that first day nor on the second nor on the third did the requisite something really break inside ben bolt  but at the end of a fortnight it did break  for the day came when mulcachy rapped the chair with his whipbutt when the attendant through the bars jabbed the iron fork into ben bolts ribs and when ben bolt anything but royal slinking like a beaten alleycat in pitiable terror crawled over to the chair and sat down in it like a man  he now was an educated tiger  the sight of him so sitting tragically travestying man has been considered and is considered educative by multitudinous audiences  the second case that of st elias was a harder one and it was marked down against mulcachy as one of his rare failures though all admitted that it was an unavoidable failure  st elias was a huge monster of an alaskan bear who was goodnatured and even facetious and humorous after the way of bears  but he had a will of his own that was correspondingly as stubborn as his bulk  he could be persuaded to do things but he would not tolerate being compelled to do things  and in the trainedanimal world where turns must go off like clockwork is little or no space for persuasion  an animal must do its turn and do it promptly  audiences will not brook the delay of waiting while a trainer tries to persuade a crusty or roguish beast to do what the audience has paid to see it do  so st elias received his first lesson in compulsion  it was also his last lesson and it never progressed so far as the trainingarena for it took place in his own cage  noosed in the customary way his four legs dragged through the bars and his head by means of a choke collar drawn against the bars he was first of all manicured  each one of his great claws was cut off flush with his flesh  the men outside did this  then mulcachy on the inside punched his nose  not lightly as it sounds was this operation  the punch was a perforation  thrusting the instrument into the huge bears nostril mulcachy cut a clean round chunk of living meat out of one side of it  mulcachy knew the bear business  at all times to make an untrained bear obey one must be fast to some sensitive portion of the bear  the ears the nose and the eyes are the accessible sensitive parts and the eyes being out of the question remain the nose and the ears as the parts to which to make fast  through the perforation mulcachy immediately clamped a metal ring  to the ring he fastened a long lungerope which was well named  any unruly lunge at any time during all the subsequent life of st elias could thus be checked by the man who held the lungerope  his destiny was patent and ordained  for ever as long as he lived and breathed would he be a prisoner and slave to the rope in the ring in his nostril  the nooses were slipped and st elias was at liberty within the confines of his cage to get acquainted with the ring in his nose  with his powerful forepaws standing erect and roaring he proceeded to get acquainted with the ring  it certainly was not a thing persuasible  it was living fire  and he tore at it with his paws as he would have torn at the stings of bees when raiding a honeytree  he tore the thing out ripping the ring clear through the flesh and transforming the round perforation into a ragged chasm of pain  mulcachy cursed  heres where hell coughs he said  the nooses were introduced again  again st elias helpless on his side against and partly through the bars had his nose punched  this time it was the other nostril  and hell coughed  as before the moment he was released he tore the ring out through his flesh  mulcachy was disgusted  listen to reason wont you he objurgated as this time the reason he referred to was the introduction of the ring clear through both nostrils higher up and through the central dividing wall of cartilage  but st elias was unreasonable  unlike ben bolt there was nothing inside of him weak enough or nervous enough or high strung enough to break  the moment he was free he ripped the ring away with half of his nose along with it  mulcachy punched st eliass right ear  st elias tore his right ear to shreds  mulcachy punched his left ear  he tore his left ear to shreds  and mulcachy gave in  he had to as he said plaintively  were beaten  there aint nothing left to make fast to  later when st elias was condemned to be a cageanimal all his days mulcachy was wont to grumble  he was the most unreasonable animal  couldnt do a thing with him couldnt ever get anything to make fast to     chapter xxxiv   it was in the orpheum theatre of oakland california and harley kennan was in the act of reaching under his seat for his hat when his wife said  why this isnt the interval  theres one more turn yet  a dog turn he answered and thereby explained for it was his practice to leave a theatre during the period of the performance of an animalact  villa kennan glanced hastily at the programme  of course she said then added but its a singing dog  a dog caruso  and it points out that there is no one on the stage with the dog  let us stay for once and see how he compares with jerry  some poor brute tormented into howling harley grumbled  but it has the stage to itself villa urged  besides if it is painful then we can go out  ill go out with you  but i just would like to see how much better jerry sings than does he  and it says an irish terrier too  so harley kennan remained  the two burntcork comedians finished their turn and their three encores and the curtain behind them went up on a full set of an empty stage  a roughcoated irish terrier entered at a sedate walk sedately walked forward to the centre nearly to the footlights and faced the leader of the orchestra  as the programme had stated he had the stage to himself  the orchestra played the opening strains of sweet bye and bye  the dog yawned and sat down  but the orchestra was thoroughly instructed to play the opening strains over and over until the dog responded and then to follow on with him  by the third time the dog opened his mouth and began  it was not a mere howling  for that matter it was too mellow to be classified as a howl at all  nor was it merely rhythmic  the notes the dog sang were of the air and they were correct  but villa kennan scarcely heard  he has jerry beaten a mile harley muttered to her  listen she replied in tense whispers  did you ever see that dog before  harley shook his head  you have seen him before she insisted  look at that crinkled ear think  think back  remember  still her husband shook his head  remember the solomons she pressed  remember the ariel  remember when we came back from malaita where we picked jerry up to tulagi that he had a brother there a niggerchaser on a schooner  and his name was michaelgo on  and he had that selfsame crinkled ear she hurried  and he was rough coated  and he was full brother to jerry  and their father and mother were terrence and biddy of meringe  and jerry is our sing song silly and this dog sings  and he has a crinkled ear  and his name is michael  impossible said harley  it is when the impossible comes true that life proves worth while she retorted  and this is one of those worthwhiles of impossibles  i know it  still the man of him said impossible and still the woman of her insisted that this was an impossible come true  by this time the dog on the stage was singing god save the king  that shows i am right villa contended  no american in america would teach a dog god save the king  an englishman originally owned that dog and taught it  the solomons are british  thats a far cry he smiled  but what gets me is that ear  i remember it now  i remember the day when we were on the beach at tulagi with jerry and when his brother came ashore from the eugenie in a whaleboat  and his brother had that selfsame loppy crinkled ear  and more villa argued  how many singing dogs have we ever known only onejerry  evidently such a type occurs rarely  the same family would more likely produce similar types than different families  the family of terrence and biddy produced jerry  and this is michael  he was roughcoated along with a crinkly ear harley meditated back i see him distinctly as he stood up in the bow of the whaleboat and as he ran along the beach side by side with jerry  if jerry should tomorrow run side by side with him you would be convinced she queried  it was their trick and the trick of terrence and biddy before them he agreed  but its a far cry from the solomons to the united states  jerry is such a far cry she replied  and if jerry won from the solomons to california then is there anything more remarkable in michael so winningoh listen  for the dog on the stage now responding to its one encore was singing home sweet home  this finished jacob henderson to tumultuous applause came on the stage from the wings and joined the dog in bowing villa and harley sat in silence for a moment  then villa said apropos of nothing  i have been sitting here and feeling very grateful for one particular thing  he waited  it is that we are so abominably wealthy she concluded  which means that you want the dog must have him and are going to got him just because i can afford to do it for you he teased  because you cant afford not to she answered  you must know he is jerrys brother  at least you must have a sneaking suspicion      i have he nodded  the thing that cant sometimes does and there is a chance that this may be one of those times  of course it isnt michael but on the other hand whats to prevent it from being michael let us go behind and find out        more agents of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals was jacob hendersons thought as the man and woman accompanied by the manager of the theatre were shown into his tiny dressingroom  michael on a chair and half asleep took no notice of them  while harley talked with henderson villa investigated michael and michael scarcely opened his eyes ere he closed them again  too sour on the human world and too glum in his own soured nature he was anything save his old courtly self to chance humans who broke in upon him to pat his head and say silly things and go their way never to be seen by him again  villa kennan with a pang of disappointment at such rebuff forwent her overtures for the moment and listened to what tale jacob henderson could tell of his dog  harry del mar a trainedanimal man had picked the dog up somewhere on the pacific coast most probably in san francisco she learned but having taken the dog east with him harry del mar had died by accident in new york before telling anybody anything about the animal that was all except that henderson had paid two thousand dollars to one harris collins and had found the investment the finest he had ever made  villa turned back to the dog  michael she called caressingly almost in a whisper  and michaels eyes partly opened the basemuscles of his ears stiffened and his body quivered  michael she repeated  this time raising his head the eyes open and the ears stiffly erect michael looked at her  not since on the beach at tulagi had he heard that name uttered  across the years and the seas the word came to him out of the past  its effect was electrical for on the instant all the connotations of michael flooded his consciousness  he saw again captain kellar of the eugenie who had last called him it and mister haggin and derby and bob of meringe plantation and biddy and terrence and not least among these shades of the vanished past his brother jerry  but was it the vanished past  the name which had ceased for years had come back  it had entered the room along with this man and woman  all this he did not reason but indubitably as if he had so reasoned he acted upon it  he jumped from the chair and ran to the woman  he smelled her hand and smelled her as she patted him  then as he recognized her he went wild he sprang away dashing around and around the room sniffing under the washstand and smelling out the corners  as in a frenzy he was back to the woman whimpering eagerly as she strove to pet him  the next moment stiff in a frenzy he was away again scurrying about the room and still whimpering  jacob henderson looked on with mild disapproval  he never cuts up that way he said  he is a very quiet dog  maybe it is a fit he is going to have though he never has fits  no one understood not even villa kennan  but michael understood  he was looking for that vanished world which had rushed back upon him at sound of his oldtime name  if this name could come to him out of the nothingness as this woman had whom once he had seen treading the beach at tulagi then could all other things of tulagi and the nothingness come to him  as she was there before him in the living flesh uttering his name so might captain kellar and mister haggin and jerry be there somewhere in the very room or just outside the door  he ran to the door whimpering as he scratched at it  maybe he thinks there is something outside said jacob henderson opening the door for him  and michael did so think  as a matter of course through that open door he was prepared to have the southpacific ocean flow in bearing on its bosom schooners and ships islands and reefs and all men and animals and things he once had known and still remembered  but no past flowed in through the door  outside was the usual present he came back dejectedly to the woman who still called him michael as she petted him  she at any rate was real  next he carefully smelled and identified the man with the beach of tulagi and the deck of the ariel and again his excitement began to mount  oh harley i know it is he villa cried  cant you test him  cant you prove him  but how harley pondered  he seems to recognize his name  it excites him  and though he never knew us very well he seems to remember us and to be excited by us too  if only he could talk      oh talk  talk villa pleaded with michael catching both sides of his head and jaws in her hands and swaying him back and forth  be careful madam jacob henderson warned  he is a very sour dog and he dont let people take such liberties  he does me she laughed halfhysterically  because he knows me    harley  she broke off as the great idea dawned on her  i have a test  listen  remember jerry was a niggerchaser before we got him and michael was a niggerchaser  you talk in bechedemer  appear angry with some black boy and see how it will affect him  ill have to remember hard to resurrect any bechedemer harley said nodding approval of the suggestion  at the same time ill distract him she rushed on  sitting down and bending forward to michael so that his head was buried in her arms and breast she began swaying him and crooning to him as was her wont with jerry  nor did he resent the liberty she took and like jerry he yielded to her crooning and softly began to croon with her  she signalled harley with her eyes  my word he began in tones of wrath  what name you fella boy stop m along this fella place  you make m me cross along you any amount  and at the words michael bristled dragged himself clear of the womans detaining hands and with a snarl whirled about to get a look at the black boy who must have just then entered the room and aroused the white gods ire  but there was no black boy  he looked on still bristling to the door  harley transferred his own gaze to the door and michael knew beyond all doubt that outside the door was standing a solomons nigger  hey  michael harley shouted  chase m that black fella boy overside  with a roaring snarl michael flung himself at the door  such was the fury and weight of his onslaught that the latch flew loose and the door swung open  the emptiness of the space which he had expected to see occupied was appalling and he shrank down sick and dizzy with the baffling apparitional past that thus vexed his consciousness  and now said harley to jacob henderson we will talk business         chapter xxxv   when the train arrived at glen ellen in the valley of the moon it was harley kennan himself at the sidedoor of the baggagecar who caught hold of michael and swung him to the ground  for the first time michael had performed a railroad journey uncrated  merely with collar and chain had he travelled up from oakland  in the waiting automobile he found villa kennan and chain removed sat beside her and between her and harley  as the machine purred along the two miles of road that wound up the side of sonoma mountain michael scarcely looked at the foresttrees and vistas of wandering glades  he had been in the united states three years during which time he had been kept a close prisoner  cage and crate and chain had been his portion and narrow rooms baggage cars and station platforms  the nearest he had come to the country was when chained to benches in the various parks while jacob henderson studied swedenborg  so that trees and hills and fields had ceased to mean anything  they were something inaccessible as inaccessible as the blue of the sky or the drifting cloudfleeces  thus did he regard the trees and hills and fields if the negative act of not regarding a thing at all can be considered a state of mind  dont seem to be enthusiastic over the ranch eh michael harley remarked  he looked up at sound of his old name and made acknowledgment by flattening his ears a quivering trifle and by touching his nose against harleys shoulder  nor does he seem demonstrative was villas judgment  at least nothing like jerry  wait till they meet harley smiled in anticipation  jerry will furnish enough excitement for both of them  if they remember each other after all this time said villa  i wonder if they will  they did at tulagi he reminded her  and they were full grown and hadnt seen each other since they were puppies  remember how they barked and scampered all about the beach  michael was the hurlyburly one  at least he made twice as much noise  but he seems dreadfully grownup and subdued now  three years ought to have subdued him harley insisted  but villa shook her head  as the machine drew up at the house and kennan first stepped out a dogs whimperingly joyous bark of welcome struck michael as not altogether unfamiliar  the joyous bark turned to a suspicious and jealous snarl as jerry scented the other dogs presence from harleys caressing hand  the next moment he had traced the original source of the scent into the limousine and sprung in after it  with snarl and forward leap michael met the snarling rush less than halfway and was rolled over on the bottom of the car  the irish terrier under all circumstances amenable to the control of the master as are few breeds of dogs was instantly manifest in jerry and michael an harley kennans voice rang out  they separated and despite the rumbling of low growling in their throats refrained from attacking each other as they plunged out to the ground  the little setto had occurred in so few seconds or fractions of seconds that they had not begun to betray recognition of each other until they were out of the machine  they were still comically stifflegged and bristly as they aloofly sniffed noses  they know each other villa cried  lets wait and see what they will do  as for michael he accepted without surprise the indubitable fact that jerry had come back out of the nothingness  things of this sort had begun to happen rapidly but it was not the things themselves but the connotations of them that almost stunned him  if the man and woman whom he had last seen at tulagi and likewise jerry had come back from the nothingness then could come and might come at any moment the beloved steward  instead of responding to jerry michael sniffed and glanced about in quest of steward  jerrys first expression of greeting and friendliness took the form of a desire to run  he barked invitation to his brother scampered away half a dozen jumps scampered back and dabbed playfully at michael with one forepaw in added emphasis of invitation ere he scampered away again  for so many years had michael not run with another dog that at first jerrys invitation had little meaning to him  nevertheless such running was an habitual expression of happiness and friendliness in dogdom and especially strong had been his inheritance of it from terrence and biddy the noted loverunners of the solomons  the next time jerry dabbed at him with a paw barked and scurried away in an enticing semicircle michael started involuntarily though slowly after him  but michael did not bark and after half a dozen leaps he came to a full stop and looked to villa and harley for permission  all right michael harley called heartily deliberately turning his shoulder in the noninterest of consent as he extended his hand to help villa from the machine  michael sprang away again and was numbly aware of an ancient joy as he shouldered jerry who shouldered against him as they ran side by side  but most of the joy was jerrys as was the wildest of the skurrying and the racing and the shouldering of the bodywriggling and earpricking and yelping cries  also jerry barked and michael did not bark  he used to bark said villa  much more than jerry harley supplemented  then they have taken the bark out of him she concluded  he must have gone through terrible experiences to have lost his bark        the green california spring merged into tawny summer as jerry ever running afield made michael acquainted with the farthest and highest reaches of the kennan ranch in the valley of the moon  the pageant of the wild flowers vanished until all that lingered on the burnt hillsides were orange poppies faded to palest gold and mariposa lilies windblown on slender stems amidst the desiccated grasses that smouldered like ornate spotted moths fluttering in rest for a space between flight and flight  and michael a follower always where the exuberant jerry led sought throughout the passing year for what he could not find  looking for something looking for something harley would say to villa  it is not alive  it is not here  now just what is it he is always looking for  steward it was and michael never found him  the nothingness held him and would not yield him up although could michael have journeyed a ten days steamerjourney into the south pacific to the marquesas steward he would have found and along with him kwaque and the ancient mariner all three living like lotuseaters on the beachparadise of taiohae also in and about their grassthatched bungalow under the lofty avocado trees michael would have found other petcats and kittens and pigs donkeys and ponies a pair of lovebirds and a mischievous monkey or two but never a dog and never a cockatoo  for dag daughtry with violence of language had laid a taboo upon dogs  after killeny boy he averred there should be no other dog  and kwaque without averring anything at all resolutely refrained from possessing himself of the white cockatoos brought ashore by the sailors off the trading schooners  but michael was long in giving over his search for steward and running the mountain trails or scrambling and sliding down into the deep canyons was ever expectant and ready for steward to step forth before him or to pick up the unmistakable scent that would lead him to him  looking for something looking for something harley kennan would chant curiously as he rode beside villa and observed michaels unending search  now jerrys after rabbits and foxtrails but youll notice they dont interest michael much  theyre not what hes after  he behaves like one who has lost a great treasure and doesnt know where he lost it nor where to look for it  much michael learned from jerry of the varied life of the forest and fields  to run with jerry seemed the one pleasure he took for he never played  play had passed out of him  he was not precisely morose or gloomy from his years on the trainedanimal stage and in harris collinss college of pain but he was sobered subdued  the spring and the spontaneity had gone out of him  just as the leopard had clawmarked his shoulder so that damp and frosty weather made the pain of the old wound come back so was his mind marked by what he had gone through  he liked jerry was glad to be with him and to run with him but it was jerry who was ever in the lead who ever raised the hue and cry of hunting pursuit who barked indignation and eager yearning at a treed squirrel in refuge forty feet above the ground  michael looked on and listened but took no part in such antics of enthusiasm  in the same way he looked on when jerry fought fearful comic battles with norman chief the great percheron stallion  it was only play for jerry and norman chief were tried friends and though the huge horse ears laid back mouth open to bite pursued jerry in mad gyrations all about the paddock it was with no thought of inflicting hurt but merely to act up to his part in the sham battle  yet no invitation of jerrys could induce michael to join in the fun  he contented himself with sitting down outside the rails and looking on  why play might michael have asked who had had all play taken out of him  but when it came to serious work he was there even ahead of jerry  on account of footandmouth disease and of hogcholera strange dogs were taboo on the kennan ranch  it did not take michael long to learn this and stray dogs got short shrift from him  with never a warning bark nor growl in deadly silence he rushed them slashed and bit them rolled them over and over in the dust and drove them from the place  it was like niggerchasing a service to perform for the gods whom he loved and who willed such chasing  no wild passion of love such as he had had for steward did he bear villa and harley but he did develop for them a great sober love  he did not go out of his way to express it with overtures of wrigglings and squirmings and whimpering yelpings  jerry could be depended upon for that  but he was always seriously glad to be with villa and harley and to receive recognition from them next after jerry  some of his deepest moments of content before the fireplace were to sit beside villa or harley and lean his head against a knee and have a hand on occasion drop down on his head or gently twist his crinkled ear  jerry was even guilty of playing with children who happened at times to be under the kennan aegis  michael endured children for as long as they left him alone  if they waxed familiar he would warn them with a bristling of his neckhair and a throaty rumbling and get up and stalk away  i cant understand it villa would say  he was the fullest of play and spirits and all foolishness  he was much sillier and much more excitable than jerry and certainly noisier  he must have some terrible story to tell if only he could of all that happened between tulagi and the time we found him on the orpheum stage  and that may be the least little hint of it harley would reply pointing to michaels shoulder where the leopard had scarred it on the day jack the airedale and sara the little green monkey had died  he used to bark i know he used to bark villa would continue  why doesnt he bark now  and harley would point to the scarred shoulder and say that may account for it and most possibly a hundred other things like it of which we cannot see the marks  but the time was to come when they were to hear him bark againnot once but twice  and both times were to be but an earnest of another and graver time when without barking at all he would express in action the measure of his love and worship of them who had taken him from the crate and the footlights and given him the freedom of the valley of the moon  and in the meantime running endlessly with jerry over the ranch he learned all the ways of it and all the life of it from the chickenyards and the duckponds to the highest pitch of sonoma mountain  he learned where the wild deer in their season were to be found when they raided the pruneorchard the vineyards and the appletrees when they sought the deepest canyons and most secret coverts and when they stamped out in open glades and on bare hillsides and crashed and clattered their antlers together in combat  under jerrys leadership always running second and after on the narrow trails as a subdued dog should he learned the ways and habits of the foxes the coons the weasels and the ringtail cats that seemed compounded of cat and coon and weasel  he came to know the groundnesting birds and the difference between the customs of the valley quail the mountain quail and the pheasants  the traits and lairs of the domestic cats gone wild he also learned as did he learn the wild loves of mountain farmdogs with the freeroving coyotes  he knew of the presence of the mountain lion adrift down from mendocino county ere the first shorthorn calf was slain and came home from the encounter torn and bleeding to attest what he had discovered and to be the cause of harley kennan riding trail next day with a rifle across his pommel  likewise michael came to know what harley kennan never did know and always denied as existing on his ranchthe one rocky outcrop in the dense heart of the mountain forest where a score of rattlesnakes denned through the winters and warmed themselves in the sun     chapter xxxvi   winter came on in its delectable way in the valley of the moon  the last mariposa lily vanished from the burnt grasses as the california indian summer dreamed itself out in purple mists on the windless air  soft rain showers first broke the spell  snow fell on the summit of sonoma mountain  at the ranch house the morning air was crisp and brittle yet midday made the shade welcome and in the open under the winter sun roses bloomed and oranges grapefruit and lemons turned to golden yellow ripeness  yet a thousand feet beneath on the floor of the valley the mornings were white with frost  and michael barked twice  the first time was when harley kennan astride a hotblooded sorrel colt tried to make it leap a narrow stream  villa reined in her steed at the crest beyond and looking back into the little valley waited for the colt to receive its lesson  michael waited too but closer at hand  at first he lay down panting from his run by the streamedge  but he did not know horses very well and soon his anxiety for the welfare of harley kennan brought him to his feet  harley was gentle and persuasive and all patience as he strove to make the colt take the leap  the urge of voice and rein was of the mildest but the animal balked the takeoff each time and the hot thoroughbredness in its veins made it sweat and lather  the velvet of young grass was torn up by its hoofs and its terror of the stream was such that when fetched to the edge at a canter it stiffened and crouched to an abrupt stop then reared on its hindlegs  which was too much for michael  he sprang at the horses head as it came down with forefeet to earth and as he sprang he barked  in his bark was censure and menace and as the horse reared again he leaped into the air after it his teeth clipping together as he just barely missed its nose  villa rode back down the slope to the opposite bank of the stream  mercy she cried  listen to him  hes actually barking  he thinks the colt is trying to do some damage to me harley said thats his provocation  he hasnt forgotten how to bark  hes reading the colt a lecture  if he gets him by the nose it will be more than a lecture villa warned  be careful harley or he will  now michael lie down and be good harley commanded  its all right i tell you  its an right  lie down  michael sank down obediently but protestingly and he had eyes only for the horses antics while all his muscles were gathered tensely to spring in case the horse threatened injury to harley again  i cant give in to him now or he never will jump anything harley said to his wife as he whirled about to gallop back to a distance  either i lift him over or i take a cropper  he came back at full speed and the colt despite himself unable to stop lifted into the leap that would avoid the stream he feared so that he cleared it with a good two yards to spare on the other side  the next time michael barked was when harley on the same hotblood mount strove to close a poorly hung gate on the steep pitch of a mountain woodroad  michael endured the danger to his mangod as long as he could then flew at the colts head in a frenzy of barking  anyway his barking helped harley conceded as he managed to close the gate  michael must certainly have told the colt that hed give him what for if he didnt behave  at any rate hes not tonguetied villa laughed even if he isnt very loquacious  and michaels loquacity never went farther  only on these two occasions when his mastergod seemed to be in peril was he known to bark  he never barked at the moon nor at hillside echoes nor at any prowling thing  a particular echo to be heard directly from the ranchhouse was an unfailing source of exercise for jerrys lungs  at such times that jerry barked michael with a bored expression would lie down and wait until the duet was over  nor did he bark when he attacked strange dogs that strayed upon the ranch  he fights like a veteran harley remarked after witnessing one such encounter  hes coldblooded  theres no excitement in him  hes old before his time villa said  there is no heart of play left in him and no desire for speech  just the same i know he loves me and you  without having to be voluble about it her husband completed for her  you can see it shining in those quiet eyes of his she supplemented  reminds me of one of the survivors of lieutenant greeleys expedition i used to know he agreed  he was an enlisted soldier and one of the handful of survivors  he had been through so much that he was just as subdued as michael and just as taciturn  he bored most people who could not understand him  of course the truth was the other way around  they bored him  they knew so little of life that he knew the last word of and one could scarcely get any word out of him  it was not that he had forgotten how to speak but that he could not see any reason for speaking when nobody could understand  he was really crusty from toobitter wise experience  but all you had to do was look at him in his tremendous repose and know that he had been through the thousand hells including all the frozen ones  his eyes had the same quietness of michaels  and they had the same wisdom  id give almost anything to know how he got his shoulder scarred  it must have been a tiger or a lion        the man like the mountain lion whom michael had encountered up the mountain had strayed down from the wilds of mendocino county following the ruggedest mountain stretches and at night crossing the farmed valley spaces where the presence of man was a danger to him  like the mountain lion the man was an enemy to man and all men were his enemies seeking his life which he had forfeited in ways more terrible than the lion which had merely killed calves for food  like the mountain lion the man was a killer  but unlike the lion his vague description and the narrative of his deeds was in all the newspapers and mankind was a vast deal more interested in him than in the lion  the lion had slain calves in upland pastures  but the man for purposes of robbery had slain an entire familythe postmaster his wife and their three children in the upstairs over the post office in the mountain village of chisholm  for two weeks the man had eluded and exceeded pursuit  his last crossing had been from the mountains of the russian river across widefarmed santa rosa valley to sonoma mountain  for two days he had laired and rested sleeping much in the wildest and most inaccessible precincts of the kennan ranch  with him he had carried coffee stolen from the last house he had raided  one of harley kennans angora goats had furnished him with meat  four times he had slept the clock around from exhaustion rousing on occasion like any animal to eat voraciously of the goatmeat to drink large quantities of the coffee hot or cold and to sink down into heavy but nightmareridden sleep  and in the meantime civilization with its efficient organization and intricate inventions including electricity had closed in on him electricity had surrounded him  the spoken word had located him in the wild canyons of sonoma mountain and fringed the mountain with posses of peaceofficers and detachments of armed farmers  more terrible to them than any mountain lion was a mankilling man astray in their landscape the telephone on the kennan ranch and the telephones on all other ranches abutting on sonoma mountain had rung often and transmitted purposeful conversations and arrangements  so it happened when the posses had begun to penetrate the mountain and when the man was compelled to make a daylight dash down into the valley of the moon to cross over to the mountain fastnesses that lay between it and napa valley that harley kennan rode out on the hotblooded colt he was training  he was not in pursuit of the man who had slain the postmaster of chisholm and his family  the mountain was alive with man hunters as he well knew for a score had bedded and eaten at the ranch house the night before  so the meeting of harley kennan with the man was unplanned and eventful  it was not the first meeting with men the man had had that day  during the preceding night he had noted the campfires of several posses  at dawn attempting to break forth down the southwestern slopes of the mountain toward petaluma he had encountered not less than five separate detachments of dairyranchers all armed with winchesters and shotguns breaking back to cover the chase hot on his heels he had run full tilt into a party of village youths from glen ellen and caliente  their squirrel and deer rifles had missed him but his back had been peppered with birdshot in a score of places the leaden pellets penetrating maddeningly in a score of places just under the skin  in the rush of his retreat down the canyon slope he had plunged into a bunch of shorthorn steers who far more startled than he had rolled him on the forest floor trampled over him in their panic and smashed his rifle under their hoofs  weaponless desperate stinging and aching from his superficial wounds and bruises he had circled the forest slopes along deerpaths crossed two canyons and begun to descend the horse trail he found in the third canyon  it was on this trail going down that he met the reporter coming up  the reporter waswell just a reporter from the city knowing only city ways who had never before engaged in a manhunt  the livery horse he had rented down in the valley was a brokenkneed jaded and spiritless creature that stood calmly while its rider was dragged from its back by the wildlooking and violently impetuous man who sprang out around a sharp turn of the trail  the reporter struck at his assailant once with his ridingwhip  then he received a beating such as he had often written up about sailorrows and saloonfrequenters in his cubreporter days but which for the first time it was his lot to experience  to the mans disgust he found the reporter unarmed save for a pencil and a wad of copy paper  out of his disappointment in not securing a weapon he beat the reporter up some more left him wailing among the ferns and astride the reporters horse urging it on with the reporters whip continued down the trail  jerry ever keenest on the hunting had ranged farther afield than michael as the pair of them accompanied harley kennan on his early morning ride  even so michael at the heels of his masters horse did not see nor understand the beginning of the catastrophe  for that matter neither did harley  where a steep eightfoot bank came down to the edge of the road along which he was riding harley and the hotblood colt were startled by an eruption through the screen of manzanita bushes above  looking up he saw a reluctant horse and a forceful rider plunging in midair down upon him  in that flashing glimpse even as he reined and spurred to make his own horse leap sidewise out from under harley kennan observed the scratched skin and torn clothing the wild burning eyes and the haggardness under the scraggly growth of beard of the manhunted man  the livery horse was justifiably reluctant to make that leap out and down the bank  too painfully aware of the penalty its broken knees and rheumatic joints must pay it dug its hoofs into the steep slope of moss and only sprang out and clear in the air in order to avoid a fall  even so its shoulder impacted against the shoulder of the whirling colt below it overthrowing the latter  harley kennans leg caught under against the earth snapped and the colt twisted and twisting as it struck the ground snapped its backbone  to his utter disgust the man pursued by an armed countryside found harley kennan his latest victim like the reporter to be weaponless dismounted he snarled in his rage and disappointment and deliberately kicked the helpless man in the side  he had drawn back his foot for the second kick when michael took a handor a leg rather sinking his teeth into the calf of the backdrawn leg about to administer the kick  with a curse the man jerked his leg clear michaels teeth ribboning flesh and trousers  good boy michael harley applauded from where he lay helplessly pinioned under his horse  hey  michael he continued lapsing back into bechedemer chase m that white fella marster to hell outa here along bush  ill kick your head off for that the man gritted at harley through his teeth  savage as were his acts and utterance the man was nearly ready to cry the long pursuit his hand against all mankind and all mankind against him had begun to break his stamina  he was surrounded by enemies  even youths had risen up and peppered his back with birdshot and beef cattle had trod him underfoot and smashed his rifle  everything conspired against him  and now it was a dog that had slashed down his leg  he was on the deathroad  never before had this impressed him with such clear certainty  everything was against him  his desire to cry was hysterical and hysteria in a desperate man is prone to express itself in terrible savage ways  without rhyme or reason he was prepared to carry out his threat to kick harley kennan to death  not that kennan had done anything to him  on the contrary it was he who had attacked kennan hurling him down on the road and breaking his leg under his horse  but harley kennan was a man and all mankind was his enemy and in killing kennan in some vague way it appeared to him that he was avenging himself at least in part on mankind in general  going down himself in death he would drag what he could with him into the red ruin  but ere he could kick the man on the ground michael was back upon him his other calf and trousers leg were ribboned as he tore clear  then catching michael in midleap with a kick that reached him under the chest he sent him flying through the air off the road and down the slope  as mischance would have it michael did not reach the ground crashing through a scrub manzanita bush his body was caught and pinched in an acute fork a yard above the ground  now the man announced grimly to harley im going to do what i said im just going to kick your head clean off  and i havent done a thing to you harley parleyed  i dont so much mind being murdered but id like to know what im being murdered for  chasing me for my life the man snarled as he advanced  i know your kind  youve all got it in for me and i aint got a chance except to give you yours  ill take a whole lot of it out on you  kennan was thoroughly aware of the gravity of his peril  helpless himself a mankilling lunatic was about to kill him and to kill him most horribly  michael a prisoner in the bush hanging headdownward in the manzanita from his loins squeezed in the fork and struggling vainly could not come to his defence  the mans first kick aimed at harleys face he blocked with his forearm and before the man could make a second kick jerry erupted on the scene  nor did he need encouragement or direction from his lovemaster  he flashed at the man sinking his teeth harmlessly into the slack of the mans trousers at the waistband above the hip but by his weight dragging him half down to the ground  and upon jerry the man turned with an increase of madness  in truth all the world was against him  the very landscape rained dogs upon him  but from above from the slopes of sonoma mountain the cries and calls of the trailing poses caught his ear and deflected his intention  they were the pursuing death and it was from them he must escape  with another kick at jerry hurling him clear he leaped astride the reporters horse which had continued to stand without movement or excitement in utter apathy where he had dismounted from it  the horse went into a reluctant and stifflegged gallop while jerry followed snarling and growling wrath at so high a pitch that almost he squalled  its all right michael harley soothed  take it easy  dont hurt yourself  the troubles over  anybodyll happen along any time now and get us out of this fix  but the smaller branch of the two composing the fork broke and michael fell to the ground landing in momentary confusion on his head and shoulders  the next moment he was on his feet and tearing down the road in the direction of jerrys noisy pursuit  jerrys noise broke in a sharp cry of pain that added wings to michaels feet  michael passed him rolling helplessly on the road  what had happened was that the livery horse in its stiffjointed brokenkneed gallop had stumbled nearly fallen and in its sprawling recovery had accidentally stepped on jerry bruising and breaking his foreleg  and the man looking back and seeing michael close upon him decided that it was still another dog attacking him  but he had no fear of dogs  it was men with their rifles and shotguns that might bring him to ultimate grief  nevertheless the pain of his bleeding legs lacerated by jerry and michael maintained his rage against dogs  more dogs was his bitter thought as he leaned out and brought his whip down across michaels face  to his surprise the dog did not wince under the blow  nor for that matter did he yelp or cry out from the pain  nor did he bark or growl or snarl  he closed in as though he had not received the blow and as though the whip was not brandished above him  as michael leaped for his right leg he swung the whip down striking him squarely on the muzzle midway between nose and eyes  deflected by the blow michael dropped back to earth and ran on with his longest leaps to catch up and make his next spring  but the man had noticed another thing  at such close range bringing his whip down he could not help noting that michael had kept his eyes open under the blow  neither had he winced nor blinked as the whip slashed down on him  the thing was uncanny  it was something new in the way of dogs  michael sprang again the man timed him again with the whip and he saw the uncanny thing repeated  by neither wince nor blink had the dog acknowledged the blow  and then an entirely new kind of fear came upon the man  was this the end for him after all he had gone through  was this deadly silent roughcoated terrier the thing destined to destroy him where men had failed  he did not even know that the dog was real  might it not be some terrible avenger out of the mystery beyond life placed to beset him and finish him finally on this road that he was convinced was surely the deathroad  the dog was not real  it could not be real  the dog did not live that could take a fullarm whipslash without wince or flinch  twice again as the dog sprang he deflected it with accurately delivered blows  and the dog came on with the same surety and silence  the man surrendered to his terror clapping heels to his horses old ribs beating it over the head and under the belly with the whip until it galloped as it had not galloped in years  even on that apathetic steed the terror descended  it was not terror of the dog which it knew to be only a dog but terror of the rider  in the past its knees had been broken and its joints stiffened for ever by drunkenmad riders who had hired him from the stables  and here was another such drunkenmad riderfor the horse sensed the mans terrorwho ached his ribs with the weight of his heels and beat him cruelly over face and nose and ears  the best speed of the horse was not very great not great enough to out distance michael although it was fast enough to give the latter only infrequent opportunities to spring for the mans leg  but each spring was met by the unvarying whipblow that by its very weight deflected him in the air  though his teeth each time clipped together perilously close to the mans leg each time he fell back to earth he had to gather himself together and run at his own top speed in order to overtake the terrorstricken man on the crazygalloping horse  enrico piccolomini saw the chase and was himself in at the finish and the affair his one great adventure in the world gave him wealth as well as material for conversation to the end of his days  enrico piccolomini was a woodchopper on the kennan ranch  on a rounded knoll overlooking the road he had first heard the galloping hoofs of the horse and the crack of the whipblows on its body  next he had seen the running battle of the man the horse and the dog  when directly beneath him not twenty feet distant he saw the dog leap in its queer silent way straight up and in to the downsmash of the whip and sink its teeth in the riders leg  he saw the dog with its weight as it fell back to earth drag the man half out of the saddle  he saw the man in an effort to recover his balance put his own weight on the bridlereins  and he saw the horse halfrearing halftottering and stumbling overthrow the last shred of the mans balance so that he followed the dog to the ground  and then they are like two dogs like two beasts piccolomini was wont to tell in afteryears over a glass of wine in his little hotel in glen ellen  the dog lets go the mans leg and jumps for the mans throat and the man rolling over is at the dogs throat  both his handssohe fastens about the throat of this dog  and the dog makes no sound  he never makes sound before or after  after the two hands of the man stop his breath he can not make sound  but he is not that kind of a dog  he will not make sound anyway  and the horse stands and looks on and the horse coughs  it is very strange all that i see  and the man is mad  only a madman will do what i see him do  i see the man show his teeth like any dog and bite the dog on the paw on the nose on the body  and when he bites the dog on the nose the dog bites him on the check  and the man and the dog fight like hell and the dog gets his hind legs up like a cat  and like a cat he tears the mans shirt away from his chest and tears the skin of the chest with his claws till it is all red with bleeding  and the man yowyowls and makes noises like a wild mountain lion  and always he chokes the dog  it is a hell of a fight  and the dog is mister kennans dog a fine man and i have worked for him two years  so i will not stand there and see mister kennans dog all killed to pieces by the man who fights like a mountain lion  i run down the hill but i am excited and forget my axe  i run down the hill maybe from this door to that door twenty feet or maybe thirty feet  and it is nearly all finished for the dog  his tongue is a long ways out and his eyes like covered with cobwebs but still he scratches the mans chest with his hindfeet and the man yowyowls like a hen of the mountains  what can i do  i have forgotten the axe  the man will kill the dog  i look for a big rock  there are no rocks  i look for a club  i cannot find a club  and the man is killing the dog  i tell you what i do  i am no fool  i kick the man  my shoes are very heavynot like shoes i wear now  they are the shoes of the woodchopper very thick on the sole with hard leather with many iron nails  i kick the man on the side of the face on the neck right under the ear  i kick once  it is a good kick  it is enough  i know the placeright under the ear  and the man lets go of the dog  he shuts his eyes and opens his mouth and lies very still  and the dog begins once more to breathe  and with the breath comes the life and right away he wants to kill the man  but i say no though i am very much afraid of the dog  and the man begins to become alive  he opens his eyes and he looks at me like a mountain lion  and his mouth makes a noise like a mountain lion  and i am afraid of him like i am afraid of the dog  what am i to do  i have forgotten the axe  i tell you what i do  i kick the man once again under the ear then i take my belt and my bandana handkerchief and i tie him  i tie his hands  i tie his legs too  and all the time i am saying no to the dog and that he must leave the man alone  and the dog looks  he knows i am his friend and am tying the man  and he does not bite me though i am very much afraid  the dog is a terrible dog  do i not know have i not seen him take a strong man out of the saddlea man that is like a mountain lion  and then the men come  they all have gunsrifles shotguns revolvers pistols  and i think first that justice is very quick in the united states  only just now have i kicked a man in the head and onetwothree just like that men come with guns to take me to jail for kicking a man in the head  at first i do not understand  the many men are angry with me  they call me names and say bad things but they do not arrest me  ah  i begin to understand  i hear them talk about three thousand dollars  i have robbed them of three thousand dollars  it is not true  i say so  i say never have i robbed a man of one cent  then they laugh  and i feel better and i understand better  the three thousand dollars is the reward of the government for this man i have tied up with my belt and my bandana  and the three thousand dollars is mine because i kicked the man in the head and tied his hands and his feet  so i do not work for mister kennan any more  i am a rich man  three thousand dollars all mine from the government and mister kennan sees that it is paid to me by the government and not robbed from me by the men with the guns  just because i kicked the man in the head who was like a mountain lion  it is fortune  it is america  and i am glad that i have left italy and come to chop wood on mister kennans ranch  and i start this hotel in glen ellen with the three thousand dollars  i know there is large money in the hotel business  when i was a little boy did not my father have a hotel in napoli  i have now two daughters in high school  also i own an automobile        mercy me the whole ranch is a hospital cried villa kennan two days later as she came out on the broad sleepingporch and regarded harley and jerry stretched out the one with his leg in splints the other with his leg in a plaster cast  look at michael she continued  youre not the only ones with broken bones  ive only just discovered that if his nose isnt broken it ought to be from the blow he must have received on it  ive had hot compresses on it for the last hour  look at it  michael who had followed in at her invitation betrayed a ridiculously swollen nose as he sniffed noses with jerry wagged his bobtail to harley in greeting and was greeted in turn with a blissful hand laid on his head  must have got it in the fight harley said  the fellow struck him with the whip many times so piccolomini says and naturally it would be right across the nose when he jumped for him  and piccolomini says he never cried out when he was struck but went on running and jumping villa took up enthusiastically  think of it  a dog no bigger than michael dragging out of the saddle a mankilling outlaw whom scores of officers could not catch  so far as we are concerned he did better than that harley commented quietly  if it hadnt been for michael and for jerry tooif it hadnt been for the pair of them i do verily believe that that lunatic would have kicked my head off as he promised  the blessed pair of them villa cried with shining eyes as her hand flashed out to her husbands in a quick press of heartthankfulness  the last word has not been said upon the wonder of dogs she added as with a quick winking of her eyelashes to overcome the impending moistness she controlled her emotion  the last word of the wonder of dogs will never be said harley spoke returning the pressure of her hand and releasing it in order to help her  and just for that were going to say something right now she smiled jerry and michael and i  weve been practising it in secret for a surprise for you  you just lie there and listen  its the doxology dont laugh  no pun intended  she bent forward from the stool on which she sat and drew michael to her so that he sat between her knees her two hands holding his head and jowls his nose halfburied in her hair  now jerry she called sharply as a singing teacher might call so that jerry turned his head in attention looked at her smiled understanding with his eyes and waited  it was villa who started and pitched the doxology but quickly the two dogs joined with their own soft mellow howling if howling it may be called when it was so soft and mellow and true  and all that had vanished into the nothingness was in the minds of the two dogs as they sang and they sang back through the nothingness to the land of otherwhere and ran once again with the lost pack and yet were not entirely unaware of the present and of the indubitable twolegged god who was called villa and who sang with them and loved them  no reason we shouldnt make a quartette of it remarked harley kennan as with his own voice he joined in
