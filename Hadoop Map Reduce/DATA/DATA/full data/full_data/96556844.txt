for     ralph and betsy    illustration  what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen  listen to the story of jemima puddleduck who was annoyed because the farmers wife would not let her hatch her own eggs  illustration  her sisterinlaw mrs rebeccah puddleduck was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one elsei have not the patience to sit on a nest for twentyeight days and no more have you jemima you would let them go cold you know you would  i wish to hatch my own eggs i will hatch them all by myself quacked jemima puddleduck  illustration  she tried to hide her eggs but they were always found and carried off  jemima puddleduck became quite desperate she determined to make a nest right away from the farm  illustration  she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cartroad that leads over the hill  she was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet  illustration  when she reached the top of the hill she saw a wood in the distance  she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot  illustration  jemima puddleduck was not much in the habit of flying she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl and then she jumped off into the air  illustration  she flew beautifully when she had got a good start  she skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood where the trees and brushwood had been cleared  illustration  jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nestingplace she rather fancied a treestump amongst some tall foxgloves  butseated upon the stump she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper  he had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers  quack said jemima puddleduck with her head and her bonnet on one sidequack  illustration  the gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at jemima  madam have you lost your way said he he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon as the stump was somewhat damp  jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome she explained that she had not lost her way but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nestingplace  illustration  ah is that so indeed said the gentleman with sandy whiskers looking curiously at jemima he folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket  jemima complained of the superfluous hen  indeed how interesting i wish i could meet with that fowl i would teach it to mind its own business  illustration  but as to a nestthere is no difficulty i have a sackful of feathers in my woodshed no my dear madam you will be in nobodys way you may sit there as long as you like said the bushy longtailed gentleman  he led the way to a very retired dismallooking house amongst the foxgloves  it was built of faggots and turf and there were two broken pails one on top of another by way of a chimney  illustration  this is my summer residence you would not find my earthmy winter houseso convenient said the hospitable gentleman  there was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house made of old soapboxes the gentleman opened the door and showed jemima in  illustration  the shed was almost quite full of feathersit was almost suffocating but it was comfortable and very soft  jemima puddleduck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers but it was very comfortable and she made a nest without any trouble at all  illustration  when she came out the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaperat least he had it spread out but he was looking over the top of it  he was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day  he said he loved eggs and ducklings he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his woodshed  illustration  jemima puddleduck came every afternoon she laid nine eggs in the nest they were greeny white and very large the foxy gentleman admired them immensely he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there  at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next dayand i will bring a bag of corn with me so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched they might catch cold said the conscientious jemima  illustration  madam i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag i will provide oats but before you commence your tedious sitting i intend to give you a treat let us have a dinnerparty all to ourselves  may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farmgarden to make a savoury omelette sage and thyme and mint and two onions and some parsley i will provide lard for the stufflard for the omelette said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers  illustration  jemima puddleduck was a simpleton not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious  she went round the farmgarden nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck  illustration  and she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket  the colliedog kep met her coming out what are you doing with those onions where do you go every afternoon by yourself jemima puddleduck  jemima was rather in awe of the collie she told him the whole story  the collie listened with his wise head on one side he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers  illustration  he asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed  then he went out and trotted down the village he went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher  illustration  jemima puddleduck went up the cartroad for the last time on a sunny afternoon she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag  she flew over the wood and alighted opposite the house of the bushy longtailed gentleman  illustration  he was sitting on a log he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood when jemima alighted he quite jumped  come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs give me the herbs for the omelette be sharp  he was rather abrupt jemima puddleduck had never heard him speak like that  she felt surprised and uncomfortable  illustration  while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door and then locked it  jemima became much alarmed  illustration  a moment afterwards there were most awful noisesbarking baying growls and howls squealing and groans  and nothing more was ever seen of that foxywhiskered gentleman  presently kep opened the door of the shed and let out jemima puddleduck  illustration  unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them  he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping  illustration  jemima puddleduck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs  illustration  she laid some more in june and she was permitted to keep them herself but only four of them hatched  jemima puddleduck said that it was because of her nerves but she had always been a bad sitter
