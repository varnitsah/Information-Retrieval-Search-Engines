58030425	endymion  a poetic romance   by john keats  the stretched metre of an antique song  london printed for taylor and hessey 93 fleet street 1818  inscribed to the memory of thomas chatterton     preface   knowing within myself the manner in which this poem has been produced it is not without a feeling of regret that i make it public  what manner i mean will be quite clear to the reader who must soon perceive great inexperience immaturity and every error denoting a feverish attempt rather than a deed accomplished the two first books and indeed the two last i feel sensible are not of such completion as to warrant their passing the press nor should they if i thought a years castigation would do them any goodit will not the foundations are too sandy it is just that this youngster should die away a sad thought for me if i had not some hope that while it is dwindling i may be plotting and fitting myself for verses fit to live  this may be speaking too presumptuously and may deserve a punishment but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it he will leave me alone with the conviction that there is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object this is not written with the least atom of purpose to forestall criticisms of course but from the desire i have to conciliate men who are competent to look and who do look with a zealous eye to the honour of english literature  the imagination of a boy is healthy and the mature imagination of a man is healthy but there is a space of life between in which the soul is in a ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain the ambition thicksighted thence proceeds mawkishness and all the thousand bitters which those men i speak of must necessarily taste in going over the following pages  i hope i have not in too late a day touched the beautiful mythology of greece and dulled its brightness for i wish to try once more before i bid it farewel    teignmouth   april 10 1818     erratum   page 108 line 4 from the bottom for her read his     endymion  book i     a thing of beauty is a joy for ever   its loveliness increases it will never   pass into nothingness but still will keep   a bower quiet for us and a sleep   full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing   therefore on every morrow are we wreathing   a flowery band to bind us to the earth   spite of despondence of the inhuman dearth   of noble natures of the gloomy days   of all the unhealthy and oerdarkened ways                    10   made for our searching yes in spite of all   some shape of beauty moves away the pall   from our dark spirits such the sun the moon   trees old and young sprouting a shady boon   for simple sheep and such are daffodils   with the green world they live in and clear rills   that for themselves a cooling covert make   gainst the hot season the mid forest brake   rich with a sprinkling of fair muskrose blooms   and such too is the grandeur of the dooms                      20   we have imagined for the mighty dead   all lovely tales that we have heard or read   an endless fountain of immortal drink   pouring unto us from the heavens brink      nor do we merely feel these essences   for one short hour no even as the trees   that whisper round a temple become soon   dear as the temples self so does the moon   the passion poesy glories infinite   haunt us till they become a cheering light                     30   unto our souls and bound to us so fast   that whether there be shine or gloom oercast   they alway must be with us or we die      therefore tis with full happiness that i   will trace the story of endymion   the very music of the name has gone   into my being and each pleasant scene   is growing fresh before me as the green   of our own vallies so i will begin   now while i cannot hear the citys din                        40   now while the early budders are just new   and run in mazes of the youngest hue   about old forests while the willow trails   its delicate amber and the dairy pails   bring home increase of milk and as the year   grows lush in juicy stalks ill smoothly steer   my little boat for many quiet hours   with streams that deepen freshly into bowers   many and many a verse i hope to write   before the daisies vermeil rimmd and white                  50   hide in deep herbage and ere yet the bees   hum about globes of clover and sweet peas   i must be near the middle of my story   o may no wintry season bare and hoary   see it half finished but let autumn bold   with universal tinge of sober gold   be all about me when i make an end   and now at once adventuresome i send   my herald thought into a wilderness   there let its trumpet blow and quickly dress                  60   my uncertain path with green that i may speed   easily onward thorough flowers and weed      upon the sides of latmos was outspread   a mighty forest for the moist earth fed   so plenteously all weedhidden roots   into oerhanging boughs and precious fruits   and it had gloomy shades sequestered deep   where no man went and if from shepherds keep   a lamb strayed far adown those inmost glens   never again saw he the happy pens                              70   whither his brethren bleating with content   over the hills at every nightfall went   among the shepherds twas believed ever   that not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever   from the white flock but passd unworried   by angry wolf or pard with prying head   until it came to some unfooted plains   where fed the herds of pan ay great his gains   who thus one lamb did lose paths there were many   winding through palmy fern and rushes fenny                  80   and ivy banks all leading pleasantly   to a wide lawn whence one could only see   stems thronging all around between the swell   of turf and slanting branches who could tell   the freshness of the space of heaven above   edgd round with dark tree tops through which a dove   would often beat its wings and often too   a little cloud would move across the blue      full in the middle of this pleasantness   there stood a marble altar with a tress                       90   of flowers budded newly and the dew   had taken fairy phantasies to strew   daisies upon the sacred sward last eve   and so the dawned light in pomp receive   for twas the morn apollos upward fire   made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre   of brightness so unsullied that therein   a melancholy spirit well might win   oblivion and melt out his essence fine   into the winds rainscented eglantine                        100   gave temperate sweets to that wellwooing sun   the lark was lost in him cold springs had run   to warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass   mans voice was on the mountains and the mass   of natures lives and wonders pulsd tenfold   to feel this sunrise and its glories old      now while the silent workings of the dawn   were busiest into that selfsame lawn   all suddenly with joyful cries there sped   a troop of little children garlanded                         110   who gathering round the altar seemed to pry   earnestly round as wishing to espy   some folk of holiday nor had they waited   for many moments ere their ears were sated   with a faint breath of music which evn then   filld out its voice and died away again   within a little space again it gave   its airy swellings with a gentle wave   to lighthung leaves in smoothest echoes breaking   through copseclad valliesere their death oertaking   the surgy murmurs of the lonely sea                          121      and now as deep into the wood as we   might mark a lynxs eye there glimmered light   fair faces and a rush of garments white   plainer and plainer shewing till at last   into the widest alley they all past   making directly for the woodland altar   o kindly muse let not my weak tongue faulter   in telling of this goodly company   of their old piety and of their glee                        130   but let a portion of ethereal dew   fall on my head and presently unmew   my soul that i may dare in wayfaring   to stammer where old chaucer used to sing      leading the way young damsels danced along   bearing the burden of a shepherd song   each having a white wicker over brimmd   with aprils tender younglings next well trimmd   a crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks   as may be read of in arcadian books                          140   such as sat listening round apollos pipe   when the great deity for earth too ripe   let his divinity oerflowing die   in music through the vales of thessaly   some idly trailed their sheephooks on the ground   and some kept up a shrilly mellow sound   with ebontipped flutes close after these   now coming from beneath the forest trees   a venerable priest full soberly   begirt with ministring looks alway his eye                   150   stedfast upon the matted turf he kept   and after him his sacred vestments swept   from his right hand there swung a vase milkwhite   of mingled wine outsparkling generous light   and in his left he held a basket full   of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull   wild thyme and valleylilies whiter still   than ledas love and cresses from the rill   his aged head crowned with beechen wreath   seemd like a poll of ivy in the teeth                        160   of winter hoar then came another crowd   of shepherds lifting in due time aloud   their share of the ditty after them appeard   upfollowed by a multitude that reard   their voices to the clouds a fair wrought car   easily rolling so as scarce to mar   the freedom of three steeds of dapple brown   who stood therein did seem of great renown   among the throng his youth was fully blown   shewing like ganymede to manhood grown                       170   and for those simple times his garments were   a chieftain kings beneath his breast half bare   was hung a silver bugle and between   his nervy knees there lay a boarspear keen   a smile was on his countenance he seemd   to common lookers on like one who dreamd   of idleness in groves elysian   but there were some who feelingly could scan   a lurking trouble in his nether lip   and see that oftentimes the reins would slip                  180   through his forgotten hands then would they sigh   and think of yellow leaves of owlets cry   of logs piled solemnlyah welladay   why should our young endymion pine away      soon the assembly in a circle rangd   stood silent round the shrine each look was changd   to sudden veneration women meek   beckond their sons to silence while each cheek   of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear   endymion too without a forest peer                          190   stood wan and pale and with an awed face   among his brothers of the mountain chase   in midst of all the venerable priest   eyed them with joy from greatest to the least   and after lifting up his aged hands   thus spake he men of latmos shepherd bands   whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks   whether descended from beneath the rocks   that overtop your mountains whether come   from vallies where the pipe is never dumb                    200   or from your swelling downs where sweet air stirs   blue harebells lightly and where prickly furze   buds lavish gold or ye whose precious charge   nibble their fill at oceans very marge   whose mellow reeds are touchd with sounds forlorn   by the dim echoes of old tritons horn   mothers and wives who day by day prepare   the scrip with needments for the mountain air   and all ye gentle girls who foster up   udderless lambs and in a little cup                          210   will put choice honey for a favoured youth   yea every one attend for in good truth   our vows are wanting to our great god pan   are not our lowing heifers sleeker than   nightswollen mushrooms are not our wide plains   speckled with countless fleeces have not rains   greend over aprils lap no howling sad   sickens our fearful ewes and we have had   great bounty from endymion our lord   the earth is glad the merry lark has pourd                  220   his early song against yon breezy sky   that spreads so clear oer our solemnity      thus ending on the shrine he heapd a spire   of teeming sweets enkindling sacred fire   anon he staind the thick and spongy sod   with wine in honour of the shepherdgod   now while the earth was drinking it and while   bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile   and gummy frankincense was sparkling bright   neath smothering parsley and a hazy light                   230   spread greyly eastward thus a chorus sang      o thou whose mighty palace roof doth hang   from jagged trunks and overshadoweth   eternal whispers glooms the birth life death   of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness   who lovst to see the hamadryads dress   their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken   and through whole solemn hours dost sit and hearken   the dreary melody of bedded reeds

lambkins from the eagles maw   or by mysterious enticement draw   bewildered shepherds to their path again   or to tread breathless round the frothy main                 270   and gather up all fancifullest shells   for thee to tumble into naiads cells   and being hidden laugh at their outpeeping   or to delight thee with fantastic leaping   the while they pelt each other on the crown   with

through those regions be   his messenger his little mercury   some were athirst in soul to see again   their fellow huntsmen oer the wide champaign   in times long past to sit with them and talk   of all the chances in their earthly walk   comparing joyfully their plenteous stores   of happiness to when upon the moors                         390   benighted close they huddled from the cold   and shard their famishd scrips thus all outtold   their fond imaginationssaving him   whose eyelids curtaind up their jewels dim   endymion yet hourly had he striven   to hide the cankering venom that had riven   his fainting recollections now indeed   his senses had swoond off he did not heed   the sudden silence or the whispers low   or the old eyes dissolving at his woe                        400   or anxious calls or close of trembling palms   or maidens sigh that grief itself embalms   but in the selfsame fixed trance he kept   like one who on the earth had never slept   aye even as deadstill as a marble man   frozen in that old tale arabian      who whispers him so pantingly and close   peona his sweet sister of all those   his friends the dearest hushing signs she made   and breathd a sisters sorrow to persuade                    410   a yielding up a cradling on her care   her eloquence did breathe away the curse   she led him like some midnight spirit nurse   of happy changes in emphatic dreams   along a path between two little streams   guarding his forehead with her round elbow   from lowgrown branches and his footsteps slow   from stumbling over stumps and hillocks small   until they came to where these streamlets fall   with mingled bubblings and a gentle rush                     420   into a river clear brimful and flush   with crystal mocking of the trees and sky   a little shallop floating there hard by   pointed its beak over the fringed bank   and soon it lightly dipt and rose and sank   and dipt again with the young couples weight   peona guiding through the water straight   towards a bowery island opposite   which gaining presently she steered light   into a shady fresh and ripply cove                         430   where nested was an arbour overwove   by many a summers silent fingering   to whose cool bosom she was used to bring   her playmates with their needle broidery   and minstrel memories of times gone by      so she was gently glad to see him laid   under her favourite bowers quiet shade   on her own couch new made of flower leaves   dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves   when last the sun his autumn tresses shook                   440   and the tannd harvesters rich armfuls took   soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest   but ere it crept upon him he had prest   peonas busy hand against his lips   and still a sleeping held her fingertips   in tender pressure and as a willow keeps   a patient watch over the stream that creeps   windingly by it so the quiet maid   held her in peace so that a whispering blade   of grass a wailful gnat a bee bustling                      450   down in the bluebells or a wren light rustling   among sere leaves and twigs might all be heard      o magic sleep o comfortable bird   that broodest oer the troubled sea of the mind   till it is hushd and smooth o unconfind   restraint imprisoned liberty great key   to golden palaces strange minstrelsy   fountains grotesque new trees bespangled caves   echoing grottos full of tumbling waves   and moonlight aye to all the mazy world                     460   of silvery enchantmentwho upfurld   beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour   but renovates and livesthus in the bower   endymion was calmd to life again   opening his eyelids with a healthier brain   he said i feel this thine endearing love   all through my bosom thou art as a dove   trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings   about me and the pearliest dew not brings   such morning incense from the fields of may                  470   as do those brighter drops that twinkling stray   from those kind eyesthe very home and haunt   of sisterly affection can i want   aught else aught nearer heaven than such tears   yet dry them up in bidding hence all fears   that any longer i will pass my days   alone and sad no i will once more raise   my voice upon the mountainheights once more   make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar   again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll             480   around the breathed boar again ill poll   the fairgrown yew tree for a chosen bow   and when the pleasant sun is getting low   again ill linger in a sloping mead   to hear the speckled thrushes and see feed   our idle sheep so be thou cheered sweet   and if thy lute is here softly intreat   my soul to keep in its resolved course      hereat peona in their silver source   shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim                 490   and took a lute from which there pulsing came   a lively prelude fashioning the way   in which her voice should wander twas a lay   more subtle cadenced more forest wild   than dryopes lone lulling of her child   and nothing since has floated in the air   so mournful strange surely some influence rare   went spiritual through the damsels hand   for still with delphic emphasis she spannd   the quick invisible strings even though she saw              500   endymions spirit melt away and thaw   before the deep intoxication   but soon she came with sudden burst upon   her selfpossessionswung the lute aside   and earnestly said brother tis vain to hide   that thou dost know of things mysterious   immortal starry such alone could thus   weigh down thy nature hast thou sinnd in aught   offensive to the heavenly powers caught   a paphian dove upon a message sent                           510   thy deathful bow against some deerherd bent   sacred to dian haply thou hast seen   her naked limbs among the alders green   and that alas is death no i can trace   something more high perplexing in thy face      endymion lookd at her and pressd her hand   and said art thou so pale who wast so bland   and merry in our meadows how is this   tell me thine ailment tell me all amiss   ah thou hast been unhappy at the change                      520   wrought suddenly in me what indeed more strange   or more complete to overwhelm surmise   ambition is no sluggard tis no prize   that toiling years would put within my grasp   that i have sighd for with so deadly gasp   no man eer panted for a mortal love   so all have set my heavier grief above   these things which happen rightly have they done   i who still saw the horizontal sun   heave his broad shoulder oer the edge of the world          530   outfacing lucifer and then had hurld   my spear aloft as signal for the chace   i who for very sport of heart would race   with my own steed from araby pluck down   a vulture from his towery perching frown   a lion into growling loth retire   to lose at once all my toil breeding fire   and sink thus low but i will ease my breast   of secret grief here in this bowery nest      this river does not see the naked sky                     540   till it begins to progress silverly   around the western border of the wood   whence from a certain spot its winding flood   seems at the distance like a crescent moon   and in that nook the very pride of june   had i been used to pass my weary eves   the rather for the sun unwilling leaves   so dear a picture of his sovereign power   and i could witness his most kingly hour   when he doth lighten up the golden reins                     550   and paces leisurely down amber plains   his snorting four now when his chariot last   its beams against the zodiaclion cast   there blossomd suddenly a magic bed   of sacred ditamy and poppies red   at which i wondered greatly knowing well   that but one night had wrought this flowery spell   and sitting down close by began to muse   what it might mean perhaps thought i morpheus   in passing here his owlet pinions shook                     560   or it may be ere matron night uptook   her ebon urn young mercury by stealth   had dipt his rod in it such garland wealth   came not by common growth thus on i thought   until my head was dizzy and distraught   moreover through the dancing poppies stole   a breeze most softly lulling to my soul   and shaping visions all about my sight   of colours wings and bursts of spangly light   the which became more strange and strange and dim   and then were gulphd in a tumultuous swim                   571   and then i fell asleep ah can i tell   the enchantment that afterwards befel   yet it was but a dream yet such a dream   that never tongue although it overteem   with mellow utterance like a cavern spring   could figure out and to conception bring   all i beheld and felt methought i lay   watching the zenith where the milky way   among the stars in virgin splendour pours                    580   and travelling my eye until the doors   of heaven appeard to open for my flight   i became loth and fearful to alight   from such high soaring by a downward glance   so kept me stedfast in that airy trance   spreading imaginary pinions wide   when presently the stars began to glide   and faint away before my eager view   at which i sighd that i could not pursue   and dropt my vision to the horizons verge                   590   and lo from opening clouds i saw emerge   the loveliest moon that ever silverd oer   a shell for neptunes goblet she did soar   so passionately bright my dazzled soul   commingling with her argent spheres did roll   through clear and cloudy even when she went   at last into a dark and vapoury tent   whereat methought the lidlesseyed train   of planets all were in the blue again   to commune with those orbs once more i raisd                600   my sight right upward but it was quite dazed   by a bright something sailing down apace   making me quickly veil my eyes and face   again i lookd and o ye deities   who from olympus watch our destinies   whence that completed form of all completeness   whence came that high perfection of all sweetness   speak stubborn earth and tell me where o where   hast thou a symbol of her golden hair   not oatsheaves drooping in the western sun                  610   notthy soft hand fair sister let me shun   such follying before theeyet she had   indeed locks bright enough to make me mad   and they were simply gordiand up and braided   leaving in naked comeliness unshaded   her pearl round ears white neck and orbed brow   the which were blended in i know not how   with such a paradise of lips and eyes   blushtinted cheeks half smiles and faintest sighs   that when i think thereon my spirit clings                  620   and plays about its fancy till the stings   of human neighbourhood envenom all   unto what awful power shall i call   to what high faneah see her hovering feet   more bluely veind more soft more whitely sweet   than those of seaborn venus when she rose   from out her cradle shell the wind outblows   her scarf into a fluttering pavilion   tis blue and overspangled with a million   of little eyes as though thou wert to shed                  630   over the darkest lushest bluebell bed   handfuls of daisiesendymion how strange   dream within dreamshe took an airy range   and then towards me like a very maid   came blushing waning willing and afraid   and pressd me by the hand ah twas too much   methought i fainted at the charmed touch   yet held my recollection even as one   who dives three fathoms where the waters run   gurgling in beds of coral for anon                          640   i felt upmounted in that region   where falling stars dart their artillery forth   and eagles struggle with the buffeting north   that balances the heavy meteorstone   felt too i was not fearful nor alone   but lappd and lulld along the dangerous sky   soon as it seemd we left our journeying high   and straightway into frightful eddies swoopd   such as ay muster where grey time has scoopd   huge dens and caverns in a mountains side                   650   there hollow sounds arousd me and i sighd   to faint once more by looking on my bliss   i was distracted madly did i kiss   the wooing arms which held me and did give   my eyes at once to death but twas to live   to take in draughts of life from the gold fount   of kind and passionate looks to count and count   the moments by some greedy help that seemd   a second self that each might be redeemd   and plunderd of its load of blessedness                     660   ah desperate mortal i evn dard to press   her very cheek against my crowned lip   and at that moment felt my body dip   into a warmer air a moment more   our feet were soft in flowers there was store   of newest joys upon that alp sometimes   a scent of violets and blossoming limes   loiterd around us then of honey cells   made delicate from all whiteflower bells   and once above the edges of our nest                        670   an arch face peepdan oread as i guessd      why did i dream that sleep oerpowerd me   in midst of all this heaven why not see   far off the shadows of his pinions dark   and stare them from me but no like a spark   that needs must die although its little beam   reflects upon a diamond my sweet dream   fell into nothinginto stupid sleep   and so it was until a gentle creep   a careful moving caught my waking ears                       680   and up i started ah my sighs my tears   my clenched handsfor lo the poppies hung   dewdabbled on their stalks the ouzel sung   a heavy ditty and the sullen day   had chidden herald hesperus away   with leaden looks the solitary breeze   blusterd and slept and its wild self did teaze   with wayward melancholy and i thought   mark me peona that sometimes it brought   faint faretheewells and sighshrilled adieus            690   away i wanderdall the pleasant hues   of heaven and earth had faded deepest shades   were deepest dungeons heaths and sunny glades   were full of pestilent light our taintless rills   seemd sooty and oerspread with upturnd gills   of dying fish the vermeil rose had blown   in frightful scarlet and its thorns outgrown   like spiked aloe if an innocent bird   before my heedless footsteps stirrd and stirrd   in little journeys i beheld in it                            700   a disguisd demon missioned to knit   my soul with under darkness to entice   my stumblings down some monstrous precipice   therefore i eager followed and did curse   the disappointment time that aged nurse   rockd me to patience now thank gentle heaven   these things with all their comfortings are given   to my downsunken hours and with thee   sweet sister help to stem the ebbing sea   of weary life                                               710                     thus ended he and both   sat silent for the maid was very loth   to answer feeling well that breathed words   would all be lost unheard and vain as swords   against the enchased crocodile or leaps   of grasshoppers against the sun she weeps   and wonders struggles to devise some blame   to put on such a look as would say shame   on this poor weakness but for all her strife   she could as soon have crushd away the life                  720   from a sick dove at length to break the pause   she said with trembling chance is this the cause   this all yet it is strange and sad alas   that one who through this middle earth should pass   most like a sojourning demigod and leave   his name upon the harpstring should achieve   no higher bard than simple maidenhood   singing alone and fearfullyhow the blood   left his young cheek and how he used to stray   he knew not where and how he would say nay               730   if any said twas love and yet twas love   what could it be but love how a ringdove   let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path   and how he died and then that love doth scathe   the gentle heart as northern blasts do roses   and then the ballad of his sad life closes   with sighs and an alasendymion   be rather in the trumpets mouthanon   among the winds at largethat all may hearken

intensity the crown of these   is made of love and friendship and sits high   upon the forehead of humanity   all its more ponderous and bulky worth   is friendship whence there ever issues forth   a steady splendour but at the tiptop   there hangs by unseen film an orbed drop   of light and that is love its influence   thrown in our eyes genders a novel sense   at which we start and fret till in the end                  810   melting into its radiance we blend   mingle and so become a part of it   nor with aught else can our souls interknit   so wingedly when we combine therewith   lifes self

and winnow from the coming step of time                       820   all chaff of custom wipe away all slime   left by menslugs and human serpentry   have been content to let occasion die   whilst they did sleep in loves elysium   and truly i would rather be struck dumb   than speak against this ardent listlessness   for i have ever thought that it might bless   the world with benefits unknowingly   as does the nightingale upperched high   and cloisterd among cool and bunched leaves                830   she sings but to her love nor eer conceives   how tiptoe night holds back her darkgrey hood

seem   when i have told thee how my waking sight                     860   has made me scruple whether that same night   was passd in dreaming hearken sweet peona   beyond the matrontemple of latona   which we should see but for these darkening boughs   lies a deep hollow from whose ragged brows   bushes and trees do lean all round athwart   and meet so nearly that with wings outraught   and spreaded tail a vulture could not glide   past them but he must brush on every side   some moulderd steps lead into this cool cell                870   far as the slabbed margin of a well   whose patient level peeps its crystal eye   right upward through the bushes to the sky   oft have i brought thee flowers on their stalks set   like vestal primroses but dark velvet   edges them round and they have golden pits   twas there i got them from the gaps and slits   in a mossy stone that sometimes was my seat   when all above was faint with midday heat   and there in strife no burning

the open plain   and therefore was just going when behold   a wonder fair as any i have told   the same bright face i tasted in my sleep   smiling in the clear well my heart did leap   through the cool depthit moved as if to flee   i started up when lo refreshfully   there came upon my face in plenteous showers                900   dewdrops and dewy buds and leaves and flowers   wrapping all

sickening how dark the dreadful leisure   of weary days made deeper exquisite   by a foreknowledge of unslumbrous night   like sorrow came upon me heavier still   than when i wanderd from the poppy

hour to each lushleavd rill   now he is sitting by a shady spring   and elbowdeep with feverous fingering   stems the upbursting cold a wild rose tree   pavilions him in bloom and he doth see   a bud which snares his fancy lo but now   he plucks it dips its stalk in the water how   it swells it buds it flowers beneath his sight              60   and in the middle there is softly pight   a golden

away one track unseams   a wooded cleft and far away the blue   of ocean fades upon him then anew   he sinks adown a solitary glen   where there was never sound of mortal men   saving perhaps some snowlight cadences                      80   melting to silence when upon the breeze   some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet   to cheer itself to delphi still his feet   went swift beneath the

her dripping hand she softly kist   and anxiously began to plait and twist   her ringlets round her fingers saying youth   too long alas hast thou starvd on the ruth   the bitterness of love too long

must wander far   in other regions past the scanty bar   to mortal steps before thou canst be taen   from every wasting sigh from every pain   into the gentle bosom of thy love   why it is thus one

amaze   the dashing fount pourd on and where its pool   lay half asleep in grass and rushes cool   quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still   and fish were dimpling as if good nor ill   had fallen out that hour the wanderer   holding his forehead to keep off the burr   of smothering fancies patiently sat down                    140   and while beneath the evenings sleepy frown   glowworms began to trim their starry lamps   thus breathd he to himself whoso encamps   to take a fancied city of delight   o what a wretch is he and when tis his   after long toil and travelling to miss   the kernel of his hopes how more than vile   yet for him theres refreshment even in toil   another city doth he set about   free from the smallest pebblehead of doubt                   150   that he will seize on trickling honeycombs   alas he finds them dry and then he foams   and onward to another city speeds   but this is human life the war the deeds   the disappointment the anxiety   imaginations struggles far and nigh   all human bearing in themselves this good   that they are still the air the subtle food   to make us feel existence and to shew   how quiet death is where soil is men grow                   160   whether to weeds or flowers but for me   there is no depth to strike in i can see   nought earthly worth my compassing so stand   upon a misty jutting head of land   alone no no and by the orphean lute   when mad eurydice is listening tot   id rather stand upon this misty peak   with not a thing to sigh for or to seek   but the soft shadow of my thriceseen love

uncertainty and shadows grim   there when new wonders ceasd to float before   and thoughts of self came on how crude and sore   the journey homeward to habitual self   a madpursuing of the fogborn elf

peeps into a wood   so saw he panting light and towards it went   through winding alleys and lo wonderment   upon soft verdure saw one here one there   cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair      after a thousand mazes overgone   at last with sudden step he came upon   a chamber myrtle walld embowered high                     390   full of light incense tender minstrelsy   and more of beautiful and strange beside   for on a silken couch of rosy pride   in midst of all there lay a sleeping youth   of fondest beauty fonder in fair sooth   than sighs could fathom or contentment reach   and coverlids goldtinted like the peach   or ripe octobers faded marigolds   fell sleek about him in a thousand folds   not hiding up an apollonian curve                             400   of neck and

uprose to look   at the youths slumber while another took   a willowbough distilling odorous dew   and shook it on his hair another flew   in through the woven roof and flutteringwise   raind violets

treading went   to that same featherd lyrist who straightway   smiling thus whisperd though from upper day   thou art a wanderer and thy presence here   might seem unholy be of happy cheer   for tis

backward yawns but all were soon alive   for as delicious wine doth sparkling dive   in nectard clouds and curls through water fair   so from the arbour roof down swelld an air   odorous and enlivening making all   to laugh and play and sing and loudly call   for their sweet queen when lo the wreathed green   disparted and far upward could be seen   blue heaven and a silver car airborne   whose silent wheels fresh wet from clouds of morn   spun off a drizzling dewwhich falling chill                521   on soft adonis shoulders made him still   nestle and turn uneasily about   soon

heavy hours i used to rue   the endless sleep of this newborn adon   this stranger ay i pitied for upon   a dreary morning once i fled away   into the breezy clouds to weep and pray   for this my love for vexing mars had teazd   me even to tears thence when a little easd                560   downlooking vacant through a hazy wood   i saw this youth as he despairing stood   those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind   those same full fringed lids a constant blind   over his sullen eyes i saw him throw   himself on witherd leaves even as though   death had come sudden for no jot he movd   yet mutterd wildly i could hear he lovd   some fair immortal and that his embrace   had zoned her through the night there is no trace            570   of this in heaven i have markd each cheek   and

580   the impatient doves up rose the floating car   up went the hum celestial high afar   the latmian saw them minish into nought   and when all were clear vanishd still he caught   a vivid lightning from that dreadful bow   when all was darkened with etnean throe   the earth closdgave a solitary moan   and left him once again in twilight lone      he did not rave he did not stare aghast   for all those visions were oergone and past                590   and he in loneliness he felt assurd   of happy times when all he had endurd   would seem a feather to the mighty prize   so with unusual gladness on he hies   through caves and palaces of mottled ore   gold dome and crystal wall and turquois floor   black polishd porticos of awful shade   and at the last a diamond balustrade   leading afar past wild magnificence   spiral through ruggedest loopholes and thence                600   stretching across a void then guiding oer   enormous chasms where all foam and roar   streams subterranean tease their granite beds   then heightend just above the silvery heads   of a thousand fountains so that he could dash   the waters with his spear but at the splash   done heedlessly those spouting columns rose   sudden a poplars height and gan to enclose   his diamond path with fretwork streaming round   alive and dazzling cool and with a sound                   610   haply like dolphin tumults when sweet shells   welcome the float of thetis long he dwells   on this delight for every minutes space   the streams with changed magic interlace   sometimes like delicatest lattices   coverd with crystal vines then weeping trees   moving about as in a gentle wind   which in a wink to watery gauze refind   pourd into shapes of curtaind canopies   spangled and rich with liquid broideries                     620   of flowers peacocks swans and naiads fair   swifter than lightning went these wonders rare   and then the water into stubborn streams   collecting mimickd the wrought oaken beams   pillars and frieze and high fantastic roof   of those dusk places in times far aloof   cathedrals calld he bade a loth farewel   to these founts protean passing gulph and dell   and torrent and ten thousand jutting shapes   half seen through deepest gloom and griesly gapes           630   blackening on every side and overhead   a vaulted dome like heavens far bespread   with starlight gems aye all so huge and strange   the solitary felt a hurried change   working within him into something dreary   vexd like a morning eagle lost and weary   and purblind amid foggy midnight

fathoming plummet down he fell   through unknown things till exhaled asphodel   and rose with spicy fannings interbreathd   came swelling forth where little caves were wreathd   so thick with leaves

did their anxious fears   question that thus it was long time they lay   fondling and kissing every doubt away   long time ere soft caressing sobs began   to mellow into words and then there ran   two

was past all things fair   he saw far in the concave green of the sea   an old man sitting calm and peacefully   upon a weeded rock this old man sat   and his white hair was awful and a mat   of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet   and ample as the largest windingsheet   a cloak of blue wrappd up his aged bones   oerwrought with symbols by the deepest groans                200   of

this old man lay a pearly wand   and in his lap a book the which he connd   so stedfastly that the new denizen   had time to keep him in amazed ken   to mark these shadowings and stand in awe      the old man raisd his hoary head and saw   the wilderd strangerseeming not to see                    220   his features were so lifeless suddenly   he woke as from a trance his snowwhite brows   went arching up and like two magic ploughs   furrowd deep wrinkles in his forehead large   which kept as fixedly as rocky marge   till round his witherd lips had gone a smile   then up he rose like one whose tedious toil   had watchd for years in forlorn hermitage   who had not from midlife to utmost age   easd in one accent his oerburdend soul                   230   even to the trees he rose he graspd his stole   with convulsd clenches waving it abroad   and in a voice of solemn joy that awd   echo into oblivion he said      thou art the man now shall i lay my head   in peace upon my watery

searing hand   and leave a black memorial on the sand   or tear me piecemeal with a bony saw   and keep me as a chosen food to draw   his magian fish through hated fire and flame   o misery of hell resistless tame   am i to be burnt up no i will shout   until the gods through heavens blue look out   o tartarus but some few days agone                           270   her soft arms were entwining

   arise good youth for sacred phœbus sake   i know thine inmost bosom and i feel   a very brothers yearning for thee steal   into mine own for why thou openest   the prison gates that have so long

silently their footprints                                     my soul stands   now past the midway from mortality   and so i can prepare without a sigh   to tell thee briefly all my joy and pain   i

housing from the storm and tempests mad   but hollow rocksand they were palaces   of silent happiness of slumberous ease   long years of misery have told me so   aye thus it was one thousand years ago   one thousand yearsis it then possible   to look so plainly through them to dispel                    330   a thousand years with backward glance sublime   to breathe away as twere all scummy slime   from off a crystal pool to see its deep   and ones own image from the bottom peep   yes now i am no longer wretched thrall   my long captivity and moanings all   are but a slime a thinpervading scum   the which i breathe away and thronging come   like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures      i touchd no lute i sang not trod no measures   i was a lonely youth on desert shores                        341   my sports were lonely mid continuous roars   and craggy isles and seamews plaintive cry   plaining discrepant between sea and sky   dolphins were still my playmates shapes unseen   would let me feel their scales of gold and green   nor be my desolation and full oft   when a dread waterspout had reard aloft   its hungry hugeness seeming ready ripe   to burst with hoarsest thunderings and wipe                  350   my life away like a vast sponge of fate   some friendly monster pitying my sad state   has dived to its foundations gulphd it down   and left me tossing safely but the crown   of all my life was utmost quietude   more did i love to lie in cavern rude   keeping in wait whole days for neptunes voice   and if it came at last hark and rejoice   there blushd no summer eve but i would steer   my skiff along green shelving coasts to hear                 360   the shepherds pipe come clear from aery steep   mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep   and never was a day of summer shine   but i beheld its birth upon the brine   for i would watch all night to see unfold   heavens gates and Æthon snort his morning gold   wide oer the swelling streams and constantly   at brim of daytide on some grassy lea   my nets would be spread out and i at rest   the poor folk of the seacountry i blest                      370   with daily boon of fish most delicate   they knew not whence this bounty and elate   would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach      why was i not contented wherefore reach   at things which but for thee o latmian   had been my dreary death fool i began   to feel distemperd longings to desire   the utmost privilege that oceans sire   could grant in benediction to be free   of all his kingdom long in misery                            380   i wasted ere in one extremest fit   i plungd for life or death to interknit   ones senses with so dense a breathing stuff   might seem a work of pain so not enough   can i admire how crystalsmooth it felt   and buoyant round my limbs at first i dwelt   whole days and days in sheer astonishment   forgetful utterly of selfintent   moving but with the mighty ebb and flow   then like a new fledgd bird that first doth shew            390   his spreaded feathers to the morrow chill   i tried in fear the pinions of my will   twas freedom and at once i visited   the ceaseless wonders of this oceanbed   no need to tell thee of them for i see   that thou hast been a witnessit must be   for these i know thou canst not feel a drouth   by the melancholy corners of that mouth   so i will in my story straightway pass   to more immediate matter woe alas                          400   that love should be my bane ah scylla fair   why did poor glaucus everever dare   to sue thee to his heart kind strangeryouth   i lovd her to the very white of truth   and she would not conceive it timid thing   she fled me swift as seabird on the wing   round every isle and point and promontory   from where large hercules wound up his story   far as egyptian nile my passion grew   the more the more i saw her dainty hue                       410   gleam delicately through the azure clear   until twas too fierce agony to bear   and in that agony across my grief   it flashd that circe might find some relief   cruel enchantress so above the water   i reard my head and lookd for phœbus daughter   Ææas isle was wondering at the moon   it seemd to whirl around me and a swoon   left me deaddrifting to that fatal power      when i awoke twas in a twilight bower                   420   just when the light of morn with hum of bees   stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees   how sweet and sweeter for i heard a lyre   and over it a sighing voice expire   it ceasedi caught light footsteps and anon   the fairest face that morn eer lookd upon   pushd through a screen of roses starry jove   with tears and smiles and honeywords she wove   a net whose thraldom was more bliss than all   the range of flowerd elysium thus did fall                  430   the dew of her rich speech ah art awake   o let me hear thee speak for cupids sake   i am so oppressd with joy why i have shed   an urn of tears as though thou wert cold dead   and now i find thee living i will pour   from these devoted eyes their silver store   until exhausted of the latest drop   so it will pleasure thee and force thee stop   here that i too may live but if beyond   such cool and sorrowful offerings thou art fond              440   of soothing warmth of dalliance supreme   if thou art ripe to taste a long love dream   if smiles if dimples tongues for ardour mute   hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit   o let me pluck it for thee thus she linkd   her charming syllables till indistinct   their music came to my oersweetend soul   and then she hoverd over me and stole   so near that if no nearer it had been   this furrowd visage thou hadst never seen                   450      young man of latmos thus particular   am i that thou mayst plainly see how far   this fierce temptation went and thou mayst not   exclaim how then was scylla quite forgot      who could resist who in this universe   she did so breathe ambrosia so immerse   my fine existence in a golden clime   she took me like a child of suckling time   and cradled me in roses thus condemnd   the current of my former life was stemmd                    460   and to this arbitrary queen of sense   i bowd a tranced vassal nor would thence   have movd even though amphions harp had wood   me back to scylla oer the billows rude   for as apollo each eve doth devise   a new appareling for western skies   so every eve nay every spendthrift hour   shed balmy consciousness within that bower   and i was free of haunts umbrageous   could wander in the mazy foresthouse                         470   of squirrels foxes shy and antlerd deer   and birds from coverts innermost and drear   warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow   to me new born delights                             now let me borrow   for moments few a temperament as stern   as plutos sceptre that my words not burn   these uttering lips while i in calm speech tell   how specious heaven was changed to real hell      one morn she left me sleeping half awake                  480   i sought for her smooth arms and lips to slake   my greedy thirst with nectarous cameldraughts   but she was gone whereat the barbed shafts   of disappointment stuck in me so sore   that out i ran and searchd the forest oer   wandering about in pine and cedar gloom   damp awe assaild me for there gan to boom   a sound of moan an agony of sound   sepulchral from the distance all around   then came a conquering earththunder and rumbled             490   that fierce complain to silence while i stumbled   down a precipitous path as if impelld   i came to a dark valleygroanings swelld   poisonous about my ears and louder grew   the nearer i approachd a flames gaunt blue   that glard before me through a thorny brake   this fire like the eye of gordian snake   bewitchd me towards and i soon was near   a sight too fearful for the feel of fear   in thicket hid i

rage   shrieks yells and groans of torturepilgrimage   until their grieved bodies gan to bloat   and puff from the tails end to stifled throat   then was appalling silence then a sight

words went echoing dismally   through the wide foresta most fearful tone   like one repenting in his latest moan   and while it died away a shade passd by   as of a thunder cloud when arrows fly   through the thick branches poor ringdoves sleek forth   their timid necks and tremble so these both                  330   leant to each other trembling and sat so   waiting for some destructionwhen
