8095194	the vanished messenger  by e phillips oppenheim     chapter i   there were very few people upon platform number twentyone of liverpool street station at a quarter to nine on the evening of april 2possibly because the platform in question is one of the most remote and least used in the great terminus the stationmaster however was there himself with an inspector in attendance a dark thickset man wearing a long travelling ulster and a homburg hat and carrying in his hand a brown leather dressingcase across which was painted in black letters the name mr john p dunster was standing a few yards away smoking a long cigar and to all appearance absorbed in studying the advertisements which decorated the grimy wall on the other side of the single track a couple of porters were seated upon a barrow which contained one solitary portmanteau there were no signs of other passengers no other luggage as a matter of fact according to the timetable no train was due to leave the station or to arrive at it on this particular platform for several hours  down at the other end of the platform the wooden barrier was thrust back and a porter with some luggage upon a barrow made his noisy approach he was followed by a tall young man in a grey tweed suit and a straw hat on which were the colours of a famous cricket club  the inspector watched them curiously lost his way i should think he observed  the stationmaster nodded it looks like the young man who missed the boat train he remarked perhaps he has come to beg a lift  the young man in question made steady progress up the platform his hands were thrust deep into the pockets of his coat and his forehead was contracted in a frown as he approached more closely he singled out mr john p dunster and motioning his porter to wait crossed to the edge of the track and addressed him  can i speak to you for a moment sir  mr john p dunster turned at once and faced his questioner he did so without hastewith a certain deliberation in factyet his eyes were suddenly bright and keen he was neatly dressed with the quiet precision which seems as a rule to characterise the travelling american he was apparently of a little less than middleage cleanshaven broadshouldered with every appearance of physical strength he seemed like a man on wires a man on the alert likely to miss nothing  are you mr john p dunster the youth asked  i carry my visitingcard in my hand sir the other replied swinging his dressingcase around my name is john p dunster  the young mans expression was scarcely ingratiating to a natural sullenness was added now the nervous distaste of one who approaches a disagreeable task  i want if i may to ask you a favour he continued if you dont feel like granting it please say no and ill be off at once i am on my way to the hague i was to have gone by the boat train which left half an hour ago i had taken a seat and they assured me that the train would not leave for at least ten minutes as the mails werent in i went down the platform to buy some papers and stood talking for a moment or two with a man whom i know i suppose i must have been longer than i thought or they must have been quicker than they expected with the mailbags anyhow when i came back the train was moving they would not let me jump in i could have done it easily but that fool of an inspector over there held me  they are very strict in this country i know  mr dunster agreed without change of expression please go on  i saw you arrivejust too late for the train while i was swearing at the inspector i heard you speak to the stationmaster since then i have made inquiries i understand that you have ordered a special train to harwich  mr john p dunster said nothing only his keen clear eyes seemed all the time to be questioning this gloomylooking but apparently harmless young man  i went to the stationmasters office the latter continued and tried to persuade them to let me ride in the guards van of your special but he made a stupid fuss about it so i thought id better come to you can i beg a seat in your compartment or anywhere in the train as far as harwich  mr dunster avoided for the moment a direct reply he had the air of a man who whether reasonably or unreasonably disliked the request which had been made to him  you are particularly anxious to cross tonight he asked  i am the youth admitted emphatically i never ought to have risked missing the train i am due at the hague tomorrow  mr john p dunster moved his position a little the light from a rainsplashed gas lamp shone now full upon the face of his suppliant a boys face which would have been pleasant and even handsome but for the discontented mouth the lowering forehead and a shadow in the eyes as though boy though he certainly was in years he had already at some time or another looked upon the serious things of life his nervousness too was almost grotesque he had the air of disliking immensely this asking a favour from a stranger mr dunster appreciated all these things but there were reasons which made him slow in granting the young mans request  what is the nature of your pressing business at the hague he asked  the youth hesitated  i am afraid he said grimly that you will not think it of much importance i am on my way to play in a golf tournament there  a golf tournament at the hague mr dunster repeated in a slightly altered tone what is your name  gerald fentolin  mr dunster stood quite still for a moment he was possessed of a wonderful memory and he was conscious at that moment of a subtle appeal to it fentolin there was something in the name which seemed to him somehow associated with the things against which he was on guard he stood with puzzled frown reminiscent for several minutes unsuccessful then he suddenly smiled and moving underneath the gas lamp shook open an evening paper which he had been carrying he turned over the pages until he arrived at the sporting items here in almost the first paragraph he saw the name which had happened to catch his eye a moment or two before                       golf at the hague      among the entrants for the tournament which commences     tomorrow are several wellknown english players     including mr barwin mr parrott mr hillard and     mr gerald fentolin  mr dunster folded up the newspaper and replaced it in his pocket he turned towards the young man  so youre a golfer are you  i play a bit was the somewhat indifferent reply  mr dunster turned to another part of the paper and pointed to the great black headlines  seems a queer thing for a young fellow like you to be worrying about games he remarked i havent been in this country more than a few hours but i expected to find all the young men getting ready  getting ready for what  why to fight of course mr dunster replied seems pretty clear that theres an expeditionary force being fitted out according to this evenings paper somewhere up in the north sea the only englishman ive spoken to on this side was willing to lay me odds that war would be declared within a week  the young mans lack of interest was curious  i am not in the army he said it really doesnt affect me  mr dunster stared at him  youll forgive my curiosity he said but say is there nothing you could get into and fight if this thing came along  nothing at all that i know of the youth replied coolly war is an affair which concerns only the military and naval part of two countries the civil population  plays golf i suppose mr dunster interrupted young man i havent been in england for some years and you rather take my breath away all the same you can come along with me as far as harwich  the young man showed signs of some satisfaction i am very much obliged to you sir he declared i promise you i wont be in the way  the stationmaster who had been looking through a little pile of telegrams brought to him by a clerk from his office now turned towards them his expression was a little grave  your special will be backing down directly sir he announced but i am sorry to say that we hear very bad accounts of the line they say that this is only the fagend of the storm that we are getting here and that its been raging for nearly twentyfour hours on the east coast i doubt whether the harwich boat will be able to put off  we must take our chance about that dunster remarked if the mail boat doesnt run i presume there will be something else we can charter  the stationmaster looked the curiosity which he did not actually express in words  money will buy most things nowadays sir he observed but if it isnt fit for our mail boat it certainly isnt fit for anything else that can come into harwich harbour however youll hear what they say when you get there  mr dunster nodded and relapsed into a taciturnity which was obviously one of his peculiarities the young man strolled down the platform and catching up with the inspector touched him on the shoulder  do you know who the fellow is he asked curiously its awfully decent of him to let me go with him but he didnt seem very keen about it  the inspector shook his head  no idea sir he replied he drove up just two minutes after the train had gone came straight into the office and ordered a special paid for it too in bank of england notes before he went out i fancy hes an american and he gave his name as john p dunster  the young man paused to light a cigarette  if hes an american i suppose that accounts for it he observed he must be in a precious hurry to get somewhere though  a night like this too the inspector remarked with a shiver i wouldnt leave london myself unless i had to they say theres a tremendous storm blowing on the east coast here comes the train sirjust one saloon and the guards van  the little train backed slowly along the platform side the engine was splashed with mud and soaking wet the faces of the enginedriver and his companion shone from the dripping rain the stationmaster held open the door of the saloon  youve a rough journey before you sir he said youll catch the boat all right thoughif it goes the mail train was very heavy tonight you should catch her up this side of colchester  mr dunster nodded  i am taking this young gentleman with me he announced shortly it seems that he too missed the train i am much obliged to you stationmaster for your attention good night  they were about to start when mr dunster once more let down the window  by the way he said as it is such a wild night you will oblige me very much if you will tell the enginedriver that there will be a five pound note for himself and his companion if we catch the mail inspector  the inspector touched his hat the stationmaster had turned discreetly away he had been an inspector himself once and sovereigns had been useful to him too then the train glided from the platform side plunged with a scream through a succession of black tunnels and with rapidly increasing speed faced the storm     chapter ii  the young man sat on one side of the saloon and mr john p dunster on the other although both of them were provided with a certain amount of railway literature neither of them made any pretence at reading the older man with his feet upon the opposite seat and his arms folded was looking pensively through the rainsplashed windowpane into the impenetrable darkness the young man although he could not ignore his companions unsociable instincts was fidgety  there will be some floods out tomorrow he remarked  mr dunster turned his head and looked across the saloon there was something in the deliberate manner of his doing so and his hesitation before he spoke which seemed intended to further impress upon the young man the fact that he was not disposed for conversation  very likely was his sole reply  gerald fentolin sighed as though he regretted his companions taciturnity and a few minutes later strolled to the farther end of the saloon he spent some time trying to peer through the streaming window into the darkness he chatted for a few minutes with the guard who was however in a bad temper at having had to turn out and who found little to say then he took one of his golf clubs from the bag and indulged in several half swings finally he stretched himself out upon one of the seats and closed his eyes  may as well try to get a nap he yawned there wont be much chance on the steamer if it blows like this  mr dunster said nothing his face was set his eyes were looking somewhere beyond the confines of the saloon in which he was seated so they travelled for over an hour the young man seemed to be dozing in earnest when with a succession of jerks the train rapidly slackened speed mr dunster let down the window the interior of the carriage was at once thrown into confusion a couple of newspapers were caught up and whirled around a torrent of rain beat in mr dunster rapidly closed the window and rang the bell the guard came in after a moment or two his clothes were shiny from the wet raindrops hung from his beard  what is the matter mr dunster demanded why are we waiting here  theres a block on the line somewhere the man replied cant tell where exactly the signals are against us thats all we know at present  they crawled on again in about ten minutes stopped and resumed their progress at an even slower rate mr dunster once more summoned the guard  why are we travelling like this he asked impatiently we shall never catch the boat  we shall catch the boat all right if it runs sir the man assured him the mail is only a mile or two ahead of us thats one reason why we have to go so slowly then the water is right over the line where we are now and we cant get any news at all from the other side of ipswich if it goes on like this some of the bridges will be down thats what im afraid of  mr dunster frowned for the first time he showed some signs of uneasiness  perhaps he muttered half to himself a motorcar would have been better  not on your life his young companion intervened all the roads to the coast here cross no end of small bridgesmuch weaker affairs than the railway bridges i bet there are some of those down already besides you wouldnt be able to see where you were going on a night like this  there appears to be a chance mr dunster remarked drily that you will have to scratch for your competition tomorrow  also the young man observed that you will have taken this special train for nothing i cant fancy the harwich boat going out a night like this  mr dunster relapsed into stony but anxious silence the train continued its erratic progress sometimes stopping altogether for a time with whistle blowing repeatedly sometimes creeping along the metals as though feeling its way to safety at last after a somewhat prolonged wait the guard whose hoarse voice they had heard on the platform of the small station in which they were standing entered the carriage with him came a gust of wind once more sending the papers flying around the compartment the rain dripped from his clothes on to the carpet he had lost his hat his hair was tossed with the wind his face was bleeding from a slight wound on the temple  the boat trains just ahead of us sir he announced she cant get on any better than we can weve just heard that theres a bridge down on the line between ipswich and harwich  what are we going to do then mr dunster demanded  thats just what ive come to ask you sir the guard replied the mails going slowly on as far as ipswich i fancy theyll lie by there until the morning the best thing that i can see is if youre agreeable to take you back to london we can very likely do that all right if we start at once  mr dunster ignoring the mans suggestion drew from one of the voluminous pockets of his ulster a small map he spread it open upon the table before him and studied it attentively  if i cannot get to harwich he asked is there any possibility of keeping straight on and reaching yarmouth  the guard hesitated  we havent heard anything about the line from ipswich to norwich sir he replied but we cant very well change our course without definite instructions  your definite instructions mr dunster reminded him drily were to take me to harwich you have been forced to depart from them i see no harm in your adopting any suggestions i may have to make concerning our altered destination i will pay the extra mileage naturally  how far did you wish to go sir the guard enquired  to yarmouth mr dunster replied firmly if there are bridges down and communication with harwich is blocked yarmouth would suit me better than anywhere  the guard shook his head  i couldnt go on that way sir without instructions  is there a telegraph office at this station mr dunster inquired  we can speak anywhere on the line the guard replied  then wire to the stationmaster at liverpool street mr dunster instructed you can get a reply from him in the course of a few minutes explain the situation and tell him what my wishes are  the guard hesitated  its a goodish way from here to norwich he observed and for all we know  when we left liverpool street station mr dunster interrupted i promised five pounds each to you the enginedriver and his mate that five pounds shall be made twentyfive if you succeed in getting me to the coast do your best for me  the guard raised his hat and departed without another word  it will probably suit you better mr dunster continued turning to his companion to leave me at ipswich and join the mail  the latter shook his head  i dont see that theres any chance anyway of my getting over in time now he remarked if youll take me on with you as far as norwich i can go quietly home from there  you live in this part of the world then mr dunster asked  the young man assented again there was a certain amount of hesitation in his manner  i live some distance the other side of norwich he said i dont want to sponge on you too much he went on but if youre really going to stick it out and try and get there id like to go on too i am afraid i cant offer to share the expense but id work my passage if there was anything to be done  mr dunster drummed for a moment upon the table with his fingers all the time the young man had been speaking his eyes had been studying his face he turned now once more to his map  it was my idea he said to hire a steam trawler from yarmouth if i do so you can if you wish accompany me so far as the port at which we may land in holland on the other hand to be perfectly frank with you i should prefer to go alone there will be no doubt a certain amount of risk in crossing tonight my own business is of importance a golf tournament however is scarcely worth risking your life for is it  oh i dont know about that the young man replied grimly i fancy i should rather like it lets see whether we can get on to norwich anyhow shall we we may find that there are bridges down on that line  they relapsed once more into silence presently the guard reappeared  instructions to take you on to yarmouth if possible sir he announced and to collect the mileage at our destination  that will be quite satisfactory mr dunster agreed let us be off then as soon as possible presently they crawled on they passed the boat train in ipswich station where they stayed for a few moments mr dunster bought wine and sandwiches and his companion followed his example then they continued their journey an hour or more passed the storm showed no signs of abatement their speed now rarely exceeded ten or fifteen miles an hour mr dunster smoked all the time occasionally rubbing the windowpane and trying to look out gerald fentolin slept fitfully  have you any idea where we are mr dunster asked once  the boy cautiously let down the window a little way with the noise of the storm came another sound to which he listened for a moment with puzzled face a dull rumbling sound like the falling of water he closed the window breathless  i dont think we are far from norwich we passed forncett anyhow some time ago  still raining  in torrents i cant see a yard ahead of me i bet we get some floods after this i expect they are out now if one could only see  they crept on suddenly above the storm they heard what sounded at first like the booming of a gun and then a shrill whistle from some distance ahead they felt the jerk as their brakes were hastily applied the swaying of the little train and then the crunching of earth beneath them the roar of escaping steam as their engine ploughed its way on into the road bed  off the rails the boy cried springing to his feet hold on tightly sir id keep away from the window  the carriage swayed and rocked suddenly a telegraph post seemed to come crashing through the window and the polished mahogany panels the young man escaped it by leaping to one side it caught mr dunster who had just risen to his feet upon the forehead there was a crash all around of splitting glass a further shock they were both thrown off their feet the light was suddenly extinguished with the crashing of glass the splitting of timbera hideous tearing soundthe wrecked saloon dragging the engine halfway over with it slipped down a low embankment and lay on its side what remained of it in a field of turnips     chapter iii  as the young man staggered to his feet he had somehow a sense of detachment as though he were commencing a new life or had suddenly come into a new existence yet his immediate surroundings were charged with ugly reminiscences through a great gap in the ruined side of the saloon the rain was tearing in as he stood up his head caught the fragments of the roof he was able to push back the wreckage with ease and step out for a moment he reeled as he met the violence of the storm then clutching hold of the side of the wreck he steadied himself a light was moving back and forth close at hand he cried out weakly hullo  a man carrying a lantern bent double as he made his way against the wind crawled up to them he was a porter from the station close at hand  my god he exclaimed any one alive here  im all right gerald muttered at least i suppose i am whats it allwhats it all about weve had an accident  the porter caught hold of a piece of the wreckage with which to steady himself  your train ran right into three feet of water he answered the rails had gonetorn up the telegraph lines down  why didnt you stop the train  we were doing all we could the man retorted gloomily we werent expecting anything else through tonight wed a man along the line with a lantern but hes just been found blown over the embankment with his head in a pool of water any one else in your carriage  one gentleman travelling with me gerald answered wed better try to get him out what about the guard and enginedriver  the enginedriver and stoker are both alive the porter told him i came across them before i saw you theyre both knocked sort of sillylike but they arent much hurt the guards stone dead  where are we  a few hundred yards from wymondham lets have a look for the other gentleman  mr john p dunster was lying quite still his right leg doubled up and a huge block of telegraph post which the saloon had carried with it in its fall still pressing against his forehead he groaned as they dragged him out and laid him down upon a cushion in the shelter of the wreckage  hes alive all right the porter remarked theres a doctor on the way lets cover him up quick and wait  cant we carry him to shelter of some sort gerald proposed  the man shook his head speech of any sort was difficult even with his lips close to the others ears he had almost to shout  couldnt be done he replied its all one can do to walk alone when you get out in the middle of the field away from the shelter of the embankment here theres bits of trees flying all down the lane never was such a night folks is fair afraid of the morning to see whats happened theres a mill blown right over on its side in the next field and the man in charge of it lying dead this poor chaps bad enough  gerald on all fours had crept back into the compartment the bottle of wine was smashed into atoms he came out dragging the small dressingcase which his companion had kept on the table before him one side of it was dented in but the lock which was of great strength still held  perhaps theres a flask somewhere in this dressingcase gerald said lend me a knife  strong though it had been the lock was already almost torn out from its foundation they forced the spring and opened it the porter turned his lantern on the widening space just as gerald was raising the lid very slowly to save the contents from being scattered by the wind the man turned his head to answer an approaching hail gerald raised the lid a little higher and suddenly closed it with a bang  theres folks coming at last the porter exclaimed turning around excitedly theyve been a time and no mistake the village isnt a quarter of a mile away did you find a flask sir  gerald made no answer the dressingcase once more was closed and his hand pressed upon the lid the porter turned the light upon his face and whistled softly  youre about done yourself sir he remarked hold up  he caught the young man in his arms there was another roar in geralds ears besides the roar of the wind he had never fainted in his life but the feeling was upon him nowa deadly sickness a swaying of the earth the porter suddenly gave a little cry  if im not a born idiot he exclaimed drawing a bottle from the pocket of his coat with his disengaged hand theres whisky here i was taking it home to the missis for her rheumatism now then  he drew the cork from the bottle with his teeth and forced some of the liquid between the lips of the young man the voices now were coming nearer and nearer gerald made a desperate effort  i am all right he declared lets look after him  they groped their way towards the unconscious man gerald still gripping the dressingcase with both hands there were no signs of any change in his condition but he was still breathing heavily then they heard a shout behind almost in their ears the porter staggered to his feet  its all right now sir he exclaimed theyve brought blankets and a stretcher and brandy heres a doctor sir  a powerfullooking man hatless and wrapped in a great ulster moved towards them  how many are there of you he asked as he bent over mr dunster  only we two gerald replied is my friend badly hurt  concussion the doctor announced well take him to the village what about you young man your face is bleeding i see  just a cut gerald faltered nothing else  lucky chap the doctor remarked lets get him to shelter of some sort come along theres an inn at the corner of the lane there  they all staggered along gerald still clutching the dressingcase and supported on the other side by an excited and somewhat incoherent villager  such a storm as never was the latter volunteered the telegraph wires are all down for miles and miles there wont be no trains running along this line come many a week and as for treeswhy its as though some one had been playing ninepins in squire fellowess park when the morning do come for sure there will be things to be seen this way sir be careful of the gate  they staggered along down the lane climbing once over a tree which lay across the lane and far into the adjoining field soon they were joined by more of the villagers roused from their beds by rumours of terrible happenings the little singlestorey ivycovered inn was all lit up and the door held firmly open they passed through the narrow entrance and into the stoneflagged barroom where the men laid down their stretcher as many of the villagers as could crowd in filled the passage gerald sank into a chair the sudden absence of wind was almost disconcerting he felt himself once more in danger of fainting he was only vaguely conscious of drinking hot milk poured from a jug by a redfaced and sympathetic woman its restorative effect however was immediate and wonderful the mist cleared from before his eyes his brain began to work always in the background the horror and the shame were there the shame which kept his hand pressed with unnatural strength upon the broken lock of that dressingcase he sat a little apart from the others and listened above the confused murmur of voices he could hear the doctors comment and brief orders as he rose to his feet after examining the unconscious man  an ordinary concussion he declared i must get round and see the enginedriver now they have got him in a shed by the embankment ill call in again later on lets have one more look at you young man  he glanced at the cut on geralds forehead noted the access of colour in his cheeks and nodded  born to be hanged you were he pronounced youve had a marvellous escape ill be in again presently no need to worry about your friend he looks as though hed got a mighty constitution light my lantern brown two of you had better come with me to the shed its no night for a man to be wandering about alone  he departed and many of the villagers with him the landlady sat down and began to weep  such a night such a night she exclaimed wringing her hands and theres the doctor talks about putting the poor gentleman to bed why the roofs off the back part of the house and not a bedroom in the place but mine and johns and the rain coming in there in torrents such a night its the judgment of the lord upon us thats what it isthe judgment of the lord  judgment of the fiddlesticks her husband growled cant you light the fire woman whats the good of sitting there whining  light the fire she repeated bitterly and the chimney lying out in the road do you want to suffocate us all or is the beer still in your head its your evil doings richard budden and others like you that have brought this upon us if mr wembley would but come in and pray  her husband scoffed he was dressed only in his shirt and trousers his hair rough his braces hanging down behind  come in and pray he repeated not he not mr wembley hes safe tucked up in his bed shivering with fear ill bet you hes not getting his feet wet to save a body or lend a hand here souls are his job you let the preacher alone mother and tell us what were going to do with this gentleman  the lord only knows she cried wringing her hands  can i hire a motorcar from anywhere near gerald asked  theres motorcars right enough the innkeeper replied but not many as would be fools enough to take one out you couldnt see the road and i doubt if one of them plaguey things would stir in this storm  such nonsense as you talk richard budden his wife exclaimed sharply its twenty minutes past three of the clock and theres light coming on us fast if so be as the young gentleman knows folks round about here or happens to live nigh why shouldnt he take one of them motorcars and get away to some decent place itll be better for the poor gentleman than lying here in a house smitten by the lord  gerald rose stiffly to his feet an idea was forming in his brain his eyes were bright he looked at the body of john dunster upon the floor and felt once more in his pocket  how far off is the garage he asked  its right across the way the innkeeper replied a speculation of neighbour martins and a foolish one it do seem to me hes two cars there and one he lets to the government for delivering the mails  gerald felt in his pocket and produced a sovereign  give this he said to any man you can find who will go across there and bring me a carthe most powerful theyve got if theres any difference tell them ill pay well thismy friend will be much better at home with me than in a strange place when he comes to his senses  its sound common sense the woman declared be off with you richard  the man was looking at the coin covetously but his wife pushed him away  its not a sovereign youll be taking from the gentleman for a little errand like that she insisted sharply he shall pay us for what hes had when he goes and welcome and if so be that hes willing to make it a sovereign to include the milk and the brandy and the confusion weve been put to this night well and good its a heavy reckoning maybe but the night calls for it well see about that afterwards get along with you i say richard  ill be wet through the man muttered  and serve you right the woman exclaimed if theres a man in this village tonight whose clothes are dry its a thing for him to be ashamed of  the innkeeper reluctantly departed they heard the roar of the wind as the door was opened and closed the woman poured out another glass of milk and brought it to gerald  a godless man mine she said grimly if so happen as mr wembley had come to these parts years ago id have seen myself in my grave before id have married a publican but its too late now were mostly too late about the things that count in this world so its your friend thats been stricken down young man a wellliving man i hope  gerald shivered ever so slightly he drank the milk however he felt that he might need his strength  what train might you have been on the woman continued theres none due on this line that we knew of david bass the stationmaster was here but two hours ago and said hed finished for the night and praised the lord for that the goods trains had all been stopped at ipswich and the first passenger train was not due till six oclock  gerald shook his head with an affectation of weariness  i dont know he replied i dont remember anything about it we were hours late i think  the woman was looking down at the unconscious man gerald rose slowly to his feet and stood by her side the face of mr john p dunster even in unconsciousness had something in it of strength and purpose the shape of his head the squareness of his jaws the straightness of his thick lips all seemed to speak of a hard and inflexible disposition his hair was coal black coarse and without the slightest sprinkling of grey he had the neck and throat of a fighter but for that single livid blue mark across his forehead he carried with him no signs of his accident he was a little inclined to be stout there was a heavy gold chain stretched across his waistcoat from where he lay the shining handle of his revolver protruded from his hip pocket  sakes alive the woman muttered as she looked down what does he carry a thing like that forin a peaceful country too  it was just an idea of his gerald answered we were going abroad in a day or two he was always nervous if you like ill take it away  he stooped down and withdrew it from the unconscious mans pocket he started as he discovered that it was loaded in every chamber  i cant bear the sight of them things the woman declared its the men of evil ways whove no trust in the lord who need that sort of protection  they heard the door pushed open the howl of wind down the passage and the beating of rain upon the stone flags then it was softly closed again the landlord staggered into the room followed by a young man  this ere is mr martins chaffer he announced you can tell him what you want yerself  gerald turned almost eagerly towards the newcomer  i want to go to the other side of holt he said and get my friendget this gentleman away from hereget him home if possible can you take me  the chauffeur looked doubtful  im afraid of the roads sir he replied theres talk about many bridges down and trees and theres floods out everywhere theres half a foot of water even across the village street now im afraid we shouldnt get very far  look here gerald begged eagerly lets make a shot at it ill pay you double the hire of the car and ill be responsible for any damage i want to get out of this beastly place lets get somewhere at any rate towards a civilised country ill see you dont lose anything ill give you a five pound note for yourself if we get as far as holt  im on the young man agreed shortly its an open car you know  it doesnt matter gerald replied i can stick it in front with you and we can coverhim up in the tonneau  youll wait until the doctor comes back the landlord asked  and why should they his wife interposed sharply them doctors are all the same hell try and keep the poor gentleman here for the sake of a few extra guineas and a miserable place for him to open his eyes upon even if the rest of the roof holds which for my part im beginning to doubt theyd have to move him from here with the daylight anyhow he cant lie in the bar parlour all day can he  it dont seem right somehow the man com plained doggedly the doctor didnt say anything about having him moved  you get the car gerald ordered the young man ill take the whole responsibility  the chauffeur silently left the room gerald put a couple of sovereigns upon the mantelpiece  my friend is a man of somewhat peculiar temperament he said quietly if he finds himself at home in a comfortable room when he comes to his senses i am quite sure that he will have a better chance of recovery he cannot possibly be made comfortable here and he will feel the shock of what has happened all the more if he finds himself still in the neighbourhood when he opens his eyes if there is any change in his condition we can easily stop somewhere on the way  the woman pocketed the two sovereigns  thats common sense sir she agreed heartily and im sure we are very much obliged to you if we had a decent room and a roof above it youd be heartily welcome but as it is this is no place for a sick man and those that say different dont know what they are talking about thats a real careful young man whos going to take you along in the motorcar hell get you there safe if any one will  what i say is her husband protested sullenly that we ought to wait for the doctors orders im against seeing a poor body like that jolted across the country in an open motorcar in his state im not sure that its for his good  and what business is it of yours i should like to know the woman demanded sharply you get upstairs and begin moving the furniture from where the rains coming sopping in and if so be you can remember while you do it that this is a judgment thats come upon us why so much the better we are evildoers all of us though them as likes the easy ways generally manage to forget it  the man retreated silently the woman sat down upon a stool and waited gerald sat opposite to her the battered dressingcase upon his knees between them was stretched the body of the unconscious man  are you used to prayer young sir the woman asked  gerald shook his head and the woman did not pursue the subject only once her eyes were half closed and her words drifted across the room  the lord have mercy on this man a sinner     chapter iv  my advice to you sir is to chuck it  gerald turned towards the chauffeur by whose side he was seated a little stiffly for his limbs were numbed with the cold and exhaustion the morning had broken with a grey and uncertain light a vaporous veil of mist seemed to have taken the place of the darkness even from the top of the hill where the car had come to a standstill there was little to be seen  we must have come forty miles already the chauffeur continued what with going out of our way all the time because of the broken bridges im pretty well frozen through and as for him he added jerking his thumb across his shoulder it seems to me youre taking a bit of a risk  the doctor said he would remain in exactly the same condition for twentyfour hours gerald declared  yes but he didnt say anything about shaking him up over forty miles of rough road the other protested youll excuse me sir he continued in a slightly changed tone it isnt my business of course but im fairly done it dont seem reasonable to stick at it like this theres holt village not a mile away and a comfortable inn and a fire waiting i thought that was as far as you wanted to come we might lie up there for a few hours at any rate  his passenger slipped down from his place and lifting the rug peered into the tonneau of the car over which they had tied a hood to all appearance the condition of the man who lay there was unchanged there was a slightly added blueness about the lips but his breathing was still perceptible it seemed even a little stronger gerald resumed his seat  it isnt worth while to stay at holt he said quietly we are scarcely seven miles from home now sit still for a few minutes and get your wind  only seven miles the chauffeur repeated more cheerfully thats something anyway  and all downhill  towards the sea then  straight to the sea gerald told him the place we are making for is st davids hall near salthouse  the chauffeur seemed a little startled  why thats squire fentolins house  gerald nodded  that is where we are going you follow this road almost straight ahead  the chauffeur slipped in the clutch  oh i know the way now sir right enough he exclaimed theres salthouse marsh to cross though i dont know about that  we shall manage that all right gerald declared weve more light now too  they both looked around during the last few minutes the late morning seemed to have forced its way through the clouds they had a dim phantasmagoric view of the stricken country a watery plain with here and there great patches of fields submerged to the hedges and houses standing out amidst the waste of waters like toy dwellings there were whole plantations of uprooted trees close to the road on their left was a roofless house and a family of children crying underneath a tarpaulin shelter as they crept on the wind came to them with a brackish flavour salt with the sea the chauffeur was gazing ahead doubtfully  i dont like the look of the marsh he grumbled cant see the road at all however here goes  another halfhour gerald assured him encouragingly and we shall be at st davids hall you can have as much rest as you like then  they were facing the wind now and conversation became impossible twice they had to pull up sharp and make a considerable detour once on account of a fallen tree which blocked the road and another time because of the yawning gap where a bridge had fallen away gerald however knew every inch of the country they were in and was able to give the necessary directions they began to meet farm wagons now full of people who had been driven from their homes warnings and information as to the state of the roads were shouted to them continually presently they came to the last steep descent and emerged from the devastated fragment of a wood almost on to the sea level the chauffeur clapped on his brakes and stopped short  my god he exclaimed heres more trouble  gerald for a moment was speechless they seemed to have come suddenly upon a huge plain of waters an immense lake reaching as far as they could see on either side the road before them stretched like a ribbon for the next three miles here and there it disappeared and reappeared again in many places it was lapped by little waves everywhere the hedges were either altogether or half under water in the distance was one farmhouse only the roof of which was visible and from which the inhabitants were clambering into a boat and beyond with scarcely a break save for the rising of one strangelyshaped hill was the sea gerald pointed with his finger  theres st davids hall he said on the other side of the hill the road seems all right  does it the chauffeur grunted its under water more than half the way and heaven knows how deep it is at the sides im not going to risk my life along there i am going to take the car back to holt  his hand was already upon the reverse lever but gerald gripped it  look here he protested we havent come all this way to turn back you dont look like a coward  i am not a coward sir was the quiet answer neither am i a fool i dont see any use in risking our lives and my masters motorcar because you want to get home  naturally gerald answered calmly but remember this i am responsible for your carnot you mr fentolin is my uncle  the chauffeur nodded shortly  youre mr gerald fentolin arent you sir he remarked i thought i recognised you  i am gerald admitted weve had a rough journey but it doesnt seem sense to turn back now does it with the house in sight  thats all very well sir the chauffeur objected doubtfully but i dont believe the roads even passable and the floods seem to me to be rising  try it the young man begged look here i dont want to bribe you or anything of that sort you know youre coming out of this well its a serious matter for me and i shant be likely to forget it i want to take this gentleman to st davids hall and not to a hospital youve brought me here so far like a man lets go through with it if the worst comes to the worst we can both swim i suppose and we are not likely to get out of our depth  the chauffeur moved his head backwards  how about him  he must take his chance gerald replied hes all right where he is the car wont upset and there are plenty of people wholl see if we get into trouble come lets make a dash for it  the chauffeur thrust in his clutch and settled himself down they glided off along that winding stretch of road to its very edge on either side of them so close that they could almost touch it came the water water which stretched as far as they could see swaying waveless sinisterlooking even gerald after his first impulse of wonder kept his eyes averted and fixed upon the road ahead soon they reached a place where the water met in front there were only the rows of white palings on either side to guide them the chauffeur muttered to himself as he changed to his first speed  if the engine gets stopped he said i dont know how we shall get out of this  they emerged on the other side for some time they had a clear run then suddenly the driver clapped on his brakes  my god he cried we cant get through that  in front of them for more than a hundred yards the water seemed suddenly to have flowed across the road still a mile distant perched on a ridge of that strangelyplaced hill was their destination  it cant be done sir the man groaned there isnt a car ever built could get through that see its nearly up to the top of those posts i must put her in the reverse and get back even if we have to wait on the higher part of the road for a boat  he glanced behind and a second cry broke from his lips gerald stood up in his place already the road which had been clear a few minutes before was hidden the water was washing almost over the tops of the white posts behind them little waves were breaking against the summit of the raised bank  were cut off the chauffeur exclaimed what a fool i was to try this theres the tide coming in as well  gerald sat down in his place  look here he said we cant go back whether we want to or not its much worse behind there than it is in front theres only one chance go for it straight ahead in your first speed it may not stop the engine in any case it will be worse presently theres no use funking it if the worst happens we can sit in the car the water wont be above our heads and there are some boats about blow your horn well first in case theres any one within hearing and then go for it  the chauffeur obeyed they hissed and spluttered into the water soon all trace of the road was completely lost they steered only by the tops of the white posts  its getting deeper the man declared its within an inch or two of the bonnet now hold on  a wave broke almost over them but the engine continued its beat  if we stop now he gasped were done  the engine began to knock  stick at it gerald cried rising in his place a little look theres only one post lower than the last one that we passed they get higher all the time ahead you can almost see the road in front there now in with your gear again and stick at it  another wave broke this time completely over them they listened with strained earsthe engine continued to beat they still moved slowly then there was a shock the wheel had struck something in the roada great stone or rock the chauffeur thrust the car out of gear the engine still beat gerald leaped from the car the water was over his knees he crossed in front of the bonnet and stooped down  ive got it he exclaimed tugging hard its a stone  he moved it rolled it on one side and pushed at the wheel of the car as his companion put in the speed they started again he jumped back his place  weve done it all right he cried dont you see its getting lower all the time  the chauffeur had lost his nerve his cheeks were pale his teeth were chattering the engine however was still beating gradually the pressure of the water grew less in front of them they caught a glimpse of the road they drew up at the top of a little bridge over one of the dikes gerald uttered a brief exclamation of triumph  were safe he almost sobbed theres the road straight ahead and round to the right theres no more water anywhere near  they had left the main part of the flood behind them there were still great pools in the side of the road and huge masses of seaweed had been carried up and were lying in their track there was no more water however at every moment they drew nearer to the strangelyshaped hill with its crown of trees  the house is on the other side gerald pointed out we can go through the lodge gates at the back here the ascent isnt so steep  they turned sharply to the right along another stretch of straight road set with white posts ending before a red brick lodge and a closed gate they blew the horn and a gardener came out he gazed at them in amazement  its all right gerald cried let us through quickly foulds weve a gentleman in behind whos ill  the man swung open the gate with a respectful salute they made their way up a winding drive of considerable length and at last they came to a broad open space almost like a platform on their left were the marshes and beyond the sea along their right stretched the long front of an elizabethan mansion they drew up in front of the hail door their coming had been observed and servants were already waiting gerald sprang to the ground  theres a gentleman in behind whos ill he explained to the butler he has met with an accident on the way three or four of you had better carry him up to a bedroomany one that is ready and you george he added turning to a boy get into the car and show this man the way round to the garage and then take him to the servants hall  several of the servants hastened to do his bidding and gerald did his best to answer the eager but respectful stream of questions and then just as they were in the act of lifting the still unconscious man on to the floor of the hall came a queer sounda shrill reverberating whistle they all looked up the stairs  the master is awake henderson the butler remarked dropping his voice a little  gerald nodded  i will go to him at once he said     chapter v  accustomed though he was to the sight which he was about to face gerald shivered slightly as he opened the door of mr fentolins room a strange sort of fear seemed to have crept into his bearing and expression a fear of which there had been no traces whatever during those terrible hours through which he had passednot even during that last reckless journey across the marshes he walked with hesitating footsteps across the spacious and lofty room he had the air of some frightened creature approaching his master yet all that was visible of the despot who ruled his whole household in deadly fear was the kindly and beautiful face of an elderly man whose stunted limbs and body were mercifully concealed he sat in a little carriage with a rug drawn closely across his chest and up to his armpits his beautifully shaped hands were exposed and his face nothing else his hair was a silvery white his complexion parchmentlike pallid entirely colourless his eyes were a soft shade of blue his features were so finely cut and chiselled that they resembled some exquisite piece of statuary he smiled as his nephew came slowly towards him one might almost have fancied that the young mans abject state was a source of pleasure to him  so you are back again my dear gerald a pleasant surprise indeed but what is the meaning of it and what of my little commission eh  the young mans face was dark and sullen he spoke quickly but without any sign of eagerness or interest in the information he vouchsafed  the storm has stopped all the trains he said the boat did not cross last night and in any case i couldnt have reached harwich as for your commission i travelled down from london alone with the man you told me to spy upon i could have stolen anything he had if i had been used to the work as it wasi brought the man himself  mr fentolins delicate fingers played with the handle of his chair the smile had passed from his lips he looked at his nephew in gentle bewilderment  my dear boy he protested come come be careful what you are saying you have brought the man himself so far as my information goes mr john p dunster is charged with a very important diplomatic commission he is on his way to cologne and from what i know about the man i think that it would require more than your persuasions to induce him to break off his journey you do not really wish me to believe that you have brought him here as a guest  i was at liverpool street station last night gerald declared i had no idea how to accost him and as to stealing any of his belongings i couldnt have done it you must hear how fortune helped me though mr dunster missed the train so did ipurposely he ordered a special i asked permission to travel with him i told him a lie as to how i had missed the train i hated it but it was necessary  mr fentolin nodded approvingly  my dear boy he said to trifle with the truth is always unpleasant besides you are a fentolin and our love of truth is proverbial but there are times you know when for the good of others we must sacrifice our scruples so you told mr dunster a falsehood  he let me travel with him gerald continued we were all night getting about halfway here thenyou know about the storm i suppose  mr fentolin spread out his hands  could one avoid the knowledge of it he asked such a sight has never been seen  we found we couldnt get to harwich gerald went on they telegraphed to london and got permission to bring us to yarmouth we were on our way to norwich and the train ran off the line  an accident mr fentolin exclaimed  gerald nodded  our train ran off the line and pitched down an embankment mr dunster has concussion of the brain he and i were taken to a miserable little inn near wymondham from there i hired a motorcar and brought him here  you hired a motorcar and brought him here mr fentolin repeated softly my dear boyforgive me if i find this a little hard to understand you say that you have brought him here had he nothing to say about it  he was unconscious when we picked him up gerald explained he is unconscious now the doctor said he would remain so for at least twentyfour hours and it didnt seem to me that the journey would do him any particular harm the roof had been stripped off the inn where we were and the place was quite uninhabitable so we should have had to have moved him somewhere we put him in the tonneau of the car and covered him up they have carried him now into a bedroom and sarson is looking after him  mr fentolin sat quite silent his eyes blinked once or twice and there was a curious curve about his lips  you have done well my boy he pronounced slowly your scheme of bringing him here sounds a little primitive but success justifies everything  mr fentolin raised to his lips and blew softly a little gold whistle which hung from a chain attached to his waistcoat almost immediately the door opened a man entered dressed somberly in black whose bearing and demeanour alike denoted the servant but whose physique was the physique of a prizefighter he was scarcely more than five feet six in height but his shoulders were extraordinarily broad he had a short bull neck and long mighty arms his face with the heavy jaw and small eyes was the face of the typical fighting man yet his features seemed to have become disposed by habit into an expression of gentle almost servile civility  meekins mr fentolin said a visitor has arrived do you happen to have noticed what luggage he brought  there is one small dressingcase sir the man replied nothing else that i have seen  that is all we brought gerald interposed  you will bring the dressingcase here at once mr fentolin directed and also my compliments to doctor sarson and any pocketbook or papers which may help us to send a message to the gentlemans friends  meekins closed the door and departed mr fentolin turned back towards his nephew  my dear boy he said tell me why you look as though there were ghosts flitting about the room you are not ill i trust  tired perhaps gerald answered shortly we were many hours in the car i have had no sleep  mr fentolins face was full of kindly sympathy  my dear fellow he exclaimed i am selfish indeed i should not have kept you here for a moment you had better go and lie down  ill go directly gerald promised can i speak to you for one moment first  speak to me mr fentolin repeated a little wonderingly my dear gerald is there ever a moment when i am not wholly at your service  that fellow dunster on the platform the first moment i spoke to him made me feel like a cur the boy said with a sudden access of vigour in his tone i told him i was on my way to a golf tournament and he pointed to the news about the war is it true uncle that we may be at war at any moment  mr fentolin sighed  a terrible reflection my dear boy he admitted softly but alas the finger of probability points that way  then what about me gerald exclaimed i dont want to complain but listen you dragged me home from a public school before i could even join my cadet corps youve kept me banging around here with a tutor you wouldnt let me go to the university youve stopped my entering either of the services i am nineteen years old and useless do you know what i should do tomorrow if war broke out enlist its the only thing left for me  mr fentolin was shocked  my dear boy he exclaimed you must not talk like that i am quite sure that it would break your mothers heart enlist indeed nothing of the sort you are part of the civilian population of the country  civilian population be dd the boy suddenly cried white with rage uncle forgive me i have stood all i can bear if you wont let me go in for the armyi could pass my exams tomorrowim off ill enlist without waiting for the war i cant bear this idle life any longer  mr fentolin leaned a little forward in his chair  gerald he said softly  the boy turned his head turned it unwillingly he had the air of a caged animal obeying the word of his keeper a certain savage uncouthness seemed to have fallen upon him during the last few minutes there was something almost like a snarl in his expression  gerald mr fentolin repeated  then it was obvious that there was something between those two some memory or some living thing seldom if ever to be spoken of and yet always present the boy began to tremble  youre a little overwrought gerald mr fentolin declared sit quietly in my easychair for a few moments walt until i have examined mr dunsters belongings ah meekins has been prompt indeed  there was a stealthy tap at the door meekins entered with the small dressingcase in his hand he brought it over to his masters chair mr fentolin pointed to the floor  open it there meekins he directed i fancy that the pocketbook you are carrying will prove more interesting we will just glance through the dressingcase first thank you yes you can lay the things upon the floor a man of spartanlike life i should imagine mr dunster a spare toothbrush though i am glad to see pyjamas of most unattractive pattern and what a taste in shirts nothing but wearing apparel and singularly little of that i fancy  the dressingcase was empty its contents upon the floor mr fentolin held out his hand and took the pocketbook which meekins had been carrying it was an ordinary morocco affair similar to those issued by american banking houses to enclose letters of credit one side of it was filled with notes mr fentolin withdrew them and glanced them through  dear me he murmured no wonder our friend engages special trains he travels like a prince indeed two thousand pounds or near it in this little compartment and here i see a letter a sealed letter with no address  he held it out in front of him it was a long commercial envelope of ordinary type and although the flap was secured with a blob of sealing wax there was no particular impression upon it  we can match this envelope i think mr fentolin said softly the seal we can copy i think that for the sake of others we must discover the cause for this hurried journey on the part of mr john p dunster  with his long delicate forefinger mr fentolin slit the envelope and withdrew the single sheet of paper which it contained there were a dozen lines of written matter and what appeared to be a dozen signatures appended mr fentolin read it at first with ordinary interest then a change came the look of a man drawn out of himself drawn out of all knowledge of his surroundings or his present state stole into his face literally he became transfixed the delicate fingers of his left hand gripped the sides of his little carriage his eyes shone as though those few written lines upon which they were riveted were indeed some message from an unknown an unimagined world yet no word ever passed his lips there came a time when the tension seemed a little relaxed with fingers which still trembled he folded up the sheet and replaced it in the envelope he guarded it with both his hands and sat quite still neither gerald nor his servant moved somehow the sense of mr fentolins suppressed excitement seemed to have become communicated to them it was a little tableau broken at last by mr fentolin himself  i should like he said turning to gerald to be alone it may interest you to know that this document which mr dunster has brought across the seas and which i hold in my hands is the most amazing message of modern times  gerald rose to his feet  what are you going to do about it he asked abruptly do you want any one in from the telegraph room  mr fentolin shook his head slowly  at present he announced i am going to reflect meekins my chair to the north windowso i am going to sit here he went on and i am going to look across the sea and reflect a very fortunate storm after all i think which kept mr john p dunster from the harwich boat last night leave me gerald for a time stand behind my chair meekins and see that no one enters  mr fentolin sat in his chair his hands still gripping the wonderful document his eyes travelling over the ocean now flecked with sunlight his eyes were fixed upon the horizon he looked steadily eastward    chapter vi  mr john p dunster opened his eyes upon strange surroundings he found himself lying upon a bed deliciously soft with laceedged sheets and lavenderperfumed bed hangings through the discreetly opened upper window came a pleasant and ozoneladen breeze the furniture in the room was mostly of an oldfashioned type some of it of oak curiously carved and most of it surmounted with a coat of arms the apartment was lofty and of almost palatial proportions the whole atmosphere of the place breathed comfort and refinement the only thing of which he did not wholly approve was the face of the nurse who rose silently to her feet at his murmured question  where am i  she felt his forehead altered a bandage for a moment and took his wrist between her fingers  you have been ill she said there was a railway accident you are to lie quite still and not say a word i am going to fetch the doctor now he wished to see you directly you spoke  mr dunster dozed again for several moments when he reopened his eyes a man was standing by his bedside a short man with a black beard and goldrimmed glasses mr dunster in this first stage of his convalescence was perhaps difficult to please for he did not like the look of the doctor either  please tell me where i am he begged  you have been in a railway accident the doctor told him and you were brought here afterwards  in a railway accident mr dunster repeated ah yes i remember i took a special to harwichi remember now where is my dressingbag  it is here by the side of your bed  and my pocketbook  it is on your dressingtable  have any of my things been looked at  only so far as was necessary to discover your identity the doctor assured him dont talk too much the nurse is bringing you some beef tea  when mr dunster enquired shall i be able to continue my journey  that depends upon many things the doctor replied  mr dunster drank his beef tea and felt considerably stronger his head still ached but his memory was returning  there was a young man in the carriage with me he asked presently mr gerald something or other i think he said his name was  fentolin the doctor said he is unhurt this is his relatives house to which you have been brought  mr dunster lay for a time with knitted brows once more the name of fentolin seemed somehow familiar to him seemed somehow to bring with it to his memory a note of warning he looked around the room fretfully he looked into the nurses face which he disliked exceedingly and he looked at the doctor whom he was beginning to detest  whose house exactly is this he demanded  this is st davids hallthe home of mr miles fentolin the doctor told him the young gentleman with whom you were travelling is his nephew  can i send a telegram mr dunster asked a little abruptly  without a doubt the doctor replied mr fentolin desired me to ask you if there was any one whom you would like to apprise of your safety  again the man upon the bed lay quite still with knitted brows there was surely something familiar about that name was it his fevered fancy or was there also something a little sinister  the nurse who had glided from the room came back presently with some telegraph forms mr dunster held out his hand for them and then hesitated  can you tell me any date doctor upon which i can rely upon leaving here  you will probably be well enough to travel on the third day from now the doctor assured him  the third day mr dunster muttered very well  he wrote out three telegrams and passed them over  one he said is to new york one to the hague and one to london there was plenty of money in my pocket perhaps you will find it and pay for these  is there anything more the doctor asked that can be done for your comfort  nothing at present mr dunster replied my head aches now but i think that i shall want to leave before three days are up are you the doctor in the neighbourhood  sarson shook his head  i am physician to mr fentolins household he answered quietly i live here mr fentolin is himself somewhat of an invalid and requires constant medical attention  mr dunster contemplated the speaker steadfastly  you will forgive me he said i am an american and i am used to plain speech i am quite unused to being attended by strange doctors i understand that you are not in general practice now might i ask if you are fully qualified  i am an md of london the doctor replied you can make yourself quite easy as to my qualifications it would not suit mr fentolins purpose to entrust himself to the care of any one without a reputation  he left the room and mr dunster closed his eyes his slumbers however were not altogether peaceful ones all the time there seemed to be a hammering inside his head and from somewhere back in his obscured memory the name of fentolin seemed to be continually asserting itself from somewhere or other the amazing sense which sometimes gives warning of danger to men of adventure seemed to have opened its feelers he rested because he was exhausted but even in his sleep he was ill at ease  the doctor with the telegrams in his hand made his way down a splendid staircase past the long picture gallery where masterpieces of van dyck and rubens frowned and leered down upon him descended the final stretch of broad oak stairs crossed the hail and entered his masters rooms mr fentolin was sitting before the open window an easel in front of him a palette in his left hand painting with deft swift touches  ah he exclaimed without looking around it is my friend the doctor my friend sarson md of london lrcp and all the rest of it he brings with him the odour of the sick room for a moment or two just for a moment dear friend do not disturb me do not bring any alien thoughts into my brain i am absorbed you seeabsorbed it is a strange problem of colour this  he was silent for several moments glancing repeatedly out of the window and back to his canvas painting all the time with swift and delicate precision  meekins who stands behind my chair mr fentolin continued even meekins is entranced he has a soul my friend sarson although you might not think it he too sees sometimes the colour in the skies the glitter upon the sands the clear sweet purity of those long stretches of virgin water meekins i believe has a soul only he likes better to see these things grow under his masters touch than to wander about and solve their riddles for himself  the man remained perfectly immovable not a feature twitched yet it was a fact that although he stood where mr fentolin could not possibly observe him he never removed his gaze from the canvas  you see my medical friend that there has been a great tide in the night following upon the flood even our small landmarks are shifted soon in my little carriage i shall ride down to the tower i shall sit there and i shall watch the sea i think that this evening with the turn of the tide the spray may reach even to my windows there i shall paint again there is always something fresh in the sea you knowalways something fresh in the sea like a human faceangry or pleased sullen or joyful some people like to paint the sea at its calmest and most beautiful some people like to see happy faces around them it is not every one who appreciates the other things it is not quite like that with me eh sarson  his hand fell to his side momentarily he had finished his work he turned around and eyed the doctor who stood in taciturn silence  answer answer me he insisted  the doctors gloomy face seemed darker still  you have spoken the truth mr fentolin he admitted you are not one of the vulgar herd who love to consort with pleasure and happiness you are one of those who understand the beauty of unhappinessin others he added with faint emphasis  mr fentolin smiled his face became almost like the face of one of those angels of the great italian master  how well you know me he murmured my humble effort doctorhow do you like it  the doctor bent over the canvas  i know nothing about art he said a little roughly your work seems to me clevera little grotesque perhaps a little straining after the hard plain things which threaten nothing of the idealist in your work mr fentolin  mr fentolin studied the canvas himself for a moment  a clever man sarson he remarked coolly but no courtier never mind my work pleases me it gives me a passing sensation of happiness now what about our patient  he recovers the doctor pronounced from my short examination i should say that he had the constitution of an ox i have told him that he will be up in three days as a matter of fact he will be able if he wants to to walk out of the house tomorrow  mr fentolin shook his head  we cannot spare him quite so soon he declared we must avail ourselves of this wonderful chance afforded us by my brilliant young nephew we must keep him with us for a little time what is it that you have in your hands doctor telegrams i think let me look at them  the doctor held them out mr fentolin took them eagerly between his thin delicate fingers suddenly his face darkened and became like the face of a spoilt and angry child  cipher he exclaimed furiously a cipher which he knows so well as to remember it too never mind it will be easy to decode it will amuse me during the afternoon very good sarson i will take charge of these  you do not wish anything dispatched  nothing at present mr fentolin sighed it will be well i think for the poor man to remain undisturbed by any communications from his friends is he restless at all  he wants to get on with his journey  we shall see mr fentolin remarked now feel my pulse sarson how am i this morning  the doctor held the thin wrist for a moment between his fingers and let it go  in perfect health as usual he announced grimly  ah but you cannot be sure mr fentolin protested my tongue if you please  he put it out  excellent  we must make quite certain mr fentolin continued there are so many people who would miss me my place in the world would not be easily filed undo my waistcoat sarson feel my heart please feel carefully i can see the end of your stethoscope in your pocket dont scamp it i fancied this morning when i was lying here alone that there was something almost like a palpitationa quicker beat be very careful sarson now  the doctor made his examination with impassive face then he stepped back  there is no change in your condition mr fentolin he announced the palpitation you spoke of is a mistake you are in perfect health  mr fentolin sighed gently  then he said i will now amuse myself by a gentle ride down to the tower you are entirely satisfied sarson you are keeping nothing back from me  the doctor looked at him with grim impassive face there is nothing to keep back he declared you have the constitution of a cowboy there is no reason why you should not live for another thirty years  mr fentolin sighed as though a weight had been removed from his heart  i will now he decided reaching forward for the handle of his carriage go down to the tower it is just possible that a few days seclusion might be good for our guest  the doctor turned silently away there was no one there to see his expression as he walked towards the door     chapter vii  the two men who were supping together in the grillroom at the cafe milan were talking with a seriousness which seemed a little out of keeping with the roseshaded lamps and the swaying music of the band from the distant restaurant their conversation had started some hours before in the club smokingroom and had continued intermittently throughout the evening it had received a further stimulus when richard hamel who had bought an evening standard on their way from the theatre a few minutes ago came across a certain paragraph in it which he read aloud  hanged if i understand things over here nowadays reggie he declared laying the paper down heres another englishman imprisoned in germanythis time at a place no one ever heard of before i wont try to pronounce it what does it all mean its all very well to shrug your shoulders but when there are eighteen arrests within one week on a charge of espionage there must be something up  for the first time reginald kinsley seemed inclined to discuss the subject seriously he drew the paper towards him and read the little paragraph word by word then he gave some further order to an attentive maitre dhotel and glanced around to be sure that they were not overheard  look here dick old chap he said you are just back from abroad and you are not quite in the hang of things yet let me ask you a plain question what do you think of us all  think of you hamel repeated a little doubtfully do you mean personally  take it any way you like kinsley replied look at me nine years ago we played cricket in the same eleven i dont look much like cricket now do i  hamel looked at his companion thoughtfully for a man who was doubtless still young kinsley had certainly an aged appearance the hair about his temples was grey there were lines about his mouth and forehead he had the air of one who lived in an atmosphere of anxiety  to me hamel declared frankly you look worried if i hadnt heard so much of the success of your political career and all the rest of it i should have thought that things were going badly with you  theyve gone well enough with me personally kinsley admitted but im only one of many politics isnt the game it was the foreign office especially is ageing its men fast these few years weve been going through hell hamel and we are up against it now hard up against it  the slight smile passed from the lips of hamels sunburnt goodnatured face he himself seemed to become infected with something of his companions anxiety  theres nothing seriously wrong is there reggie he asked  dick said kinsley with a sigh i am afraid there is its very seldom i talk as plainly as this to any one but you are just the person one can unburden oneself to a little and to tell you the truth its rather a relief as you say these eighteen arrests in one week do mean something half of the englishmen who have been arrested are to my certain knowledge connected with our secret service and they have been arrested in many cases where there are no fortifications worth speaking of within fifty miles on one pretext or another the fact of the matter is that things are going on in germany just at the present moment the knowledge of which is of vital interest to us  then these arrests hamel remarked are really bona fide  without a doubt his companion agreed i only wonder there have not been more i am telling you what is a pretty open secret when i tell you that there is a conference due to be held this week at some place or another on the continenti dont know where myselfwhich will have a very important bearing upon our future we know just as much as that and not much more  a conference between whom hamel asked  kinsley dropped his voice almost to a whisper  we know he replied that a very great man from russia a greater still from france a minister from austria a statesman from italy and an envoy from japan have been invited to meet a german minister whose name i will not mention even to you the subject of their proposed discussion has never been breathed one can only suspect when i tell you that no one from this country was invited to the conference i think you will be able broadly speaking to divine its purpose the clouds have been gathering for a good many years and we have only buried our heads a little deeper in the sands we have had our chances and wilfully chucked them away national service or three more army corps four years ago would have brought us an alliance which would have meant absolute safety for twentyone years you know what happened we have lived through many rumours and escaped more narrowly than most people realise a great many dangers but there is every indication this time that the end is really coming  and what will the end be hamel enquired eagerly  kinsley shrugged his shoulders and paused while their glasses were filled with wine  it will be in the nature of a diplomatic coup he said presently of that much i feel sure england will be forced into such a position that she will have no alternative left but to declare war that of course will be the end of us with our ridiculously small army and absolutely no sane scheme for home defence we shall lose all that we have worth fighting forour colonieswithout being able to strike a blow the thing is so ridiculously obvious it has been admitted time after time by every sea lord and every commanderinchief we have listened to it and thats all our fleet is needed under present conditions to protect our own shores there isnt a single battleship which could be safely spared canada australia new zealand egypt india must take care of themselves i wonder when a nation of the world ever played fast and loose with great possessions as we have done  this is a nice sort of thing to hear almost ones first night in england hamel remarked a little gloomily tell me some more about this conference are you sure that your information is reliable  our information is miserably scanty kinsley admitted curiously enough the man who must know most about the whole thing is an englishman one of the most curious mortals in the british empire a spy of his succeeded in learning more than any of our people and without being arrested too  and who is this singular person hamel asked  a man of whom you i suppose never heard kinsley replied his name is fentolinmiles fentolinand he lives somewhere down in norfolk he is one of the strangest characters that ever lived stranger than any effort of fiction i ever met with he was in the foreign office once and every one was predicting for him a brilliant career then there was an accidentlet me see it must have been some six or seven years agoand he had to have both his legs amputated no one knows exactly how the accident happened and there was always a certain amount of mystery connected with it since then he has buried himself in the country i dont think in fact that he ever moves outside his place but somehow or other he has managed to keep in touch with all the political movements of the day  fentolin hamel repeated softly to himself tell me whereabouts does he live  quite a wonderful place in norfolk i believe somewhere near the sea ive forgotten the name for the moment he has had wireless telegraphy installed he has a telegraph office in the house halfadozen private wires and they say that he spends an immense amount of money keeping in touch with foreign politics his excuse is that he speculates largely as i dare say he does but just lately kinsley went on more slowly he has been an object of anxiety to all of us it was he who sent the first agent out to germany to try and discover at least where this conference was to be held his man returned in safety and he has one over there now who has not been arrested we seem to have lost nearly all of ours  do you mean to say that this man fentolin actually possesses information which the government hasnt as to the intentions of foreign powers hamel asked  kinsley nodded there was a slight flush upon his pallid cheeks  he not only has it but he doesnt mean to part with it a few hundred years ago when the rulers of this country were men with blood in their veins hed have been given just one chance to tell all he knew and hung as a traitor if he hesitated we dont do that sort of thing nowadays we rather go in for preserving traitors we permit them even in our own house of commons however i dont want to depress you and play the alarmist so soon after your return to london i dare say the old countryll muddle along through our time  dont be foolish hamel begged theres no other subject of conversation could interest me half as much have you formed any idea yourself as to the nature of this conference  we all have an idea kinsley replied grimly india for russia a large slice of china for japan with probably australia thrown in alsacelorraine for frances neutrality theres bribery for you whats to become of poor england then our friends are only human after all and its merely a question of handing over to them sufficient spoil they must consider themselves first thats the first duty of their politicians towards their country  you mean to say hamel asked that you seriously believe that a conference is on the point of being held at which france and russia are to be invited to consider suggestions like this  i am afraid theres no doubt about it kinsley declared their ambassadors in london profess to know nothing that of course is their reasonable attitude but theres no doubt whatever that the conference has been planned i should say that tonight we are nearer war if we can summon enough spirit to fight than we have been since fashoda  queer if i have returned just in time for the scrap hamel remarked thoughtfully i was in the militia once so i expect i can get a job if theres any fighting  i can get you a better job than fightingone you can start on tomorrow too kinsley announced abruptly that is if you really want to help  of course i do hamel insisted im on for anything  you say that you are entirely your own master for the next six months  or as much longer as i like hamel assented no plans at all except that i might drift round to the norfolk coast and look up some of the places where the governor used to paint theres a queer little housest davids tower i believe they call itwhich really belongs to me it was given to my father or rather he bought it from a man who i think must have been some relative of your friend i feel sure the name was fentolin  reginald kinsley set down his wineglass  is your st davids tower anywhere near a place called salthouse he asked reflectively  thats the name of the village hamel admitted my father used to spend quite a lot of time in those parts and painted at least a dozen pictures down there  this is a coincidence reginald kinsley declared lighting a cigarette i think if i were you dick id go down and claim my property  tired of me already hamel asked smiling  reginald kinsley knocked the ash from his cigarette  it isnt that the fact is that job i was speaking to you about was simply this we want some one to go down to salthousenot exactly as a spy you know but some one who has his wits about him we are all of us very curious about this man fentolin there are no end of rumours which i wont mention to you for they might only put you off the scent but the man seems to be always intriguing it wouldnt matter so much if he were our friend or if he were simply a financier but to tell you the truth we have cause to suspect him  but hes an englishman surely hamel asked the fentolin who was my fathers friend was just a very wealthy norfolk squireone of the best from all i have heard  miles fentolin is an englishman kinsley admitted it is true too that he comes of a very ancient norfolk family it doesnt do however to build too much upon that from all i can learn of him he is a sort of puck a professional mischiefmaker i dont suppose theres anything an outsider could find out which would be really useful to us but all the same if i had the time i should certainly go down to norfolk myself  the conversation drifted away for a while mutual acquaintances entered there were several introductions and it was not until the two found themselves together in kinsleys rooms for a few minutes before parting that they were alone again hamel returned then once more to the subject  reggie he said if you think it would be of the slightest use ill go down to salthouse tomorrow i am rather keen on going there anyway i am absolutely fed up with life here already  its just what i want you to do kinsley said i am afraid fentolin is a little too clever for you to get on the right side of him but if you could only get an idea as to what his game is down there it would be a great help you see the fellow cant have gone into all this sort of thing blindfold weve lost several very useful agents abroad and two from new york whove gone into his pay there must be a method in it somewhere if it really ends with his financial operationswhy all right thats very likely what itll come to but we should like to know the merest hint would be useful  ill do my best hamel promised in any case it will be just the few days holiday i was looking forward to  kinsley helped himself to whisky and soda and turned towards his friend  heres luck to you dick take care of yourself all sorts of things may happen you know old man fentolin may take a fancy to you and tell you secrets that any statesman in europe would be glad to hear he may tell you why this conference is being held and what the result will be you may be the first to hear of our coming fall well heres to you anyway drop me a line if youve anything to report  cheero hamel answered as he set down his empty tumbler astonishing how keen i feel about this little adventure im perfectly sick of the humdrum life i have been leading the last week and you do sort of take one back to the arabian nights you know reggie i am never quite sure whether to take you seriously or not  kinsley smiled as he held his friends hand for a moment  dick he said earnestly if only youd believe it the adventures in the arabian nights were as nothing compared with the presentday drama of foreign politics you see weve learned to conceal things nowadaysto smooth them over to play the part of ordinary citizens to the world while we tug at the underhand levers in our secret moments good night good luck     chapter viii  richard hamel although he certainly had not the appearance of a person afflicted with nerves gave a slight start for the last halfhour during which time the train had made no stop he had been alone in his compartment yet to his surprise he was suddenly aware that the seat opposite to him had been noiselessly taken by a girl whose eyes also were fixed with curious intentness upon the broad expanse of marshland and sands across which the train was slowly making its way hamel had spent a great many years abroad and his first impulse was to speak with the unexpected stranger he forgot for a moment that he was in england travelling in a firstclass carriage and pointed with his left hand towards the sea  queer country this isnt it he remarked pleasantly do you know i never heard you come in it gave me quite a start when i found that i had a fellowpassenger  she looked at him with a certain amount of still surprise a look which he returned just as steadfastly because even in those few seconds he was conscious of that strange selective interest certainly unaccounted for by his own impressions of her appearance she seemed to him at that first glance very far indeed from being goodlooking according to any of the standards by which he had measured good looks she was thin too thin for his taste and she carried herself with an aloofness to which he was unaccustomed her cheeks were quite pale her hair of a soft shade of brown her eyes grey and sad she gave him altogether an impression of colourlessness and he had been living in a land where colour and vitality meant much her speech too in its very restraint fell strangely upon his ears  i have been travelling in an uncomfortable compartment she observed i happened to notice when passing along the corridor that yours was empty in any case i am getting out at the next station  so am i he replied still cheerfully i suppose the next station is st davids  she made no answer but so far as her expression counted for anything at all she was a little surprised her eyes considered him for a moment hamel was tall well over six feet powerfully made with good features clear eyes and complexion unusually sunburnt he wore a flannel collar of unfamiliar shape and his clothes although they were neat enough were of a pattern and cut obviously designed to afford the maximum of ease and comfort with the minimum regard to appearance he wore too very thick boots and his hands gave one the impression that they were seldom gloved his voice was pleasant and he had the easy selfconfidence of a person sure of himself in the world she put him down as a colonialperhaps an americanbut his rank in life mystified her  this seems the queerest stretch of country he went on long spits of sand jutting right out into the sea dikes and creeksmiles and miles of them now i wonder is it low tide or high low i should think because of the seashine on the sand there  she glanced out of the window  the tide she told him is almost at its lowest  you live in this neighbourhood perhaps he enquired  i do she assented  sort of country one might get very fond of he ventured  she glanced at him from the depths of her grey eyes  do you think so she rejoined coldly for my part i hate it  he was surprised at the unexpected emphasis of her tonethe first time indeed that she had shown any signs of interest in the conversation  kind of dull i suppose you find it he remarked pensively looking out across the waste of lavendergrown marshes sand hummocks piled with seaweed and a far distant line of pebbled shore and yet i dont know i have lived by the sea a good deal and however monotonous it may seem at first theres always plenty of change really tide and wind do such wonderful work  she too was looking out now towards the sea  oh it isnt exactly that she said quietly i am quite willing to admit what all the tourists and chance visitors call the fascination of these places i happen to dislike them that is all perhaps it is because i live here because i see them day by day perhaps because the sight of them and the thought of them have become woven into my life  she was talking half to herself for a moment even the knowledge of his presence had escaped her hamel however did not realise that fact he welcomed her confidence as a sign of relaxation from the frigidity of her earlier demeanour  that seems hard he observed sympathetically it seems odd to hear you talk like that too your life surely ought to be pleasant enough  she looked away from the sea into his face although the genuine interest which she saw there and the kindly expression of his eyes disarmed annoyance she still stiffened slightly  why ought it  the question was a little bewildering  why because you are young and a girl he replied its natural to be cheerful isnt it  is it she answered listlessly i cannot tell i have not had much experience  how old are you he asked bluntly  this time it certainly seemed as though her reply would contain some rebuke for his curiosity she glanced once more into his face however and the instinctive desire to administer that welldeserved snub passed away he was so obviously interested his question was asked so naturally that its spice of impertinence was as though it had not existed  i am twentyone she told him  and how long have you lived here  since i left boardingschool four years ago  anywhere near where i am going to bury myself for a time i wonder he went on  that depends she replied our only neighbours are the lorneybrookes of market burnham are you going there  he shook his head  ive got a little shanty of my own he explained quite close to st davids station ive never even seen it yet  she vouchsafed some slight show of curiosity  where is this shanty as you call it she asked him  i really havent the faintest idea he replied i am looking for it now all i can tell you is that it stands just out of reach of the full tides on a piece of rock dead on the beach and about a mile from the station it was built originally for a coastguard station and meant to hold a lifeboat but they found they could never launch the lifeboat when they had it so the man to whom all the foreshore and most of the land around here belongsa mr fentolin i believesold it to my father i expect the place has tumbled to pieces by this time but i thought id have a look at it  she was gazing at him steadfastly now with parted lips  what is your name she demanded  richard hamel  hamel  she repeated it lingeringly it seemed quite unfamiliar  was your father a great friend of mr fentolins then she asked  i believe so in a sort of way he answered my father was hamel the artist you know they made him an ra some time before he died he used to come out here and live in a tent then mr fentolin let him use this place and finally sold it to him my father used often to speak to me about it before he died  tell me she enquired i do not know much about these matters but have you any papers to prove that it was sold to your father and that you have the right to occupy it now when you choose  he smiled  of course i have he assured her as a matter of fact as none of us have been here for so long i thought id better bring the titledeed or whatever they call it along with me its with the rest of my traps at norwich oh the place belongs to me right enough he went on smiling dont tell me that any ones pulled it down or that its disappeared from the face of the earth  no she said it still remains there when we are round the next curve i think i can show it to you but every one has forgotten i think that it doesnt belong to mr fentolin still he uses it himself very often  what for  she looked at her questioner quite steadfastly quite quietly speechlessly a curious uneasiness crept into his thoughts there were mysterious things in her face he knew from that moment that she too directly or indirectly was concerned with those strange happenings at which kinsley had hinted he knew that there were things which she was keeping from him now  mr fentolin uses one of the rooms as a studio he likes to paint there and be near the sea she explained but for the rest i do not know i never go near the place  i am afraid he remarked after a few moments of silence that i shall be a little unpopular with mr fentolin perhaps i ought to have written first but then of course i had no idea that any one was making use of the place  i do not understand she said how you can possibly expect to come down like this and live there without any preparation  why not  you havent any servants nor any furniture nor things to cook with  he laughed  oh i am an old campaigner he assured her i meant to pick up a few oddments in the village i dont suppose i shall stay very long anyhow but i thought id like to have a look at the place bytheby what sort of a man is mr fentolin  again there was that curious expression in her eyes an expression almost of secret terror this time not wholly concealed he could have sworn that her hands were cold  he met with an accident many years ago she said slowly both his legs were amputated he spends his life in a little carriage which he wheels about himself  poor fellow hamel exclaimed with a strong mans ready sympathy for suffering that is just as much as i have heard about him is he a decent sort of fellow in other ways i suppose anyhow if he has really taken a fancy to my little shanty i shall have to give it up  then as it seemed to him for the first time real life leaped into her face she leaned towards him her tone was half commanding half imploring her manner entirely confidential  dont she begged it is yours claim it live in it do anything you like with it but take it away from mr fentolin  hamel was speechless he sat a little forward a hand on either knee his mouth ungracefully open an expression of blank and utter bewilderment in his face for the first time he began to have vague doubts concerning this young lady everything about her had been so strange her quiet entrance into the carriage her unusual manner of talking and finally this last passionate inexplicable appeal  i am afraid he said at last i dont quite understand you say the poor fellow has taken a fancy to the place and likes being there well it isnt much of a catch for me anyway im rather a wanderer and i dare say i shant be back in these parts again for years why shouldnt i let him have it if he wants it its no loss to me im not a painter you know like my father  she seemed on the point of making a further appeal her lips even were parted her head a little thrown back and then she stopped she said nothing the silence lasted so long that he became almost embarrassed  you will forgive me if i am a little dense wont you he begged to tell you the truth he went on smiling ive got a sort of feeling that id like to do anything you ask me now wont you just explain a little more clearly what you mean and ill blow up the old place sky high if its any pleasure to you  she seemed suddenly to have reverted to her former selfthe cold and colourless young woman who had first taken the seat opposite to his  mine was a very foolish request she admitted quietly i am sorry that i ever made it it was just an impulse because the little building we were speaking of has been connected with one or two very disagreeable episodes nevertheless it was foolish of me how long did you think of staying therethat is she added with a faint smile providing that you find it possible to prove your claim and take up possession  oh just for a week or so he answered lightly and as to regaining possession of it he went on a slightly pugnacious instinct stirring him i dont imagine that therell be any difficulty about that  really she murmured  not that i want to make myself disagreeable he continued but the tower is mine right enough even if i have let it remain unoccupied for some time  she let down the windowa task in which he hastened to assist her a rush of salt cold air swept into the compartment he sniffed it eagerly  wonderful he exclaimed  she stretched out a long arm and pointed away in the distance on the summit of a line of pebbled shore standing as it seemed sheer over the sea was a little black speck  that she said is the tower  he changed his position and leaned out of the window  well its a queer little place he remarked it doesnt look worth quarrelling over does it  and that she went on directing his attention to the hill is mr fentolins home st davids hall  for several moments he made no remark at all there was something curiously impressive in that sudden sweep up from the sealine the strange miniature mountain standing in the middle of the marshes with its treecrowned background and the long weatherbeaten front of the house turned bravely to the sea  i never saw anything like it he declared why its barely a quarter of a mile from the sea isnt it  a little more than that it is a strangely situated abode isnt it  wonderful he agreed with emphasis i must study the geological formation of that hill he continued with interest why it looks almost like an island now  that is because of the floods she told him even at high tide the creeks never reach so far as the back there all the water you see stretching away inland is flood waterthe result of the storm i suppose this is where you get out she concluded rising to her feet  she turned away with the slightest nod a maid was already awaiting her at the door of the compartment hamel was suddenly conscious of the fact that he disliked her going immensely  we shall perhaps meet again during the next few days he remarked  she half turned her head her expression was scarcely encouraging  i hope she said that you will not be disappointed in your quarters  hamel followed her slowly on to the platform saw her escorted to a very handsome motorcar by an obsequious stationmaster and watched the former disappear down the stretch of straight road which led to the hill then with a stick in one hand and the handbag which was his sole luggage in the other he left the station and turned seaward     chapter ix  mr fentolin surrounded by his satellites was seated in his chair before the writingtable there were present in the room most of the people important to him in his somewhat singular life a few feet away in characteristic attitude stood meekins doctor sarson with his hands behind him was looking out of the window at the further end of the table stood a confidential telegraph clerk who was just departing with a little sheaf of messages by his side with a notebook in her hand stood mr fentolins private secretarya whitehaired woman with a strangely transparent skin and light brown eyes dressed in somber black a woman who might have been of any age from thirty to fifty behind her was a middleaged man whose position in the household no one was quite sure abouta cleanshaven man whose name was ryan and who might very well have been once an actor or a clergyman in the background stood henderson the perfect butler  it is perhaps opportune mr fentolin said quietly that you all whom i trust should be present here together i wish you to understand one thing you have i believe in my employ learned the gift of silence it is to be exercised with regard to a certain visitor brought here by my nephew a visitor whom i regret to say is now lying seriously ill  there was absolute silence doctor sarson alone turned from the window as though about to speak but met mr fentolins eye and at once resumed his position  i rely upon you all mr fentolin continued softly henderson you perhaps have the most difficult task for you have the servants to control nevertheless i rely upon you also if one word of this visitors presence here leaks out even so far as the village out they go every one of them i will not have a servant in the place who does not respect my wishes you can give any reason you like for my orders it is a whim i have whims and i choose to pay for them you are all better paid than any man breathing could pay you in return i ask only for your implicit obedience  he stretched out his hand and took a cigarette from a curiously carved ivory box which stood by his side he tapped it gently upon the table and looked up  i think sir henderson said respectfully that i can answer for the servants being mostly foreigners they see little or nothing of the village people  no one else made any remark it was strange to see how dominated they all were by that queer little fragment of humanity whose head scarcely reached a foot above the table before which he sat they departed silently almost abjectly dismissed with a single wave of the hand mr fentolin beckoned his secretary to remain she came a little nearer  sit down lucy he ordered  she seated herself a few feet away from him mr fentolin watched her for several moments he himself had his back to the light the woman on the other hand was facing it the windows were high and the curtains were drawn back to their fullest extent a cold stream of northern light fell upon her face mr fentolin gazed at her and nodded her head slightly  my dear lucy he declared you are wonderfula perfect cameo a gem to look at you now with your delightful white hair and your flawless skin one would never believe that you had ever spoken a single angry word that you had ever felt the blood flow through your veins or that your eyes had ever looked upon the gentle things of life  she looked at him still without speech the immobility of her face was indeed a marvellous thing mr fentolins expression darkened  sometimes he murmured softly i think that if i had strong fingersreally strong fingers you know lucyi should want to take you by the throat and hold you tighter and tighter until your breath came fast and your eyes came out from their shadows  she turned over a few pages of her notebook to all appearance she had not heard a word  today she announced is the fourth of april shall i send out the various checks to those men in paris new york frankfort st petersburg and tokio  you can send the checks he told her be sure that you draw them as usual upon the credit lyonaise and in the name you know of say to lebonaitre of paris that you consider his last reports faulty no mention was made of monsieur cs visit to the russian embassy or of the supper party given to the baron von erlstein by a certain russian gentleman warn him if you please that reports with such omissions are useless to me  she wrote a few words in her book  you made a note of that  she raised her head  i do not make mistakes she said  his eyebrows were drawn together this was his work he told himself this magnificent physical subjection yet his inability to stir her sometimes maddened him  you know who is in this house he asked you know the name of my unknown guest  i know nothing she replied his presence does not interest me  supposing i desire you to know he persisted leaning a little forward supposing i tell you that it is your duty to know  then she said i should tell you that i believe him to be the special envoy from new york to the hague or whatever place on the continent this coming conference is to be held at  right woman mr fentolin answered sharply right it is the special envoy he has his mandate with him i have them boththe man and his mandate can you guess what i am going to do with them  it is not difficult she replied your methods are scarcely original his mandate to the flames and his body to the sea  she raised her eyes as she spoke and looked over mr fentolins shoulder across the marshland to the grey stretch of ocean her eyes became fixed it was not possible to say that they held any expression and yet one felt that she saw beneath the grey waves even to the rocks and caverns below  it does not terrify you then he asked curiously to think that a man under this roof is about to die  why should it she retorted death does not frighten memy own or anybody elses does it frighten you  his face was suddenly livid his eyes full of fierce anger his lips twitched he struck the table before him  beast of a woman he shouted you ghoul how dare you how dare you  he stopped short he passed his hand across his forehead all the time the woman remained unmoved  do you know he muttered his voice still shaking a little that i believe sometimes i am afraid of you how would you like to see me there eh down at the bottom of that hungry sea you watch sometimes so fixedly youd miss me wouldnt you i am a good master you know i pay well youve been with me a good many years you were a different sort of woman when you first came  yes she admitted i was a different sort of woman  you dont remember those days i suppose he went on the days when you had brown hair when you used to carry roses about and sing to yourself while you beat your work out of that wretched typewriter  no she answered i do not remember those days they do not belong to me it is some other woman you are thinking of   their eyes met mr fentolin turned away first he struck the bell at his elbow she rose at once  be off he ordered when you look at me like that you send shivers through me youll have to go i can see youll have to go i cant keep you any longer you are the only person on the face of the earth who dares to say things to me which make me think the only person who doesnt shrink at the sound of my voice youll have to go send sarson to me at once youve upset me  she listened to his words in expressionless silence when he had finished carrying her book in her hand she very quietly moved towards the door he watched her leaning a little forward in his chair his lips parted his eyes threatening she walked with steady even footsteps she carried herself with almost machinelike erectness her skirts were noiseless she had the trick of turning the handle of the door in perfect silence he heard her calm voice in the hall  doctor sarson is to go to mr fentolin  mr fentolin sat quite still feeling his own pulse  that woman he muttered to himself thatwomansome day i shouldnt be surprised if she really  he paused the doctor had entered the room  i am upset sarson he declared come and feel my pulse quickly that woman has upset me  miss price  miss price dn it lucyyes  it seems unlike her the doctor remarked i have never heard her utter a useless syllable in my life  mr fentolin held out his wrist  its what she doesnt say he muttered  the doctor produced his watch in less than a minute he put it away  this is quite unnecessary he pronounced your pulse is wonderful  not hurried no signs of palpitation  you have seven or eight footmen all young men doctor sarson replied drily i will wager that there isnt one of them has a pulse so vigorous as yours  mr fentolin leaned a little back in his chair an expression of satisfaction crept over his face  you reassure me my dear sarson that is excellent what of our patient  there is no change  i am afraid mr fentolin sighed that we shall have trouble with him these strong people always give trouble  it will be just the same in the long run the doctor remarked shrugging his shoulders  mr fentolin held up his finger  listen a motorcar i believe  it is miss fentolin who is just arriving the doctor announced i saw the car coming as i crossed the hall  mr fentolin nodded gently  indeed he replied indeed so my dear niece has returned open the door friend sarson open the door if you please she will be anxious to see me we must summon her     chapter x  mr fentolin raised to his lips the little gold whistle which hung from his neck and blew it he seemed to devote very little effort to the operation yet the strength of the note was wonderful as the echoes died away he let it fall by his side and waited with a pleased smile upon his lips in a few seconds there was the hurried flutter of skirts and the sound of footsteps the girl who had just completed her railway journey entered followed by her brother they were both a little out of breath they both approached the chair without a smile the girl in advance with a certain expression of apprehension in her eyes mr fentolin sighed he appeared to notice these things and regret them  my child he said holding out his hands my dear esther welcome home again i heard the car outside i am grieved that you did not at once hurry to my side  i have not been in the house two minutes esther replied and i havent seen mother yet forgive me  she had come to a standstill a few yards away she moved now very slowly towards the chair with the air of one fulfilling a hateful task the fingers which accepted his hands were extended almost hesitatingly he drew her closer to him and held her there  your mother my dear esther is i regret to say suffering from a slight indisposition he remarked she has been confined to her room for the last few days just a trifling affair of the nerves nothing more doctor sarson assures me but my dear child he went on your fingers are as cold as ice you look at me so strangely too alas you have not the affectionate disposition of your dear mother one would scarcely believe that we have been parted for more than a week  for more than a week she repeated under her breath  stoop down my dear i must kiss your foreheadthere now bring up a chair to my side you seem frightenedalarmed have you ill news for me  i have no news she answered gradually recovering herself  the gaieties of london i fear he protested gently have proved a little unsettling  there were no gaieties for me the girl replied bitterly mrs sargent obeyed your orders very faithfully i was not allowed to move out except with her  my dear child you would not go about london unchaperoned  there is a difference she retorted between a chaperon and a jailer  mr fentolin sighed he shook his head slowly he seemed pained  i am not sure that you repay my care as it deserves esther he declared there is something in your deportment which disappoints me never mind your brother has made some atonement i entrusted him with a little mission in which i am glad to say that he has been brilliantly successful  i cannot say that i am glad to hear it esther replied quietly  mr fentolin sat back in his chair his long fingers played nervously together he looked at her gravely  my dear child he exclaimed in a tone of pained surprise your attitude distresses me  i cannot help it i have told you what i think about gerald and the life he is compelled to live here i dont mind so much for myself but for him i think it is abominable  the same as ever mr fentolin sighed i fear that this little change has done you no good dear niece  change she echoed it was only a change of prisons  mr fentolin shook his head slowlya distressful gesture yet all the time he had somehow the air of a man secretly gratified  you are beginning to depress me he announced i think that you can go away no stop for just one moment stand there in the light dear me how unfortunate who would have thought that so beautiful a mother could have so plain a daughter  she stood quite still before him her hands crossed in front of her something of the look of the nun from whom the power of suffering has gone in her still cold face and steadfast eyes  not a touch of colour he continued meditatively a figure straight as my walkingstick what a pity and all the taste nowadays they tell me is in the other direction the lank damsels have gone completely out we buried them with oscar wilde run along my dear child you do not amuse me you can take gerald with you if you will i have nothing to say to gerald just now he is in my good books is there anything i can do for you gerald your allowance for instancea trifling increase or an advance i am in a generous humour  then grant me what i begged for the other day the boy answered quickly let me go to sandhurst i could enter my name next week for the examinations and i could pass tomorrow  mr fentolin tapped the table thoughtfully with his forefinger  a little ungrateful my dear boy he declared a little ungrateful that i think your confidence in yourself pleases me though you think you could pass your examinations  i did a set of papers last week the boy replied on the given percentages i came out twelfth or better mr brown assured me that i could go in for them at any moment he promised to write you about it before he left  mr fentolin nodded gently  now i come to think of it i did have a letter from mr brown he remarked rather an impertinence for a tutor i thought it he devoted three pages towards impressing upon me the necessity of your adopting some sort of a career  he wrote because he thought it was his duty the boy said doggedly  so you want to be a soldier mr fentolin continued musingly well well why not our picture galleries are full of them there has been a fentolin in every great battle for the last five hundred years sailors tooplenty of themand just a few diplomatists brave fellows not one i fancy he added like menot one condemned to pass their days in a perambulator you are a fine fellow geralda regular fentolin getting on for six feet arent you  six feet two sir  a very fine fellow mr fentolin repeated i am not so sure about the army gerald you see there are some people who say like your american friend that we are even now almost on the brink of war  all the more reason for me to hurry the boy begged  mr fentolin closed his eyes  dont he insisted have you ever stopped to think what war meansthe war you speak of so lightly the suffering the misery of it all the pageantry and music and heroism in front and behind a blackened world a trail of writhing corpses a world of weeping women for whom the sun shall never rise again ugh an ugly thing war gerald i am not sure that you are not better at home here why not practise golf a little more assiduously i see from the local paper that you are still playing at two handicap now with your physique i should have thought you would have been a scratch player long before now  i play cricket sir the boy reminded him a little impatiently and after all there are other things in the world besides games  mr fentolins long finger shot suddenly out he was leaning a little from his chair his expression of gentle immobility had passed away his face was stern almost stony  you have spoken the truth gerald he said there are other things in the world besides games there is the real the tragical side of life the duties one takes up the obligations of honour you have not forgotten young man the burden you carry  the boy was paler but he had drawn himself to his full height  i have not forgotten sir he answered bitterly do i show any signs of forgetting havent i done your bidding year by year arent i here now to do it  then do it mr fentolin retorted sharply when i am ready for you to leave here you shall leave until then you are mine remember that ah this is doctor sarson who comes i believe that must mean that it is five oclock come in doctor i am not engaged you see i am alone with my dear niece and nephew we have been having a little pleasant conversation  doctor sarson bowed to esther who scarcely glanced at him he remained in the background quietly waiting  a very delightful little conversation mr fentolin concluded i have been congratulating my nephew doctor upon his wisdom in preferring the quiet country life down here to the wearisome routine of a profession he escapes the embarrassing choice of a career by preferring to devote his life to my comfort i shall not forget it i shall not be ungrateful i may have my faults but i am not ungrateful run away now both of you dear children you are but one wearies you know of everything i am going out you see the twilight is coming the tide is changing i am going down to meet the sea  his little carriage moved towards the door the brother and sister passed out esther led gerald into the great diningroom and from there through the open windows out on to the terrace she gripped his shoulder and pointed down to the tower  something she whispered in his ear is going to happen there     chapter xi  the little station at which hamel alighted was like an oasis in the middle of a flat stretch of sand and marsh it consisted only of a few raised planks and a rude shelterbuilt indeed for the convenience of st davids hall alone for the nearest village was two miles away the stationmaster on his return from escorting the young lady to her car stared at this other passenger in some surprise  which way to the sea hamel asked  the man pointed to the white gates of the crossing  you can take any of those paths you like sir he said if you want to get to salthouse though you should have got out at the next station  this will do for me hamel replied cheerfully  be careful of the dikes the stationmaster advised him some of them are pretty deep  hamel nodded and passing through the white gates made his way by a raised cattle track towards the sea on either side of him flowed a narrow dike filled with saltwater beyond stretched the flat marshland its mossy turf leavened with cracks and creeks of all widths filled also with seaslime and seawater a slight grey mist rested upon the more distant parts of the wilderness which he was crossing a mist which seemed to be blown in from the sea in little puffs resting for a time upon the earth and then drifting up and fading away like soap bubbles  more than once where the dikes had overflown he was compelled to change his course but he arrived at last at the little ridge of pebbled beach bordering the sea straight ahead of him now was that strangelooking building towards which he had all the time been directing his footsteps as he approached it his forehead slightly contracted there was ample confirmation before him of the truth of his fellowpassengers words the place left to itself for so many years without any attention from its actual owner was neither deserted nor in ruins its solid grey stone walls were seastained and a trifle worn but the arched wooden doors leading into the lifeboat shelter which occupied one side of the building had been newly painted and in the front the window was hung with a curtain now closely drawn of some dark red material the lock from the door had been removed altogether and in its place was the aperture for a yale latchkey the last note of modernity was supplied by the telephone wire attached to the roof of the lifeboat shelter he walked all round the building seeking in vain for some other means of ingress then he stood for a few moments in front of the curtained window he was a man of somewhat determined disposition and he found himself vaguely irritated by the liberties which had been taken with his property he hammered gently upon the framework with his fist and the windows opened readily inwards pushing back the curtain with them he drew himself up on to the sill and squeezing himself through the opening landed on his feet and looked around him a little breathless  he found himself in a simply furnished mans sittingroom an easel was standing close to the window there were reams of drawing paper and several unfinished sketches leaning against the wall there was a small oak table in the middle of the room against the wall stood an exquisite chiffonier on which were resting some cutglass decanters and goblets there was a turkey carpet upon the floor which matched the curtains but to his surprise there was not a single chair of any sort to be seen the walls had been distempered and were hung with one or two engravings which although he was no judge he was quite sure were good he wandered into the back room where he found a stove a teaservice upon a deal table and several other cooking utensils all spotlessly clean and of the most expensive description the walls here were plainly whitewashed and the floor was of hard stone he then tried the door on the left which led into the larger portion of the buildingthe shed in which the lifeboat had once been kept not only was the door locked but he saw at once that the lock was modern and the door itself was secured with heavy iron clamps he returned to the sittingroom  the girl with the grey eyes was right enough he remarked to himself mr fentolin has been making himself very much at home with my property  he withdrew the curtains noticing to his surprise the heavy shutters which their folds had partly concealed then he made his way out along the passage to the front door which from the inside he was able to open easily enough leaving it carefully ajar he went out with the intention of making an examination of the outside of the place instead however he paused at the corner of the building with his face turned landwards exactly fronting him now about threequarters of a mile away on the summit of that strange hill which stood out like a gigantic rock in the wilderness was st davids hall he looked at it steadily and with increasing admiration its long red brick front with its masses of clustering chimneys a little bare and weatherbeaten impressed him with a sense of dignity due as much to the purity of its architecture as the singularity of its situation behinda wonderfully effective backgroundwere the steep gardens from which even in this uncertain light he caught faint glimpses of colouring subdued from brilliancy by the twilight these were encircled by a brick wall of great height the whole of the southern portion of which was enclosed with glass from the fragment of rock upon which he had seated himself to the raised stone terrace in front of the house was an absolutely straight path beautifully kept like an avenue with white posts on either side and built up to a considerable height above the broad tidal way which ran for some distance by its side it had almost the appearance of a racing track and its state of preservation in the midst of the wilderness was little short of remarkable  this hamel said to himself as he slowly produced a pipe from his pocket and began to fill it with tobacco from a battered silver box is a queer fix looks rather like the inn for me  and who might you be gentleman  he turned abruptly around towards his unseen questioner a woman was standing by the side of the rock upon which he was sitting a woman from the village apparently who must have come with noiseless footsteps along the sandy way she was dressed in rusty black and in place of a hat she wore a black woolen scarf tied around her head and underneath her chin her face was lined her hair of a deep brown plentifully besprinkled with grey she had a curious habit of moving her lips even when she was not speaking she stood there smiling at him but there was something about that smile and about her look which puzzled him  i am just a visitor he replied who are you  she shook her head  i saw you come out of the tower she said speaking with a strong local accent and yet with a certain unusual correctness in at the window and out of the door youre a brave man  why brave he asked  she turned her head very slowly towards st davids hall a gleam of sunshine had caught one of the windows which shone like fire she pointed toward it with her head  hes looking at you she muttered he dont like strangers poking around here that i can tell you  and who is he hamel enquired  squire fentolin she answered dropping her voice a little hes a very kindhearted gentleman squire fentolin but he dont like strangers hanging around  well i am not exactly a stranger you see hamel remarked my father used to stay for months at a time in that little shanty there and paint pictures its a good many years ago  i mind him the woman said slowly his name was hamel  i am his son hamel announced  she pointed to the hall does he know that you are here  hamel shook his head not yet i have been abroad for so long  she suddenly relapsed into her curious habit her lips moved but no words came she had turned her head a little and was facing the sea  tell me hamel asked gently why do you come out here alone so far from the village  she pointed with her finger to where the waves were breaking in a thin line of white about fifty yards from the beach  its the cemetery that she said the village cemetery you know i have three buried there george the eldest james the middle one and david the youngest three of themthats why i come i cant put flowers on their graves but i can sit and watch and look through the sea down among the rocks where their bodies are and wonder  hamel looked at her curiously her voice had grown lower and lower  its what you land folks dont believe perhaps she went on but its true its only us who live near the sea who understand it i am not an ignorant body either i was schoolmistress here before i married david cox they thought id done wrong to marry a fisherman but i bore him brave sons and i lived the life a woman craves for no i am not ignorant i have fancies perhapsthe lord be praised for themand i tell you its true you look at a spot in the sea and you see nothinga gleam of blue a fleck of white foam one day a gleam of green with a black line another and a grey little sob the next perhaps but you go on looking you look day by day and hour by hour and the chasms of the sea will open and their voices will come to you listen  she clutched his arm  couldnt you hear that she half whispered  the light it was davids voice the light hamel was speechless the womans face was suddenly strangely transformed her mood however swiftly changed she turned once more towards the hall  youll know him soon she went on the kindest man in these parts they say its not much that he gives away but hes a kind heart you see that great post at the entrance to the river there she went on pointing to it he had that set up and a lamp hung from there fentolins light they call it it was to save mens lives it was burning they say the night i lost my lads fentolins light  they were wrecked he asked her gently  wrecked she answered bad steering it must have been james would steer and they say that he drank a bit bad steering yes youll meet squire fentolin before long hes queer to look ata small body but a great kind heart a miserable life his but it will be made up to him it will be made up to him  she turned away her lips were moving all the time she walked about a dozen steps and then she returned  youre hamels son the painter she said youll be welcome down here hell have you to stay at the halla brave place dont let him be too kind to you sometimes kindness hurts  she passed on walking with a curious shambling gait and soon she disappeared on her way to the village hamel watched her for a moment and then turned his head towards st davids hall he felt somehow that her abrupt departure was due to something which she had seen in that direction he rose to his feet his instinct had been a true one    chapter xii  from where hamel stood a queer object came strangely into sight below the terrace of st davids hallfrom a spot in fact at the base of the solid wallit seemed as though a gate had been opened and there came towards him what he at first took to be a tricycle as it came nearer it presented even a weirder appearance mr fentolin in a black cape and black skull cap sat a little forward in his electric carriage with his hand upon the guiding lever his head came scarcely above the back of the little vehicle his hands and body were motionless he seemed to be progressing without the slightest effort personal or mechanical as though he rode in deed in some ghostly vehicle from the same place in the wall had issued a moment or two later a man upon a bicycle who was also coming towards him hamel was scarcely conscious of this secondary figure his eyes were fixed upon the strange personage now rapidly approaching him there was something which seemed scarcely human in that shrunken fragment of body the pale face with its waving white hair the strange expression with which he was being regarded the little vehicle came to a standstill only a few feet away mr fentolin leaned forward his features had lost their delicately benevolent aspect his words were minatory  i am under the impression sir he said that i saw you with my glasses from the window attempting to force an entrance into that building  hamel nodded  i not only tried but i succeeded he remarked i got in through the window  mr fentolins eyes glittered for a moment hamel who had resumed his place upon the rock close at hand had been mixed up during his lifetime in many wild escapades yet at that moment he had a sudden feeling that there were dangers in life which as yet he had not faced  may i ask for your explanation or your excuse  you can call it an explanation or an excuse whichever you like hamel replied steadily but the fact is that this little building which some one else seems to have appropriated is mine if i had not been a goodnatured person i should be engaged at the present moment in turning out its furniture on to the beach  what is your name mr fentolin asked suddenly  my name is hamelrichard hamel  for several moments there was silence mr fentolin was still leaning forward in his strange little vehicle the colour seemed to have left even his lips the hard glitter in his eyes had given place to an expression almost like fear he looked at richard hamel as though he were some strange seamonster come up from underneath the sands  richard hamel he repeated do you mean that you are the son of hamel the ra who used to be in these parts so often he was my brothers friend  i am his son  but his son was killed in the san francisco earthquake i saw his name in all the lists it was copied into the local papers here  hamel knocked the ashes from his pipe  i take a lot of killing he observed i was in that earthquake right enough and in the hospital afterwards but it was a man named hamel of philadelphia who died  mr fentolin sat quite motionless for several moments he seemed if possible to have shrunken into something smaller still a few yards behind meekins had alighted from his bicycle and was standing waiting  so you are richard hamel mr fentolin said at last very softly welcome back to england richard hamel i knew your father slightly although we were never very friendly  he stretched out his hand from underneath the coverlet of his little vehiclea hand with long white fingers slim and white and shapely as a womans a single ring with a dull green stone was on his fourth finger hamel shook hands with him as he would have shaken hands with a woman afterwards he rubbed his fingers slowly together there was something about the touch which worried him  you have been making use of this little shanty havent you he asked bluntly  mr fentolin nodded he was apparently beginning to recover himself  you must remember he explained suavely that it was built by my grandfather and that we have had rights over the whole of the foreshore here from time immemorial i know quite well that my brother gave it to your fatheror rather he sold it to him for a nominal sum i must tell you that it was a most complicated transaction he had the greatest difficulty in getting any lawyer to draft the deed of sale there were so many ancient rights and privileges which it was impossible to deal with even now there are grave doubts as to the validity of the transaction when nothing was heard of you and we all concluded that you were dead i ventured to take back what i honestly believed to be my own owing he continued slowly to my unfortunate affliction i am obliged to depend for interest in my life upon various hobbies this little place queerly enough has become one of them i have furnished it in a way installed the telephone to the house connected it with my electric plant and i come down here when i want to be quite alone and paint i watch the seasuch a sea sometimes such storms such colour you notice that ridge of sand out yonder it forms a sort of natural breakwater even on the calmest day you can trace that white line of foam  it is a strange coast hamel admitted  mr fentolin pointed with his forefinger northwards  somewhere about there he indicated is the entrance to the tidal river which flows up to the village of st davids yonder you see  his finger traced its course until it came to a certain point near the beach where a tall black pillar stood surmounted by a globe  i have had a light fixed there for the benefit or the fishermen he said a light which i work from my own dynamo between where we are sitting now and thereonly a little way out to seais a jagged cluster of cruel rocks you can see them if you care to swim out in calm weather fishermen who tried to come in by night were often trapped there and in a rough sea drowned that is why i had that pillar of light built on stormy nights it shows the exact entrance to the water causeway  very kind of you indeed hamel remarked very benevolent  mr fentolin sighed  so few people have any real feeling for sailors he continued the fishermen around here are certainly rather a casual class do you know that there is scarcely one of them who can swim there isnt one of them who isnt too lazy to learn even the simplest stroke my brother used to saydear geraldthat it served them right if they were drowned i have never been able to feel like that mr hamel life is such a wonderful thing one night he went on dropping his voice and leaning a little forward in his carriageit was just before or was it just after i had fixed that lighti was down here one dark winter night there was a great north wind and a huge sea running it was as black as pitch but i heard a boat making for st davids causeway strike on those rocks just hidden in front there i heard those fishermen shriek as they went under i heard their shouts for help i heard their death cries very terrible mr hamel very terrible  hamel looked at the speaker curiously mr fentolin seemed absorbed in his subject he had spoken with relish as one who loves the things he speaks about quite unaccountably hamel found himself shivering  it was their mother mr fentolin continued leaning again a little forward in his chair their mother whom i saw pass along the beach just nowa widow too poor thing she comes here oftena morbid taste she spoke to you i think  she spoke to me strangely hamel admitted she gave me the impression of a woman whose brain had been turned with grief  too true mr fentolin sighed the poor creature i offered her a small pension but she would have none of it a superior woman in her way once filled now with queer fancies he went on eyeing hamel steadilythe very strangest fancies she spends her life prowling about here no one in the village even knows how she lives did she speak of me bytheby  she spoke of you as being a very kindhearted man  mr fentolin sighed  the poor creature well well let us revert to the object of your coming here do you really wish to occupy this little shanty mr hamel  that was my idea hamel confessed i only came back from mexico last month and i very soon got fed up with life in town i am going abroad again next year till then i am rather at a loose end my father was always very keen indeed about this place and very anxious that i should come and stay here for a little time so i made up my mind to run down ive got some things waiting at norwich i thought i might hire a woman to look after me and spend a few weeks here they tell me that the early spring is almost the best time for this coast  mr fentolin nodded slowly he moistened his lips for a moment one might have imagined that he was anxious  mr hamel he said softly you are quite right it is the best time to visit this coast but why make a hermit of yourself you are a family friend come and stay with us at the hall for as long as you like it will give me the utmost pleasure to welcome you there he went on earnestly and as for this little place of what use is it to you let me buy it from you you are a man of the world i can see you may be rich yet money has a definite value to me it has none that little place as it stands is probably worthsay a hundred pounds your father gave if i remember rightly a five pound note for it i will give you a thousand for it sooner than be disturbed  hamel frowned slightly  i could not possibly think he said of selling what was practically a gift to my father you are welcome to occupy the place during my absence in any way you wish on the other hand i do not think that i care to part with it altogether and i should really like to spend just a day or so here i am used to roughing it under all sorts of conditionsmuch more used to roughing it than i am to staying at country houses  mr fentolin leaned a little out of his carriage he reached the younger mans shoulder with his hand  ah mr hamel he pleaded dont make up your mind too suddenly am i a little spoilt i wonder well you see what sort of a creature i am i have to go through life as best i may and people are kind to me it is very seldom i am crossed it is quite astonishing how often people let me have my own way do not make up your mind too suddenly i have a niece and a nephew whom you must meet there are some treasures too at st davids hall look at it there isnt another house quite like it in england it is worth looking over  it is most impressive hamel agreed and wonderfully beautiful it seems odd he added with a laugh that you should care about this little shanty here with all the beautiful rooms you must have of your own  its naboths vineyard mr fentolin groaned now mr hamel you are going to be gracious arent you let us leave the question of your little habitation here alone for the present come back with me my niece shall give you some tea and you shall choose your room from forty you can sleep in a haunted chamber or a historical chamber in queen elizabeths room a victorian chamber or a louis quinze room all my people have spent their substance in furniture dont look at your bag clothes are unnecessary i can supply you with everything or if you prefer it i can send a fast car into norwich for your own things come and be my guest please  hamel hesitated he had not the slightest desire to go to st davids hall and though he strove to ignore it he was conscious of an aversion of which he was heartily ashamed for this strange fragment of humanity on the other hand his mission the actual mission which had brought him down to these parts could certainly best be served by an entree into the hall itselfand there was the girl whom he felt sure belonged there he had never for a moment been able to dismiss her from his thoughts her still cold face the delicate perfection of her clothes and figure the grey eyes which had rested upon his so curiously haunted him he was desperately anxious to see her again if he refused this invitation if he rejected mr fentolins proffered friendship it would be all the more difficult  you are really very kind he began hesitatingly  it is settled mr fentolin interrupted settled meekins you can ride back again i shall not paint today mr hamel you will walk by my side will you not i can run my little machine quite slowly you see i have an electric battery it needs charging often but i have a dynamo of my own you never saw a vehicle like this in all your travellings did you  hamel shook his head  an electrical bathchair mr fentolin continued practice has made me remarkably skilful in its manipulation you see i can steer to an inch  he was already turning around hamel rose to his feet  you are really very kind he said i should like to come up and see the hall at any rate but in the meantime as we are here could i just look over the inside of this little place i found the large shed where the lifeboat used to be kept locked up  mr fentolin was manoeuvring his carriage his back was towards hamel  by all means he declared we will go in together i have had the entrance widened so that i can ride straight into the sittingroom but wait  he paused suddenly he felt in all his pockets  dear me he exclaimed i find that i have left the keys we will come down a little later if you do not mind mr hamel or tomorrow perhaps you will not mind it is very careless of me but seeing you about the place and imagining that you were an intruder made me angry and i started off in a hurry now walk by my side up to the house please and talk to me it is so interesting for me to meet men he went on as they started along the straight path who do things in life who go to foreign countries meet strange people and have new experiences i have been a good many years like this you know  it is a great affliction hamel murmured sympathetically  in my youth i was an athlete mr fentolin continued i played cricket for the varsity and for my county i hunted too and shot i did all the things a man loves to do i might still shoot they tell me but my strength has ebbed away i am too weak to lift a gun too weak even to handle a fishingrod i have just a few hobbies in life which keep me alive are you a politician mr hamel  not in the least hamel replied i have been out of england too long to keep in touch with politics  naturally mr fentolin agreed it amuses me to follow the course of events i have a good many friends in london and abroad who are kind to me who keep me informed send me odd bits of information not available for every one and it amuses me to put these things together in my mind and to try and play the prophet i was in the foreign office once you know i take up my paper every morning and it is one of my chief interests to see how near my own speculations come to the truth just now for example there are strange things doing on the continent  in america hamel remarked they affect to look upon england as a doomed power  not altogether supine yet mr fentolin observed yet even this last generation has seen weakening we have lost so much selfreliance perhaps it is having these grownup children who we think can take care of uscanada and australia and the others however we will not talk of politics it bores you i can see we will try and find some other subject now tell me dont you think this is ingenious  they had reached the foot of the hill upon which the hall was situated in front of them underneath the terrace was a little iron gate held open now by meekins who had gone on ahead and dismounted from his bicycle  i have a subterranean way from here into the hall mr fentolin explained come with me you will only have to stoop a little and it may amuse you you need not be afraid there are electric lights every ten yards i turn them on with this switchsee  mr fentolin touched a button in the wall and the place was at once brilliantly illuminated a little row of lights from the ceiling and the walls stretched away as far as one could see they passed through the iron gates which shut behind them with a click stooping a little hamel was still able to walk by the side of the man in the chair they traversed about a hundred yards of subterranean way here and there a fungus hung down from the wall otherwise it was beautifully kept and dry by and by with a little turn they came to an incline and another iron gate held open for them by a footman mr fentolin sped up the last few feet into the great hail which seemed more imposing than ever by reason of this unexpected entrance hamel blinking a little stepped to his side  welcome mr fentolin cried gaily welcome my friend mr hamel to st davids hall     chapter xiii  during the next halfhour hamel was introduced to luxuries to which in a general way he was entirely unaccustomed one manservant was busy preparing his bath in a room leading out of his sleeping apartment while another brought him a choice of evening clothes and superintended his disrobing hamel always observant studied his surroundings with keen interest he found himself in a queerly mixed atmosphere of luxurious modernity and stately antiquity his fourposter the huge couch at the foot of his bed and all the furniture about the room was of the queen anne period the bathroom which communicated with his apartment was the latest triumph of the plumbers arta room with floor and walls of white tiles the bath itself a little sunken and twice the ordinary size he dispensed so far as he could with the services of the men and descended as soon as he was dressed into the hall meekins was waiting at the bottom of the stairs dressed now in somber black  mr fentolin will be glad if you will step into his room sir he announced leading the way  mr fentolin was seated in his chair reading the times in a corner of his library shaped blocks had been placed behind and in front of the wheels of his little vehicle to prevent it from moving a shaded readinglamp stood on the table by his side he did not at once look up and hamel glanced around with genuine admiration the shelves which lined the walls and the winged cases which protruded into the room were filled with books there was a large oak table with beautifully carved legs piled with all sorts of modern reviews and magazines a log fire was burning in the big oaken grate the perfume from a great bowl of lavender seemed to mingle curiously yet pleasantly with the half musty odour of the old leatherbound volumes the massive chimneypiece was of black oak and above it were carved the arms of the house of fentolin the walls were oakpanelled to the ceiling  refreshed i hope by your bath and change my dear visitor the head of the house remarked as he laid down his paper draw a chair up here and join me in a glass of vermouth you need not be afraid of it it comes to me from the maker as a special favour  hamel accepted a quaintlycut wineglass full of the amber liquid mr fentolin sipped his with the air of a connoisseur  this he continued is one of our informal days there is no one in the house save my sisterinlaw niece and nephew and a poor invalid gentleman who i am sorry to say is confined to his bed my sisterinlaw is also i regret to say indisposed she desired me to present her excuses to you and say how greatly she is looking forward to making your acquaintance during the next few days  hamel bowed  it is very kind of mrs fentolin he murmured  on these occasions mr fentolin continued we do not make use of a drawingroom my niece will come in here presently you are looking at my books i see are you by any chance a bibliophile i have a case of manuscripts here which might interest you  hamel shook his head  only in the abstract i fear he answered i have scarcely opened a serious book since i was at oxford  what was your year mr fentolin asked  fourteen years ago i left magdalen hamel replied i had made up my mind to be an engineer and i went over to the boston institute of technology  mr fentolin nodded appreciatively  a magnificent profession he murmured a healthy one too i should judge from your appearance you are a strong man mr hamel  i have had reason to be hamel rejoined during nearly the whole of the time i have been abroad i have been practically pioneering building railways in the far west with gangs of chinese and italians and hungarians and scarcely a foreman who isnt terrified of his job isnt exactly drawingroom work  you are going back there mr fentolin asked with interest  hamel shook his head  i have no plans he declared i have been fortunate enough or shall i some day say unfortunate enough i wonder to have inherited a large legacy  mr fentolin smiled  dont ever doubt your good fortune he said earnestly the longer i liveand in my limited way i do see a good deal of lifethe more i appreciate the fact that there isnt anything in this world that compares with the power of money i distrust a poor man he may mean to be honest but he is at all times subject to temptation ah here is my niece  mr fentolin turned towards the door hamel rose at once to his feet his surmise then had been correct she was coming towards them very quietly in her soft grey dinnergown her brown hair smoothly brushed back a pearl necklace around her long delicate neck she seemed to him a very exquisite embodiment of those memories which he had been carrying about throughout the afternoon  here mr hamel his host said is a member of my family who has been a deserter for a short time this is mr richard hamel esther my niece miss esther fentolin  she held out her hand with the faintest possible smile which might have been of greeting or recognition  i travelled for some distance in the train with mr hamel this afternoon i think she remarked  indeed mr fentolin exclaimed dear me that is very interestingvery interesting indeed mr hamel i am sure did not tell you of his destination  he watched them keenly hamel though he scarcely understood was quick to appreciate the possible significance of that tentative question  we did not exchange confidences he observed miss fentolin only changed into my carriage during the last few minutes of her journey besides he continued to tell you the truth my ideas as to my destination were a little hazy to come and look for some queer sort of building by the side of the sea which has been unoccupied for a dozen years or so scarcely seems a reasonable quest does it  scarcely indeed mr fentolin assented you may thank me mr hamel for the fact that the place is not in ruins my blatant trespassing has saved you from that at least after dinner we must talk further about the tower to tell you the truth i have grown accustomed to the use of the little place  the sound of the dinner gong boomed through the house a moment later gerald entered followed by a butler announcing dinner  the only remaining member of my family mr fentolin remarked indicating his nephew gerald you will be pleased i know to meet mr hamel mr hamel has been a great traveller long before you can remember his father used to paint wonderful pictures of this coast  gerald shook hands with his visitor his face for a moment lighted up he was looking pale though and singularly sullen and dejected  there are two of your fathers pictures in the modern side of the gallery upstairs he remarked a little diffidently they are great favourites with everybody here  they all went in to dinner together meekins who had appeared silently had glided unnoticed behind his masters chair and wheeled it across the hall  a partie carree tonight mr fentolin declared i have a resident doctor here a very delightful person who often dines with us but tonight i thought not five is an awkward number i want to get to know you better mr hamel and quickly i want you too to make friends with my niece and nephew mr hamels father he went on addressing the two latter and your father were great friends bytheby have i told you both exactly why mr hamel is a guest here tonightwhy he came to these parts at all no listen then he came to take possession of the tower the worst of it is that it belongs to him too his father bought it from your father more years ago than we should care to talk about i have really been a trespasser all this time  they took their places at a small round table in the middle of the diningroom the shaded lights thrown downwards upon the table seemed to leave most of the rest of the apartment in semidarkness the gloomy faces of the men and women whose pictures hung upon the walls were almost invisible the servants themselves standing a little outside the halo of light were like shadows passing swiftly and noiselessly back and forth at the far end of the room was an organ and to the left a little balcony built out as though for an orchestra hamel looked about him almost in wonderment there was something curiously impressive in the size of the apartment and its emptiness  a trespasser mr fentolin continued as he took up the menu and criticised it through his hornrimmed eyeglass that is what i have been without a doubt  but for your interest and consequent trespass hamel remarked i should probably have found the roof off and the whole place in ruins  instead of which you found the door locked against you mr fentolin pointed out well we shall see i might at any rate have lost the opportunity of entertaining you here this evening i am particularly glad to have an opportunity of making you known to my niece and nephew i think you will agree with me that here are two young people who are highly to be commended i cannot offer them a cheerful life here there is little society no gaiety no sort of excitement yet they never leave me they seem to have no other interest in life but to be always at my beck and call a case mr hamel of really touching devotion if anything could reconcile me to my miserable condition it would be the kindness and consideration of those by whom i am surrounded  hamel murmured a few words of cordial agreement yet he found himself in a sense embarrassed gerald was looking down upon his plate and his face was hidden esthers features had suddenly become stony and expressionless hamel felt instinctively that something was wrong  there are compensations mr fentolin continued with the air of one enjoying speech which find their way into even the gloomiest of lives as i lie on my back hour after hour i feel all the more conscious of this the world is a school of compensations mr hamel the intereststhe mental interests i meanof unfortunate people like myself come to possess in time a peculiar significance and to yield a peculiar pleasure i have hobbies mr hamel i frankly admit it without my hobbies i shudder to think what might become of me i might become a selfish cruel misanthropical person hobbies are indeed a great thing  the brother and sister sat still in stony silence hamel looking across the little table with its glittering load of cut glass and silver and scarlet flowers caught something in esthers eyes so rarely expressive of any emotion whatever which puzzled him he looked swiftly back at his host mr fentolins face at that moment was like a beautiful cameo his expression was one of gentle benevolence  let me be quite frank with you mr fentolin murmured my occupation of the tower is one of these hobbies i love to sit there within a few yards of the sea and watch the tide come in i catch something of the spirit i think which caught your father mr hamel and kept him a prisoner here in my small way i too paint while i am down there paint and dream these things may not appeal to you but you must remember that there are few things left to me in life and that those therefore which i can make use of are dear to me gerald you are silent tonight how is it that you say nothing  i am tired sir the boy answered quietly  mr fentolin nodded gravely  it is inexcusable of me he declared smoothly to have forgotten even for a moment my nephew mr hamel he went on had quite an exciting experience last nightor rather a series of experiences he was first of all in a railway accident and then for the sake of a poor fellow who was with him and who was badly hurt he motored back here in the grey hours of the morning and ran they tell me considerable risk of being drowned on the marshes a very wonderful and praiseworthy adventure i consider it i trust that our friend upstairs when he recovers will be properly grateful  gerald rose to his feet precipitately the service of dinner was almost concluded and he muttered something which sounded like an excuse mr fentolin however stretched out his hand and motioned him to resume his seat  my dear gerald he exclaimed reprovingly you would leave us so abruptly before your sister too what will mr hamel think of our country ways pray resume your seat  for a moment the boy stood quite still then he slowly subsided into his chair mr fentolin passed around a decanter of wine which had been placed upon the table by the butler the servants had now left the room  you must excuse my nephew if you please mr hamel he begged gerald has a boys curious aversion to praise in any form i am looking forward to hearing your verdict upon my port the collection of wine and pictures was a hobby of my grandfathers for which we his descendants can never be sufficiently grateful  hamel praised his wine as indeed he had every reason to but for a few moments the smooth conversation of his host fell upon deaf ears he looked from the boys face pale and wrinkled as though with some sort of suppressed pain to the girls still stony expression this was indeed a house of mysteries there was something here incomprehensible some thing about the relations of these three and their knowledge of one another utterly baffling it was the queerest household surely into which any stranger had ever been precipitated  the planting of trees and the laying down of port are two virtues in our ancestors which have never been properly appreciated mr fentolin continued let us at any rate free ourselves from the reproach of ingratitude so far as regards my grandfathergerald fentolinto whom i believe we are indebted for this wine we will drink  mr fentolin broke off in the middle of his sentence the august calm of the great house had been suddenly broken from upstairs came the tumult of raised voices the slamming of a door the falling of something heavy upon the floor mr fentolin listened with a grim change in his expression his smile had departed his lower lip was thrust out his eyebrows met he raised the little whistle which hung from his chain at that moment however the door was opened doctor sarson appeared  i am sorry to disturb you mr fentolin he said but our patient is becoming a little difficult the concussion has left him as i feared it might in a state of nervous excitability he insists upon an interview with you  mr fentolin backed his little chair from the table the doctor came over and laid his hand upon the handle  you will i am sure excuse me for a few moments mr hamel his host begged my niece and nephew will do their best to entertain you now sarson i am ready  mr fentolin glided across the dim empty spaces of the splendid apartment followed by the doctor a ghostly little procession it seemed the door was closed behind them for a few moments a curious silence ensued gerald remained tense and apparently suffering from some sort of suppressed emotion esther for the first time moved in her place she leaned towards hamel her lips were slowly parted her eyes sought the door as though in terror her voice although save for themselves there was no one else in the whole of that great apartment had sunk to the lowest of whispers  are you a brave man mr hamel she asked  he was staggered but he answered her promptly  i believe so  dont give up the towerjust yet that is whathe has brought you here for he wants you to give it up and go back dont  the earnestness of her words was unmistakable hamel felt the thrill of coming events  why not  dont ask me she begged only if you are brave if you have feeling for others keep the tower if it be for only a week hush  the door had been noiselessly opened the doctor appeared and advanced to the table with a grave little bow  mr fentolin he said has been kind enough to suggest that i take a glass of wine with you my presence is not needed upstairs mr hamel he added i am glad sir to make your acquaintance i have for a long time been a great admirer of your fathers work  he took his place at the head of the table and filling his glass bowed towards hamel once more gerald and his sister relapsed almost automatically into an indifferent and cultivated silence hamel found civility towards the newcomer difficult unconsciously his attitude became that of the other two he resented the intrusion he found himself regarding the advent of doctor sarson as possessing some secondary significance it was almost as though mr fentolin preferred not to leave him alone with his niece and nephew  nevertheless his voice when he spoke was clear and firm     chapter xiv  mr fentolin on leaving the diningroom steered his chair with great precision through the open wroughtiron doors of a small lift at the further end of the hall which doctor sarson who stepped in with him promptly directed to the second floor here they made their way to the room in which mr dunster was lying doctor sarson opened the door and looked in almost immediately he stood at one side out of sight of mr dunster and nodded to mr fentolin  if there is any trouble he whispered send for me i am better away for the present my presence only excites him  mr fentolin nodded  you are right he said go down into the diningroom i am not sure about that fellow hamel and gerald is in a queer temper stay with them see that they are not alone  the doctor silently withdrew and mr fentolin promptly glided past him into the room mr john p dunster in his night clothes was sitting on the side of the bed standing within a few feet of him watching him all the time with the subtle intentness of a cat watching a mouse stood meekins mr dunsters head was still bound although the bandage had slipped a little apparently in some struggle his face was chalklike and he was breathing quickly  so youve come at last he exclaimed a little truculently are you mr fentolin  mr fentolin gravely admitted his identity his eyes rested upon his guest with an air of tender interest his face was almost beautiful  you are the owner of this housei am underneath your roofis that so  this is certainly st davids hall mr fentolin replied it really appears as though your conclusions were correct  then will you tell me why i am kept a prisoner here  mr fentolins expression was for a moment clouded he seemed hurt  a prisoner he repeated softly my dear mr dunster you have surely forgotten the circumstances which procured for me the pleasure of this visit the condition in which you arrived hereonly after all a very few hours ago  the circumstances mr dunster declared drily are to me still inexplicable at liverpool street station i was accosted by a young man who informed me that his name was gerald fentolin and that he was on his way to the hague to play in a golf tournament his story seemed entirely probable and i permitted him a seat in the special train i had chartered for harwich there was an accident and i received this blow to my headonly a trifling affair after all i come to my senses to find myself here i do not know exactly what part of the world you call this but from the fact that i can see the sea from my window it must be some considerable distance from the scene of the accident i find that my dressingcase has been opened my pocketbook examined and i am apparently a prisoner i ask you mr fentolin for an explanation  mr fentolin smiled reassuringly  my dear sir he said my dear mr dunster i believe i may have the pleasure of calling youyour conclusions seem to me just a little melodramatic my nephewgerald fentolindid what i consider the natural thing under the circumstances you had been courteous to him and he repaid the obligation to the best of his ability the accident to your train happened in a dreary part of the country some thirty miles from here my nephew adopted a course which i think under the circumstances was the natural and hospitable one he brought you to his home there was no hospital or town of any importance nearer  very well mr dunster decided i will accept your version of the affair i will then up to this point acknowledge myself your debtor but will you tell me why my dressingcase has been opened my clothes removed and a pocketbook containing papers of great importance to me has been tampered with  my dear mr dunster his host repelled calmly you surely cannot imagine that you are among thieves your dressingcase was opened and the contents of your pocketbook inspected with a view to ascertaining your address or the names of some friends with whom we might communicate  am i to understand that they are to be restored to me then mr dunster demanded  without a doubt yes mr fentolin assured him you however are not fit for anything at the present moment but to return to your bed from which i understand you rose rather suddenly a few minutes ago  on the contrary mr dunster insisted i am feeling absolutely well enough to travel i have an appointment on the continent of great importance as you may judge by the fact that at liverpool street i chartered a special train i trust that nothing in my manner may have given you offence but i am anxious to get through with the business which brought me over to this side of the water i have sent for you to ask that my pocketbook dressingcase and clothes be at once restored to me and that i be provided with the means of continuing my journey without a moments further delay  mr fentolin shook his head very gently very regretfully but also firmly  mr dunster he pleaded do be reasonable think of all you have been through i can quite sympathise with you in your impatience but i am forced to tell you that the doctor who has been attending you since the moment you were brought into this house has absolutely forbidden anything of the sort  mr dunster seemed for a moment to struggle for composure  i am an american citizen he declared i am willing to listen to the advice of any physician but so long as i take the risk i am not bound to follow it  in the present case i decline to follow it i ask for facilities to leave this house at once  mr fentolin sighed  in your own interests he said calmly they will not be granted to you  mr dunster had spoken all the time like a man struggling to preserve his selfcontrol there were signs now that his will was ceasing to serve him his eyes flashed fire his voice was raised  will not be granted to me he repeated do you mean to say then that i am to be kept here against my will  mr fentolin made no immediate reply with the delicate fingers of his right hand he pushed back the hair from his forehead he looked at his questioner soothingly as one might look at a spoiled child  against my will mr dunster repeated raising his voice still higher mr fentolin if the truth must be told i have heard of you before and been warned against you i decline to accept any longer the hospitality of your roof i insist upon leaving it if you will not provide me with any means of doing so i will walk  he made a motion as though to rise from the bed meekins hand very gently closed upon his arm one could judge that the grip was like a grip of iron  dear me mr fentolin said this is really very unreasonable of you if you have heard of me mr dunster you ought to understand that notwithstanding my unfortunate physical trouble i am a person of consequence and position in this county i am a magistrate exhigh sheriff and a great landowner here i think i may say without boasting that i represent one of the most ancient families in this country why therefore should you treat me as though it were to my interest to inveigle you under my roof and keep you there for some guilty purpose cannot you understand that it is for your own good i hesitate to part with you  i understand nothing of the sort mr dunster exclaimed angrily let us bring this nonsense to an end i want my clothes and if you wont lend me a car or a trap ill walk to the nearest railway station  mr fentolin shook his head  i am quite sure he said that you are not in a position to travel even in the diningroom just now i heard a disturbance for which i was told that you were responsible  i simply insisted upon having my clothes mr dunster explained your servant refused to fetch them perhaps i lost my temper if so i am sorry i am not used to being thwarted  a few days rest mr fentolin began  a few days rest be hanged mr dunster interrupted fiercely listen mr fentolin he added with the air of one making a last effort to preserve his temper the mission with which i am charged is one of greater importance than you can imagine so much depends upon it that my own life if that is in danger would be a mere trifle in comparison with the issues involved if i am not allowed to continue upon my journey at once the consequences may be more serious than i can tell you to you and yours to your own country therei am telling you a great deal but i want you to understand that i am in earnest i have a mission which i must perform and which i must perform quickly  you are very mysterious mr fentolin murmured  i will leave nothing to chance mr dunster continued send this man who seems to have constituted himself my jailer out of earshot and i will tell you even more  mr fentolin turned to meekins  you can leave the room for a moment he ordered wait upon the threshold  meekins very unwillingly turned to obey  you will excuse me sir he objected doubtfully but i am not at all sure that he is safe  mr fentolin smiled faintly  you need have no fear meekins he declared i am quite sure that you are mistaken i think that mr dunster is incapable of any act of violence towards a person in my unfortunate position i am willing to trust myself with himperfectly willing meekins  meekins with ponderous footsteps left the room and closed the door behind him mr fentolin leaned a little forward in his chair it seemed as though he were on springs the fingers of his right hand had disappeared in the pocket of his black velvet dinnercoat he was certainly prepared for all emergencies  now mr dunster he said softly you can speak to me without reserve  mr dunster dropped his voice his tone became one of fierce eagerness  look here he exclaimed i dont think you ought to force me to give myself away like this but after all you are an englishman with a stake in your country and i presume you dont want her to take a back seat for the next few generations listen here its to save your country that i want to get to the hague without a seconds delay i tell you that if i dont get there if the message i convey doesnt reach its destination you may find an agreement signed between certain powers which will mean the greatest diplomatic humiliation which great britain has ever known aye and more than that mr dunster continued it may be that the bogey youve been setting before yourself for all these years may trot out into life and you may find st davids hall a barrack for german soldiers before many months have passed  mr fentolin shook his head in gentle disbelief  you are speaking to one he declared who knows more of the political situation than you imagine in my younger days i was in the foreign office since my unfortunate accident i have preserved the keenest interest in politics i tell you frankly that i do not believe you as the powers are grouped at present i do not believe in the possibility of a successful invasion of this country  perhaps not mr dunster replied eagerly but the grouping of the powers as it has existed during the last few years is on the eve of a great change i cannot take you wholly into my confidence i can only give you my word of honour as a friend to your country that the message i carry is her only salvation having told you as much as that i do not think i am asking too much if i ask you for my clothes and dressingcase and for the fastest motorcar you can furnish me with i guess i can get from here to yarmouth and from there i can charter something which will take me to the other side  mr fentolin raised the little gold whistle to his lips and blew it very softly meekins at once entered closing the door behind him he moved silently to the side of the man who had risen now from the bed and who was standing with his hand grasping the post and his eyes fixed upon mr fentolin as though awaiting his answer  our conversation the latter said calmly has reached a point mr dunster at which i think we may leave it for the moment you have told me some very surprising things i perceive that you are a more interesting visitor even than i had thought  he raised his left hand and meekins who seemed to have been waiting for some signal of the sort suddenly with a movement of his knee and right arm flung dunster hack upon the bed the man opened his mouth to shout but already with lightninglike dexterity his assailant had inserted a gag between his teeth treating his struggles as the struggles of a baby meekins next proceeded to secure his wrists with handcuffs he then held his feet together while he quietly wound a coil of cord around them mr fentolin watched the proceedings from his chair with an air of pleased and critical interest  very well done meekinsvery neatly done indeed he exclaimed as i was saying mr dunster he continued turning his chair our conversation has reached a point at which i think we may safely leave it for a time we will discuss these matters again your pretext of a political mission is of course an absurd one but fortunately you have fallen into good hands take good care of mr dunster meekins i can see that he is a very important personage we must be careful not to lose sight of him  mr fentolin steered his chair to the door opened it and passed out on the landing he blew his whistle the lift almost immediately ascended a moment or two later he glided into the diningroom the three men were still seated around the table a decanter of wine almost empty was before doctor sarson whose pallid cheeks however were as yet unflushed  at last my dear guest mr fentolin exclaimed turning to hamel i am able to return to you if you will drink no more wine let us have our coffee in the library you and i i want to talk to you about the tower     chapter xv  mr fentolin led the way to a delightful little corner of his library where before the open grate recently piled with hissing logs an easy chair had been drawn he wheeled himself up to the other side of the hearthrug and leaned back with a little air of exhaustion the butler who seemed to have appeared unsummoned from somewhere among the shadows served coffee and poured some old brandy into large and wonderfully thin glasses  why my house should be turned into an asylum to gratify the hospitable instincts of my young nephew i cannot imagine mr fentolin grumbled a most extraordinary person our visitor i can assure you quite violent too he was at first  have you had any outside advice about his condition hamel inquired  mr fentolin glanced across those few feet of space and looked at hamel with swift suspicion  why should i he asked doctor sarson is fully qualified and the case seems to present no unusual characteristics  hamel sipped his brandy thoughtfully  i dont know why i suggested it he admitted i only thought that an outside doctor might help you to get rid of the fellow  mr fentolin shrugged his shoulders  after all he said the matter is of no real consequence doctor sarson assures me that we shall be able to send him on his way very shortly in the meantime mr hamel what about the tower  what about it hamel asked selecting a cigar from the box which had been pushed to his side i am sure i havent any wish to inconvenience you  i will be quite frank mr fentolin declared i do not dispute your right for a moment on the other hand my few hours daily down there have become a habit with me i do not wish to give them up stay here with us mr hamel you will be doing us a great kindness my nephew and niece have too little congenial society make up your mind to give us a fortnight of your time and i can assure you that we will do our best to make yours a pleasant stay  hamel was a little taken aback  mr fentolin he said i couldnt think of accepting your hospitality to such an extent my idea in coming here was simply to fulfil an old promise to my father and to rough it at the tower for a week or so and when that was over i dont suppose i should ever be likely to come back again you had better let me carry out that plan and afterwards the place shall be entirely at your disposal  you dont quite understand mr fentolin persisted a little irritably i sit there every morning i want for instance to be there tomorrow morning and the next morning and the morning afterwards to finish a little seascape i have commenced nowhere else will do call it a whim or what you will i have begun the picture and i want to finish it  well you can sit there all right hamel assured him i shall be out playing golf or fishing i shall do nothing but sleep there  and very uncomfortable you will be mr fentolin pointed out you have no servant i understand and there is no one in the village fit to look after you think of my thirtynine empty rooms my books here my gardens my motorcars my young people entirely at your service you can have a suite to yourself you can disappear when you like to all effects and purposes you will be the master of st davids hall be reasonable dont you think now that you can spend a fortnight more pleasantly under such circumstances than by playing the misanthrope down at the tower  please dont think hamel begged that i dont appreciate your hospitality i should feel uncomfortable however if i paid you a visit of the length you have suggested come i dont see he added why my occupation of the tower should interfere with you i should be away from it by about nine or ten oclock every morning i should probably only sleep there cant you accept the use of it all the rest of the time i can assure you that you will be welcome to come and go as though it were entirely your own  mr fentolin had lit a cigarette and was watching the blue smoke curl upwards to the ceiling  youre an obstinate man mr hamel he sighed but i suppose you must have your own way bytheby you would only need to use the upstairs room and the sittingroom you will not need the outhouserather more than an outhouse though isnt it i mean the shed which leads out from the kitchen where the lifeboat used to be kept  i dont think i shall need that hamel admitted a little hesitatingly  to tell you the truth mr fentolin continued among my other hobbies i have done a little inventing i work sometimes at a model there it is foolish perhaps but i wish no one to see it do you mind if i keep the keys of the place  not in the least hamel replied tell me what direction do your inventions take mr fentolin  before you go mr fentolin promised i will show you my little model at work until then we will not talk of it now come be frank with me shall we exchange ideas for a little time will you talk of books they are my daily friends i have thousands of them beloved companions on every side or will you talk of politics or travel or would you rather be frivolous with my niece and nephew that i think is esther playing  to be quite frank hamel declared bluntly i should like to talk to your niece  mr fentolin smiled as though amused his amusement however was perfectly goodnatured  if you will open this door he said you will see another one exactly opposite to you that is the drawingroom you will find esther there before you go will you pass me the quarterly review thank you  hamel crossed the hail opened the door of the room to which he had been directed and made his way towards the piano esther was there playing softly to herself with eyes half closed he came and stood by her side and she stopped abruptly her eyes questioned him then her fingers stole once more over the keys more softly still  i have just left your uncle hamel said he told me that i might come in here  yes she murmured  he was very hospitable hamel continued he wanted me to remain here as a guest and not go to the tower at all  and you  i am going to the tower he said i am going there tomorrow or the day after  the music swelled beneath her fingers  for how long  for a week or so i am just giving your uncle time to clear out his belongings i am leaving him the outhouse  he asked you to leave him that she whispered  yes  you are not going in there at all  not at all  again she played a little more loudly for a few moments then the music died away once more  what reason did he give for keeping possession of that  another hobby hamel replied he is an inventor it seems he has the model of something there he would not tell me what  she shivered a little and her music drifted away she bent over the keys her face hidden from him  you will not go away just yet she asked softly you are going to stay for a few days at any rate  without a doubt he assured her i am altogether my own master  thank god she murmured  he leaned with his elbow against the top of the piano looking down at her since dinnertime she had fastened a large red rose in the front of her gown  do you know that this is all rather mysterious he said calmly  what is mysterious she demanded  the atmosphere of the place your uncles queer aversion to my having the tower your visitor upstairs who fights with the servants while we are at dinner your uncle himself whose will seems to be law not only to you but to your brother who must be of age i should think and who seems to have plenty of spirit  we live here both of us she told him he is our guardian  naturally hamel replied and yet it may have been my fancy of course but at dinnertime i seemed to get a queer impression  tell it me she insisted her fingers breaking suddenly into a livelier melody tell it me at once you were there all the time i could see you watching tell me what you thought  she had turned her head now and her eyes were fixed upon his they were large and soft capable he knew of infinite expression yet at that moment the light that shone from them was simply one of fear half curious half shrinking  my impression he said was that both of you disliked and feared mr fentolin yet for some reason or other that you were his abject slaves  her fingers seemed suddenly inspired with diabolical strength and energy strange chords crashed and broke beneath them she played some unfamiliar music with tense and fierce energy suddenly she paused and rose to her feet  come out on to the terrace she invited you are not afraid of cold  he followed her without a word she opened the french windows and they stepped out on to the long broad stone promenade the night was dark and there was little to be seen the light was burning at the entrance to the waterway a few lights were twinkling from the village the soft moaning of the sea was distinctly audible she moved to the edge of the palisading he followed her closely  you are right mr hamel she said i think that i am more afraid of him than any woman ever was of any man in this world  then why do you live here he protested you must have other relations to whom you could go and your brotherwhy doesnt he do somethinggo into one of the professions he could surely leave easily enough  i will tell you a secret she answered calmly perhaps it will help you to understand you know my uncles condition you know that it was the result of an accident  i have heard so he replied gravely  she clutched at his arm  come she said  side by side they walked the entire length of the terrace when they reached the corner they were met with a fierce gust of wind she battled along and he followed her they were looking inland now there were no lights visiblenothing but dark chaotic emptiness from somewhere below him he could hear the wind in the treetops  this way she directed be careful  they walked to the very edge of the palisading it was scarcely more than a couple of feet high she pointed downwards  can you see she whispered  by degrees his eyes faintly penetrated the darkness it was as though they were looking down a precipice the descent was perfectly sheer for nearly a hundred feet at the bottom were the pine trees  come here again in the morning she whispered you will see then i brought you here to show you the place it was here that the accident happened  what accident  mr fentolins she continued it was here that he went over he was picked up with both his legs broken they never thought that he would live  hamel shivered a little as his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness he saw more distinctly than ever the sheer fall the tops of the bending trees below  what a horrible thing he exclaimed  it was more horrible than you know she continued dropping her voice a little almost whispering in his ear i do not know why i tell you thisyou a strangerbut if i do not tell some one i think that the memory of it will drive me mad it was no accident at all mr fentolin was thrown over  by whom he asked  she clung to his arm for a moment  ah dont ask me she begged no one knows my uncle gave out as soon as he was conscious that it was an accident  that at any rate was fine of him hamel declared  she shivered  he was proud at least of our family name whatever credit he deserves for it he must have it was owing to that accident that we became his slaves nothing but thathis absolute slaves to wait upon him if he would hand and foot you see he has never been able to marry his life was of course ruined so the burden came to us we took it up little thinking what was in store for us five years ago we came here to live gerald wanted to go into the army i wanted to travel with my mother gerald has done all the work secretly but he has never been allowed to pass his examinations i have never left england except to spend two years at the strictest boardingschool in paris to which i was taken and fetched away by one of his creatures we live here with the shadow of this thing always with us we are his puppets if we hesitate to do his bidding he reminds us so far we have been his creatures body and soul whether it will go on i cannot sayoh i cannot say it is bad for us butthere is mother too he makes her life a perfect hell  a roar of wind came booming once more across the marshes bending the trees which grew so thickly beneath them and which ascended precipitately to the back of the house the french windows behind rattled she looked around nervously  i am afraid of him all the time she murmured he seems to overhear everythinghe or his creatures listen  they were silent for several moments he whispered in her ear so closely that through the darkness he could see the fire in her eyes  you are telling me half he said tell me everything who threw your uncle over the parapet  she stood by his side motionless and trembling  it was the passion of a moment she said at last speaking hoarsely i cannot tell you listen listen  there is no one near hamel assured her it is the wind which shakes the windows i wish that you would tell me everything i would like to be your friend believe me i have that desire really there are so many things which i do not understand that it is dull here for you of course is natural but there is something more than that you seem always to fear something your uncle is a selfish man naturally although to look at him he seems to have the disposition of an angel but beyond that is there anything of which you are afraid you seem all the time to live in fear  she suddenly clutched his hand there was nothing of affection in her touch and yet he felt a thrill of delight  there are strange things which happen here she whispered things which neither gerald nor i understand yet they terrify us i think that very soon the end will come neither of us can stand it very much longer we have no friends somehow or other he seems to manage to keep us always isolated  i shall not go away from here hamel said firmly at present mind i am not at all sure that living this solitary life as you do you have not become a little overnervous that you have not exaggerated the fear of some things to me your uncle seems merely quixotic and egregiously selfish however that may be i am going to remain she clutched once more at his arm her finger was upraised they listened together from somewhere behind them came the clear low wailing of a violin  it is mr fentolin she whispered please come in let us go in at once he only plays when he is excited i am afraid oh i am afraid that something is going to happen  she was already round the corner and on her way to the main terrace he followed her closely     chapter xvi  let us follow the example of all great golfers hamel said let us for this morning at any rate imagine that your whole world is encompassed within these eighteen holes we have been sent here in a moment of good humour by your tyrant uncle the sun shines and the wind is from the west why not  that is all very well for you she retorted smiling but i have topped my drive  purely an incident he assured her the vicissitudes of the game do not enter into the question i have driven a ball far above my usual form but i am not gloating over it i prefer to remember only that i am going to spend the next two hours with you  she played her shot and they walked for a little way together she was suddenly silent  do you know she said finally just a little gravely i am not at all used to speeches of this sort  then you ought to be he declared nothing but the lonely life you have been living has kept you from hearing them continually  she laughed a little at the impotence of her rebuff and paused for a moment to make her next shot hamel standing a little on one side watched her appraisingly her short grey tweed skirt was obviously the handiwork of an accomplished tailor her grey stockings and suede shoes were immaculate and showed a care for her appearance which pleased him her swing too revealed a grace the grace of long arms and a supple body at which previously he had only guessed the sunshine seemed to have brought out a copper tinge from her abundant brown hair  do you know he remarked i think i am beginning to like your uncle great idea of his sending us off here directly after breakfast  her face darkened for a moment and he realised his error the same thought indeed had been in both their minds mr fentolins courteous suggestion had been offered to them almost in the shape of a command it was scarcely possible to escape from the reflection that he had desired to rid himself of their presence for the morning  of course he went on i knew that these links were goodquite famous arent they  i have played on so few others she told him i learned my golf here with king the professional  he took off his cap and handed it to his caddy he himself was beginning already to look younger the long blue waves came rippling up the creeks the salt wind soft with sunshine blew in their faces the marshes on the landward side were mauve with lavender blossom in the distance the redtiled cottages nestled deep among a background of green trees and rising fields  this indeed is a land of peace he declared if i hadnt to give you quite so many strokes i should be really enjoying myself  you dont play like a man who has been living abroad for a great many years she remarked tell me about some of the places you have visited  dont let us talk seriously he begged ill tell you of them but let it be later on this morning i feel that the spring air is getting into my head i have an absurd desire to talk nonsense  so far she admitted you havent been altogether unsuccessful  if you are alluding he replied to the personal remarks i was emboldened to make on my way here i can only say that they were excused by their truthfulness  i am not at all sure that you have known me long enough to tell me what colours suit me she demurred  then what will you say he enquired if i admire the angle of that quill in your hat  dont do it she laughed if you continue like this i may have to go home  you have sent the car away he reminded her cheerfully you would simply have to sit upon the balcony and reflect upon your wasted morning  i decline to talk upon the putting green she said it puts me off if you will stand perfectly quiet and say nothing i will play the like  they moved off presently to the next teeing ground  i dont believe this nonsense is good for our golf she said  it is immensely good for us as human beings he protested  they had played the ninth hole and turned for home on their right now was a shimmering stretch of wet sand and a thin line of sea in the distance the tide receding had left little islands of virgin sand grass tufted the home of countless seagulls a brownsailed fishing boat was racing for the narrow entrance to the tidal way  i am beginning to understand what there is about this coast which fascinated my father so he remarked  are you she answered gravely years ago i used to love it but not now  he tried to change the subject but the gloom had settled upon her face once more  you dont know what it is like she went on as they walked side by side after their balls to live day and night in fear with no one to talk tono one that is to say who is not under the same shadow even the voices of the wind and the sea and the screaming of the birds seem to bring always an evil message there is nothing kindly or hopeful even in the sunshine at night when the tide comes thundering in as it does so often at this time of the year one is afraid there is so much to make one afraid  she had turned pale again notwithstanding the sunshine and the freshening wind he laid his hand lightly upon her arm she suffered his touch without appearing to notice it  ah you mustnt talk like that he pleaded do you know what you make me feel like  she came back from the world of her own unhappy imaginings  really i forgot myself she declared with a little smile never mind it does one good sometimes one up are you henceforth then golfall the rigour of the game mind  he fell in with her mood and their conversation touched only upon the game on the last green he suffered defeat and acknowledged it with a little grimace  if i might say so miss fentolin he protested you are a little too good for your handicap i used to play a very reasonable scratch myself but i cant give you the strokes  she smiled  doubtless your long absence abroad she began slowly has affected your game  i was round in eightyone he grumbled  you must have travelled in many countries she continued where golf was an impossibility  naturally he admitted let us stay and have lunch and try again  she shook her head with a little sigh of regret  you see the car is waiting she pointed out we are expected home i shant be a minute putting my clubs away  they sped swiftly along the level road towards st davids hall far in the distance they saw it built upon that strange hill with the sunlight flashing in its windows he looked at it long and curiously  i think he said that yours is the most extraordinarily situated house i have ever seen fancy a gigantic mound like that in the midst of an absolutely flat marsh  she nodded  there is no other house quite like it in england she said i suppose it is really a wonderful place have you looked at the pictures  not carefully he told her  you must before you leave she insisted mr fentolin is a great judge and so was his father  their road curved a little to the sea and at its last bend they were close to the pebbly ridge on which the tower was built he touched the electric bell and stopped the car  do let us walk along and have a look at my queer possession once more he begged luncheon you told me is not till halfpast one and it is a quarter to now  she hesitated for a moment and then assented they left the car and walked along the little track bordered with white posts which led on to the ridge to their right was the village separated from them only by one level stretch of meadowland in the background the hall they turned along the raised dike just inside the pebbly beach and she showed her companion the narrow waterway up to the village at its entrance was a tall iron upright with a ladder attached and a great lamp at the top  that is to show them the way in at night isnt it he asked  she nodded  yes she told him mr fentolin had it placed there and yet she went on curiously enough since it was erected there have been more wrecks than ever  it doesnt seem a dangerous beach he remarked  she pointed to a spot about fifty yards from the tower it was the spot to which the woman whom he had met on the day of his arrival had pointed  you cant see them she said they are always out of sight even when the tide is at the lowestbut there are some hideous sunken rocks there the daggers they call them one or two fishing boats have been lost on them trying to make the village when mr fentolin put up the lamp every one thought that it would be quite safe to try and get in at night this winter though there have been three wrecks which no one could understand it must be something in the currents or a sort of optical illusion because in the last shipwreck one man was saved and he swore that at the time they struck the rock they were headed straight for the light  they had reached the tower now hamel became a little absorbed they walked around it and he tried the front door he found as he had expected that it opened readily he looked around him for several moments  your uncle has been here this morning he remarked quietly  very likely  that outhouse he continued must be quite a large place have you any idea what it is he works upon there  none she answered  he looked around him once more  mr fentolin has been preparing for my coming he observed i see that he has moved a few of his personal things  she made no reply only she shivered a little as she stepped back into the sunshine  i dont believe you like my little domicile he remarked as they started off homeward  i dont she admitted curtly  in the train he reminded her you seemed rather to discourage my coming here yet last night after dinner  i was wrong she interrupted i should have said nothing and yet i couldnt help it i dont suppose it will make any difference  make any difference to what   i cannot tell you she confessed only i have a strange antipathy to the place i dont like it my uncle sometimes shuts himself up here for quite a long time we have an idea gerald and i that things happen here sometimes which no one knows of when he comes back he is moody and illtempered or else half mad with excitement he isnt always the amiable creature whom you have met he has the face of an angel but there are times  well dont lets talk about him hamel begged as her voice faltered now that i am going to stay in the neighbourhood for a few days you must please remember that it is partly your responsibility you are not going to shut yourself up are you youll come and play golf again  if he will let me she promised  i think he will let you right enough hamel observed between you and me i rather think he hates having me down at the tower at all he will encourage anything that takes me away even as far as the golf club  they were approaching the hall now she was looking once more as she had looked last night she had lost her colour her walk was no longer buoyant she had the air of a prisoner who after a brief spell of liberty enters once more the place of his confinement gerald came out to meet them as they climbed the stone steps which led on to the terrace he glanced behind as he greeted them and then almost stealthily took a telegram from his pocket  this came for you he remarked handing it to hamel i met the boy bringing it out of the office  hamel tore it open with a word of thanks gerald stood in front of him as he read  if you wouldnt mind putting it away at once he asked a little uncomfortably you see the telegraph office is in the place and my uncle has a queer rule that every telegram is brought to him before it is delivered  hamel did not speak for a moment he was looking at the few words scrawled across the pink sheet with a heavy black pencil     make every enquiry in your neighbourhood     for an american john p dunster entrusted     with message of great importance addressed to     von dusenberg the hague  is believed to     have been in railway accident near wymondham     and to have been taken from inn by young man     in motorcar  suggest that he is being     improperly detained  hamel crumpled up the telegram and thrust it into his pocket  bytheby he asked as they ascended the steps what did you say the name of this poor fellow was who is lying ill upstairs  gerald hesitated for a moment then he answered as though a species of recklessness had seized him  he called himself mr john p dunster     chapter xvii  mr fentolin having succeeded in getting rid of his niece and his somewhat embarrassing guest for at least two hours was seated in his study planning out a somewhat strenuous morning when his privacy was invaded by doctor sarson  our guest the latter announced in his usual cold and measured tones has sent me to request that you will favour him with an interview  mr fentolin laid his pen deliberately down  so soon he murmured very well sarson i am at his service say that i will come at once  mr fentolin lost no time in paying this suggested visit mr john p dunster shaved and clothed was seated in an easychair drawn up to the window of his room smoking what he was forced to confess was a very excellent cigar he turned his head as the door opened and mr fentolin waved his hand pleasantly  really he declared this is most agreeable i had an idea mr dunster that i should find you a reasonable person men of your eminence in their profession usually are  mr dunster looked at the speaker curiously  and what might my profession be mr fentolin he asked you seem to know a great deal about me  it is true mr fentolin admitted i do know a great deal  mr dunster knocked the ash from his cigar  well he said i have been the hearer of several important communications from my side of the atlantic to england and to the continent and i have always known that there was a certain amount of risk in the business once i had an exceedingly narrow shave he continued reminiscently but this is the first time i have ever been dead up against it and i dont mind confessing that youve fairly got me puzzled who the mischief are you mr fentolin and what are you interfering about  mr fentolin smiled queerly  i am what you see he replied i am one of those unfortunate human beings who by reason of their physical misfortunes are cut off from the world of actual life i have been compelled to seek distraction in strange quarters i have wealthgreat wealth i suppose i should say an inordinate curiosity a talent for intrigue as to the direction in which i carry on my intrigues or even as to the direct interests which i study that is a matter mr dunster upon which i shall not gratify your curiosity nor anybody elses but you see i am admitting freely that it does interest me to interfere in great affairs  but how on earth did you get to know about me mr dunster asked and my errand you couldnt possibly have got me here in an ordinary way it was an entire fluke  there you speak with some show of reason i have a nephew whom you have met who is devoted to me  mr gerald fentolin mr dunster remarked drily  precisely mr fentolin declared well i admit frankly the truth of what you say yourshall we say capture was by way of being a gigantic fluke my nephews instructions simply were to travel down by the train to harwich with you to endeavour to make your acquaintance to follow you on to your destination and if any chance to do so occurred to relieve you of your pocketbook that however i never ventured to expect what really happened was as you have yourself suggested almost in the nature of a miracle my nephew showed himself to be possessed of gifts which were a revelation to me he not only succeeded in travelling with you by the special train but after its wreck he was clever enough to bring you here instead of delivering you over to the mercies of a village doctor i really cannot find words to express my appreciation of my nephews conduct  i could mr dunster muttered very easily  mr fentolin sighed gently  perhaps our points of view might differ  we have spent a very agreeable few minutes in explanations mr dunster continued would it be asking too much if i now suggest that we remove the buttons from our foils  why not mr fentolin assented smoothly your first question to yourself under these circumstances would naturally be what does mr fentolin want with me i will answer that question for you all that i askit is really very littleis the word agreed upon  mr dunster held his cigar a little way off and looked steadfastly at his host for a moment so you have interpreted my cipher  mr fentolin spread out the palms of his hands in a delicate gesture  my dear mr dunster he said one of the simplest i think that was ever strung together i am somewhat of an authority upon ciphers  i gather mr dunster went on although his cigar was burning itself out that you have broken the seal of my dispatches  mr fentolin closed his eyes as though he had heard a discord  nothing so clumsy as that i hope he murmured gently i will not insult a person of your experience and intelligence by enumerating the various ways in which the seal of a dispatch may be liquefied it is quite true that i have read with much pleasure the letter which you are carrying from a certain group of very distinguished men to a certain person now in the hague the letter however is replaced in its envelope the seal is still there you need have no fears whatever concerning it all that i require is that one word from you  and if i give you that one word mr dunster asked  if you give it me as i think you will mr fentolin replied suavely i shall then telegraph to my agent or rather i should say to a dear friend of mine who lives at the hague and that single word will be cabled by him from the hague to new york  and in that case mr dunster enquired what would become of me  you would give us the great pleasure of your company here for a very brief visit mr fentolin answered we should i can assure you do our very best to entertain you  and the dispatch which i am carrying to the hague  would remain here with you  mr dunster knocked the ash from his cigar without being a man of great parts he was a shrewd person possessed of an abundant stock of common sense he applied himself for a few moments to a consideration of this affair without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion  come mr fentolin he said at last you must really forgive me but i cant see what youre driving at you are an englishman are you not  i am an englishman mr fentolin confessed or rather he added with ghastly humour i am half an englishman  you are i am sure mr dunster continued a person of intelligence a wellread person a person of perceptions surely you can see and appreciate the danger with which your country is threatened  with regard to political affairs mr fentolin admitted i consider myself unusually well postedin fact the study of the diplomatic methods of the various great powers is rather a hobby of mine  yet mr dunster persisted you do not wish this letter delivered to that little conference in the hague which you must be aware is now sitting practically to determine the fate of your nation  i do not wish mr fentolin replied i do not intend that that letter shall be delivered why do you worry about my point of view i may have a dozen reasons i may believe that it will be good for my country to suffer a little chastisement  or you may mr dunster suggested glancing keenly at his host be the paid agent of some foreign power  mr fentolin shook his head  my means he pointed out should place me above such suspicion my income i really believe is rather more than fifty thousand pounds a year i should not enter into these adventures which naturally are not entirely dissociated from a certain amount of risk for the purposes of financial gain  mr dunster was still mystified  granted that you do so from pure love of adventure he declared i still cannot see why you should range yourself on the side of your countrys enemies  in time mr fentolin observed even that may become clear to you at present welljust that word if you please  mr dunster shook his head  no he decided i do not think so i cannot make up my mind to tell you that word  mr fentolin gave no sign of annoyance or even disappointment he simply sighed his eyes were full of a gentle sympathy his face indicated a certain amount of concern  you distress me he declared perhaps it is my fault i have not made myself sufficiently clear the knowledge of that word is a necessity to me without it i cannot complete my plans without it i very much fear dear mr dunster that your sojourn among us may be longer than you have any idea of  mr dunster laughed a little derisively  weve passed those days he remarked ive done my best to enter into the humour of this situation but there are limits you cant keep prisoners in english country houses nowadays there are a dozen ways of communicating with the outside world and when thats once done it seems to me that the position of squire fentolin of st davids hall might be a little peculiar  mr fentolin smiled very slightly still very blandly  alas my stalwart friend i fear that you are by nature an optimist i am not a betting man but i am prepared to bet you a hundred pounds to one that you have made your last communication with the outside world until i say the word  mr dunster was obviously plentifully supplied with either courage or bravado for he only laughed  then you had better make up your mind at once mr fentolin how soon that word is to be spoken or you may lose your money he remarked  mr fentolin sat very quietly in his chair  you mean then he asked that you do not intend to humour me in this little matter  i do not intend mr dunster assured him to part with that word to you or to any one else in the the world when my message has been presented to the person to whom it has been addressed when my trust is discharged then and then only shall i send that cablegram that moment can only arrive at the end of my journey  mr fentolin leaned now a little forward in his chair his face was still smooth and expressionless but there was a queer sort of meaning in his words  the end of your journey he said grimly may be nearer than you think  if i am not heard of in the hague tomorrow at the latest mr dunster pointed out remember that before many more hours have passed i shall be searched for even to the far corners of the earth  let me assure you mr fentolin promised serenely that though your friends search for you up in the skies or down in the bowels of the earth they will not find you my hidingplaces are not as other peoples  mr dunster beat lightly with his square blunt forefinger upon the table which stood by his side  thats not the sort of talk i understand he declared curtly let us understand one another if we can what is to happen to me if i refuse to give you that word  mr fentolin held his hand in front of his eyes as though to shut out some unwelcome vision  dear me he exclaimed how unpleasant why should you force me to disclose my plans be content dear mr dunster with the knowledge of this one fact we cannot part with you i have thought it over from every point of view and i have come to that conclusion always presuming he went on that the knowledge of that little word of which we have spoken remains in its secret chamber of your memory  mr dunster smoked in silence for a few minutes  i am very comfortable here he remarked  you delight me mr fentolin murmured  your cook mr dunster continued has won my heartfelt appreciation your cigars and wines are fit for any nobleman perhaps after all this little rest is good for me  mr fentolin listened attentively  do not forget he said that there is always a limit fixed whether it be one day two days or three days  a limit to your complacence i presume  mr fentolin assented  obviously then mr dunster concluded you wish those who sent me to believe that my message has been delivered yet there i must confess that you puzzle me what i cannot see is to put it bluntly where you come in any one of the countries represented at this little conference would only be the gainers by the miscarriage of my message which is without doubt so far as they are concerned of a distasteful nature your own country alone could be the sufferer now what interest in the world then is there leftwhat interest in the world can you possibly representwhich can be the gainer by your present action  mr fentolins eyes grew suddenly a little brighter there was a light upon his face strange to witness  the power which is to be the gainer he said quietly is the power encompassed by these walls  he touched his chest his long slim fingers were folded upon it  when i meet a man whom i like he continued softly i take him into my confidence picture me if you will as a kind of puck havent you heard that with the decay of the body comes sometimes a malignant growth in the brain a calibanlike desire for evil to fall upon the world a desire to escape from the loneliness of suffering the isolation of black misery  mr john p dunster let his cigar burn out he looked steadfastly at this strange little figure whose chair had imperceptibly moved a little nearer to his  you know what the withholding of this message you carry may mean mr fentolin proceeded you come here bearing to europe the word of a great people a people whose voice is powerful enough even to still the gathering furies i have read your ciphered message it is what i feared it is my will minemiles fentolinsthat that message be not delivered  i wonder mr dunster muttered under his breath whether you are in earnest  in your heart mr fentolin told him you know that i am i can see the truth in your face now for the first time you begin to understand  to a certain extent mr dunster admitted where i am still in the dark however is why you should expect that i should become your confederate it is true that by holding me up and obstructing my message you may bring about the evil you seek but unless that word is cabled back to new york and my senders believe that my message has been delivered there can be no certainty what has been trusted to me as the safest means of transmission might in an emergency be committed to a cable  excellent reasoning fentolin agreed for the very reasons you name that word will be given  mr dunsters face was momentarily troubled there was something in the still cold emphasis of this mans voice which made him shiver  do you think mr fentolin went on that i spend a great fortune buying the secrets of the world that i live from day to day with the risk of ignominious detection always hovering about medo you think that i do this and am yet unprepared to run the final risks of life and death have you ever talked with a murderer mr dunster has curiosity ever taken you within the walls of sing sing have you sat within the cell of a doomed man and felt the thrill of his touch of his close presence well i will not ask you those questions i will simply tell you that you are talking to one now  mr dunster had forgotten his extinct cigar he found it difficult to remove his eyes from mr fentolins face he was half fascinated half stirred with a vague mysterious fear underneath these wild words ran always that hard note of truth  you seem to be in earnest he muttered  i am mr fentolin assured him quietly i have more than once been instrumental in bringing about the death of those who have crossed my purposes i plead guilty to the weakness of nero suffering and death are things of joy to me there  i am not sure mr dunster said slowly that i ought not to wring your neck  mr fentolin smiled his chair receded an inch or two there was never a time when his expression had seemed more seraphic  there is no emergency of that sort he remarked for which i am not prepared  his little revolver gleamed for a minute beneath his cuff he backed his chair slowly and with wonderful skill towards the door  we will fix the period of your probation mr dunster atsay twentyfour hours he decided please make yourself until then entirely at home my cook my cellar my cigar cabinets are at your disposal if some happy impulse he concluded should show you the only reasonable course by dinnertime it would give me the utmost pleasure to have you join us at that meal i can promise you a cheque beneath your plate which even you might think worth considering wine in your glass which kings might sigh for cigars by your side which even your mr pierpont morgan could not buy au revoir  the door opened and closed mr dunster sat staring into the open space like a man still a little dazed     chapter xviii  the beautiful but somewhat austere front of st davids hall seemed in a sense transformed as hamel and his companion climbed the worn grey steps which led on to the broad sweep of terrace evidently visitors had recently arrived a dark rather goodlooking woman with pleasant round face and a ceaseless flow of conversation was chattering away to mr fentolin by her side stood another woman who was a stranger to hamelthin still elegant with tired worn face and the shadow of something in her eyes which reminded him at once of esther she wore a large picture hat and carried a little pomeranian dog under her arm in the background an insignificantlooking man with grey sidewhiskers and spectacles was beaming upon everybody mr fentolin waved his hand and beckoned to hamel and esther as they somewhat hesitatingly approached  this is one of my fortunate mornings you see esther he exclaimed smiling lady saxthorpe has brought her husband over to lunch lady saxthorpe he added turning to the woman at his side let me present to you the son of one of the first men to realise the elusive beauty of our coast this is mr hamel son of peter hamel rathe countess of saxthorpe  lady saxthorpe who had been engaged in greeting esther held out her hand and smiled goodhumouredly at hamel  i know your fathers work quite well she declared and i dont wonder that you have made a pilgrimage here they tell me that he painted nineteen picturespictures of importance that is to say within this little area of ten miles do you paint mr hamel  not at all hamel answered  our friend hamel mr fentolin intervened woos other and sterner muses he fights nature in distant countries spans her gorges with iron bridges stems the fury of her rivers and carries to the boundary of the world that little twin line of metal which brings men like ants to the workheaps of the universe my dear florence he added suddenly turning to the woman at his other side for the moment i had forgotten you have not met our guest yet hamel this is my sisterinlaw mrs seymour fentolin  she held out her hand to him unnaturally thin and white covered with jewels again he saw something in her eyes which stirred him vaguely  it is so nice that you are able to spend a few days with us mr hamel she said quietly i am sorry that i have been too indisposed to make your acquaintance earlier  and mr fentolin continued you must know my young friend here too mr hamellord saxthorpe  the latter shook hands heartily with the young man  i knew your father quite well he announced queer thing he used to hang out for months at a time at that little shanty on the beach there hardest work in the world to get him away he came over to dine with us once or twice but we saw scarcely anything of him i hope his son will not prove so obdurate  you are very kind hamel murmured  mr hamel came into these parts to claim his fathers property mr fentolin said however i have persuaded him to spend a day or two up here before he transforms himself into a misanthrope what of his golf esther eh  mr hamel plays very well indeed the girl replied  your niece was too good for me hamel confessed  mr fentolin smiled  the politeness of this younger generation he remarked keeps the truth sometimes hidden from us i perceive that i shall not be told who won lady saxthorpe you are fortunate indeed in the morning you have chosen for your visit there is no sun in the world like an april sun and no corner of the earth where it shines with such effect as here look steadily to the eastward of that second dike and you will see the pink light upon the sands which baffled every one until our friend hamel came and caught it on his canvas  i do see it lady saxthorpe murmured what eyes you have mr fentolin what perception for colour  dear lady mr fentolin said i am one of those who benefit by the law of compensations on a morning like this i can spend hours merely feasting my eyes upon this prospect and i can find if not happiness the next best thing the world is full of beautiful places but the strange part of it is that beauty has countless phases and each phase differs in some subtle and unexplainable manner from all others look with me fixedly dear lady saxthorpe look indeed with more than your eyes look at that flush of wild lavender where it fades into the sands on one side and strikes the emerald green of that wet seamoss on the other look at the liquid blue of that tongue of sea which creeps along its bed through the yellow sands through the dark meadowland which creeps and oozes and widens till in an hours time it will have become a river look at my sand islands virgin from the foot of man the home of seagulls the islands of a day there may be other and more beautiful places there is none quite like this  i pity you no longer lady saxthorpe asserted fervently the eyes of the artist are a finer possession than the limbs of the athlete  the butler announced luncheon and they all trooped in hamel found himself next to lady saxthorpe  dear mr fentolin has been so kind she confided to him as they took their places i came in fear and trembling to ask for a very small cheque for my dear brothers diocese my brother is a colonial bishop you know can you imagine what mr fentolin has given me  hamel wondered politely lady saxthorpe continued with an air of triumph  a thousand pounds just fancy thata thousand pounds and some people say he is so difficult she went on dropping her voice mrs hungerford came all the way over from norwich to beg for the infirmary there and he gave her nothing  what was his excuse hamel asked  i think he told her that it was against his principles to give to hospitals lady saxthorpe replied he thinks that they should be supported out of the rates  some people have queer ideas of charity hamel remarked now i am afraid that if i had been mr fentolin i would have given the thousand pounds willingly to a hospital but not a penny to a mission  mr fentolin looked suddenly down the table he was some distance away but his hearing was wonderful  ah my dear hamel he said believe me missions are very wonderful things it is only from a very careful study of their results that i have brought myself to be a considerable supporter of those where i have some personal knowledge of the organisation hospitals on the other hand provide for the poor what they ought to be able to provide for themselves the one thing to avoid in the giving away of money is pauperisation what do you think florence  his sisterinlaw who was seated at the other end of the table looked across at him with a bright but stereotyped smile  i agree with you of course miles i always agree with you mr fentolin has the knack of being right about most things she continued turning to lord saxthorpe his judgment is really wonderful  wish we could get him to come and sit on the bench sometimes then lord saxthorpe remarked heartily our neighbours in this part of the world are not overburdened with brains bytheby he went on that reminds me you havent got such a thing as a mysterious invalid in the house have you  there was a moments rather curious silence mr fentolin was sitting like a carved figure with a glass of wine half raised to his lips gerald had broken off in the middle of a sentence and was staring at lord saxthorpe esther was sitting perfectly still her face grave and calm her eyes alone full of fear lord saxthorpe was not an observant man and he continued quite unconscious of the sensation which his question had aroused  sounds a silly thing to ask you doesnt it theyre all full of it at wells though i sat on the bench this morning and went into the policestation for a moment first seems theyve got a long dispatch from scotland yard about a missing man who is supposed to be in this part of the world he came down in a special train on tuesday nightthe night of the great floodand his train was wrecked at wymondham after that he was taken on by some one in a motorcar colonel renshaw wanted me to allude to the matter from the bench but it seemed to me that it was an affair entirely for the police  as though suddenly realising the unexpected interest which his words had caused lord saxthorpe brought his sentence to a conclusion and glanced enquiringly around the table  a man could scarcely disappear in a civilised neighbourhood like this mr fentolin remarked quietly but there is a certain amount of coincidence about your question may i ask whether it was altogether a haphazard one  absolutely lord saxthorpe declared the idea seems to be that the fellow was brought to one of the houses in the neighbourhood and we were all rather chaffing one another this morning about it inspector yardleythe stout fellow with the beard you knowwas just starting off in his dogcart to make enquiries round the neighbourhood if any one in fiction wants a type of the ridiculous detective there he is readymade  the coincidence of your question mr fentolin said smoothly is certainly a strange one the mysterious stranger is within our gates  lady saxthorpe who had been out of the conversation for far too long laid down her knife and fork  my dear mr fentolin she exclaimed my dear mrs fentolin this is really most exciting do tell us all about it at once i thought that the man was supposed to have been decoyed away in a motorcar do you know his name and all about him  there are a few minor points mr fentolin murmured such as his religious convictions and his size in boots which i could not swear about but so far as regards his name and his occupation i think i can gratify your curiosity he is a mr john p dunster and he appears to be the representative of an american firm of bankers on his way to germany to conclude a loan  god bless my soul lord saxthorpe exclaimed wonderingly the fellow is actually here under this roof but who brought him how did he find his way  better ask gerald mr fentolin replied he is the abductor it seems that they both missed the train from liverpool street and mr dunster invited gerald to travel down in his special train very kind of him but might have been very unlucky for gerald as you know they got smashed up at wymondham and gerald feeling in a way responsible for him brought him on here quite properly i think sarson has been looking after him but i am afraid he has slight concussion of the brain  i shall remember this all my life lord saxthorpe declared solemnly as one of the most singular coincidences which has ever come within my personal knowledge perhaps after lunch mr fentolin you will let some of your people telephone to the policestation at wells there really is an important enquiry respecting this man i should not be surprised he added dropping his voice a little for the benefit of the servants to find that scotland yard needed him on their own account  in that case mr fentolin remarked he is quite safe for sarson tells me there is no chance of his being able to travel at any rate for twentyfour hours  lady saxthorpe shivered  arent you afraid to have him in the house she asked a man who is really and actually wanted by scotland yard when one considers that nothing ever happens here except an occasional shipwreck in the winter and a flowershow in the summer it does sound positively thrilling i wonder what he has done  they discussed the subject of mr dunsters possible iniquities meanwhile a young man carrying his hat in his hand had slipped in past the servants and was leaning over mr fentolins chair he laid two or three sheets of paper upon the table and waited while his employer glanced them through and dismissed him with a little nod  my wireless has been busy this morning mr fentolin remarked we seem to have collected about forty messages from different battleships and cruisers there must be a whole squadron barely thirty miles out  you dont really think lady saxthorpe asked that there is any fear of war do you mr fentolin  he answered her with a certain amount of gravity who can tell the papers this morning were bad this conference at the hague is still unexplained frances attitude in the matter is especially mysterious  i am a strong supporter of lord roberts lord saxthorpe said and i believe in the vital necessity of some scheme for national service at the same time i find it hard to believe that a successful invasion of this country is within the bounds of possibility  i quite agree with you lord saxthorpe mr fentolin declared smoothly all the same this hague conference is a most mysterious affair the papers this morning are ominously silent about the fleet from the tangle of messages we have picked up i should say without a doubt that some form of mobilisation is going on in the north sea if lady saxthorpe thinks it warm enough shall we take our coffee upon the terrace  the terrace by all means her ladyship assented rising from her place what a wonderful man you are mr fentolin with your wireless telegraphy and your telegraph office in the house and telephones does it really amuse you to be so modern  to a certain extent yes mr fentolin sighed as he guided his chair along the hall when my misfortune first came i used to speculate a good deal upon the stock exchange that was really the reason i went in for all these modern appliances  and now she asked what use do you make of them now  mr fentolin smiled quietly he looked out seaward beyond the skyline from whence had come to him through the clouds that tangle of messages  i like to feel he said that the turning wheel of life is not altogether out of earshot i like to dabble just a little in the knowledge of these things  lord saxthorpe came strolling up to them  you wont forget to telephone about this guest of yours he asked fussily  it is already done mr fentolin assured him my dear sister why so silent  mrs fentolin turned slowly towards him she too had been standing with her eyes fixed upon the distant sealine her face seemed suddenly to have aged her forced vivacity to have departed her little pomeranian rubbed against her feet in vain yet at the sound of mr fentolins voice she seemed to come back to herself as though by magic  i was looking where you were looking she declared lightly just trying to see a little way beyond so silly isnt it chowchow you bad little dog come and you shall have your dinner  she strolled off humming a tune to herself lord saxthorpe watched her with a shadow upon his plain goodhumoured face  somehow or other he remarked quietly mrs fentolin never seems to have got over the loss of her husband does she how long is it since he died  eight years mr fentolin replied it was just six months after my own accident  i am losing a great deal of sympathy for you mr fentolin lady saxthorpe confessed coming over to his side you have so many resources there is so much in life which you can do you paint as we all know exquisitely they tell me that you play the violin like a master you have unlimited time for reading and they say that you are one of the greatest living authorities upon the politics of europe your morning paper must bring you so much that is interesting  it is true mr fentolin admitted that i have compensations which no one can guess at compensations which appeal to me more as time steals on and yet  he stopped short  and yet lady saxthorpe repeated interrogatively  mr fentolin was watching gerald drive golf balls from the lawn beneath he pointed downwards  i was like that when i was his age he said quietly     chapter xix  mr fentolin remained upon the terrace long after the departure of his guests he had found a sunny corner out of the wind and he sat there with a telescope by his side and a budget of newspapers upon his knee on some pretext or another he had detained all the others of the household so that they formed a little court around him even hamel who had said something about a walk had been induced to stop by an appealing glance from esther mr fentolin was in one of his most loquacious moods for some reason or other the visit of the saxthorpes seemed to have excited him he talked continually with the briefest pauses every now and then he gazed steadily across the marshes through his telescope  lord saxthorpe he remarked has i must confess greatly excited my curiosity as to the identity of our visitor such a harmlesslooking person he seems to be causing such a commotion gerald dont you feel your responsibility in the matter  yes sir i do gerald replied with unexpected grimness i feel my responsibility deeply  mr fentolin who was holding the telescope to his eye touched hamel on the shoulder  my young friend he said your eyes are better than mine you see the road there look along it between the white posts as far as you can what do you make of that black speck  hamel held the telescope to his eye and steadied it upon the little tripod stand  it looks like a horse and trap he announced good mr fentolin declared it seemed so to me but i was not sure my eyes are weak this afternoon how many people are in the trap  two hamel answered i can see them distinctly now one man is driving another is sitting by his side they are coming this way  mr fentolin blew his whistle meekins appeared almost directly his master whispered a word in his ear the man at once departed  let me make use of your eyes once more mr fentolin begged about these two men in the trap mr hamel is one of them by any chance wearing a uniform  they both are hamel replied the man who is driving is wearing a peaked hat he looks like a police inspector the man by his side is an ordinary policeman  mr fentolin sighed gently  it is very interesting he said let us hope that we shall not see an arrest under my roof i should feel it a reflection upon my hospitality i trust i sincerely trust that this visit does not bode any harm to mr john p dunster  gerald rose impatiently to his feet and swung across the terrace mr fentolin however called him back  gerald he advised better not go away the inspector may desire to ask you questions you will have nothing to conceal it was a natural and delightful impulse of yours to bring the man who had befriended you and who was your companion in that disaster straight to your own home for treatment and care it was an admirable impulse my boy you have nothing to be ashamed of  shall i tell him too gerald began  be careful gerald  mr fentolins words seemed to be charged with a swift rapierlike note the boy broke off in his speech he looked at hamel and was silent  dear me mrs fentolin murmured i am sure there is no need for us to talk about this poor man as though anybody had done anything wrong in having him here this i suppose must be the inspector yardley whom lord saxthorpe spoke of  a very intelligentlooking officer i am sure mr fentolin remarked gerald go and meet him if you please i should like to speak to him out here  the dogcart had drawn up at the front door and the inspector had already alighted gerald intervened as he was in the act of questioning the butler  mr fentolin would like to speak to you inspector he said if you will come this way  the inspector followed gerald and saluted the little group solemnly mr fentolin held out his hand  you got my telephone message inspector he asked  we have not received any message that i know of sir the inspector replied i have come over here in accordance with instructions received from headquartersin fact from scotland yard  quite so mr fentolin assented youve come over i presume to make enquiries concerning mr john p dunster  that is the name of the gentleman sir  i only understood today from my friend lord saxthorpe mr fentolin continued that mr dunster was being enquired about as though he had disappeared my nephew brought him here after the railway accident at wymondham since when he has been under the care of my own physician i trust that you have nothing serious against him  my first duty sir the inspector pronounced is to see the gentleman in question  by all means mr fentolin agreed gerald will you take the inspector up to mr dunsters rooms or stop i will go myself  mr fentolin started his chair and beckoned the inspector to follow him meekins who was waiting inside the hall escorted them by means of the lift to the second floor they made their way to mr dunsters room mr fentolin knocked softly at the door it was opened by the nurse  how is the patient mr fentolin enquired  doctor sarson appeared from the interior of the room  still unconscious he reported otherwise the symptoms are favourable he is quite unfit the doctor added looking steadily at the inspector to be removed or questioned  there is no idea of anything of the sort mr fentolin explained it is inspector yardleys duty to satisfy himself that mr dunster is here it is necessary for the inspector to see your patient so that he can make his report at headquarters  doctor sarson bowed  that is quite simple sir he said please step in  they all entered the room which was large and handsomely furnished through the open windows came a gentle current of fresh air mr dunster lay in the midst of all the luxury of fine linen sheets and embroidered pillowcases the inspector looked at him stolidly  is he asleep he asked  the doctor shook his head  it is the third day of his concussion he whispered he is still unconscious he will remain in the same condition for another two days after that he will begin to recover  mr fentolin touched the inspector on the arm  you see his clothing at the foot of the bed he pointed out his linen is marked with his name that is his dressingcase with his name painted on it  i am quite satisfied sir the inspector announced i will not intrude any further  they left the room mr fentolin himself escorted the inspector into the library and ordered whisky and cigars  i dont know whether i am unreasonably curious mr fentolin remarked but is it really true that you have had enquiries from scotland yard about the poor fellow upstairs  we had a very important enquiry indeed sir the inspector replied i have instructions to telegraph all i have been able to discover immediately  pardon my putting it plainly mr fentolin asked but is our friend a criminal  i wouldnt go so far as that sir the inspector answered i know of no charge against him i dont know that i have the right to say so much he added sipping his whisky and soda but putting two and two together i should rather come to the conclusion that he was a person of some political importance  not a criminal at all  not as i know of the inspector assented that isnt the way i read the enquiries at all  you relieve me mr fentolin declared now what about his possessions  theres a man coming down shortly from scotland yard the inspector announced a little gloomily my orders were to touch nothing but to locate him  well youve succeeded so far mr fentolin remarked here he is and here i think he will stay until some days after your friend from scotland yard can get here  it does seem so indeed the inspector agreed to me he looks terrible ill but theres one thing sure hes having all the care and attention thats possible and now sir ill not intrude further upon your time ill just make my report and youll probably have a visit from the scotland yard man sometime within the next few days  mr fentolin escorted the inspector to his dogcart shook hands with him and watched him drive off only mrs seymour fentolin remained upon the terrace he glided over to her side  my dear florence he asked where are the others  mr hamel and esther have gone for a walk she answered gerald has disappeared somewhere has anythingis everything all right  naturally mr fentolin replied easily all that the inspector desired was to see mr dunster he has seen him the poor fellow was unfortunately unconscious but our friend will at least be able to report that he was in good hands and well cared for  unconscious mrs fentolin repeated i thought that he was better  one is always subject to those slight relapses in an affair of concussion mr fentolin explained  mrs fentolin laid down her work and leaned a little towards her brotherinlaw her hand rested upon his her voice had fallen to a whisper  miles she said forgive me but are you sure that you are not getting a little out of your depth remember that there are some risks which are not worth while  quite true he answered and there are some risks my dear florence which are worth every drop of blood in a mans body and every breath of life the peace of europe turns upon that man upstairs it is worth taking a little risk for worth a little danger i have made my plans and i mean to carry them through tell me when i was upstairs this fellow hamelwas he talking confidentially to gerald  not particularly  i am not sure that i trust him mr fentolin continued he had a telegram yesterday from a man in the foreign office a telegram which i did not see he took the trouble to walk three miles to send the reply to it from another office  but after all mrs fentolin protested you know who he is you know that he is peter hamels son he had a definite purpose in coming here  mr fentolin nodded  quite true he admitted but for that mr hamel would have found a little trouble before now as it is he must be watched if any one comes between me and the things for which i am scheming today they will risk death  mrs fentolin sighed she was watching the figures of esther and hamel far away in the distance picking their way across the last strip of marshland which lay between them and the sea  miles she said earnestly you take advice from no one you will go your own way i know and yet it seems to me that life holds so many compensations for you without your taking these terrible risks i am not thinking of any one else i am not pleading to you for the sake of any one else i am thinking only of yourself i have had a sort of feeling ever since this man was brought into the house that trouble would come of it to me the trouble seems to be gathering even now  mr fentolin laughed softly a little contemptuously  presentiments he scoffed are the excuses of cowards dont be afraid florence remember always that i look ahead do you think that i could stay here contented with what you call my compensationsmy art the study of beautiful things the calm epicureanism of the sedate and simple life you know very well that i could not do that the craving for other things is in my heart and blood the excitement which i cannot have in one way i must find in another and i think that before many nights have passed i shall lie on my pillow and hear the guns roar hear the footsteps of the great armies of the world moving into battle it is for that i live florence  she took up her knitting again her eyes were fixed upon the skyline twice she opened her lips but twice no words came  you understand he whispered you begin to understand dont you  she looked at him only for a moment and back at her work  i suppose so she sighed     chapter xx  in the middle of that night hamel sat up in bed awakened with a sudden start by some sound only the faintest echo of which remained in his consciousness his nerves were tingling with a sense of excitement he sat up in bed and listened suddenly it came againa long low moan of pain stifled at the end as though repressed by some outside agency he leaped from his bed hurried on a few clothes and stepped out on to the landing the cry had seemed to him to come from the further end of the long corridorin the direction indeed of the room where mr dunster lay he made his way there walking on tiptoe although his feet fell noiselessly upon the thick carpet a single light was burning from a bracket in the wall insufficient to illuminate the empty spaces but enough to keep him from stumbling the corridor towards the south end gradually widened terminating in a splendid high window with stained glass a broad seat and a table on the right the end room was mr dunsters apartment and on the left a flight of stairs led to the floor above hamel stood quite still listening there was a light in the room as he could see from under the door but there was no sound of any one moving hamel listened intently every sense strained then the sound of a stair creaking behind diverted his attention he looked quickly around gerald was descending the boys face was white and his eyes were filled with fear hamel stepped softly back from the door and met him at the foot of the stairs  did you hear that cry he whispered  gerald nodded  it woke me up what do you suppose it was hamel shook his head  some one in pain he replied i dont understand it it came from this room  you know who sleeps there gerald asked hoarsely  hamel nodded  a man with concussion of the brain doesnt cry out like that besides did you hear the end of it it sounded as though some one were choking him hush  they had spoken only in bated breath but the door of the room before which they were standing was suddenly opened meekins stood there fully dressed his dark heavy face full of somber warning he started a little as he saw the two whispering together gerald addressed him almost apologetically  we both heard the same sound meekins is any one ill it sounded like some one in pain  the man hesitated then from behind his shoulder came mr fentolins still soft voice there was a little click and meekins as though obeying an unseen gesture stepped back mr fentolin glided on to the threshold he was still dressed he propelled his chair a few yards down the corridor and beckoned them to approach  i am so sorry he said softly that you should have been disturbed mr hamel we have been a little anxious about our mysterious guest doctor sarson fetched me an hour ago he discovered that it was necessary to perform a very slight operation merely the extraction of a splinter of wood it is all over now and i think that he will do very well  notwithstanding this very plausible explanation hamel was conscious of the remains of an uneasiness which he scarcely knew how to put into words  it was a most distressing cry he observed doubtfully a cry of fear as well as of pain  poor fellow mr fentolin remarked compassionately i am afraid that for a moment or two he must have suffered acutely doctor sarson is very clever however and there is no doubt that what he did was for the best his opinion is that by tomorrow morning there will be a marvellous change good night mr hamel i am quite sure that you will not be disturbed again  hamel neither felt nor showed any disposition to depart  mr fentolin he said i hope that you will not think that i am officious or in any way abusing your hospitality but i cannot help suggesting that as dr sarson is purely your household physician the relatives of this man dunster might be better satisfied if some second opinion were called in might i suggest that you telephone to norwich for a surgeon  mr fentolin showed no signs of displeasure he was silent for a moment as though considering the matter  i am not at all sure mr hamel that you are not right he admitted frankly i believe that the case is quite a simple one but on the other hand it would perhaps be more satisfactory to have an outside opinion if mr dunster is not conscious in the morning we will telephone to the norwich infirmary  i think it would be advisable hamel agreed  good night mr fentolin said once more i am sorry that your rest has been disturbed  hamel however still refused to take the hint his eyes were fixed upon that closed door  mr fentolin he asked have you any objection to my seeing mr dunster  there was a moments intense silence a sudden light had burned in mr fentolins eyes his fingers gripped the side of his chair yet when he spoke there were no signs of anger in his tone it was a marvellous effort of selfcontrol  there is no reason mr hamel he said why your curiosity should not be gratified knock softly at the door gerald  the boy obeyed in a moment or two doctor sarson appeared on the threshold  our guest mr hamel mr fentolin explained in a whisper has been awakened by this poor fellows cry he would like to see him for a moment  doctor sarson opened the door they all passed in on tiptoe the doctor led the way towards the bed upon which mr dunster was lying quite still his head was bandaged and his eyes closed his face was ghastly gerald gave vent to a little muttered exclamation mr fentolin turned to him quickly  gerald  the boy stood still trembling speechless mr fentolins eyes were riveted upon him the doctor was standing still and dark a motionless image  is he asleep hamel asked  he is under the influence of a mild anaesthetic doctor sarson explained he is doing very well his case is quite simple by tomorrow morning he will be able to sit up and walk about if he wishes to  hamel looked steadily at the figure upon the bed mr dunsters breathing was regular and his eyes were closed but his colour was ghastly  he doesnt look like getting up for a good many days to come hamel observed  the doctor led the way towards the door  the man has a fine constitution he said i feel sure that if you wish you will be able to talk to him tomorrow  they separated outside in the passage mr fentolin bade his guest a somewhat restrained good night and gerald mounted the staircase to his room hamel however had scarcely reached his door before gerald reappeared he had descended the staircase at the other end of the corridor he stood for a moment looking down the passage the doors were all closed even the light had been extinguished  may i come in for a moment please he whispered  hamel nodded  with pleasure come in and have a cigarette if you will i shant feel like sleep for some time  they entered the room and gerald threw himself into an easychair near the window hamel wheeled up another chair and produced a box of cigarettes  queer thing your dropping across that fellow in the way you did he remarked just shows how one may disappear from the world altogether and no one be a bit the wiser  the boy was sitting with folded arms his expression was one of deep gloom  i only wish id never brought him here he muttered i ought to have known better  hamel raised his eyebrows isnt he as well off here as anywhere else  do you think that he is gerald demanded looking across at hamel  there was a brief silence  we can scarcely do your uncle the injustice hamel remarked of imagining that he can possibly have any reason or any desire to deal with that man except as a guest  do you really believe that gerald asked  hamel rose to his feet  look here young man he said this is getting serious you and i are at crosspurposes if you like you shall have the truth from me  go on  i was warned about your uncle before i came down into this part of the world hamel continued quietly i was told that he is a dangerous conspirator a man who sticks at nothing to gain his ends a person altogether out of place in these days it sounds melodramatic but i had it straight from a friend since i have been here i have had a telegramyou brought it to me yourselfasking for information about this man dunster it was i who wired to london that he was here it was through me that scotland yard communicated with the police station at wells through me that a man is to be sent down from london i didnt come here as a spydont think that i was coming here anyhow on the other hand i believe that your uncle is playing a dangerous game i am going to have mr john p dunster put in charge of a norwich physician tomorrow  thank god the boy murmured  look here hamel continued what are you doing in this business anyway you are old enough to know your own mind and to go your own way  you say that because you dont know gerald declared bitterly  in a sense i dont hamel admitted and yet your sister hinted to me only this afternoon that you and she  oh i know what she told you the boy interrupted weve worn the chains for the last eight years they are breaking her theyve broken my mother sometimes i think they are breaking me but you know there comes a timethere comes a time when one cant go on ive seen some strange things here some that ive half understood some that i havent understood at all ive closed my eyes ive kept my promise ive done his bidding where ever it has led me but you know there is a timethere is a limit to all things i cant go on i spied on this man dunster i brought him here it is i who am responsible for anything that may happen to him its the last time  geralds face was white with pain hamel laid his hand upon his shoulder  my boy he said there are worse things in the world than breaking a promise when you gave it the conditions which were existing at the time made it perhaps a right and reasonable undertaking but sometimes the whole of the conditions under which a promise was given change then one must have courage enough to be false even to ones word  have you talked to my sister like that gerald asked eagerly  i have and i will again hamel declared tomorrow morning i leave this house but before i go i mean to have the affair of this man dunster cleared up your uncle will be very angry with me without a doubt i dont care but i do want you to trust me if you will and your sister i should like to be your friend  god knows we need one the boy said simply good night  once more the house was quiet hamel pushed his window wide open and looked out into the night the air was absolutely still there was no wind the only sound was the falling of the low waves upon the stony beach and the faint scrunching of the pebbles drawn back by the ebb he looked along the row of windows all dark and silent now a rush of pleasant fancies suddenly chased away the grim depression of the last few minutes out of all this sordidness and mystery there remained at least something in life for him to do a certain aimlessness of purpose which had troubled him during the last few months had disappeared he had found an object in life     chapter xxi  today hamel declared as he stood at the sideboard the following morning at breakfasttime and helped himself to bacon and eggs i am positively going to begin reading i have a case full of books down at the tower which i havent unpacked yet  esther made a little grimace  look at the sunshine she said there isnt a breath of wind either i think today that i could play from the mens tees  hamel sighed as he returned to his place  my good intentions are already half dissipated he admitted  she laughed  how can we attack the other half she asked  gerald who was also on his way to the sideboard suddenly stopped  hullo he exclaimed looking out of the window whos going away this morning i wonder theres the rollsroyce at the door  hamel too rose once more to his feet the two exchanged swift glances moved by a common thought they both started for the door only to find it suddenly opened before them mr fentolin glided into the room  uncle gerald exclaimed  mr fentolin glanced keenly around the room  good morning everybody he said my appearance at this hour of the morning naturally surprises you as a matter of fact i have been up for quite a long time esther dear give me some coffee will you and be sure that it is hot if any of you want to say goodby to mr john p dunster youd better hurry out  you mean that he is going hamel asked incredulously  he is going mr fentolin admitted i wash my hands of the man he has given us an infinite amount of trouble has monopolised doctor sarson when he ought to have been attending upon mea little more hot milk if you please estherand now although he really is not fit to leave his room he insists upon hurrying off to keep an appointment somewhere on the continent the little operation we spoke of last night was successful as doctor sarson prophesied and mr dunster was quite conscious and able to sit up early this morning we telephoned at six oclock to norwich for a surgeon who is now on his way over here but he will not wait even to see him what can you do with a man so obstinate  neither hamel nor gerald had resumed their places the former after a moments hesitation turned towards the door  i think he said that i should like to see the last of mr dunster  pray do mr fentolin begged i have said goodby to him myself and all that i hope is that next time you offer a wayfarer the hospitality of st davids hall gerald he may be a more tractable person this morning i shall give myself a treat i shall eat an oldfashioned english breakfast close the door after you if you please gerald  hamel with gerald by his side hurried out into the hall just as they crossed the threshold they saw mr dunster wrapped from head to foot in his long ulster a soft hat upon his head and one of mr fentolins cigars in his mouth step from the bottom stair into the hall and make his way with somewhat uncertain footsteps towards the front door doctor sarson walked on one side and meekins held him by the arm he glanced towards gerald and his companion and waved the hand which held his cigar  so long my young friend he exclaimed you see ive got them to let me make a start next time we go about the country in a saloon car together i hope well have better luck say but im groggy about the knees  youd better save your breath doctor sarson advised him grimly you havent any to spare now and youll want more than you have before you get to the end of your journey carefully down the steps mind  they helped him into the car hamel and gerald stood under the great stone portico watching  well im jiggered the boy exclaimed under his breath  hamel was watching the proceedings with a puzzled frown to his surprise neither doctor sarson nor meekins were accompanying the departing man  hes off right enough hamel declared as the car glided away do you understand it i dont  gerald did not speak for several moments his eyes were still fixed upon the back of the disappearing car then he turned towards hamel  there isnt much he said softly that mr fentolin doesnt know if that detective was really on his way here there wasnt any chance of keeping mr dunster to himself you see the whole story is common property and yet theres something about the affair that bothers me  and me hamel admitted watching the car until it became a speck in the distance  he was fairly well cornered gerald concluded as they made their way back to the diningroom but it isnt like him to let go of anything so easily  so youve seen the last of our guest mr fentolin remarked as hamel and gerald reentered the diningroom a queer fellowalmost a new type to me dogged and industrious i should think he hadnt the least right to travel you know and i think so long as we had taken the trouble to telephone to norwich he might have waited to see the physician sarson was very angry about it but what can you do with these fellows who are never ill they scarcely know what physical disability means well mr hamel and how are you going to amuse yourself today  i had thought of commencing some reading i brought with me hamel replied but miss esther has challenged me to another game of golf  excellent mr fentolin declared it is very kind of you indeed mr hamel it is always a matter of regret for me that society in these parts is so restricted my nephew and niece have little opportunity for enjoying themselves play golf with mr hamel by all means my dear child he continued turning to his niece make the most of this glorious spring weather and what about you gerald what are you doing today  i havent made up my mind yet sir the boy replied  mr fentolin sighed  always that lack of initiative he remarked a lack of initiative is one of your worst faults i am afraid dear gerald  the boy looked up quickly for a moment it seemed as though he were about to make a fierce reply he met mr fentolins steady gaze however and the words died away upon his lips  i rather thought he said of going into norwich if you could spare me captain holt has asked me to lunch at the barracks  mr fentolin shook his head gently  it is most unfortunate he declared i have a commission for you later in the day  gerald continued his breakfast in silence he bent over his plate so that his face was almost invisible mr fentolin was peeling a peach a servant entered the room  lieutenant godfrey sir he announced  they all looked up a trim cleanshaven hardfeatured young man in naval uniform was standing upon the threshold he bowed to esther  very sorry to intrude sir at this hour of the morning he said briskly lieutenant godfrey my name i am flag lieutenant of the britannia you cant see her but shes not fifty miles off at this minute i landed at sheringham this morning hired a car and made the best of my way here message from the admiral sir  mr fentolin smiled genially  we are delighted to see you lieutenant godfrey he said have some breakfast  you are very good sir the officer answered business first ill breakfast afterwards with pleasure if i may the admirals compliments and he would take it as a favour if you would haul down your wireless for a few days  haul down my wireless mr fentolin repeated slowly  we are doing a lot of manoeuvring within range of you and likely to do a bit more the young man explained you are catching up our messages all the time of course we know theyre quite safe with you but things get about as yours is only a private installation wed like you if you dont mind sir to shut up shop for a few days  mr fentolin seemed puzzled  but my dear sir he protested we are not at war are we  not yet the young officer replied but god knows when we shall be we are under sealed orders anyway and we dont want any risk of our plans leaking out thats why we want your wireless disconnected  you need say no more mr fentolin assured him the matter is already arranged esther let me present lieutenant godfreymy niece miss fentolin mr gerald fentolin my nephew mr hamel a guest see that lieutenant godfrey has some breakfast gerald i will go myself and see my marconi operator  awfully good of you sir the young man declared and i am sure we are very sorry to trouble you in a week or twos time you can go into business again as much as you like its only while we are fiddling around here that the admirals jumpy about things may my man have a cup of coffee sir id like to be on the way back in a quarter of an hour  mr fentolin halted his chair by the side of the bell and rang it  pray make use of my house as your own sir he said gravely from what you leave unsaid i gather that things are more serious than the papers would have us believe under those circumstances i need not assure you that any help we can render is entirely yours  mr fentolin left the room lieutenant godfrey was already attacking his breakfast gerald leaned towards him eagerly  is there really going to be war he demanded  ask those chaps at the hague lieutenant godfrey answered doing their best to freeze us out or something all i know is if theres going to be fighting we are ready for them bytheby what have you got wireless telegraphy for here anyway  its a fad of my uncles gerald replied since his accident he amuses himself in all sorts of queer ways  lieutenant godfrey nodded  poor fellow he said i heard he was a cripple or something of the sort forgive my asking butyou people are english arent you  rather gerald answered the fentolins have lived here for hundreds of years why do you ask that  lieutenant godfrey hesitated he looked for the moment scarcely at his ease  oh i dont know he replied the old man was very anxious i should find out you see a lot of information seems to have got over on the other side and we couldnt think where it had leaked out except through your wireless however that isnt likely of course unless youve got one of these beastly germans in your receivingroom now if i can borrow a cigarette a cigar or a pipe of tobaccoany mortal thing to smokeill be off if i may the old man turned me out at an unearthly hour this morning and in sheringham all the shops were closed steady on young fellow he laughed as gerald filled his pockets with cigarettes well heres good morning to you miss fentolin good morning sir how long ought it to take me to get to sheringham  about forty minutes gerald told him if your cars any good at all  it isnt much was the somewhat dubious reply however well shove along you in the service he enquired as they walked down the hall together  hope i shall be before long gerald answered im going into the army though  have to hurry up wont you  gerald sighed  its a little difficult for me heres your car good luck to you  my excuses to mr fentolin lieutenant godfrey shouted and many thanks  he jumped into the automobile and was soon on his way back gerald watched him until he was nearly out of sight on the knoll two of the wireless operators were already at work mr fentolin sat in his chair below watching the blue sparks were flashing a message was just being delivered presently mr fentolin turned his chair and with meekins by his side made his way back to the house he passed along the hall and into his study gerald who was on his way to the diningroom heard the ring of the telephone bell and the call for the trunk special line he hesitated for a moment then he made his way slowly down towards the study and stood outside the door listening in a moment he heard mr fentolins clear voice very low yet very penetrating  the mediterranean fleet will be fortyseven hours before it comes together was the message he heard the channel fleet will manoeuvre off sheerness waiting for it the north sea fleet is seventeen units under nominal strength  gerald turned the handle of the door slowly and entered mr fentolin was just replacing the receiver on its stand he looked up at his nephew and his eyebrows came together  what do you mean by this he demanded dont you know that i allow no one in here when i am telephoning on the private wire  gerald closed the door behind him and summoned up all his courage  it is because i have heard what you were saying over the telephone that i am here he declared i want to know to whom you were sending that message which you have intercepted outside     chapter xxii  mr fentolin sat for a moment in his chair with immovable face then he pointed to the door which gerald had left open behind him  close that door gerald  the boy obeyed mr fentolin waited until he had turned around again  come and stand over here by the side of the table he directed  gerald came without hesitation he stood before his uncle with folded arms there was something else besides sullenness in his face this morning something which mr fentolin was quick to recognise  i do not quite understand the nature of your question gerald mr fentolin began it is unlike you you do not seem yourself is there anything in particular the matter  only this gerald answered firmly i dont understand why this naval fellow should come here and ask you to close up your wireless because secrets have been leaking out and a few moments afterwards you should be picking up a message and telephoning to london information which was surely meant to be private thats all ive come to ask you about it  you heard the message then  i did  you listenedat the keyhole  i listened outside gerald assented doggedly i am glad i listened do you mind answering my question  do i mind mr fentolin repeated softly really gerald your politeness your consideration your good manners astound me i am positively deprived of the power of speech  ill wait here till it comes to you again then the boy declared bluntly ive waited on you hand and foot done dirty work for you put up with your illhumours and your tyranny and never grumbled but there is a limit youve made a poor sort of creature of me but even the worm turns you know when it comes to giving away secrets about the movements of our navy at a time when we are almost at war i strike  melodramatic almost dramatic but alas so inaccurate mr fentolin sighed is this a fit of the heroics boy or what has come over you have you by any chanceforgotten  mr fentolins voice seemed suddenly to have grown in volume his eyes dilated he himself seemed to have grown in size gerald stepped a little back he was trembling but his expression had not changed  no i havent forgotten theres a great debt we are doing our best to pay but theres such a thing as asking top much theres such a thing as drawing the cords to snapping point im speaking for esther and mother as well as myself we have been your slaves in a way i suppose we are willing to go on being your slaves its the burden that fate has placed around our necks and well go through with it all i want to point out is that there are limits and it seems to me that we are up against them now  mr fentolin nodded he had the air of a man who wishes to be reasonable  you are very young my boy he said very young indeed perhaps that is my fault for not having let you see more of the world you have got some very queer ideas into your head a little too much novel reading lately eh i might treat you differently i might laugh at you and send you out of the room i wont ill tell you what you ask ill explain what you find so mysterious the person to whom i have been speaking is my stockbroker  your stockbroker gerald exclaimed  mr fentolin nodded  mr bayliss he continued of the firm of bayliss hundercombe  dunn throgmorton court mr bayliss is a man of keen perceptions he understands exactly the effect of certain classes of news upon the market the message which i have just sent to him is practically common property it will be in the daily mail tomorrow morning the only thing is that i have sent it to him just a few minutes sooner than any one else can get it there is a good deal of value in that gerald i do not mind telling you that i have made a large fortune through studying the political situation and securing advance information upon matters of this sort that fortune some day will probably be yours it will be you who will benefit meanwhile i am enriching myself and doing no one any harm  but how do you know gerald persisted that this message would ever have found its way to the press it was simply a message from one battleship to another it was not intended to be picked up on land there is no other installation but ours that could have picked it up besides it was in code i know that you have the code but the others havent  mr fentolin yawned slightly  ingenious my dear gerald but inaccurate you do not know that the message was in code and in any case it was liable to be picked up by any steamer within the circle you really do treat me my boy rather as though i were a weird mischiefmaking person with a talent for intrigue and crime of every sort look at your suspicions last night i believe that you and mr hamel had quite made up your minds that i meant evil things for mr john p dunster well i had my chance you saw him depart  what about his papers  i will admit mr fentolin replied that i read his papers they were of no great consequence however and he has taken them away with him mr dunster as a matter of fact turned out to be rather a maresnest now come since you are here finish everything you have to say to me i am not angry i am willing to listen quite reasonably  gerald shook his head  oh i cant he declared bitterly you always get the best of it ill only ask you one more question are you having the wireless hauled down  mr fentolin pointed out of the window gerald followed his finger three men were at work upon the towering spars  you see mr fentolin continued tolerantly that i am keeping my word to lieutenant godfrey you are suffering from a little too much imagination i am afraid it is really quite a good fault bytheby how do you get on with our friend mr hamel  very well the boy replied i havent seen much of him  he and esther are together a great deal eh mr fentolin asked quickly  they seem to be quite friendly  it isnt mr hamel by any chance who has been putting these ideas into your head  no one has been putting any ideas into my head gerald answered hotly its simply what ive seen and overheard its simply what i feel around the whole atmosphere of the place the whole atmosphere you seem to create around you with these brutes sarson and meekins and those whitefaced smoothtongued marconi men of yours who cant talk decent english and the postoffice man who cant look you in the face and miss price who looks as though she were one of the creatures too of your torture chamber thats all  mr fentolin waited until he had finished then he waved him away  go and take a long walk gerald he advised fresh air is what you need fresh air and a little vigorous exercise run along now and send miss price to me  gerald overtook hamel upon the stairs  by this time the latter remarked i suppose that our friend mr dunster is upon the sea  gerald nodded silently they passed along the corridor the door of the room which mr dunster had occupied was ajar as though by common consent they both stopped and looked in the windows were all wide open the bed freshly made the nurse was busy collecting some medicine bottles and fragments of lint she looked at them in surprise  mr dunster has left sir she told them  we saw him go gerald replied  rather a quick recovery wasnt it nurse hamel asked  it wasnt a recovery at all sir the woman declared sharply hed no right to have been taken away its my opinion doctor sarson ought to be ashamed of himself to have permitted it  they couldnt exactly make a prison of the place could they hamel pointed out the man after all was only a guest  thats as it may be sir the nurse replied all the same those that wont obey their doctors arent fit to be allowed about alone thats the way i look at it  mrs fentolin was passing along the corridor as they issued from the room she started a little as she saw them  what have you two been doing in there she asked quickly  we were just passing hamel explained we stopped for a moment to speak to the nurse  mr dunster has gone she said you saw him go gerald you saw him too didnt you mr hamel  i certainly did hamel admitted  mrs fentolin pointed to the great north window near which they were standing through which the clear sunlight streamed a little pitilessly upon her worn face and mass of dyed hair  you ought neither of you to be indoors for a minute on a morning like this she declared esther is waiting for you in the car i think mr hamel  gerald passed on up the stairs to his room but hamel lingered a curious impulse of pity towards his hostess stirred him the morning sunlight seemed to have suddenly revealed the tragedy of her life she stood there a tired worn woman with the burden heavy upon her shoulders  why not come out with miss fentolin and me he suggested we could lunch at the golf club out on the balcony i wish you would cant you manage it  she shook her head  thank you very much she said mr fentolin does not like to be left  something in the finality of her words seemed to him curiously eloquent of her state of mind she did not move on she seemed indeed to have the air of one anxious to say more in that ruthless light the advantages of her elegant clothes and graceful carriage were suddenly stripped away from her she was the abject wreck of a beautiful woman wizened prematurely aged nothing remained but the eyes which seemed somehow to have their message for him  mr fentolin is a little peculiar you know she went on her voice shaking slightly with the effort she was making to keep it low he allows esther so little liberty she sees so few young people of her own age i do not know why he allows you to be with her so much be careful mr hamel  her voice seemed suddenly to vibrate with a curious note of suppressed fear almost as she finished her speech she passed on her little gesture bade him remain silent as she went up the stairs she began to hum scraps of a little french air     chapter xxiii  hamel sliced his ball at the ninth and after waiting for a few minutes patiently esther came to help him look for it he was standing down on the sands a little apart from the two caddies who were beating out various tufts of long grass  where did it go she asked  i have no idea he admitted  why dont you help look for it  searching for balls he insisted is a caddys occupation both the caddies are now busy let us sit down here these sand hummocks are delightful it is perfectly sheltered and the sun is in our faces golf is an overrated pastime let us sit and watch that little streak of blue find its way up between the white posts  she hesitated for a moment  we shall lose our place  there is no one behind  she sank on to the little knoll of sand to which he had pointed with a resigned sigh  you really are a queer person she declared you have been playing golf this morning as though your very life depended upon it you have scarcely missed a shot or spoken a word and now all of a sudden you want to sit on a sand hummock and watch the tide  i have been silent he told her because i have been thinking  that may be truthful she remarked but you wouldnt call it polite would you  the subject of my thoughts is my excuse i have been thinking of you  for a single moment her eyes seemed to have caught something of that sympathetic light with which he was regarding her then she looked away  was it my mashie shots you were worrying about she asked  it was not he replied simply it was youyou yourself  she laughed not altogether naturally  how flattering she murmured bytheby you are rather a downright person arent you mr hamel  so much so he admitted that i am going to tell you one or two things now i am going to be very frank indeed  she sat suddenly quite still her face was turned from him but for the first time since he had known her there was a slight undertone of colour in her cheeks  a week ago he said i hadnt the faintest idea of coming into norfolk i knew about this little shanty of my fathers but i had forgotten all about it i came as the result of a conversation i had with a friend who is in the foreign office  she looked at him with startled eyes  what do you mean she asked quickly you are mr hamel arent you  certainly he replied not only am i richard hamel mining engineer but i really have all that reading to do i have spoken about and i really was looking for a quiet spot to do it in it is true that i had this part of the world in my mind but i do not think that i should ever have really decided to come here if it had not been for my friend in london he was very interested indeed directly i mentioned st davids tower would you like to know what he told me  yes go on please  he told me a little of the history of your uncle mr fentolin and what he did not tell me at the time he has since supplemented i suppose he added hesitatingly that you yourself  please go on please speak as though i knew nothing  well then hamel continued he told me that your uncle was at one time in the foreign office himself he seemed to have a most brilliant career before him when suddenly there was a terrible scandal a political secreti dont know what it washad leaked out there were rumours that it had been acquired for a large sum of money by a foreign power mr fentolin retired to norfolk pending an investigation it was just as that time that he met with his terrible accident and the matter was dropped  go on please she murmured  my friend went on to say that during the last few years mr fentolin has once again become an object of some suspicion to the head of our secret service department for a long time they have known that he was employing agents abroad and that he was showing the liveliest interest in underground politics they believed that it was a mere hobby born of his useless condition a taste ministered to without doubt by the occupation of his earlier life once or twice lately they have had reason to change their minds you know i dare say in what a terribly disturbed state european affairs are just now well my friend had an idea that mr fentolin was showing an extraordinary amount of interest in a certain conference which we understand is to take place at the hague he begged me to come down and to watch your uncle while i was down here and report to him anything that seemed to me noteworthy since then i have had a message from him concerning the american whom you entertainedmr john p dunster it appears that he was the bearer of very important dispatches for the continent  but he has gone she said quickly nothing happened to him after all he went away without a word of complaint we all saw him  that is quite true hamel admitted mr dunster has certainly gone it is rather a coincidence however that he should have taken his departure just as the enquiries concerning his whereabouts had reached such a stage that it had become quite impossible to keep him concealed any longer  she turned a little in her place and looked at him steadfastly  mr hamel she said tell mewhat of your mission you have had an opportunity of studying my uncle you have even lived under his roof tell me what you think  his face was troubled  miss fentolin he said i will tell you frankly that up to now i have not succeeded in solving the problem of your uncles character to me personally he has been most courteous he lives apparently a studious and an unselfish life i have heard him even spoken of as a philanthropist and yet you threeyou your mother and your brother who are nearest to him who live in his house and under his protection have the air of passing your days in mortal fear of him  mr hamel she exclaimed nervously you dont believe that he is always very kind  apparently hamel observed drily and yet you must remember that you too are afraid of him i need not remind you of our conversations but there the truth is you praise his virtues and his charities you pity him and yet you go about with a load of fear andforgive meof secret terror in your heart you and gerald too as for your mother  dont she interrupted suddenly why do you bring me here to talk like this you cannot alter things nothing can be altered  cant it he replied well i will tell you the real reason of my having brought you here and of my having made this confession i brought you here because i could not bear to go on living if not under your roof at any rate in the neighbourhood without telling you the truth now you know it i am here to watch mr fentolin i am going on watching him you can put him on his guard if you like i shant complain or you can  he paused so long that she looked at him he moved a little closer to her his fingers suddenly gripped her hand  or you can marry me and come away from it all he concluded quietly forgive me pleasei mean it  for a moment the startled light in her eyes was followed by a delicious softness her lips were parted she leaned a little towards him then suddenly she seemed to remember she rose with swift alertness to her feet  i think she said that we had better play golf  but i have asked you to marry me he protested as he scrambled up  your caddy has found your ball a long time ago she pointed out walking swiftly on ahead  he played his shot and caught her up  miss fentolinesther he pleaded eagerly do you think that i am not in earnest because i am i mean it even if i have only known you for a few days it has been enough i think that i knew it was coming from the moment that you stepped into my railway carriage  you knew that what was coming she asked raising her eyes suddenly  that i should care for you  its the first time youve told me she reminded him with a queer little smile oh forgive me please i didnt mean to say that i dont want to have you tell me so its all too ridiculous and impossible  is it and why  i have only known you for three days  we can make up for that  but i dontcare about you i have never thought of any one in that way it is absurd she went on  youll have to sometime or other he declared ill take you travelling with me show you the world new worlds unnamed rivers untrodden mountains or do you want to go and see where the little brown people live among the mimosa and the cherry blossoms ill take you so far away that this place and this life will seem like a dream  her breath caught a little  dont please she begged you know very wellor rather you dont know perhaps but i must tell youthat i couldnt i am here tied and bound and i cant escape  ah dear dont believe it he went on earnestly there isnt any bond so strong that i wont break it for you no knot i wont untie if you give me the right  they were climbing slowly on to the tee he stepped forward and pulled her up her hand was cold her eyes were raised to his very softly yet almost pleadingly  please dont say anything more she begged i cantquite bear it just now you know you must rememberthere is my mother do you think that i could leave her to struggle alone  his caddy who had teed the ball and who had regarded the proceedings with a moderately tolerant air felt called upon at last to interfere  wed best get on he remarked pointing to two figures in the distance or theyll say weve cut in  hamel smote his ball far and true on a more moderate scale she followed his example they descended the steps together  lovemaking isnt going to spoil our golf he whispered smiling as he touched her fingers once more  she looked at him almost shyly  is this lovemaking she asked  they walked together from the eighteenth green towards the clubhouse a curious silence seemed suddenly to have enveloped them hamel was conscious of a strange exhilaration a queer upheaval of ideas an excitement which nothing in his previous life had yet been able to yield him the wonder of it amazed him kept him silent it was not until they reached the steps indeed that he spoke  on our way home he began  she seemed suddenly to have stiffened he looked at her surprised she was standing quite still her hand gripping the post her eyes fixed upon the waiting motorcar the delicate softness had gone from her face once more that look of partly veiled suffering was there suffering mingled with fear  look she whispered under her breath look it is mr fentolin he has come for us himself he is there in the car  mr fentolin a strange little figure lying back among the cushions of the great daimler raised his hat and waved it to them  come along children he cried you see i am here to fetch you myself the sunshine has tempted me what a heavenly morning come and sit by my side esther and fight your battle all over again that is one of the joys of golf isnt it he asked turning to hamel you need not be afraid of boring me today is one of my bright days i suppose that it is the sunshine and the warm wind on the way here we passed some fields i could swear that i smelt violets where are you going esther  to take my clubs to my locker and pay my caddy she replied  mr hamel will do that for you mr fentolin declared come and take your seat by my side and let us wait for him i am tired of being alone  she gave up her clubs reluctantly all the life seemed to have gone from her face  why didnt mother come with you she asked simply  to tell you the truth dear esther he answered when i started i had a fancy to be alone i thinkin fact i am surethat your mother wanted to come the sunshine too was tempting her perhaps it was selfish of me not to bring her but then there is a great deal to be forgiven me isnt there esther  a great deal she echoed looking steadily ahead of her  i came he went on because it occurred to me that after all i had my duties as your guardian dear esther i am not sure that we can permit flirtations you know let me see how old are you  twentyone she replied  in a magazine i was reading the other day he continued i was interested to observe that the modern idea as regards marriage is a changed one a woman they say should not marry until she is twentyseven or twentyeighta very excellent idea i think we agree do we not on that esther  i dont know she replied i have never thought about the matter  then he went on we will make up our minds to agree twentyseven or twentyeight let us say a very excellent age a girl should know her own mind by then and meanwhile dear esther would it be wise i wonder to see a little less of our friend mr hamel he leaves us today i think he is very obstinate about that if he were staying still in the house well it might be different but if he persists in leaving us you will not forget dear that association with a guest is one thing association with a young man living out of the house is another a great deal less of mr hamel i think that we must see  she made no reply whatever hamel was coming now towards them  really a very personable young man mr fentolin remarked studying him through his eyeglass is it my fancy i wonder as an observant person or is he just a littlejust a little taken with you esther a pity if it is soa great pity  she said nothing but her hand which rested upon the rug was trembling a little  if you have an opportunity mr fentolin suggested dropping his voice you might very delicately you knowgirls are so clever at that sort of thingconvey my views to mr hamel as regards his leaving us and its effect upon your companionship you understand me i am sure  for the first time she turned her head towards him  i understand she said that you have some particular reason for not wishing mr hamel to leave st davids hall  he smiled benignly  you do my hospitable impulses full justice dear esther he declared sometimes i think that you understand me almost as well as your dear mother if by any chance mr hamel should change his mind as to taking up his residence at the tower i think you would not find me in any sense of the word an obdurate or exacting guardian come along mr hamel that seat opposite to us is quite comfortable you see i resign myself to the inevitable i have come to fetch golfers home to luncheon and i compose myself to listen which of you will begin the epic of missed putts and brassey shots which failed by a foot to carry     chapter xxiv  hamel sat alone upon the terrace his afternoon coffee on a small table in front of him his eyes were fixed upon a black speck at the end of the level roadway which led to the tower only a few minutes before mr fentolin in his little carriage had shot out from the passage beneath the terrace on his way to the tower behind him came meekins bending over his bicycle hamel watched them both with thoughtful eyes there were several little incidents in connection with their expedition which he scarcely understood  then there came at last the sound for which he had been listening the rustle of a skirt along the terraced way hamel turned quickly around half rising to his feet and concealing his disappointment with difficulty it was mrs seymour fentolin who stood there a little dog under each arm a large hat gay with flowers upon her head she wore patent shoes with high heels and white silk stockings she had indeed the air of being dressed for luncheon at a fashionable restaurant as she stooped to set the dogs down a strong waft of perfume was shaken from her clothes  are you entirely deserted mr hamel she asked  i am he replied miss esther went i think to look for you my host he added pointing to the black speck in the distance begged me to defer my occupation of the tower for an hour or so and has gone down there to collect some of his trifles  her eyes followed his outstretched hand she seemed to him to shiver for a moment  you really mean then that you are going to leave us she asked accepting the chair which he had drawn up close to his  he smiled  well i scarcely came on a visit to st davids hall did i he reminded her it has been delightfully hospitable of mr fentolin to have insisted upon my staying on here for these few days but i could not possibly inflict myself upon you all for an unlimited period  mrs fentolin sat quite still for a time in absolute repose if one could forget her mass of unnaturally golden hair the forced and constant smile the too liberal use of rouge and powder the nervous motions of her head it was easily to be realised that there were still neglected attractions about her face and figure only in these moments of repose an intense and ageing weariness seemed to have crept into her eyes and face it was as though she had dropped the mask of incessant gaiety and permitted a glimpse of her real self to steal to the surface  mr hamel she said quietly i dare say that even during these few days you have realised that mr fentolin is a very peculiar man  i have certainly observedeccentricities hamel assented  my life and the lives of my two children she went on is devoted to the task of ministering to his happiness  isnt that rather a heavy sacrifice he asked mrs seymour fentolin looked down the long narrow way along which mr fentolin had passed he was out of sight now inside the tower somehow or other the thought seemed to give her courage and dignity she spoke differently without nervousness or hurry  to you mr hamel she said it may seem so we who make it know of its necessity  he bowed his head it was not a subject for him to discuss with her  mr fentolin has whims she went on violent whims we all try to humour him he has his own ideas about geralds bringing up i do not agree with them but we submit esther too suffers perhaps to a less extent as for meher voice broke a littlemr fentolin likes people around him who are always cheerful he prefers even a certain styleof dress i too have to do my little share  hamels face grew darker  has it ever occurred to you he demanded that mr fentolin is a tyrant  she closed her eyes for a moment  there are reasons she declared why i cannot discuss that with you he has these strong fancies and it is our task in life to humour them he has one now with regard to the tower with regard to you you are of course your own master you can do as you choose and you will do as you choose neither i nor my children have any claim upon your consideration but mr hamel you have been so kind that i feel moved to tell you this it would make it very much easier for all of us if you would give up this scheme of yours if you would stay on here instead of going to reside at the tower  hamel threw away his cigarette he was deeply interested  mrs fentolin he said i am glad to have you speak so plainly let me answer you in the same spirit i am leaving this house mainly because i have conceived certain suspicions with regard to mr fentolin i do not like him i do not trust him i do not believe in him therefore i mean to remove myself from the burden of his hospitality there are reasons he went on why i do not wish to leave the neighbourhood altogether there are certain investigations which i wish to make that is why i have decided to go to the tower  miles was right then she cried suddenly you are here to spy upon him  he turned towards her swiftly  to spy upon him mrs fentolin for what reason why is he a criminal then  she opened her lips and closed them again there was a slight frown upon her forehead it was obvious that the word had unintentionally escaped her  i only know what it is that he called you what he suspects you of being she explained mr fentolin is very clever and he is generally at work upon something we do not enquire into the purpose of his labours the only thing i know is that he suspects you of wanting to steal one of his secrets  secrets but what secrets has he hamel demanded is he an inventor  you ask me idle questions she sighed we have gone perhaps a little further than i intended i came to plead with you for all our sakes if i could to make things more comfortable by remaining here instead of insisting upon your claim to the tower  mrs fentolin hamel said firmly i like to do what i can to please and benefit my friends especially those who have been kind to me i will be quite frank with you there is nothing you could ask me which i would not do for your daughters sakeif i were convinced that it was for her good  mrs seymour fentolin seemed to be trembling a little her hands were crossed upon her bosom  you have known her for so short a time she murmured  hamel smiled confidently  i will not weary you he said with the usual trite remarks i will simply tell you that the time has been long enough i love your daughter  mrs fentolin sat quite still only in her eyes fixed steadily seawards there was the light of something new as though some new thought was stirring in her brain her lips moved although the sound which came was almost inaudible  why not she murmured as though arguing with some unseen critic of her thoughts why not  i am not a rich man hamel went on but i am fairly well off i could afford to be married at once and i should like  she turned suddenly upon him and gripped his wrist  listen she interrupted you are a traveller are you not you have been to distant countries where white people go seldom inaccessible countries where even the arm of the law seldom reaches couldnt you take her away there take her right away travel so fast that nothing could catch you and hidehide for a little time  hamel stared at his companion for a moment blankly her attitude was so unexpected her questioning so fierce  my dear mrs fentolin he began  she suddenly relaxed her grip of his arm something of the old hopelessness was settling down upon her face her hands fell into her lap  no she interrupted i forgot i mustnt talk like that she too is part of the sacrifice  part of the sacrifice hamel repeated frowning is she indeed i dont know what sacrifice you mean but esther is the girl whom sooner or later somehow or other i am going to make my wife and when she is my wife i shall see to it that she isnt afraid of miles fentolin or of any other man breathing  a gleam of hopefulness shone through the stony misery of the womans face  does esther care she asked softly  how can i tell i can only hope so if she doesnt yet she shall some day i suppose he added with a sigh it is rather too soon yet to expect that she should if it is necessary i can wait  mrs fentolins eyes were once more fixed upon the tower the sun had caught the top of the telephone wire and played around it till it seemed like a long thin shaft of silver  if you go down there she said esther will not be allowed to see you at all mr fentolin has decided to take it as a personal affront you will be ostracised from here  shall i he answered well it wont be for long at any rate and as to not seeing esther you must remember that i come from outside this little domain and i see nothing more in mr fentolin than a badtempered mischievous tyrannical old invalid who is fortunately prevented by his infirmities from doing as much mischief as he might i am not afraid of your brotherinlaw or of the bully he takes about with him and i am going to see your daughter somehow or other and i am going to marry her before very long  she thrust out her hand suddenly and grasped his the fingers were very thin almost bony and covered with rings their grip was feverish and he felt them tremble  you are a brave man mr hamel she declared speaking in a low quick undertone perhaps you are right the shadow isnt over your head you havent lived in the terror of it you may find a way god grant it  she wrung his fingers and rose to her feet her voice suddenly changed into another key hamel knew instinctively that she wished him to understand that their conversation was over  chowchow she cried come along dear we must have our walk come along koto come along little dogs  hamel strolled down the terrace steps and wandered for a time in the gardens behind the house here in the shelter of the great building he found himself suddenly in an atmosphere of springtime there were beds of crocuses and hyacinths fragrant clumps of violets borders of snowdrops masses of primroses and early anemones he slowly climbed one or two steep paths until he reached a sort of plateau level with the top of the house the flowers here grew more sparsely the track of the salt wind lay like a withering band across the flowerbeds the garden below was like a little oasis of colour and perfume arrived at the bordering red brick wall he turned around and looked along the narrow road which led to the sea there was no sign of mr fentolins return then to his left he saw a gate open and heard the clamour of dogs esther appeared walking swiftly towards the little stretch of road which led to the village he hurried after her  unsociable person he exclaimed as he caught her up didnt you know that i was longing for a walk  how should i read your thoughts she answered besides a few minutes ago i saw you on the terrace talking to mother i am only going as far as the village  may i come he asked i have business there myself  she laughed  there are nine cottages three farmhouses and a general shop in st davids she remarked also about fifteen fishermens cottages dotted about the marsh your business i presume is with the general shop  he shook his head falling into step with her  what i want he explained is to find a woman to come in and look after me at the tower your servant who valets me has given me two names  something of the lightness faded from her face  so you have quite made up your mind to leave us she asked slowly mother wasnt able to persuade you to stay  he shook his head  she was very kind he said but there are really grave reasons why i feel that i must not accept mr fentolins hospitality any longer i had he went on a very interesting talk with your mother  she turned quickly towards him the slightest possible tinge of additional colour was in her cheeks she was walking on the top of a green bank with the wind blowing her skirts around her the turn of her head was a little diffident almost shy her eyes were asking him questions at that moment she seemed to him with her slim body her gently parted lips and soft tremulous eyes almost like a child he drew a little nearer to her  i told your mother he continued all that i have told you and more i told her dear that i cared for you that i wanted you to be my wife  she was caught in a little gust of wind both her hands went up to her hat her face was hidden she stepped down from the bank  you shouldnt have done that she said quietly  why not he demanded it was the truth  he stooped forward intent upon looking into her face the mystic softness was still in her eyes but her general expression was inscrutable it seemed to him that there was fear there  what did mother say she whispered  nothing discouraging he replied i dont think she minded at all i have decided if you give me permission to go and talk to mr fentolin this evening  she shook her head very emphatically  dont she implored dont dont give him another whip to lash us with keep silent let me just have the memory for a few days all to myself  her words came to him like numb things there was little expression in them and yet he felt that somehow they meant so much  esther dear he said i shall do just as you ask me at the same time please listen i think that you are all absurdly frightened of mr fentolin living here alone with him you have all grown under his dominance to an unreasonable extent because of his horrible infirmity you have let yourselves become his slaves there are limits to this sort of thing esther i come here as a stranger and i see nothing more in mr fentolin than a very selfish irritable domineering and capricious old man humour him by all means i am willing to do the same myself but when it comes to the great things in life neither he nor any living person is going to keep from me the woman i love  she walked by his side in silence her breath was coming a little quicker her fingers lay passive in his then for a moment he felt the grip of them almost burn into his flesh still she said nothing  i want your permission dear he went on to go to him i suppose he calls himself your guardian if he says no you are of age i just want you to believe that i am strong enough to put my arms around you and to carry you away to my own world and keep you there although an army of mr fentolins creatures followed us  she turned and he saw the great transformation her face was brilliant her eyes shone with wonderful things  please she begged will you say or do nothing at all for a little time until i tell you when i want just a few days peace you have said such beautiful things to me that i want them to lie there in my thoughts in my heart undisturbed for just a little time you see we are at the village now i am going to call at this third cottage while i am inside you can go and make what enquiries you like come and knock at the door for me when you are ready  and we will walk back together  we will walk back together she promised him  i will take you home another way i will take you over what they call the common and come down behind the hall into the gardens  she dismissed him with a little smile he strolled along the village street and plunged into the mysterious recesses of the one tiny shop    chapter xxv  hamel met kinsley shortly before one oclock the following afternoon in the lounge of the royal hotel at norwich  you got my wire then the latter asked as he held out his hand i had it sent by special messenger from wells  it arrived directly after breakfast hamel replied it wasnt the easiest matter to get here even then for there are only about two trains a day and i didnt want to borrow a car from mr fentolin  quite right kinsley agreed i wanted you to come absolutely on your own lets get into the coffeeroom and have some lunch now i want to catch the afternoon train hack to town  do you mean to say that youve come all the way down here to talk to me for half an hour or so hamel demanded as they took their places at a table  all the way from town kinsley assented and up to the eyes in work we are too dick what do you think of miles fentolin  hanged if i know hamel answered with a sigh  nothing definite to tell us then  nothing  what about mr john p dunster  he left yesterday morning hamel said i saw him go he looked very shaky i understood that mr fentolin sent him to yarmouth  did mr fentolin know that there was an enquiry on foot about this mans disappearance kinsley asked  certainly i heard lord saxthorpe tell him that the police had received orders to scour the country for him and that they were coming to st davids hall  kinsley for a moment was singularly and eloquently profane  thats why mr fentolin let him go then if saxthorpe had only held his tongue or if those infernal police hadnt got chattering with the magistrates we might have made a coup as it is the games up mr dunster left for yarmouth you say yesterday morning  i saw him go myself he looked very shaky and ill but he was able to smoke a big cigar and walk downstairs leaning on the doctors arm  i dont doubt kinsley remarked but that you saw what you say you saw at the same time you may be surprised to hear that mr dunster has disappeared again  disappeared again hamel muttered  it looks very much kinsley continued as though your friend miles fentolin has been playing with him like a cat with a mouse he has been obliged to turn him out of one hidingplace and he has simply transferred him to another  hamel looked doubtful  mr dunster left quite alone in the car he said he was on his guard too for mr fentolin and he had had words i really cant see how it was possible for him to have got into any more trouble  where is he then kinsley demanded come i will let you a little further into our confidence we have reason to believe that he carries with him a written message which is practically the only chance we have of avoiding disaster during the next few days that written message is addressed to the delegates at the hague who are now sitting nothing had been heard of dunster or the document he carries no word has come from him of any sort since he left st davids hall  have you tried to trace him from there hamel asked  trace him kinsley repeated by heavens you dont seem to understand dick the immense the extraordinary importance of this man to us the cleverest detective in england spent yesterday under your nose at st davids hall there are a dozen others working upon the job as hard as they can all the reports confirm what you saythat dunster left st davids hall at halfpast nine yesterday morning and he certainly arrived in yarmouth at a little before twelve from there he seems however to have completely disappeared the car went back to st davids hall empty the man only stayed long enough in yarmouth in fact to have his dinner we cannot find a single smack owner who was approached in any way for the hire of a boat yarmouth has been ransacked in vain he certainly has not arrived at the hague or we should have heard news at once as a last resource i ran down here to see you on the chance of your having picked up any information  hamel shook his head  you seem to know a good deal more than i do already he said  what do you think of mr fentolin you have stayed in his house you have had an opportunity of studying him  so far as my impressions go hamel replied everything which you have suggested might very well be true i think that either out of sheer love of mischief or from some subtler motive he is capable of anything every one in the place except one poor woman seems to look upon him as a sort of supernatural being he gives money away to worthless people with both hands yet i share your opinion of him i believe that he is a creature without conscience or morals i have sat at his table and shivered when he has smiled  are you staying at st davids hall now  i left yesterday  where are you now then  i am at st davids towerthe little place i told you of that belonged to my fatherbut i dont know whether i shall be able to stop there mr fentolin for some reason or other very much resented my leaving the hall and was very annoyed at my insisting upon claiming the tower when i went down to the village to get some one to come up and look after me there wasnt a woman there who would come it didnt matter what i offered they were all the same they all muttered some excuse or other and seemed only anxious to show me out at the village shop they seemed to hate to serve me with anything it was all i could do to get a packet of tobacco yesterday afternoon you would really think that i was the most unpopular person who ever lived and it can only be because of mr fentolins influence  mr fentolin evidently doesnt like to have you in the locality kinsley remarked thoughtfully  he was all right so long as i was at st davids hall hamel observed  whats this little place likest davids tower you call it kinsley asked  just a little stone building actually on the beach hamel explained there is a large shed which mr fentolin keeps locked up and the habitable portion consists just of a bedroom and sittingroom from what i can see mr fentolin has been making a sort of hobby of the place there is telephonic communication with the house and he seems to have used the sittingroom as a sort of studio he paints sea pictures and really paints them very well  a man came into the coffeeroom made some enquiry of the waiter and went out again hamel stared at him in a puzzled manner for the moment he could only remember that the face was familiar then he suddenly gave vent to a little exclamation  any one would think that i had been followed he remarked the man who has just looked into the room is one of mr fentolins parasites or bodyguards or whatever you call them  you probably have kinsley agreed what post does he hold in the household  i have no idea hamel replied i saw him the first day i arrived and not since sort of secretary i should think  he is a queerlooking fellow anyway kinsley muttered look out dick here he comes back again  mr ryan approached the table a little diffidently  i hope you will forgive the liberty sir he said to hamel you remember me i trustmr ryan i am the librarian at st davids hall  hamel nodded  i thought id seen you there  i was wondering the man continued whether you had a car of mr fentolins in norwich today and if so whether i might beg a seat back in case you were returning before the five oclock train i came in early this morning to go through some manuscripts at a secondhand booksellers here and i have unfortunately missed the train back  hamel shook his head  i came in by train myself or i would have given you a lift back with pleasure he said  mr ryan expressed his thanks briefly and left the room kinsley watched him from over the top of a newspaper  so that is one of mr fentolins creatures too he remarked keeping his eye on you in norwich eh tell me dick bytheby how do you get on with the rest of mr fentolins household and exactly of whom does it consist  there is his sisterinlaw hamel replied mrs seymour fentolin she is a strange tiredlooking woman who seems to stand in mortal fear of mr fentolin she is always overdressed and never natural but it seems to me that nearly everything she does is done to suit his whims or at his instigation  kinsley nodded thoughtfully  i remember seymour fentolin he said a really fine fellow he was well who else  just the nephew and niece the boy is half sullen half discontented yet he too seems to obey his uncle blindly the three of them seem to be his slaves its a thing you cant live in the house without noticing  it seems to be a cheerful sort of household kinsley observed you read the papers i suppose dick he asked after a moments pause  on and off the last few days i seem to have been busy doing all sorts of things  well ill tell you something kinsley continued the whole of our available fleet is engaged in carrying out what they call a demonstration in the north sea they have patrol boats out in every direction and only the short distance wireless signals are being used everything of course is in code yet we know this for a fact a good deal of private information passing between the admiral and his commanders was known in germany three hours after the signals themselves had been given it is suspectedmore than suspected in factthat these messages were picked up by mr fentolins wireless installation  i dont suppose he could help receiving them hamel remarked  he could help decoding them and sending them through to germany though kinsley retorted grimly the worst of it is he has a private telephone wire in his house to london if he isnt up to mischief what does he need all these things forprivate telegraph line private telephone private wireless we have given the postmaster a hint to have the telegraph office moved down into the village but i dont know that that will help us much  so far as regards the wireless hamel said i rather believe that it is temporarily dismantled we had a sailorman over the morning before yesterday to complain of his messages having been picked up mr fentolin promised at once to put his installation out of work for a time  he has done plenty of mischief with it already kinsley groaned however it was dunster i came down to make enquiries about i couldnt help hoping that you might have been able to put us on the right track  hamel sighed  i know nothing beyond what i have told you  how did he look when he went away  very ill indeed hamel declared i afterwards saw the nurse who had been attending him and she admitted that he was not fit to travel i should say the probabilities are that he is laid up again somewhere  did you actually speak to him  just a word or two  and you saw him go off in the car  gerald fentolin and i both saw him and wished him goodby  kinsley glanced at the clock and rose to his feet walk down to the station with me he suggested i neednt tell you i am sure he went on as they left the hotel a few minutes later that if anything does turn up or if you get the glimmering of an idea youll let me know weve a small army looking for the fellow but it does seem as though he had disappeared off the face of the earth if he doesnt turn up before the end of the conference we are done  tell me hamel asked after they had walked for some distance in silence exactly why is our fleet demonstrating to such an extent  that conference i have spoken of kinsley replied which is being held at the hague is being held we know purposely to discuss certain matters in which we are interested it is meeting for their discussion without any invitation having been sent to this country there is only one reply possible to such a course it is there in the north sea but unfortunately  kinsley paused his tone and his expression had alike become gloomier  go on hamel begged  our reply after all is a miserable affair kinsley concluded you remember the outcry over the withdrawal of our mediterranean fleet now you see its sequel we havent a ship worth a snap of the fingers from gibraltar to suez if france deserts us its goodby to malta goodby to egypt goodby to india its the disruption of the british empire and all this he wound up as he paused before taking his seat in the railway carriage all this might even now be avoided if only we could lay our hands upon the message which that man dunster was bringing from new york     chapter xxvi  once more hamel descended from the little train and turning away from st davids hall made his way across the marshes seawards the sunshine of the last few days had departed the twilight was made gloomy by a floating veil of white mist which hung about in wet patches hamel turned up his coat collar as he walked and shivered a little the thought of his solitary night and uncomfortable surroundings after all the luxury of st davids hall was scarcely inspiring yet on the whole he was splendidly cheerful the glamour of a host of new sensations was upon him there was a new love of living in his heart he forgot the cold east wind which blew in his face bringing with it little puffs of damp grey mist he forgot the cheerlessness which he was about to face the lonely night before him for the first time in his life a woman reigned in his thoughts  it was not until he actually reached the very side of the tower that he came back to earth as he opened the door he found a surprise in store for him a fire was burning in the sittingroom smoke was ascending from the kitchen chimney the little round table was laid with a white cloth there was a faint odour of cooking from the back premises his lamp was lit there were logs hissing and crackling upon the fire as he stood there looking wonderingly about him the door from the back was opened hannah cox came quietly into the room  what time would you like your dinner sir she enquired  hamel stared at her  why are you going to keep house for me mrs cox he asked  if you please sir i heard that you had been in the village looking for some one i am sorry that i was away there is no one else who would come to you  so i discovered he remarked a little grimly  no one else she went on would come to you because of mr fentolin he does not wish to have you here they love him so much in the village that he had only to breathe the word it was enough  yet you are here he reminded her  i do not count she answered i am outside all these things  hamel gave a little sigh of satisfaction  well i am glad you could come anyhow if you have something for dinner i should like it in about half an hour  he climbed the narrow stairs which led to his bedroom to his surprise there were many things there for his comfort which he had forgotten to orderclean bedlinen towels even a curtain upon the window  where did you get all the linen upstairs from mrs cox he asked her when he descended the room was almost empty yesterday and i forgot nearly all the things i meant to bring home from norwich  mrs seymore fentolin sent down a hamper for you the woman replied with a message from mr fentolin he said that nothing among the oddments left by your father had been preserved but that you were welcome to anything you desired if you would let them know at the hall  it is very kind of both of them hamel said thoughtfully  the woman stood still for a moment looking at him then she drew a step nearer  has mr fentolin given you the key of the shed she asked very quietly  hamel shook his head  we dont need the place do we  he did not give you the key she persisted  mr fentolin said that he had some things in there which he wished to keep locked up he explained  she remained thoughtful for several moments then she turned away  no she said it was not likely he would not give you that key  hamel dined simply but comfortably mrs cox cleared away the things brought him his coffee and appeared a few minutes later her shawl wrapped around her ready for departure  i shall be here at seven oclock in the morning sir she announced  hamel was a little startled he withdrew the pip from his mouth and looked at her  why of course he remarked id forgotten there is no place for you to stay here  i shall go back to my brothers she said  hamel put some money upon the table  please get anything that is necessary he directed i shall leave you to do the housekeeping for a few days  shall you be staying here long sir she asked  i am not sure he replied  i do not suppose she said that you will stay for very long i shall get only the things that you require from day to day good night sir  she left the room hamel looked after her for a moment with a frown in some indescribable way the woman half impressed half irritated him she had always the air of keeping something in the background he followed her out on to the little ridge of beach a few minutes after she had left the mist was still drifting about only a few yards away the sea rolled in filling the air with dull thunder the marshland was half obscured st davids hall was invisible but like strangelyhung lanterns in an empty space he saw the line of lights from the great house gleam through the obscurity there was no sound save the sound of the sea he shivered slightly it was like an empty land this  then moved by some instinct of curiosity he made his way round to the closed door of the boathouse only to find it as he had expected locked he shook it slightly without result then he strolled round to the back entered his own little abode by the kitchen and tried the other door which led into the boathouse it was not only locked but a staple had been put in and it was fastened with a padlock of curious design which he did not remember to have seen there before again half unconsciously he listened and again he found the silence oppressive he went back to his room brought out some of the books which it had been his intention to study and sat and read over the fire  at ten oclock he went to bed as he threw open his window before undressing it seemed to him that he could catch the sound of voices from the sea he listened intently a grey pall hung everywhere to the left with strange indistinctness almost like something human struggling to assert itself came the fitful flash from the light at the entrance to the tidal way once more he strained his ears this time there was no doubt about it he heard the sound of fishermens voices he heard one of them say distinctly  hard aport dave lad thats fentolins light keep her out a bit steady lad  through a rift in the mist he caught a glimpse of the brown sail of a fishingboat dangerously near the land he watched it alter its course slightly and pass on then again there was silence he undressed slowly and went to bed  later on he woke with a start and sat up in bed listening intently listening for he knew not what except for the backward scream of the pebbles dragged down every few seconds by the receding waves an unbroken silence seemed to prevail he struck a match and looked at his watch it was exactly three oclock he got out of bed he was a man in perfect health ignorant of the meaning of nerves a man of proved courage yet he was conscious that his pulses were beating with absurd rapidity a new feeling seemed to possess him he could almost have declared that he was afraid what sound had awakened him he had no idea yet he seemed to have a distinct and absolute conviction that it had been a real sound and no dream he drew aside the curtains and looked out of the window the mist now seemed to have become almost a fog to have closed in upon sea and land there was nothing whatever to be seen as he stood there for a moment listening his face became moist with the drifting vapour suddenly upon the beach he saw what at first he imagined must be an optical illusiona long shaft of light invisible in itself except that it seemed to slightly change the density of the mist he threw on an overcoat over his pyjamas thrust on his slippers and taking up his own electric torch hastily descended the stairs he opened the front door and stepped out on to the beach he stood in the very place where the light had seemed to be and looked inland there was no sign of any human person not a sound except the falling of the sea upon the pebbly beach he raised his voice and called out somehow or other speech seemed to be a relief  hullo  there was no response he tried again  is any one there  still no answer he watched the veiled light from the harbour appear and disappear it threw no shadow of illumination upon the spot to which he had gazed from his window one window at st davids hall was illuminated the rest of the place was wrapped now in darkness he walked up to the boathouse the door was still locked there was no sign that any one had been there reluctantly at last he reentered the tower and made his way upstairs  confound that fellow kinsley he muttered as he threw off his overcoat all his silly suggestions and melodramatic ideas have given me a fit of nerves i am going to bed and i am going to sleep that couldnt have been a light i saw at all i couldnt have heard anything i am going to sleep     chapter xxvii  hamel awoke to find his room filled with sunshine and a soft wind blowing in through the open window there was a pleasant odour of coffee floating up from the kitchen he looked at his watchit was past eight oclock the sea was glittering and bespangled with sunlight he found among his scanty belongings a bathing suit and wrapped in his overcoat hurried downstairs  breakfast in half an hour mrs cox he called out  she stood at the door watching him as he stepped across the pebbles and plunged in for a few moments he swam then he turned over on his back the sunlight was gleaming from every window of st davids hall he even fancied that upon the terrace he could see a whiteclad figure looking towards him he turned over and swam once more from her place in the doorway mrs cox called out to him  mind the dagger rocks sir  he waved his hand the splendid exhilaration of the salt water seemed to give him unlimited courage he dived but the womans cry of fear soon recalled him presently he swam to shore and hurried up the beach mrs cox with a sigh of relief disappeared into the kitchen  those rocks on your nerves again mrs cox he asked goodhumouredly as he took his place at the breakfast table a quarter of an hour later  its only us who live here sir she answered who know how terrible they are theres oneit comes up like my handa long spike a boat once struck upon that and its as though itd been sawn through the middle  i must have a look at them some day he declared i am going to work this morning mrs cox lunch at one oclock  he took rugs and established himself with a pile of books at the back of a grassy knoll sheltered from the wind with the sea almost at his feet he sharpened his pencil and numbered the page of his notebook then he looked up towards the hall garden and found himself dreaming the sunshine was delicious and a gentle optimism seemed to steal over him  i am a fool he murmured to himself i am catching some part of these peoples folly mr fentolin is only an ordinary crotchety invalid with queer tastes on the big things he is probably like other men i shall go to him this morning  a seagull screamed over his head little brown sailed fishingboats came gliding down the harbourway a pleasant sensuous joyfulness seemed part of the spirit of the day hamel stretched himself out upon the dry sand  work be hanged he exclaimed  a soft voice answered him almost in his ear a voice which was becoming very familiar  a most admirable sentiment my young friend which you seem to be doing your best to live up to not a line written i see  he sat up upon his rug mr fentolin in his little carriage was there by his side behind was the faithful meekins with an easel under his arm  i trust that your first night in your new abode has been a pleasant one mr fentolin asked  i slept quite well thanks hamel replied glad to see youre going to paint  mr fentolin shook his head gloomily  it is alas he declared one of my weaknesses i can work only in solitude i came down on the chance that the fine weather might have tempted you over to the golf club as it is i shall return  i am awfully sorry hamel said cant i go out of sight somewhere  mr fentolin sighed  i will not ask your pardon for my absurd humours he continued a little sadly their existence however i cannot deny i will wait  it seems a pity for you to do that hamel remarked you see i might stay here for some time  mr fentolins face darkened he looked at the young man with a sort of pensive wrath  if the latter went on you say yes to something i am going to ask you i might even stayin the neighbourhoodfor longer still  mr fentolin sat quite motionless in his chair his eyes were fixed upon hamel  what is it that you are going to ask me he demanded  i want to marry your niece  mr fentolin looked at the young man in mild surprise  a sudden decision on your part mr hamel he murmured  not at all hamel assured him i have been ten years looking for her  and the young lady mr fentolin enquired what does she say  i believe sir hamel replied that she would be willing  mr fentolin sighed  one is forced sometimes he remarked regretfully to realise the selfishness of our young people for many years one devotes oneself to providing them with all the comforts and luxuries of life then in a single day they turn around and give everything they have to give to a stranger so you want to marry esther  if you please  she has a very moderate fortune  she need have none at all hamel replied i have enough  mr fentolin glanced towards the house  then he said i think you had better go and tell her so in which case i shall be able to paint  i have your permission then hamel asked rising to his feet eagerly  negatively mr fentolin agreed you have i cannot refuse esther is of age the thing is reasonable i do not know whether she will be happy with you or not a young man of your disposition who declines to study the whims of an unfortunate creature like myself is scarcely likely to be possessed of much sensibility however perhaps your views as to a solitary residence here will change with your engagement to my niece  hamel did not reply for a moment he was trying to ask himself why even in the midst of this rush of anticipatory happiness he should be conscious of a certain reluctance to leave the towerand mr fentolin he was looking longingly towards the hall mr fentolin waved him away  go and make love he ordered and leave me alone we are both in pursuit of beautyonly our methods differ  hamel hesitated no longer but walked up the narrow path with swift buoyant footsteps everywhere he seemed to be surrounded by the glorious spring sunshine it glittered in the little pools and creeks by his side it drew a new colour from the duncoloured marshes the masses of emerald seaweed the shimmering sands it flashed in the long row of windows of the hall as he drew nearer he could see the banks of yellow crocuses in the sloping gardens behind there were odours of spring in the air he ran lightly up the terrace steps there was an easychair drawn into her favourite corner and a book upon the table but no sign of esther he hesitated for a moment and then retracing his steps along the terrace entered the house by the front door which stood wide open there was no one in the hall scarcely a sound about the place a great clock ticked solemnly from the foot of the stairs there was not even a servant in sight hamel wandered around a a loss what to do he opened the door of the drawingroom and looked in it was empty he turned away meaning to ring a bell on his way across the hall he paused a curiously suggestive sound reached him faintly from the end of one of the passages it was the click of a typewriter  hamel stood for a moment perfectly still he had hurried up to the hall filled with the one selfish joy common to all mankind he had had no thought save the thought of seeing esther the click of that machine brought him hack to the stern realities of life he remembered his talk to kinsley his promise on the hall table he could see from where he was standing the great headlines which announced the nations anxiety he was in the house of a suspected spy the click of the typewriter was an accompaniment to his thought he looked around once more and listened then he made his way quietly across the hail and down the long passage at the end of which the room which mr fentolin called his workroom was situated he turned the handle of the door and entered closing it immediately behind him the woman who was typing paused with her fingers upon the keys her eyes met his coldly without curiosity she had paused in her work but she took no other notice of his coming  has mr fentolin sent you here she asked at last  he came over to the typewriter  mr fentolin has not sent me he said slowly i am here on my own account i dare say you will think that i am a lunatic to come to you like this nevertheless please listen to me  her fingers left the keys she laid her hands upon the table in front of her he drew a little nearer she covered over the sheets of paper with which she was surrounded with a pad of blottingpaper he pointed suddenly to them  why do you do that he demanded what is there in your work that you are afraid i might see  she answered him without hesitation  these are private papers of mr fentolins no one has any business to see them no one has any business to enter this room why are you here  i came to the hall to find miss fentolin he replied i heard the click of your typewriter i came to you i suppose i should say on impulse  her eyes rested upon his filled with a cold and questioning light  theres an impression up in london hamel went on that mr fentolin has been interfering by means of his wireless in affairs which dont concern him and giving away valuable information this man dunsters disappearance is as yet unexplained i feel myself justified in making certain investigations and among the first of them i should like you to tell me exactly the nature of the work for which mr fentolin finds a secretary necessary  she glanced towards the bell he moved to the edge of the table as though to intercept her  in any ordinary case he continued i would not ask you to betray your employers confidence as things are i think i am justified you are english are you not you realise i suppose that the country is on the brink of war  she looked at him from the depths of her still lusterless eyes  you must be a very foolish person she remarked if you expect to obtain information in this manner  perhaps i am he confessed but my folly has brought me to you and you can give me the information if you will  where is mr fentolin she asked  down at the tower he replied i left him there he sent me up to see miss fentolin i was looking for her when the click of your typewriter reminded me of other things  she turned composedly back to her work  i think she said that you had better go and find miss fentolin  dont talk nonsense you cant think i have risked giving myself away to you for nothing i mean to search this room to read the papers which you are typing  she glanced around her a little contemptuously  you are welcome she assured him pray proceed  they exchanged the glances of duelists her plain black frock was buttoned up to her throat her colourless face seemed set in exact and expressionless lines her eyes were like windows of glass he felt only their scrutiny nothing of the reason for it or of the thoughts which stirred behind in her brain there was nothing about her attitude which seemed in any way threatening yet he had the feeling that in this interview it was she who possessed the upper hand  you are a foolish person she said calmly you are so foolish that you are not in all probability in the slightest degree dangerous believe me ours is an unequal duel there is a bell upon this table which has apparently escaped your notice i sit with my finger upon the buttonso i have only to press it and the servants will be here i do not wish to press it i do not desire that you should be as you certainly would be banished from this house  he was immensely puzzled she had not resented his strange intrusion she had accepted it indeed with curious equanimity her forefinger lingered still over the little ivory knob of the bell attached to her desk he shrugged his shoulders  you have the advantage of me he admitted a little curtly all the same i think i could possess myself of those sheets of paper you know before the bell was answered  would it be wise i wonder then to ensure their safety she asked coolly  her finger pressed the bell he took a quick step forward she held out her hand  stop she ordered these sheets will tell you nothing which you do not know already unless you are a fool never mind the bell that is my affair i am sending you away  he leaned a little towards her  it wouldnt be possible to bribe you i suppose  she shook her head  i wonder you havent tried that before no it would notnot with money that is to say  youll tell mr fentolin i presume he asked quickly  i have nothing to tell him she replied nothing has happened richards she went on as a servant entered the room mr hamel is looking for miss fentolin will you see if you can find her  the mans expression was full of polite regret  miss fentolin went over to legh woods early this morning sir he announced she is staying to lunch with lady saxthorpe  hamel stood quite still for a moment then he turned to the window in the far distance he could catch a glimpse of the tower mr fentolins chair had disappeared from the walk  i am sorry he said i must have made a mistake i will hurry back  there were more questions which he was longing to ask but the cold negativeness of her manner chilled him she sat with her fingers poised over the keys waiting for his departure he turned and left the room     chapter xxviii  mr fentolin his carriage drawn up close to the beach was painting steadily when hamel stood once more by his side his eyes moved only from the sea to the canvas he never turned his head  so your wooing has not prospered my young friend he remarked gently i am sorry is there anything i can do  your niece has gone out to lunch hamel replied shortly  mr fentolin stopped painting his face was full of concern as he looked up at hamel  my dear sir he exclaimed how can i apologise of course she has gone out to lunch she has gone out to lady saxthorpes i remember the subject being discussed i myself in fact was the instigator of her going i owe you a thousand apologies mr hamel let me make what amends are possible for your useless journey dine with us tonight  you are very kind  a poor amends mr fentolin continued a morning like this was made for lovers sunshine and blue sky a salt breeze flavoured just a little with that lavender and a stroll through my spring gardens where my hyacinths are like a field of purple and gold a mantle of jewels upon the brown earth ah well ones thoughts will wander to the beautiful things of life there were once women who loved me mr hamel  hamel looked doubtfully at the strange little figure in the chair was this genuine he wondered a voluntary outburst or was it some subtle attempt to incite sympathy mr fentolin seemed almost to have read his thought  it is not for the sake of your pity that i say this he continued mine is only the passing across the line which age as well as infirmity makes inevitable no one in the world who lives to grow old and who has loved and felt the fire of it in his veins can pass that line without sorrow or look back without a pang i am among a great army well well i shall paint no more today he concluded abruptly  where is your servant hamel asked  mr fentolin glanced around him carelessly  he has wandered away out of sight he knows well how necessary solitude is to me if once i take the brush between my fingerssolitude natural and entire i mean if any one is within a dozen yards of me i know it even though i cannot see them meekins is wandering somewhere the other side of the tower  shall i call him  on no account mr fentolin begged presently he will appear in plenty of time there is the morning to be passedbarely eleven oclock i think now i shall sit in my chair and sink a little down and dream of these beautiful lights these rolling foamflecked waves these patches of blue and shifting green i can form them in my brain i can make a picture there even though my fingers refuse to move you are not an aesthete i think mr hamel the study of beauty does not mean to you what it did to your father and my father and in a smaller way to me  perhaps not hamel confessed i believe i feel these things somewhere because they bring a queer sense of content with them i am afraid though that my artistic perceptions are not so keen as some mens  mr fentolin looked at him thoughtfully  it is the physical life in your veinstoo splendid to permit you abstract pleasures compensations again you seecompensations i wonder what the law is that governs these things i have forgotten sometimes he went on forgotten my own infirmities in the soft intoxication of a wonderful seascape only he went on his face a little grey it is the physical in life which triumphs there are the hungry hours which nothing will satisfy  his head sank his chin rested upon his chest he had all the appearance now of a man who talks in bitter earnest yet hamel wondered he looked towards the tower there was no sign of meekins the seagulls went screaming above their heads mr fentolin never moved his eyes seemed half closed it was only when hamel rose to his feet that he looked swiftly up  stay with me i beg you mr hamel he said i am in one of the moods when solitude even for a moment is dangerous do you know what i have sometimes thought to myself  he pointed to the planked way which led down the steep pebbly beach to the sea  i have sometimes thought he went on that it would be glorious to find a friend to stand by my side at the top of the planks just there when the tide was high and to bid him loose my chair and to steer it myself to steer it down the narrow path into the arms of the sea the first touch of the salt waves the last touch of life why not one sleeps without fear  he lifted his head suddenly meekins had appeared coming round from the back of the tower instantly mr fentolins whole manner changed he sat up in his chair  it is arranged then he said you dine with us tonight for the other matters of which you have spoken well let them rest in the hands of the gods you are not very kind to me i am not sure whether you would make esther a good husband i am not sure even that i like you you take no pains to make yourself agreeable considering that your father was an artist you seem to me rather a dull and uninspired young man but who can tell there may be things stirring beneath that torpid brain of yours of which no other person knows save yourself  the concentrated gaze of mr fentolins keen eyes was hard to meet but hamel came out of the ordeal without flinching  at eight oclock mr fentolin he answered i can see that i must try to earn your better opinion  hamel read steadily for the remainder of the morning it was past one oclock when he rose stiffly from his seat among the sand knolls and strolling back to the tower opened the door and entered the cloth was laid for luncheon in the little sittingroom but there were no signs of hannah cox he passed on into the kitchen and came to a sudden standstill once more the memory of his own work passed away from him once more he was back again among that queer clouded tangle of strange suspicions of thrilling halfformed fears which had assailed him at times ever since his arrival at st davids he stopped quite short the words which rose to his lips died away he felt the breathless compelling need for silence and grew tense in the effort to make no sound  hannah cox was kneeling on the stone floor her ear was close to the crack of the door which led into the boathouse her face half turned from it was set in a strange concentrated passion of listening her lips were parted her eyes half closed she took no more notice of hamel or his arrival than if he had been some useless piece of furniture every faculty seemed to be absorbed in that one intense effort of listening there was no need of her outstretched finger hamel fell in at once with a mood so mesmeric he too listened the small clock which she had brought with her from the village ticked away upon the mantelpiece the full sea fell with placid softness upon the high beach outside some slight noise of cooking came from the stove save for these things there was silence yet for a space of time which hamel could never have measured they both listened when at last the woman rose to her feet hamel finding words at last was surprised to find that his throat was dry  what is it mrs cox he asked why were you listening there  her face was absolutely expressionless she was busying herself now with a small saucepan and her back was turned towards him  i spend my life sir she said listening and waiting one never knows when the end may come  but the boathouse hamel objected no one has been in there his morning have they  who can tell she answered he could go anywhere when he chose or how he chosethrough the keyhole if he wanted  but why listen hamel persisted there is nothing in there now but some odds and ends of machinery  she turned from the fire and looked at him for a moment her eyes were colourless her tone unemotional  maybe theres no harm in listening  did you hear anything which made you want to listen  who can tell she answered a woman who lives wellnigh alone as i live in a quiet place hears things so often that other folk never listen to theres always something in my ears night or day sometimes i am not sure whether its in this world or the other it was like that with me just then it was for that reason i listened your luncheons ready sir  hamel walked thoughtfully back into his sittingroom he seated himself before a spotless cloth and watched hannah cox spread out his wellcooked cleanlyserved meal  if theres anything you want sir she said i shall hear you at a word the kitchen door is open  one moment mrs cox  she lingered there patiently with the tray in her hand  there was some sound hamel continued perhaps a real sound perhaps a fancy which made you go down on your knees in the kitchen tell me what it was  the sound i always hear sir she answered quietly i hear it in the night and i hear it when i stand by the sea and look out i have heard it for so many years that who can tell whether it comes from this world or the otherthe cry of men who die  she passed out hamel looked after her for a moment like a man in a dream in his fancy he could see her back again once more in the kitchen kneeling on the stone floorlistening     chapter xxix  a cold twilight had fallen upon the land when hamel left the tower that evening and walked briskly along the footway to the hall little patches of mist hung over the creeks the sky was almost frosty the lights from st davids hall shone like cheerful beacons before him he hastened up the stone steps crossed the terrace and passed into the hall a servant conducted him at once to the drawingroom mrs fentolin in a pink evening dress with a pink ornament in her hair held out both her hands in the background mr fentolin in his queerlycut evening clothes sat with folded arms leaning back in his carriage he listened grimly to his sisterinlaw as she stood with hamels hands in hers  my dear mr hamel she exclaimed how perfectly charming of you to come up and relieve a little our sad loneliness delightful i call it of you i was just saying so to miles  hamel looked around the room already his heart was beginning to sink  miss fentolin is well i hope he asked  well but a very naughty girl her mother declared i let her go to lady saxthorpes to lunch and now we have had simply the firmest letter from lady saxthorpe they insist upon keeping esther to dine and sleep i have had to send her evening clothes but you cant tell mr hamel how i miss her   hamels disappointment was a little too obvious to pass unnoticed there was a shade of annoyance too in his face mr fentolin smoothly intervened  let us be quite candid with mr hamel dear florence he begged i have spoken to my sisterinlaw and told her the substance of our conversation this morning he proceeded wheeling his chair nearer to hamel she is thunderstruck she wishes to reflect to consider esther chanced to be away we have encouraged her absence for a few more hours  i hope mrs fentolin hamel said simply that you will give her to me i am not a rich man but i am fairly well off i should be willing to live exactly where esther wishes and i would do my best to make her happy  mrs fentolin opened her lips once and closed them again she laughed a littlea highpitched semihysterical laugh the hand which gripped her fan was straining so that the blue veins stood out almost like whipcord  esther is very young mr hamel we must talk this over you have known her for such a very short time  a servant announced dinner and hamel offered his arm to his hostess  is gerald away too he asked  we do indeed owe you our apologies mr fentolin declared gerald is spending a couple of days at the dormy house at brancastera golf arrangement made some time back  he promised to play with me tomorrow hamel remarked thoughtfully he said nothing about going away  i fear that like most young men of his age he has little memory mr fentolin sighed however he will be back tomorrow or the next day i owe you my apologies mr hamel for our lack of young people we must do our best to entertain our guest florence you must be at your best dear you must tell him some of those capital stories of yours  mrs fentolin shivered for a moment hamel as he handed her to her place was struck by a strange look which she threw upon him half furtive full of pain her hand almost clung to his she slipped a little and he held her tightly then he was suddenly conscious that something hard was being pressed into his palm he drew his hand away at once  you seem a little unsteady this evening my dear florence mr fentolin remarked peering across the round table  she eyed him nonchalantly enough  the floor is slippery she said i was glad for a moment of mr hamels strong hand where are those dear puppies chowchow she went on come and sit by your mistress at once  hamels fingers inside his waistcoat pocket were smoothing out the crumpled piece of paper which she had passed to him soon he had it quite flat mrs fentolin as though freed from some anxiety chattered away gaily  i dont know that i shall apologise to mr hamel at all for the young people being away she declared just fancy what we have saved him froma solitary meal served by hannah cox do you know that they say she is halfwitted mr hamel  so far she has looked after me very well hamel observed  her intellect is defective mr fentolin remarked on one point only the good woman is obsessed by the idea that her husband and sons are still calling to her from the dagger rocks it is almost pitiful to meet her wandering about there on a stormy night the seacoasts are full of these little village tragediesreal tragedies too however insignificant they may seem to us  mr fentolins tone was gently sympathetic he changed the subject a moment or two later however  nero fiddles tonight he said while rome burns there are hundreds in our position yet it certainly seems queer that we should be sitting here so quietly when the whole country is in such a state of excitement i see the press this morning is preaching an immediate declaration of war  against whom mrs fentolin asked  mr fentolin smiled  that does seem to be rather the trouble he admitted russia austria germany italy and france are all assisting at a conference to which no english representative has been bidden in a sense of course that is equivalent to an act of hostility from all these countries towards england the question is whether we have or have not a secret understanding with france and if so how far she will be bound by it there is a rumour that when monsieur deschelles was asked formally whom he represented that he repliedfrance and great britain there may be something in it it is hard to see how any english statesman could have left unguarded the mediterranean with all that it means trusting simply to the faith of a country with whom we have no binding agreement on the other hand there is the mobilisation of the fleet if france is really faithful one wonders if there was need for such an extreme step  i am out of touch with political affairs hamel declared i have been away from england for so long  i on the other hand mr fentolin continued his eyes glittering a little have made the study of the political situation in europe my hobby for years i have sent to me the leading newspapers of berlin rome paris st petersburg and vienna for two hours every day i read them side by side it is curious sometimes to note the common understanding which seems to exist between the powers not bound by any formal alliance for years war seemed a very unlikely thing and now he added leaning forward in his chair i pronounce it almost a certainty  hamel looked at his host a little curiously mr fentolins gentleness of expression seemed to have departed his face was hard his eyes agleam he had almost the look of a bird of prey for some reason the thought of war seemed to be a joy to him perhaps he read something of hamels wonder in his expression for with a shrug of the shoulders he dismissed the subject  well he concluded all these things lie on the knees of the gods i dare say you wonder mr hamel why a poor useless creature like myself should take the slightest interest in passing events it is just the fascination of the lookeron i want your opinion about that champagne florence dear you must join us we will drink to mr hamels health we will perhaps couple that toast in our minds with the sentiment which i am sure is not very far from your thoughts florence  hamel raised his glass and bowed to his host and hostess he was not wholly at his ease it seemed to him that he was being watched with a queer persistence by both of them mrs fentolin continued to talk and laugh with a gaiety which was too obviously forced mr fentolin posed for a while as the benevolent listener he mildly applauded his sisterinlaws stories and encouraged hamel in the recital of some of his reminiscences suddenly the door was opened miss price appeared she walked smoothly across the room and stood by mr fentolins side stooping down she whispered in his ear he pushed his chair back a little from the table his face was dark with anger  i said not before ten tonight he muttered  again she spoke in his ear so softly that the sound of her voice itself scarcely travelled even as far as where hamel was sitting mr fentolin looked steadfastly for a moment at his sisterinlaw and from her to hamel then he backed his chair away front the table  i shall have to ask to be excused for three minutes he said i must speak upon the telephone it is a call from some one who declares that they have important news  he turned the steeringwheel of his chair and with miss price by his side passed across the diningroom out of the oasis of roseshaded lights into the shadows and through the open door from there he turned his head before he disappeared as though to watch his guest mrs fentolin was busy fondling one of her dogs which she had raised to her lap and hamel was watching her with a tolerant smile  koto you little idiot why cant you sit up like your sister was its tail in the way then mr hamel she whispered under her breath so softly that he barely caught the words although he was only a few feet away dont look at me i feel as though we were being watched all the time you can destroy that piece of paper in your pocket all that it says is leave here immediately after dinner  hamel sipped his wine in a nonchalant fashion his fingers had strayed over the silky coat of the little dog which she had held out as though for his inspection  how can i he asked what excuse can i make  invent one she insisted swiftly leave here before ten oclock dont let anything keep you and destroy that piece of paper in your pocket if you cannow  but mrs fentolin he began  she caught up one of her absurd little pets and held it to her mouth  meekins is in the doorway she whispered  dont argue with me please you are in danger you know nothing about pass me the cigarettes  she leaned back in her chair smoking quickly she held one of the dogs on her knee and talked rubbish to it hamel watched her leaning back in his carved oak chair and he found it hard to keep the pity from his eyes the woman was playing a part playing it with desperate and pitiful earnestness a part which seemed the more tragical because of the soft splendour of their surroundings from the shadowy walls huge dimlyseen pictures hung about them a strange and yet impressive background their small round diningtable with its rare cut glass its perfect appointments its bowls of pink roses was like a spot of wonderful colour in the great room two men servants stood at the sideboard a few yards away a triumph of negativeness the butler who had been absent for a moment stood now silently waiting behind his masters place hamel was oppressed during those few minutes of waiting by a curious sense of unreality as though he were taking part in some strange tableau there was something unreal about his surroundings and his own presence there something unreal in the atmosphere charged as it seemed to be with some omen of impending happenings something unreal in that whispered warning those few hoarsely uttered words which had stolen to his hearing across the clusters of drooping roses the absurd babble of the woman who sat there with tragic things under the powder with which her face was daubed  koto must learn to sit upon his taillike that no not another grape till he sits up there then  she was leaning forward with a grape between her teeth towards the tiny animal who was trying in vain to balance his absurdly shaped little body upon the tablecloth hamel without looking around knew quite well what was happening soon he heard the click of the chair mr fentolin was back in his place his skin seemed paler and more parchmentlike than ever his eyes glittered  it seems he announced quietly as he raised his wineglass to his lips with the air of one needing support that we entertained an angel unawares here this mr dunster is lost for the second time a very important personage he turns out to be  you mean the american whom gerald brought home after the accident mrs fentolin asked carelessly  mr fentolin replied he insisted upon continuing his journey before he was strong enough i warned him of what might happen he has evidently been take ill somewhere it seems that he was on his way to the hague  do you mean that he has disappeared altogether this time hamel asked  mr fentolin shook his head  no he has found his way to the hague safely enough he is lying there at a hotel in the city but he is unconscious there is some talk about his having been robbed on the way at any rate they are tracing his movements backwards we are to be honoured with a visit from one of scotland yards detectives to reconstruct his journey from here our quiet little corner of the world is becoming quite notorious florence dear you are tired i can see it in your eyes your headache continues i am sure we will not be selfish mr hamel and i are going to have a long evening in the library let me recommend a phenacetin and bed  she rose at once to her feet with a dog under either arm  ill take the phenacetin she promised but i hate going to bed early shall i see you again i wonder mr hamel  not this evening i fear he answered i am going to ask mr fentolin to excuse me early  she passed out of the room hamel escorted her as far as the door and then returned mr fentolin was sitting quite still in his chair his eyes were fixed upon the tablecloth he looked up quickly as hamel resumed his seat  you are not in earnest i hope mr hamel he said when you tell me that you must leave early i have been anticipating a long evening my library is filled with books on south america which i want to discuss with you  another evening if you dont mind hamel begged tonight i must ask you to excuse my hurrying away  mr fentolin looked up from underneath his eyelids his glance was quick and penetrating  why this haste  hamel shrugged his shoulders  to tell you the truth he admitted i had an idea while i was reading an article on cantilever bridges this morning i want to work it out  mr fentolin glanced behind him the door of the diningroom was closed the servants had disappeared meekins alone looking more like a prize fighter than ever in his somber evening clothes had taken the place of the butler behind his masters chair  we shall see mr fentolin said quietly     chapter xxx  mr fentolin pointed to the little pile of books upon the table the deep easychair the greenshaded lamps the decanter of wine he had insisted upon a visit however brief to the library  it is a students appeal which i make to you mr hamel he said with a whimsical smile here we are in my study with the door closed secure against interruption a bright fire in the grate a bowling and everincreasing wind outside let us go together over the ground of your last wonderful expedition over the andes you will find that i am not altogether ignorant of your profession or of those very interesting geological problems which you spoke of in connection with that marvellous railway scheme we will discuss them side by side as sybarites hang ourselves around with cigarette smoke drink wine and presently coffee it is necessary is it not for many reasons that we become better acquainted you realise that i am sure and you will not persist in returning to your selfish solitude  hamels eyes were fixed a little longingly upon some of the volumes with which the table was covered  you must not think me ungrateful or churlish mr fentolin he begged i have a habit of keeping promises which i make to myself and tonight i have made myself a promise that i will be back at the tower by ten oclock  you are obdurate mr fentolin asked softly  i am afraid i am  mr fentolin busied himself with the handle of his chair  tell me he insisted is there any other person save yourself to whom you have given this mysterious promise  no one hamel replied promptly  i am a person very sensitive to atmosphere mr fentolin continued slowly since the unfortunate visit of this man dunster i seem to have been conscious of a certain suspicion a little cloud of suspicion under which i seem to live and move even among the members of my own household my sisterinlaw is nervous and hysterical gerald has been sullen and disobedient esther has avoided me and nowwell i find even your attitude a little difficult to understand what does it mean mr hamel  hamel shook his head  i am not in the confidence of the different members of your family he answered so far as i personally am concerned  it pleases me sometimes mr fentolin interrupted to interfere to some extent in the affairs of the outside world if i do so that is my business i do it for my own amusement it is at no time a serious position which i take up have i by any chance mr hamel become an object of suspicion to you  there are matters in which you are concerned hamel admitted which i do not understand but i see no purpose in discussing them  mr fentolin wheeled his chair round in a semicircle he was now between the door and hamel  weaker mortals than i mr hamel he said calmly have wielded before now the powers of life and death from my chair i can make the lightnings bite science has done away with the triumph of muscularity even as we are here together at this moment mr hamel if we should disagree it is i who am the preordained victor  hamel saw the glitter in his hand this was the end then of all doubt he remained silent  suspicions which are in a sense absurd mr fentolin continued have grown until i find them obtrusive and obnoxious what have i to do with mr john p dunster i sent him out from my house if he is lost or ill the affair is not mine yet one by one those around me are falling away i told you an hour ago that gerald was at brancaster it is a lie he has left this house but no soul in it knows his destination  hamel started  you mean that he has run away  mr fentolin nodded  all that i can surmise is that he has followed dunster he proceeded he has an idea that in some way i robbed or injured the man he has broken the bond of relationship between us he has broken his solemn vow he has run a grave and terrible risk  what of miss esther hamel asked quickly  i have sent her away mr fentolin replied until we come to a clear understanding you and i you seem to be a harmless enough person mr hamel but appearances are sometimes deceptive it has been suggested to me that you are a spy  by whom hamel demanded  by those in whom i trust mr fentolin told him sternly you are a friend of reginald kinsley you met him in norwich the other daysecretly kinsleys chief is a member of the government he is one of those who will find eternal obloquy if the hague conference comes to a successful termination for some strange reason i am supposed to have robbed or harmed the one man in the world whose message might bring to nought that conference are you here to watch me mr hamel are you one of those who believe that i am either in the pay of a foreign country or that my harmless efforts to interest myself in great things are efforts inimical to this country that i am in short a traitor  you must admit that many of your actions are incomprehensible hamel replied slowly there are things here which i do not understandwhich certainly require explanation  still why do you make them your business mr fentolin persisted if indeed the course which i steer is a harmless one he continued with a strange new glitter in his eyes then you are an impertinent stranger to whom my doors cannot any longer be open if you have taken advantage of my hospitality to spy upon me and my actions if indeed you have a mission here then you can carry it with you down into hell  i understand that you are threatening me hamel murmured  mr fentolin smiled  scarcely that my young friend i am not quite the obvious sort of villain who flourishes revolvers and lures his victims into secret chambers these words to you are simply words of warning i am not like other men neither am i used to being crossed when i am crossed i am dangerous leave here if you will in safety and mind your own affairs but if you show one particle of curiosity as to mine if you interfere in matters which concern me and me only remember that you are encircled by powers which are entirely ruthless absolutely omnipotent you can walk back to the tower tonight and remember that there isnt a step you take which might not be your last if i willed it and never a soul the wiser theres a very hungry little mother here who takes her victims and holds them tight you can hear her calling to you now listen  he held up his finger the tide had turned and through the halfopen window came the low thunder of the waves  you decline to share my evening mr fentolin concluded let it be so go your own way hamel only take care that your way does not cross mine  he backed his chair slowly and pressed the bell hamel felt himself dismissed he passed out into the hall the door of the drawingroom stood open and he heard the sound of mrs fentolins thin voice singing some little french song he hesitated and then stepped in with one hand she beckoned him to her continuing to play all the time he stepped over to her side  i come to make my adieux he whispered with a glance towards the door  you are leaving then she asked quickly  he nodded  mr fentolin is in a strange humour she went on a moment later after she had struck the final chords of her song there are things going on around us which no one can understand i think that one of his schemes has miscarried he has gone too far he suspects you i cannot tell you why or how if only you would go away  what about esther he asked quietly  you must leave her she cried with a little catch in her throat gerald has broken away esther and i must carry still the burden  she motioned him to go he touched her fingers for a moment  mrs fentolin he said i have been a good many years making up my mind now that i have done so i do not think that any one will keep esther from me  she looked at him a little pitifully a little wistfully then with a shrug of the shoulders she turned round to the piano and recommenced to play hamel took his coat and hat from a servant who was waiting in the hail and passed out into the night  he walked briskly until he reached the tower the wind had risen but there was still enough light to help him on his way the little building was in complete darkness he opened the door and stepped into the sittingroom lit the lamp and holding it over his head went down the passage and into the kitchen then he gave a start the lamp nearly slipped from his fingers kneeling on the stone floor in very much the same attitude as he had found her earlier in the day hannah cox was crouching patiently by the door which led into the boathouse her face expressionless her ear turned towards the crack she was still listening     chapter xxxi  hamel set down the lamp upon the table he glanced at the little clock upon the dresser it was a quarter past ten the woman had observed his entrance although it seemed in no way to have discomposed her  do you know the time mrs cox he asked you ought to have been home hours ago what are you doing there  she rose to her feet her expression was one of dogged but patient humility  i started for home before nine oclock sir she told him but it was worse than ever tonight all the way along by the sea i seemed to hear their voices so i came back i came back to listen i have been listening for an hour  hamel looked at her with a frown upon his forehead  mrs cox he said i wish i could understand what it is that you have in your mind those are not real voices that you hear you cannot believe that  not real voices she repeated without the slightest expression in her tone  of course not and tell me what connection you find between these fancies of yours and that room why do you come and listen here  i do not know she answered patiently  you must have some reason he persisted  i have no reason she assured him only some day i shall see behind these doors afterwards i shall hear the voices no more  she was busy tying a shawl around her head hamel watched her still puzzled he could not get rid of the idea that there was some method behind her madness  tell mei have found you listening here before have you ever heard anything suspicious  i have heard nothing yet she admitted nothing that counts  come he continued couldnt we clear this matter up sensibly do you believe that there is anybody in there do you believe the place is being used in any way for a wrong purpose if so we will insist upon having the keys from mr fentolin he cannot refuse the place is mine  mr fentolin would not give you the keys sir she replied if he did it would be useless  would you like me to break the door in hamel asked  you could not do it sir she told him not you nor anybody else the door is thicker than my fist of solid oak it was a mechanic from new york who fitted the locks i have heard it said in the villagebill hamas the carpenter declares that there are double doors the workmen who were employed here were housed in a tent upon the beach and sent home the day they finished their job they were never allowed in the village they were foreigners most of them they came from nobody knows where and when they had finished they disappeared why was that sir what is there inside which mr fentolin needs to guard so carefully  mr fentolin has invented something hamel explained he keeps the model in there inventors are very jealous of their work  she looked down upon the floor for a moment  i shall be here at seven oclock in the morning sir i will give you your breakfast at the usual time  hamel opened the door for her  good night mrs cox he said would you like me to walk a little way with you its a lonely path to the village and the dikes are full  thank you no sir she replied its a lonely way right enough but it isnt loneliness that frightens me i am less afraid out with the winds and the darkness than under this roof if i lose my way and wander all night upon the marsh ill be safer out there than you sir  she passed away and hamel watched her disappear into the darkness then he dragged out a bowl of tobacco and filled a pipe although he was half ashamed of himself he strolled back once more into the kitchen and drawing up a stool he sat down just where he had discovered hannah cox sat still and listened no sound of any sort reached him he sat there for ten minutes then he scrambled to his feet  she is mad of course he muttered  he mixed himself a whisky and soda relit his pipe which had gone out and drew up an easychair to the fire which she had left him in the sittingroom the wind had increased in violence and the panes of his window rattled continually he yawned and tried to fancy that he was sleepy it was useless he was compelled to admit the truththat his nerves were all on edge in a sense he was afraid the thought of bed repelled him he had not a single impulse towards repose outside the wind all the time was gathering force more than once his window was splashed with the spray carried on by the wind which followed the tide he sat quite still and tried to think calmly tried to piece together in his mind the sequence of events which had brought him to this part of the world and which had led to his remaining where he was an undesired hangeron at the threshold of miles fentolin he had the feeling that tonight he had burned his boats there was no longer any pretence of friendliness possible between him and this strange creature mr fentolin suspected him realised that he himself was suspected but of what hamel moved in his chair restlessly sometimes that gathering cloud of suspicion seemed to him grotesque of what real harm could he be capable this little autocrat who from his chair seemed to exercise such a malign influence upon every one with whom he was brought into contact hamel sighed the riddle was insoluble with a sudden rush of warmer and more joyous feelings he let the subject slip away from him he closed his eyes and dreamed for a while there was a new world before him joys which only so short a time ago he had fancied had passed him by  he sat up in his chair with a start the fire had become merely a handful of grey ashes his limbs were numb and stiff the lamp was flickering out he had been dozing how long he had no idea something had awakened him abruptly there was a cold draught blowing through the room he turned his head his hands still gripping the sides of his chair his heart gave a leap the outer door was a few inches open was being held open by some invisible force there was some one there some one on the point of entering stealthily even as he watched the crack became a little wider he sat with his eyes riveted upon that opening space the unseen hand was still at work every instant he expected to see a face thrust forward the sensation of absolute physical fear by which he was oppressed was a revelation to him he found himself wishing almost feverishly that he was armed the physical strength in which he had trusted seemed to him at that instant a valueless and impotent thing there was a splash of spray or raindrops against the window and through the crack in the door the lamp chimney hissed and spluttered and finally the light went out the room was in sudden darkness hamel sprang then to his feet silence had become an intolerable thing he felt the close presence of another human being creeping in upon him  whos there he cried whos there i say  there was no direct answer only the door was pushed a little further open he had stepped close to it now the sweep of the wind was upon his face although in the black darkness he could see nothing and then a sudden recollection flashed in upon him from his trousers pocket he snatched a little electric torch in an instant his thumb had pressed the button he turned it upon the door the shivering white hand which held it open was plainly in view it was the hand of a woman he stepped swiftly forward a dark figure almost fell into his arms  mrs fentolin he exclaimed aghast  an hysterical cry choked and subdued broke from her lips he half carried half led her to his easychair suddenly steadied by the presence of this unlookedfor emergency he closed the outside door and relit the lamp with firm fingers then he turned to face her and his amazement at this strange visit became consternation  she was still in her dinnergown of black satin but it was soaked through with the rain and hung about her like a black shroud she had lost one shoe and there was a great hole in her silk stocking her hair was all disarranged one of its numerous switches was hanging down over her ear the rouge upon her cheeks had run down on to her neck she sat there looking at him out of her hollow eyes like some trapped animal she was shaking with fear it was fear not faintness which kept her silent  tell me please what is the matter he insisted speaking as indifferently as he could tell me at once what has happened  she pointed to the door  lock it she implored  he turned down the latch and drew the bolt the sound seemed to give her a little courage her fingers went to her throat for a moment  give me some water  he poured out some sodawater she drank only a sip and put it down again he began to be alarmed she had the appearance of one who has suddenly lost her senses  please tell me just what has happened he begged if i can help in any way you know i will but you must tell me do you realise that it is three oclock i should have been in bed only i went to sleep over the fire here  i know she answered it is just the wind that has taken away my breath it was a hard struggle to get here listenyou are our friend mr hamelesthers and mine swear that you are our friend  upon my honour i am he assured her you should know that  for eight years she went on her voice clear enough now although it seemed charged with a curious metallic vibration for eight years weve borne it all three of us slaves bound hand and foot lashed with his tongue driven along the path of his desires we have seen evil things we have been on the point of rebellion and hes come a little nearer and hes pointed back he has taken me by the hand and i have walked by the side of his chair loathing it loathing myself out on to the terrace and down below just where it happened you know what happened there mr hamel  you mean where mr fentolin met with his accident  it was no accident she cried glancing for a moment around her it was no accident it was my husband who took him up and threw him over the terrace down below my husband who tried to kill him esthers fathergeralds father miles was in the foreign office then and he did something disgraceful he sold a secret to austria he was always a great gambler and he was in debt seymour found out about it he followed him down here they met upon the terrace ii saw it  he was silent for a moment  no one has known the truth he murmured  no one has ever known she assented and our broken lives have been the price it was miles himself who made the bargain wewe cant go on mr hamel  i begin to understand hamel said softly you suffer everything from miles fentolin because he kept the secret very well that belongs to the past something has happened something tonight which has brought you here tell me about it  once more her voice began to shake  weve seenterrible thingshorrible things she faltered weve held our peace perhaps its been nearly as bad before but weve closed our eyes we havent wanted to know nowwe cant help it mr hamel esther isnt at lord saxthorpes she never went there they didnt ask her and dunsterthe man dunster  where is esther hamel interrupted suddenly  locked up away from you locked up because she rebelled  and dunster  she shook her head her eyes were filled with horror  but he left the halli saw him  she shook her head  it wasnt dunster it was the man miles makes use ofryan the librarian he was once an actor  where is dunster then hamel asked quickly what has become of him  she opened her lips and closed them again struggled to speak and failed she sat there breathing quickly but silent the power of speech had gone     chapter xxxii  hamel for the next few minutes forgot everything else in his efforts to restore to consciousness his unexpected visitor he rebuilt the fire heated some water upon his spirit lamp and forced some hot drink between the lips of the woman who was now almost in a state of collapse then he wrapped her round in his own ulster and drew her closer to the fire he tried during those few moments to put away the memory of all that she had told him gradually she began to recover she opened her eyes and drew a little sigh she made no effort at speech however she simply lay and looked at him like some wounded animal he came over to her side and chafed one of her cold hands  come he said at last you begin to look more like yourself now you are quite safe in here and for esthers sake as well as your own you know that i am your friend  she nodded and her fingers gently pressed his  i am sure of it she murmured  now let us see where we are he continued tell me exactly why you risked so much by leaving st davids hall tonight and coming down here isnt there any chance that he might find out  i dont know she answered it was lucy price who sent me she came to my room just as i was undressing  lucy price he repeated the secretary  yes she told me that she had meant to come to you herself she sent me instead she thought it best this man dunster is being kept alive because there is something miles wants him to tell him and he wont but tonight if he is still alive if he wont tell they mean to make away with him they are afraid  miss price told you this hamel asked gravely  mrs fentolin nodded  yes she said so she knowsshe knows everything she has been like the rest of us she too has suffered she too has reached the breaking point she loved him before the accident she has been his slave ever since listen  she suddenly clutched his arm they were both silent there was nothing to be heard but the wind she leaned a little closer to him  lucy price sent me here tonight because she was afraid that it was tonight they meant to take him from his hidingplace and kill him the police have left off searching for mr dunster in yarmouth and at the hague there is a detective in the neighbourhood and another one on his way here they are afraid to keep him alive any longer  where was mr fentolin when you left hamel asked  i asked lucy price that she replied when she came to my room there were no signs of his leaving she told me to come and tell you everything do you know where mr dunster is  hamel shook his head  within a few yards of here she went on he is in the boathouse the place where miles told you he kept a model of his invention they brought him here the night before they put his clothes on ryan and sent him off disguised as mr dunster in the car to yarmouth  hamel started up but she clutched at his arm and pulled him back no she cried you cant break in there are double doors and a wonderful lock the boathouse is yours the building is yours in the morning you must demand the keysif he does not come tonight  and how are we to know hamel asked if he comes tonight  go outside she whispered look towards st davids hall and tell me how many lights you can see  he drew back the bolt unlatched the door and stepped out into the darkness the wind and the driving rain beat against his face a cloud of spray enveloped and soaked him like lamps hung in the sky the lights of st davids hall shone out through the black gulf he counted them carefully then he stepped back  there are seven he told her closing the door with an effort  she counted upon her fingers  i must come and see she muttered i must be sure help me  he lifted her to her feet and they staggered out together  look she went on gripping his arm you see that row of lights if anything happens if mr fentolin leaves the hall tonight to come down here a light will appear on the left in the far corner we must watch for that light we must watch  the words whispered hoarsely into his ear suddenly died away even as they stood there far away from the other lights another one shone suddenly out in the spot towards which she had pointed and continued to burn steadily he felt the woman who was clinging to his arm become suddenly a dead weight  she was right mrs fentolin moaned he is coming down tonight he is preparing to leave now perhaps he has already started what shall we do what shall we do  hamel was conscious of a gathering sense of excitement he too looked at the signal which was flashing out its message towards them then he gripped his companions arm and almost carried her back into the sittingroom  look here he said firmly you can do nothing further you have done your part and done it well stay where you are and wait the rest belongs to me  but what can you do she demanded her voice shaking with fear meekins will come with him and doctor sarson unless he is here already what can you do against them meekins can break any ordinary mans back and mr fentolin will have a revolver  hamel threw another log on to the fire and drew her chair closer to it  never mind about he declared cheerfully mr fentolin is too clever to attempt violence except as a last resource he knows that i have friends in london who would need some explanation of my disappearance stay here and wait  she recognised the note of authority in his tone and she bowed her head then she looked up at him she was a changed woman  perhaps i have done ill to drag you into our troubles mr hamel she said and yet i believe in you i believe that you really care for esther if you can help us now it will be for your happiness too you are a man god bless you  hamel groped his way round the side of the tower and took up a position at the extreme corner of the landward side of the building within a yard of the closed doors the light far out upon the left was still gleaming brightly but two of the others in a line with it had disappeared he flattened himself against the wall and waited listening intently his eyes straining through the darkness yet they were almost upon him before he had the slightest indication of their presence a single gleam of light in the path come and gone like a flash the gleam of an electric torch directed momentarily towards the road was his first indication that they were near a moment or two later he heard the strange click click of the little engine attached to mr fentolins chair hamel set his teeth and stepped a few inches further back the darkness was so intense that they were actually within a yard or so of him before he could even dimly discern their shapes there were three of themmr fentolin in his chair doctor sarson and meekins they paused for a moment while the latter produced a key hamel distinctly heard a slow soft whisper from doctor sarson  shall i go round to the front and see that he is in bed  no need mr fentolin replied calmly it is nearly four oclock better not to risk the sound of your footsteps upon the pebbles now  the door swung noiselessly open the darkness was so complete that even though hamel could have touched them with an outstretched hand their shapes were invisible hamel who had formed no definite plans had no time to hesitate as the last one disappeared through the door he too slipped in he turned abruptly to the left and holding his breath stood against the wall the door closed behind them the gleam of the electric light flashed across the stone floor and rested for a moment upon a trapdoor which meekins had already stooped to lift it fell back noiselessly upon rubber studs and meekins immediately slipped through it a ladder on either side of which was a grooved stretch of board evidently fashioned to allow mr fentolins carriage to pass down hamel held his breath the moment for him was critical if the light flashed once in his direction he must be discovered both meekins and doctor sarson however were intent upon the task of steering mr fentolins little carriage down below they placed the wheels in the two grooves and meekins secured the carriage with a rope which he let run through his fingers as soon as the little vehicle had apparently reached the bottom he turned thrust the electric torch in his pocket and stepped lightly down the ladder doctor sarson followed his example they disappeared in perfect silence and left the door open presently a gleam of light came travelling up from which hamel knew that they had lit a lamp below very softly he crept across the floor threw himself upon his stomach and peered down below him was a room or rather a cellar parts of which seemed to have been cut out of the solid rock immediately underneath was a plain iron bedstead on which was lying stretched the figure of a man in those first few moments hamel failed altogether to recognise mr dunster he was thin and white and he seemed to have shrunken his face with its coarse growth of beard seemed like the face of an old man yet the eyes were open eyes dull and heavy as though with pain so far no word had been spoken but at that moment mr fentolin broke the silence  my dear guest he said i bring you our most sincere apologies it has gone very much against the grain i can assure you to have neglected you for so long a time it is entirely the fault of the very troublesome young man who occupies the other portion of this building in the daytime his presence makes it exceedingly difficult for us to offer you those little attentions which you might naturally expect  the man upon the bed neither moved nor changed his position in any way nor did he speak all power of initiative seemed to have deserted him he lay quite still his eyes fixed upon mr fentolin  there comes a time the latter continued when every one of us is confronted with what might be described as the crisis of our lives yours has come my guest at precisely this moment it is if my watch tells me the truth five and twenty minutes to four it is the last day of april the year you know you have exactly one minute to decide whether you will live a short time longer or whether you will on this last day of april and beforesay a quarter to four make that little journey the nature of which you and i have discussed more than once  still the man upon the bed made no movement nor any reply mr fentolin sighed and beckoned to doctor sarson  i am afraid he whispered that that wonderful drug of yours doctor has been even a little too farreaching in its results it has kept our friend so quiet that he has lost even the power of speech perhaps even the desire to speak a little restorative i thinkjust a few drops  doctor sarson nodded silently he drew from his pocket a little phial and poured into a wineglass which stood on a table by the side of the bed half a dozen drops of some rubycoloured liquid to which he added a tablespoonful of water then he leaned once more over the bed and poured the contents of the glass between the lips of the semiconscious man  give him two minutes he said calmly he will be able to speak then  mr fentolin nodded and leaned back in his chair he glanced around the room a little critically there was a thick carpet upon the floor a sofa piled with cushions in one corner and several other articles of furniture the walls however were uncovered and were stained with damp a great pink fungus stood out within a few inches of the bed a grim mixture of exquisite colouring and loathsome imperfections the atmosphere was fetid meekins suddenly struck a match and lit some grains of powder in a saucer a curious odour of incense stole through the place mr fentolin nodded appreciatively  that is better he declared really the atmosphere here is positively unpleasant i am ashamed to think that our guest has had to put up with it so long and yet he went on i think we must call it his own fault i trust that he will no longer be obstinate  the effect of the restorative began to show itself the man on the bed moved restlessly his eyes were no longer altogether expressionless he was staring at mr fentolin as one looks at some horrible vision mr fentolin smiled pleasantly  now you are looking more like your old self my dear mr dunster he remarked i dont think that i need repeat what i said when i first came need i you have just to utter that one word and your little visit to us will be at an end  the man looked around at all of them he raised himself a little on his elbow for the first time hamel crouching above recognised any likeness to mr john p dunster  ill see you in hell first  mr fentolins face momentarily darkened he moved a little nearer to the man upon the bed  dunster he said i am in grim earnest never mind arguments never mind why i am on the other side they are restless about you in america unless i can cable that word tomorrow morning theyll communicate direct with the hague and i shall have had my trouble for nothing it is not my custom to put up with failure therefore let me tell you that no single one of my threats has been exaggerated my patience has reached its breaking point give me that word or before four oclock strikes you will find yourself in a new chamber among the corpses of those misguided fishermen mariners of ancient days and a few others its only a matter of fifty yards out to the great sea pit below the dagger rocksive spoken to you about it before havent i so surely as i speak to you of it at this moment  mr fentolins speech came to an abrupt termination a convulsive movement of meekins an expression of blank amazement on the part of doctor sarson had suddenly checked the words upon his lips he turned his head quickly in the direction towards which they had been gazing towards which in fact at that moment meekins with a low cry had made a fruitless spring the ladder down which they had descended was slowly disappearing meekins with a jump missed the last rung by only a few inches some unseen hand was drawing it up already the last few feet were vanishing in midair mr fentolin sat quite quiet and still he looked through the trapdoor and saw hamel  most ingenious and i must confess most successful my young friend he exclaimed pleasantly when you have made the ladder quite secure perhaps you will be so good as to discuss this little matter with us  there was no immediate reply the eyes of all four men were turned now upon that empty space through which the ladder had finally disappeared mr fentolins fingers disappeared within the pocket of his coat something very bright was glistening in his hand when he withdrew it  come and parley with us mr hamel he begged you will not find us unreasonable  hamels voice came back in reply but hamel himself kept well away from the opening  the conditions he said are unpropitious a little time for reflection will do you no harm  the trapdoors were suddenly closed mr fentolins face as he looked up became diabolic  we are trapped he muttered caught like rats in a hole     chapter xxxiii  a gleam of day was in the sky as hamel with mrs fentolin by his side passed along the path which led from the tower to st davids hall lights were still burning from its windows the outline of the building itself was faintly defined against the sky behind him across the sea was that one straight line of grey merging into silver the rain had ceased and the wind had dropped on either side of them stretched the brimming creeks  can we get into the house without waking any one he asked  quite easily she assured him the front door is never barred  she walked by his side swiftly and with surprising vigour in the still grey light her face was more ghastly than ever but there was a new firmness about her mouth a new decision in her tone they reached the hall without further speech and she led the way to a small door on the eastern side through which they entered noiselessly and passed along a little passage out into the hall a couple of lights were still burning the place seemed full of shadows  what are you going to do now she whispered  i want to ring up london on the telephone he replied i know that there is a detective either in the neighbourhood or on his way here but i shall tell my friend that he had better come down himself  she nodded  i am going to release esther she said she is locked in her room the telephone is in the study i will come down there to you  she passed silently up the broad staircase hamel groped his way across the hail into the library he turned on the small electric readinglamp and drew up a chair to the side of the telephone even as he lifted the receiver to his ear he looked around him half apprehensively it seemed as though every moment he would hear the click of mr fentolins chair  he got the exchange at norwich without difficulty and a few minutes later a sleepy reply came from the number he had rung up in london it was kinsleys servant who answered  i want to speak to mr kinsley at once upon most important business hamel announced  very sorry sir the man repelled mr kinsley left town last night for the country  where has he gone hamel demanded quickly you can tell me you know who i am i am mr hamel  into norfolk somewhere sir he went with several other gentlemen  is that bullen hamel asked  the man admitted the fact  can you tell me if any of the people with whom mr kinsley left london were connected with the police he inquired  the man hesitated  i believe so sir he admitted the gentlemen started in a motorcar and were going to drive all night  hamel laid down the receiver at any rate he would not be left long with this responsibility upon him he walked out into the hall the house was still wrapped in deep silence then from somewhere above him coming down the stairs he heard the rustle of a womans gown he looked up and saw miss price fully dressed coming slowly towards him she held up her finger and led the way back into the library she was dressed as neatly as ever but there was a queer light in her eyes  i have seen mrs seymour fentolin she said she tells me that you have left mr fentolin and the others in the subterranean room of the tower  hamel nodded  they have dunster down there he told her i followed them in it seemed the best thing to do i have a friend from london who is on his way down here now with some detective officers to enquire into the matter of dunsters disappearance  are you going to leave them where they are until these people arrive she asked  i think so he replied after a moments hesitation i dont seem to have had time to consider even what to do the opportunity came and i embraced it there they are and they wont dare to do any further harm to dunster now mrs fentolin was down in my room and i thought it best to bring her back first before i even parleyed with them again  you must be careful she advised slowly the man dunster has been drugged he has lost some of his will he may have lost some of his mental balance mr fentolin is clever he will find a dozen ways to wriggle out of any charge that can be brought against him you know what he has really done  i can guess  he has kept back a document signed by the twelve men in america who control the whole of wall street who control practically the money markets of the world that document is a warning to germany that they will have no war against england owing to mr fentolin it has not been delivered and the conference is sitting now war may be declared at any moment  but as a matter of common sense hamel asked why does mr fentolin desire war  you do not understand mr fentolin she told him quietly he is not like other men there are some who live almost entirely for the sake of making others happy who find joy in seeing people content and satisfied mr fentolin is the reverse of this he has but one craving in life to see pain in others to see a human being suffer is to him a debauch of happiness a war which laid this country waste would fill him with a delight which you could never understand there are no normal human beings like this it is a disease in the man a disease which came upon him after his accident  yet you have all been his slaves hamel said curiously  we have all been his slaves she admitted for different reasons before his accident came mr fentolin was my master and the only man in the world for me after his accident i think my feelings for him if anything grew stronger i became his slave i sold my conscience my selfrespect everything in life worth having to bring a smile to his lips to help him through a single moment of his misery and just lately the reaction has come he has played with me just as he would sit and pull the legs out of a spider to watch its agony i have been one of his favourite amusements and even now if he came into this room i think that i should be helpless i should probably fall at his feet and pray for forgiveness  hamel looked at her wonderingly  i have come down to warn you she went on it is possible that this is the beginning of the end that his wonderful fortune will desert him that his star has gone down but remember that he has the brains and courage of genius you think that you have him in a trap dont be surprised when you go back to find that he has turned the tables upon you  impossible hamel declared i looked all round the place there isnt a window or opening anywhere the trapdoor is in the middle of the ceiling and it is fifteen feet from the floor it shuts with a spring  it may be as you say she observed it may be that he is safe remember though if you go near him that he is desperate  do you know where miss fentolin is he interrupted  she is with her mother the woman replied impatiently she is coming down tell me what are you going to do with mr fentolin nothing else matters  i have a friend hamel answered who will see to that  if you are relying upon the law she said i think you will find that the law cannot touch him mr dunster was brought to the house in a perfectly natural manner he was certainly injured and injured in a railway accident doctor sarson is a fully qualified surgeon and he will declare that mr dunster was unfit to travel if necessary they will have destroyed the mans intelligence if you think that you have him broken let me warn you that you may be disappointed let me if i may give you one word of advice  please do hamel begged  she looked at him coldly her tone was still free from any sort of emotion  you have taken up some sort of position here she continued as a friend of mrs seymour fentolin a friend of the family dont let them come back under the yoke you know the secret of their bondage  i know it he admitted  they have been his slaves because their absolute obedience to his will was one of the conditions of his secrecy he has drawn the cords too tight better let the truth be known if needs be than have their three lives broken dont let them go back under his governance for me i cannot tell if he comes back as he will come back i may become his slave again but let them break away listenthat is mrs fentolin  she left him hamel followed her out into the hail esther and her mother were already at the foot of the stairs he drew them into the study esther gave him her hands but she was trembling in every limb  i am terrified she whispered every moment i think i can hear the click of that awful carriage he will come back i am sure he will come back  he may hamel answered sturdily but never to make you people his slaves again you have done enough you have earned your freedom  i agree mrs fentolin said firmly we have gone on from sacrifice to sacrifice until it has become a habit with us to consider him the master of our bodies and our souls today esther we have reached the breaking point not even for the sake of that message from the other side of the grave not even to preserve his honour and his memory can we do more  hamel held up his finger he opened the french windows and they followed him out on to the terrace the grey dawn had broken now over the sea there were gleams of fitful sunshine on the marshes some distance away a large motorcar was coming rapidly along the road     chapter xxxiv  mr john p dunster lying flat upon his little bed watched with dilated eyes the disappearance of the ladder then he laughed it was a queer soundbroken spasmodic devoid of any of the ordinary elements of humorand yet it was a laugh mr fentolin turned his head towards his prisoner and nodded thoughtfully  what a constitution my friend he exclaimed without any trace of disturbance in his voice and what a sense of humour strange that a trifling circumstance like this should affect it meekins burn some more of the powder the atmosphere down here may be salubrious but i am unaccustomed to it  perhaps mr dunster said in a hollow tone you will have some opportunity now of discovering with me what it is like  that too is just possible mr fentolin admitted blowing out a little volume of smoke from a cigarette which he had just lit but one never knows we have friends and our position although i must admit a little ridiculous is easily remedied but how that mischiefmaking mr hamel could have found his way into the boathouse does i must confess perplex me  he must have been hanging around and followed us in when we came meekins muttered somehow i fancied i felt some one near  our young friend mr fentolin continued has without doubt an obvious turn of mind he will send for his acquaintance in the foreign office they will haul out mr dunster here and he will have a belated opportunity of delivering his message at the hague  you arent going to murder me first then mr dunster grunted  mr fentolin smiled at him benignly  my dear and valued guest he protested why so forbidding an idea let me assure you from the bottom of my heart that any bodily harm to you is the most unlikely thing in the world you see though you might not think it he went on i love life that is why i keep a doctor always by my side that is why i insist upon his making a complete study of my constitution and treating me in every respect as though i were indeed an invalid i am really only fiftynine years old it is my intention to live until i am eightynine an offence against the law of the nature you indicate might interfere materially with my intentions  mr dunster struggled for a moment for breath  look here he said thats all right but do you suppose you wont be punished for what youve done to me you laid a deliberate plot to bring me to st davids hall youve kept me locked up dosed me with drugs brought me down here at the dead of night kept me a prisoner in a dungeon do you think you can do that for nothing do you think you wont have to suffer for it  mr fentolin smiled  my dear mr dunster he reminded him you were in a railway accident you know there is no possible doubt about that and the wound in your head is still there in a very dangerous place men who have been in railway accidents and who have a gaping wound very close to their brain are subject to delusions i have simply done my best to play the good samaritan your clothes and papers are all untouched if my eminent physician had pronounced you ready to travel a week ago you would certainly have been allowed to depart a week ago any interference in your movements has been entirely in the interests of your health  mr dunster tried to sit up but found himself unable  so you think they wont believe my story eh he muttered well we shall see  mr fentolin thoughtfully contemplated the burning end of his cigarette for a moment  if i believed he said that there was any chance of your statements being accepted i am afraid i should be compelled in all our interests to ask doctor sarson to pursue just a step further that experiment into the anatomy of your brain with which he has already trifled  mr dunsters face was suddenly ghastly his reserve of strength seemed to ebb away the memory of some horrible moment seemed to hold him in its clutches  for gods sake leave me alone he moaned let me get away thats all let me crawl away  ah mr fentolin murmured that sounds much more reasonable when you talk like that my friend i feel indeed that there is hope for you let us abandon this subject for the present have you solved the puzzle yet he asked meekins  meekins was standing below the closed trapdoor he had already dragged up a wooden case underneath and was piling it with various articles of furniture  not yet sir he replied when i have made this steadier i am just going to see what pressure i can bring to bear on the trapdoor  i heard the bolts go doctor sarson remarked uneasily  in that case mr fentolin declared it will indeed be an interesting test of our friend meekins boasted strength meekins holds his placea very desirable place toochiefly for two reasons first his discretion and secondly his muscles he has never before had a real opportunity of testing the latter we shall see  doctor sarson came slowly and gravely to the bedside he looked down upon his patient mr dunster shivered  i am not sure sir he said very softly that mr dunster in his present state of mind is a very safe person to be allowed his freedom it is true that we have kept him here for his own sake because of his fits of mental wandering our statements however may be doubted an apparent return to sanity on his part may lend colour to his accusations especially if permanent perhaps it would be as well to pursue that investigation a shade further a touch more to the left and i do not think that mr dunster will remember much in this world likely to affect us  mr dunsters face was like marble there were beads of perspiration upon his forehead his eyes were filled with reminiscent horror mr fentolin bent over him with genuine interest  what a picture he would make he murmured what a drama do you know i am half inclined to agree with you sarson the only trouble is that you have not your instruments here  i could improvise something that would do the trick the doctor said thoughtfully it really isnt a complicated affair it seems to me that his story may gain credence from the very fact of our being discovered in this extraordinary place to have moved him here was a mistake sir  perhaps so mr fentolin admitted with a sigh it was our young friend mr hamel who was responsible for it i fancied him arriving with a search warrant at any moment we will bear in mind your suggestion for a few minutes let us watch meekins this promises to be interesting  by dint of piling together all the furniture in the place the man was now able to reach the trapdoor he pressed upon it vigorously without even bending the wood mr fentolin smiled pleasantly  meekins he said look at me  the man turned and faced his master his aspect of dogged civility had never been more apparent  now listen mr fentolin went on i want to remind you of certain things meekins we are among friends hereno secrecy you understand or anything of that sort you need not be afraid you know how you came to me you remember that little affair of anna jayes in hartlepool  the face of the man was filled with terror he began to tremble where he stood mr fentolin played for a moment with his collar as though he found it tight  such a chance it was my dear meekins mr fentolin continued cheerfully which brought me that little scrap of knowledge concerning you it has bought me through all these years a good deal of faithful service i am not ungrateful believe me i intend to retain you for my bodyservant and to keep my lips sealed for a great many years to come now remember what i have said when we leave this place that little episode will steal back into a far corner of my mind i shall in short forget it if we are caught here and inconvenience follows well i cannot say do your best meekins do a little better than your best you have the reputation of being a strong man let us see you justify it  the man took a long breath and returned to his task his shoulders and arms were upon the door he began to strain he grew red in the face the veins across his forehead stood out blue like tightlydrawn string his complexion became purple through his open mouth his breath came in short pants with every muscle of his body and neck he strained and strained the woodwork gave a little but it never even cracked with a sob he suddenly almost collapsed mr fentolin looked at him frowning  very goodvery good meekins he said but not quite good enough you are a trifle out of practice perhaps take your breath take time remember that you have another chance i am not angry with you meekins i know there are many enterprises upon which one does not succeed the first time get your breath there is no hurry next time you try see that you succeed it is very important meekins for you as well as for us that you succeed  the man turned doggedly back to his task the eyes of the three men watched himmr dunster on the bed doctor sarson pale and gloomy with something of fear in his dark eyes and mr fentolin himself whose expression seemed to be one of purely benevolent and encouraging interest once more the face of the man became almost unrecognisable there was a great crack the trapdoor had shifted meekins with a little cry reeled and sank backwards mr fentolin clapped his hands lightly  really meekins he declared i do not know when i have enjoyed any performance so much i feel as if i were back in the days of the roman gladiators i can see that you mean to succeed you will succeed you do not mean to end your days amid objectionable surroundings  with the air of a man temporarily mad meekins went back to his task he was sobbing to himself now his clothes had burst away from him suddenly there was a crash the hinges of the trapdoor had parted with the blood streaming from a wound in his forehead meekins staggered back to his feet mr fentolin nodded  excellent he pronounced really excellent with a little assistance from our friend meekins you i am sure sarson will now be able to climb up and let down the steps  doctor sarson stood by mr fentolins chair and together they looked up through the fragments of the trapdoor meekins was still breathing heavily suddenly they heard the sound of a sharp report as of a door above being slammed  some one was in the boathouse when i broke the trapdoor meekins muttered i heard them moving about  mr fentolin frowned  then let us hurry he said sarson what about your patient  mr dunster was lying upon his side watching them the doctor went over to the bedside and felt his pulse and head  he will do for twelve hours he pronounced if you think that other little operation  he broke off and looked at mr fentolin meaningly the man on the bed shrank back his eyes lit with horror mr fentolin smiled pleasantly  i fear he said that we must not stay for that just now a little later on perhaps if it becomes necessary let us first attend to the business on hand  meekins once more clambered on to the little heap of furniture the doctor stood by his side for a moment then with an effort he was hoisted up until he could catch hold of the floor of the outhouse meekins gave one push and he disappeared  any one up there mr fentolin enquired a shade of anxiety in his tone  no one the doctor reported  has anything been disturbed  doctor sarson was some little time before he replied  yes he said some one seems to have been rummaging about  send down the steps quickly mr fentolin ordered i am beginning to find the atmosphere here unpleasant  there was a brief silence then they heard the sound of the ladder being dragged across the floor and a moment or two later it was carefully lowered and placed in position mr fentolin passed the rope through the front of his carriage and was drawn up from his bed mr dunster watched them go it was hard to tell whether he was relieved or disappointed  who has been in here mr fentolin demanded as he looked around the place  there was no reply a grey twilight was struggling now through the high dustcovered windows meekins who had gone on towards the door suddenly called out  some one has taken away the key the door is locked on the other side  mr fentolins frown was malign even for him  our dear friend mr hamel i suppose he muttered another little debt we shall owe him try the other door  meekins moved towards the partition suddenly he paused mr fentolins hand was outstretched he too was listening above the low thunder of the sea came another sound a sound which at that moment they none of them probably understood there was the steady crashing of feet upon the pebbles a low murmur of voices mr fentolin for the first time showed symptoms of fear  try the other door quickly he directed  meekins came back shaking his head outside the noise seemed to be increasing the door was suddenly thrown open hannah cox stood outside in her plain black dress her hair windtossed her eyes aflame she held the key in her fingers and she looked in upon them her lips seemed to move but she said nothing  my good woman mr fentolin exclaimed frowning are you the person who removed that key  she laid her hand upon his chair she took no notice of the other two  come she said there is something here i want you to listen to come     chapter xxxv   mr fentolin arrived outside on the stone front of the boathouse pointed the wheel of his chair towards the hall hannah cox who kept by his side however drew it gently towards the beach  down here she directed softly bring your chair down the plankway close to the waters edge  my good woman mr fentolin exclaimed furiously i am not in the humour for this sort of thing lock up sarson at once i am in a hurry to get back  but you will come just this little way she continued speaking without any change of tone you see the others are waiting too i have been down to the village and fetched them up  mr fentolin followed her outstretched finger and gave a sudden start standing at the edge of the sea were a dozen or twenty fishermen they were all muttering together and looking at the top of the boathouse as he realised the direction of their gaze mr fentolins face underwent a strange transformation he seemed to shrink in his chair he was ghastly pale even to the lips slowly he turned his head from a place in the roof of the boathouse a tall support had appeared on the top was a swinging globe  what have you to do with that he asked in a low tone  i found it she answered i felt that it was there i have brought them up with me to see it i think that they want to ask you some questions but first come and listen  mr fentolin shook her off he looked around for meekins  meekins stand by my chair he ordered sharply turn round i wish to go to the hall drive this woman away  meekins came hurrying up but almost at the same moment half a dozen of the brown jerseyed fishermen detached themselves from the others they formed a little bodyguard around the bathchair  what is the meaning of this mr fentolin demanded his voice shrill with anger didnt you hear what i said this woman annoys me send her away  not one of the fishermen answered a word or made the slightest movement to obey him one of them a greybearded veteran drew the chair a little further down the planked way across the pebbles hannah cox kept close to its side they came to a standstill only a few yards from where the waves were breaking she lifted her hand  listen she cried listen  mr fentolin turned helplessly around the little group of fishermen had closed in upon sarson and meekins the womans hand was upon his shoulder she pointed seaward to where a hissing line of white foam marked the spot where the topmost of the rocks were visible  you wondered why i have spent so much of my time out here she said quietly now you will know if you listen as i am listening as i have listened for so many weary hours so many weary years you will hear them calling to me david and john and stephen the light do you hear what they are crying the light fentolins light look  she forced him to look once more at the top of the boathouse  they were right she proclaimed her voice gaining in strength and intensity they were neither drunk nor reckless they steered as straight as human hand could guide a tiller for fentolins light and there they are calling and calling at the bottom of the seamy three boys and my man do you know for whom they call  mr fentolin shrank back in his chair  take this woman away he ordered the fishermen do you hear take her away she is mad  they looked towards him but not one of them moved mr fentolin raised his whistle to his lips and blew it  meekins he cried where are you meekins  he turned his head and saw at once that meekins was powerless five or six of the fishermen had gathered around him there were at least thirty of them about sinewy powerful men the only person who moved towards mr fentolins carriage was jacob the coast guardsman  mr fentolin sir he said the lads have got your bully safe its a year and more that hannah cox has been about the village with some story about two lights on a stormy night its true what she saysthat her man and boys lie drowned theres william green besides and a nephew of my ownjohn kallender and philip greenhe was saved he swore by all that was holy that he steered straight for the light when his boat struck and that as he swam for shore five minutes later he saw the light reappear in another place its a strange story what have you to say sir about that  he pointed straight to the wireencircled globe which towered on its slender support above the boathouse mr fentolin looked at it and looked back at the coast guardsman the brain of a machiavelli could scarcely have invented a plausible reply  the light was never lit there he said it was simply to help me in some electrical experiments  then for the first time in their lives those who were looking on saw mr fentolin apart from his carriage without any haste but with amazing strength hannah cox leaned over and with her arms around his middle lifted him sheer up into the air she carried him clasped in her arms a weird struggling object to the clumsy boat that lay always at the top of the beach she dropped him into the bottom took her seat and unshipped the oars for one moment the coast guardsman hesitated then he obeyed her look he gave the boat a push which sent it grinding down the pebbles into the sea the woman began to work at the oars every now and then she looked over her shoulder at that thin line of white surf which they were all the time approaching  what are you doing woman mr fentolin demanded hoarsely listen it was an accident that your people were drowned ill give you an annuity ill make you rich for liferich do you understand what that means  aye she answered looking down upon him as he lay doubled up at the bottom of the boat i know what it means to be richbetter than you maybe not to let the gold and silver pieces fall through your fingers or to live in a great house and be waited upon by servants who desert you in the hour of need that isnt being rich its rich to feel the touch of the one you love to see the faces around of those youve given birth to to move on through the days and nights towards the end with them around not to know the chill loneliness of an empty life i am a poor woman mr fentolin and its your hand that made me so and not all the miracles that the bible ever told of can make me rich again  you are a fool he shrieked you can buy forgetfulness the memory of everything passes  i may be a fool she retorted grimly and you the wise man but this day well both know the truth  there was a little murmur from the shore where the fishermen stood in a long line  bring him back missus jacob called out youve scared him enough bring him back well leave him to the law  they were close to the line of surf now they had passed it indeed a little on the left and the boat was drifting she stood up straight and stern and her face as she looked towards the land was lit with the fire of the prophetess  aye she cried well leave him to the lawto the law of god  then they saw her stoop down and once more with that almost superhuman strength which seemed to belong to her for those few moments she lifted the strange object who lay cowering there high above her head from the shore they realised what was going to happen and a great shout arose she stood on the side of the boat and jumped holding her burden tightly in her arms so they went down and disappeared  half a dozen of the younger fishermen were in the water even before the grim spectacle was ended another ran for a boat that was moored a little way down the beach but from the first the search was useless only jacob who was a person afflicted with many superstitions wiped the sweat from his forehead as he leaned over the bow of his boat and looked down into that fathomless space  i heard her singing her or her wraith he swore afterwards ill never forget the moment i looked down and down and the water seemed to grow clearer and i saw her walking there at the bottom among the rocks with him over her back singing as she went looking everywhere for george and the boys  but if indeed his eyes were touched with fire at that moment no one else in the world saw anything more of miles fentolin     chapter xxxvi  mr john p dunster removed the cigar from his teeth and gazed at the long white ash with the air of a connoisseur he was stretched in a long chair high up in the terraced gardens behind the hall at his feet were golden mats of yellow crocuses long borders of hyacinthspink and purple beds of violets a great lilac tree with patches of blossom here and there forcing their way into a sunlit world the sea was blue the sheltered air where they sat was warm and perfumed mr dunster who was occupying the position of a favoured guest was feeling very much at home  there is one thing he remarked meditatively which i cant help thinking about you britishers you may deserve it or you may not but you do have the most almighty luck  sheer envy hamel murmured we escape from our tight corners by forethought  not on your life sir mr dunster declared vigorously a year or less ago you got a north sea scare and on the strength of a merely honourable understanding with your neighbour you risk your countrys very existence for the sake of adding half a dozen battleships to your north sea squadron the day the last of those battleships passed through the straits of gibraltar this little conference was plotted i tell you they meant to make history there  there was enough for everybodyindia for russia a timehonoured dream but why not alsacelorraine and perhaps egypt for france australia for japan china and south africa for germany why not you may laugh at it on paper but i say againwhy not  it didnt quite come off sir gerald observed  it didnt mr dunster admitted partly owing to you there were only two things needed france to consider her own big interests and to ignore an entente from which she gains nothing that was not assured to her under the new agreement and the money strange mr dunster continued how people forget that factor and yet the man who was responsible for the hague conference knew it we in the states are right outside all these little jealousies and wrangles that bring europe every now and then right up to the gates of war but im hanged if there is one of you dare pass through those gates without a hand on our money markets its a new word in history that little document news of which mr gerald here took to the hague the word of the money kings of the world there is something that almost nips your breath in the idea that a dozen men descended from the lord knows whom stopped a war which would have altered the whole face of history  there was never any proof hamel remarked that france would not have remained staunch to us  very likely not mr dunster agreed but on the other hand your country had never the right to put such a burden upon her honour remember that side by side with those other considerations a great statesmans first duty is to the people over whom he watches not to study the interests of other lands however its finished the hague conference is broken up the official organs of the world allude to it if at all as an unimportant gathering called together to discuss certain frontier questions with which england had nothing to do but the memory of it will live a good cold douche for you people i should say and i hope youll take warning by it whatever the attitude of america as a nation may be to these matters the american people dont want to see the old country in trouble gee whiz whats that  there was a little cry from all of them only hamel stood without sign of surprise gazing downward with grim set face a dull roar like the booming of a gun flashes of fire and a column of smokeand all that was left of st davids tower was one tottering wall and a scattered mass of masonry  i had an idea hamel said quietly that st davids tower was going to spoil the landscape for a good many years my property you know and theres the end of it i am sick of seeing people for the last few days come down and take photographs of it for every little rag that goes to press  mr dunster pointed out to the line of surf beyond if only some hand he remarked could plant dynamite below that streak of white so that the sea could disgorge its dead they tell me theres a spanish galleon there and a dutch warship besides a score or more of fishingboats  mrs fentolin shivered a little she drew her cloak around her gerald who had been watching her sprang to his feet  come he exclaimed we chose the gardens for our last afternoon here to be out of the way of these places well go round the hill  mrs fentolin shook her head once more her face had recovered its serenity she looked downward gravely but with no sign of fear  there is nothing to terrify us there gerald she declared the sea has gathered and the sea will hold its own  hamel held out his hand to esther  i have destroyed the only house in the world which i possess he said come and look for violets with me in the spinney and let us talk of the houses we are going to build and the dreams we shall dream in them
