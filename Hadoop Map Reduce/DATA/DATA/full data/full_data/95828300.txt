                with which                                 they have honoured me                                        note  the material on which this biography is founded consists mainly of course of the papers collected at hawarden besides that vast accumulation i have been favoured with several thousands of other pieces from the legion of mr gladstones correspondents between two and three hundred thousand written papers of one sort or another must have passed under my view to some important journals and papers from other sources i have enjoyed free access and my warm thanks are due to those who have generously lent me this valuable aid i am especially indebted to the king for the liberality with which his majesty has been graciously pleased to sanction the use of certain documents in cases where the permission of the sovereign was required  when i submitted an application for the same purpose to queen victoria in readily promising her favourable consideration the queen added a message strongly impressing on me that the work i was about to undertake should not be handled in the narrow way of party this injunction represents my own clear view of the spirit in which the history of a career so memorable as mr gladstones should be composed that to be sure is not at all inconsistent with our regarding party feeling in its honourable sense as entirely the reverse of an infirmity  the diaries from which i have often quoted consist of forty little books in double columns intended to do little more than record persons seen or books read or letters written as the days passed by from these diaries come several of the mottoes prefixed to our chapters such mottoes are marked by an asterisk  the trustees and other members of mr gladstones family have extended to me a uniform kindness and consideration and an absolutely unstinted confidence for which i can never cease to owe them my heartiest acknowledgment they left with the writer an unqualified and undivided responsibility for these pages and for the use of the material that they entrusted to him whatever may prove to be amiss whether in leaving out or putting in or putting wrong the blame is wholly mine

at allthe life of a man who held an imposing place in many high national transactions whose character and career may be regarded in such various lights whose interests were so manifold and whose years bridged so long a span of timeis a stroke of temerity to try to write his life today is to push temerity still further the ashes of controversy in which he was much concerned are still hot perspective scale relation must all while we stand so near be difficult to adjust not all particulars more especially of the latest marches in his wide campaign can be disclosed without risk of unjust pain to persons now alive yet to defer the task for thirty or forty years has plain drawbacks too interest grows less vivid truth becomes harder to find out memories pale and colour fades and if in one sense a statesmans contemporaries even after death has abated the storm and temper of faction can scarcely judge him yet in another sense they who breathe the same air as he breathed who know at close quarters the problems that faced him the materials with which he had to work the limitations of his timesuch must be the best if not the only true memorialists and recorders  every reader will perceive that perhaps the sharpest of all the many difficulties of my task has been to draw the line between history and biographybetween the fortunes of the community and the exploits thoughts and purposes of the individual who had so marked a share in them in the case of men of letters in whose lives our literature is admirably rich this difficulty happily for their authors and for our delight does not arise but where the subject is a man who was four times at the head of the governmentno phantom but dictatorand who held this office of first minister for a longer time than any other statesman in the reign of the queen how can we tell the story of his works and days without reference and ample reference to the course of events over whose unrolling he presided and out of which he made history it is true that what interests the world in mr gladstone is even more what he was than what he did his brilliancy charm and power the endless surprises his dualism or more than dualism his vicissitudes of opinion his subtleties of mental progress his strange union of qualities never elsewhere found together his striking unlikeness to other men in whom great and free nations have for long periods placed their trust i am not sure that the incessant search for clues through this labyrinth would not end in analysis and disquisition that might be no great improvement even upon political history mr gladstone said of reconstruction of the incometax that he only did not call the task herculean because hercules could not have done it assuredly i am not presumptuous enough to suppose that this difficulty of fixing the precise scale between history and biography has been successfully overcome by me it may be that hercules himself would have succeeded little better  some may think in this connection that i have made the preponderance of politics excessive in the story of a genius of signal versatility to whom politics were only one interest among many no doubt speeches debates bills divisions motions and manoeuvres of party like the manna that fed the children of israel in the wilderness lose their savour and power of nutriment on the second day yet after all it was to his thoughts his purposes his ideals his performances as statesman in all the widest significance of that lofty and honourable designation that mr gladstone owes the lasting substance of his fame his life was ever greatly absorbed he said in working the institutions of his country here we mark a signal trait not for two centuries since the historic strife of anglican and puritan had our island produced a ruler in whom the religious motive was paramount in the like degree he was not only a political force but a moral force he strove to use all the powers of his own genius and the powers of the state for moral purposes and religious nevertheless his mission in all its forms was action he had none of that detachment often found among superior minds which we honour for its disinterestedness even while we lament its impotence in result the track in which he moved the instruments that he employed were the track and the instruments the sword and the trowel of political action and what is called the gladstonian era was distinctively a political era  on this i will permit myself a few words more the detailed history of mr gladstone as theologian and churchman will not be found in these pages and nobody is more sensible than their writer of the gap mr gladstone cared as much for the church as he cared for the state he thought of the church as the soul of the state he believed the attainment by the magistrate of the ends of government to depend upon religion and he was sure that the strength of a state corresponds to the religious strength and soundness of the community of which the state is the civil organ i should have been wholly wanting in biographical fidelity not to make this clear and superabundantly clear still a writer inside mr gladstones church and in full and active sympathy with him on this side of mundane and supramundane things would undoubtedly have treated the subject differently from any writer outside no amount of candour or good faithand in these essentials i believe that i have not fallen shortcan be a substitute for the confidence and ardour of an adherent in the heart of those to whom the church stands first here is one of the difficulties of this complex case yet here too there may be some trace of compensation if the reader has been drawn into the whirlpools of the political charybdis he might not even in far worthier hands than mine have escaped the rocky headlands of the ecclesiastic scylla for churches also have their parties  lord salisbury the distinguished man who followed mr gladstone in a longer tenure of power than his called him a great christian and nothing could be more true or better worth saying he not only accepted the doctrines of that faith as he believed them to be held by his own communion he sedulously strove to apply the noblest moralities of it to the affairs both of his own nation and of the commonwealth of nations it was a supreme experiment people will perhaps some day wonder that many of those who derided the experiment and reproached its author failed to see that they were making manifest in this a wholesale scepticism as to truths that they professed to prize far deeper and more destructive than the doubts and disbeliefs of the gentiles in the outer courts  the epoch as the reader knows was what mr gladstone called an agitated and expectant age some stages of his career mark stages of the first importance in the history of english party on which so much in the working of our constitution hangs his name is associated with a record of arduous and fruitful legislative work and administrative improvement equalled by none of the great men who have grasped the helm of the british state the intensity of his mind and the length of years through which he held presiding office enabled him to impress for good in all the departments of government his own severe standard of public duty and personal exactitude he was the chief force propelling restraining guiding his country at many decisive moments then how many surprises and what seeming paradox devotedly attached to the church he was the agent in the overthrow of establishment in one of the three kingdoms and in an attempt to overthrow it in the principality entering public life with vehement aversion to the recent dislodgment of the landed aristocracy as the mainspring of parliamentary power he lent himself to two further enormously extensive changes in the constitutional centre of gravity with a lifelong belief in parliamentary deliberation as the grand security for judicious laws and national control over executive act he yet at a certain stage betook himself with magical result to direct and individual appeal to the great masses of his countrymen and the world beheld the astonishing spectacle of a politician with the microscopic subtlety of a thirteenth century schoolman wielding at will the new democracy in what has been called the country of plain men a firm and trained economist and no friend to socialism yet by his legislation upon land in 1870 and 1881 he wrote the opening chapter in a volume on which many an unexpected page in the history of property is destined to be inscribed statesmen do far less than they suppose far less than is implied in their resounding fame to augment the material prosperity of nations but in this province mr gladstones name stands at the topmost height yet no ruler that ever lived felt more deeply the truthfor which i know no better words than channingsthat to improve mans outward condition is not to improve man himself this must come from each mans endeavour within his own breast without that there can be little ground for social hope well was it said to him you have so lived and wrought that you have kept the soul alive in england not in england only was this felt he was sometimes charged with lowering the sentiment the lofty and fortifying sentiment of national pride at least it is a ground for national pride that he the son of english training practised through long years in the habit and tradition of english public life standing for long years foremost in accepted authority and renown before the eye of england so conquered imagination and attachment in other lands that when the end came it was thought no extravagance for one not an englishman to say on the day that mr gladstone died the world has lost its greatest citizen the reader who revolves all this will know why i began by speaking of temerity  that my book should be a biography without trace of bias no reader will expect there is at least no bias against the truth but indifferent neutrality in a work produced as this is in the spirit of loyal and affectionate remembrance would be distasteful discordant and impossible i should be heartily sorry if there were no signs of partiality and no evidence of prepossession on the other hand there is i trust no importunate advocacy or tedious assentation he was great man enough to stand in need of neither still less has it been needed in order to exalt him to disparage others with whom he came into strong collision his own funeral orations from time to time on some who were in one degree or another his antagonists prove that this petty and ungenerous method would have been to him of all men most repugnant then to pretend that for sixty years with all the varying weather of the mind he traversed in every zone the restless ocean of a great nations shifting and complex politics without many a faulty tack and many a wrong reckoning would indeed be idle no such claim is set up by rational men for pym cromwell walpole washington or either pitt it is not set up for any of the three contemporaries of mr gladstone whose names live with the three most momentous transactions of his agecavour lincoln bismarck to suppose again that in every one of the many subjects touched by him besides exhibiting the range of his powers and the diversity of his interests he made abiding contributions to thought and knowledge is to ignore the jealous conditions under which such contributions come to say so much as this is to make but a small deduction from the total of a grand account  i have not reproduced the full text of letters in the proportion customary in english biography the existing mass of his letters is enormous but then an enormous proportion of them touch on affairs of public business on which they shed little new light even when he writes in his kindest and most cordial vein to friends to whom he is most warmly attached it is usually a letter of business he deals freely and genially with the points in hand and then without play of gossip salutation or compliment he passes on his way he has in his letters little of that spirit in which his talk often abounded of disengagement pleasant colloquy happy raillery and all the other undefined things that make the correspondence of so many men whose business was literature such delightful reading for the idler hour of an industrious day it is perhaps worth adding that the asterisks denoting an omitted passage hide no piquant hit no personality no indiscretion the omission is in every case due to consideration of space without these asterisks and other omissions nothing would have been easier than to expand these three volumes into a hundred i think nothing relevant is lost nobody ever had fewer secrets nobody ever lived and wrought in fuller sunlight                                  chapter i                                childhood                              18091821       i know not why commerce in england should not have its old      families rejoicing to be connected with commerce from generation      to generation it has been so in other countries i trust it will      be so in this countrygladstone   the dawn of the life of the great and famous man who is our subject in these memoirs has been depicted with homely simplicity by his own hand with this fragment of a record it is perhaps best for me to begin our journey i was born he says on december 29 1809 at 62 rodney street liverpool i was baptized i believe in the parish church of st peter my godmother was my elder sister anne then just seven years old who died a perfect saint in the beginning of the year 1829 in her later years she lived in close relations with me and i must have been much worse but for her of my godfathers one was a scotch episcopalian mr fraser of  whom i hardly ever saw or heard of the other a presbyterian mr g grant a junior partner of my fathers the child was named william ewart after his fathers friend an immigrant scot and a merchant like himself and father of a younger william ewart who became member for liverpool and did good public service in parliament       before proceeding to the period of my childhood properly      socalled i will here insert a few words about my family my      maternal grandfather was known as provost robertson of dingwall a      man held i believe in the highest respect his wife was a      mackenzie of coul his circumstances must have been good       of his three sons one went into the army and i recollect him as      captain robertson i have a seal which he gave me a threesided      cairngorm cost him 7½ guineas the other two took mercantile      positions when my parents made a scotch tour in 182021 with i      think their four sons the freedom of dingwall was presented to us      all1 with my father and there was large visiting at the houses      of the rossshire gentry i think the line of my grandmother was      stoutly episcopalian and jacobite but coming outside the western      highlands the first at least was soon rubbed down the provost i      think came from a younger branch of the robertsons of struan       on my fathers side the matter is more complex the history of the      family has been traced at the desire of my eldest brother and my      own by sir william fraser the highest living authority2 he has      carried us up to a rather remote period i think before elizabeth      but has not yet been able to connect us with the earliest known      holders of the name which with the aid of charterchests he hopes      to do some things are plain and not without interest they were a      race of borderers there is still an old gledstanes or gladstone      castle they formed a family in sweden in the seventeenth century      the explanation of this may have been that when the union of the      crowns led to the extinction of border fighting they took service      like sir dugald dalgetty under gustavus adolphus and in this case      passed from service to settlement i have never heard of them in      scotland until after the restoration otherwise than as persons of      family at that period there are traces of their having been fined      by public authority but not for any ordinary criminal offence      from this time forward i find no trace of their gentility during      the eighteenth century they are i think principally traced by a      line of maltsters no doubt a small business then in lanarkshire      their names are recorded on tombstones in the churchyard of biggar      i remember going as a child or boy to see the representative of      that branch either in 1820 or some years earlier who was a small      watchmaker in that town he was of the same generation as my      father but came i understood from a senior brother of the      family i do not know whether his line is extinct there also seem      to be some stray gladstones who are found at yarmouth and in      yorkshire3                                    ancestry       my fathers father seems from his letters to have been an excellent      man and a wise parent his wife a woman of energy there are      pictures of them at fasque by raeburn he was a merchant in      scotch phrase that is to say a shopkeeper dealing in corn and      stores and my father as a lad served in his shop but he also sent      a ship or ships to the baltic and i believe that my father whose      energy soon began to outtop that of all the very large family went      in one of these ships at a very early age as a supercargo an      appointment then i think common but he soon quitted a nest too      small to hold him he was born in december 1764 and i have at      hawarden a reprint of the liverpool directory for 178 in which      his name appears as a partner in the firm of messrs corrie corn      merchants       here his force soon began to be felt as a prominent and then a      foremost member of the community a liberal in the early period of      the century he drew to mr canning and brought that statesman as      candidate to liverpool in 1812 by personally offering to guarantee      his expenses at a time when though prosperous he could hardly      have been a rich man his services to the town were testified by      gifts of plate now in the possession of the elder lines of his      descendants and by a remarkable subscription of six thousand      pounds raised to enable him to contest the borough of lancaster      for which he sat in the parliament of 1818       at his demise in december 1851 the value of his estate was i      think near £600000 my father was a successful merchant but      considering his long life and means of accumulation the result      represents a success secondary in comparison with that of others      whom in native talent and energy he much surpassed it was a large      and strong nature simple though hasty profoundly affectionate and      capable of the highest devotion in the lines of duty and of love i      think that his intellect was a little intemperate though not his      character in his old age spent mainly in retirement he was our      constant centre of social and domestic life my mother a      beautiful and admirable woman failed in health and left him a      widower in 1835 when she was 62  he then turns to the records of his own childhood a period that he regarded as closing in september 1821 when he was sent to eton he begins with one or two juvenile performances in no way differing from those of any other infantnavita projectus humi the mariner flung by force of the waves naked and helpless ashore he believes that he was strong and healthy and came well through his childish ailments       my next recollection belongs to the period of mr cannings first      election for liverpool in the month of october of the year 1812      much entertaining went on in my fathers house where mr canning      himself was a guest and on a day of a great dinner i was taken      down to the dining room i was set upon one of the chairs      standing and directed to say to the company ladies and      gentlemen       i have thirdly a group of recollections which refer to scotland      thither my father and mother took me on a journey which they made      i think in a postchaise to edinburgh and glasgow as its principal      points at edinburgh our sojourn was in the royal hotel princes      street i well remember the rattling of the windows when the castle      guns were fired on some great occasion probably the abdication of      napoleon for the date of the journey was i think the spring of      1814                              early recollections       in this journey the situation of sanquhar in a close dumfriesshire      valley impressed itself on my recollection i never saw sanquhar      again until in the autumn of 1863 as i believe as i was whirled      along the glasgow and southwestern railway i witnessed just      beneath me lines of building in just such a valley and said that      must be sanquhar which it was my local memory has always been      good and very impressible by scenery i seem to myself never to      have forgotten a scene       i have one other early recollection to record it must i think      have been in the year 1815 that my father and mother took me with      them on either one or two more journeys the objective points were      cambridge and london respectively my father had built under the      very niggard and discouraging laws which repressed rather than      encouraged the erection of new churches at that period the church      of st thomas at seaforth and he wanted a clergyman for it4      guided in these matters very much by the deeply religious temper of      my mother he went with her to cambridge to obtain a recommendation      of a suitable person from mr simeon whom i saw at the time5 i      remember his appearance distinctly he was a venerable man and      although only a fellow of a college was more ecclesiastically got      up than many a dean or even here and there perhaps a bishop of      the present less costumed if more ritualistic period mr simeon i      believe recommended mr jones an excellent specimen of the      excellent evangelical school of those days we went to leicester to      hear him preach in a large church and his text was grow in      grace he became eventually archdeacon of liverpool and died in      great honour a few years ago at much past 90 on the strength of      this visit to cambridge i lately boasted there even during the      lifetime of the aged provost okes that i had been in the      university before any one of them       i think it was at this time that in london we were domiciled in      russell square in the house of a brother of my mother mr colin      robertson and i was vexed and put about by being forbidden to run      freely at my own will into and about the streets as i had done in      liverpool but the main event was this we went to a great service      of public thanksgiving at saint pauls and sat in a small gallery      annexed to the choir just over the place where was the regent and      looking down upon him from behind i recollect nothing more of the      service nor was i ever present at any public thanksgiving after      this in saint pauls until the service held in that cathedral      under my advice as the prime minister after the highly dangerous      illness of the prince of wales       before quitting the subject of early recollections i must name one      which involves another person of some note my mother took me in      181to barley wood cottage near bristol here lived miss hannah      more with some of her coeval sisters i am sure they loved my      mother who was loveworthy indeed and i cannot help here      deviating for a moment into the later portion of the story to      record that in 1833 i had the honour of breakfasting with mr      wilberforce a few days before his death6 and when i entered the      house immediately after the salutation he said to me in his      silvery tones how is your sweet mother he had been a guest in      my fathers house some twelve years before during the afternoon      visit at barley wood miss hannah more took me aside and presented      to me a little book it was a copy of her sacred dramas and it      now remains in my possession with my name written in it by her      she very graciously accompanied it with a little speech of which i      cannot recollect the conclusion or apodosis but it began as      you have just come into the world and i am just going out of it i      therefore etc      i wish that in reviewing my childhood i could regard it as     presenting those features of innocence and beauty which i have often     seen elsewhere and indeed thanks be to god within the limits of     my own home the best i can say for it is that i do not think it was     a vicious childhood i do not think trying to look at the past     impartially that i had a strong natural propensity then developed     to what are termed the mortal sins but truth obliges me to record     this against myself i have no recollection of being a loving or a     winning child or an earnest or diligent or knowledgeloving child     god forgive me and what pains and shames me most of all is to     remember that at most and at best i was like the sailor in juvenal                              digitis a morte remotus                      quatuor aut septem7      the plank between me and all the sins was so very thin i do not     indeed intend in these notes to give a history of the inner life     which i think has been with me extraordinarily dubious vacillating     and above all complex i reserve them perhaps for a more private     and personal document and i may in this way relieve myself from     some at least of the risks of falling into an odious pharisaism i     cannot in truth have been an interesting child and the only     presumption the other way which i can gather from my review is that     there was probably something in me worth the seeing or my father     and mother would not so much have singled me out to be taken with     them on their journeys      i was not a devotional child i have no recollection of early love     for the house of god and for divine service though after my father     built the church at seaforth in 1815 i remember cherishing a hope     that he would bequeath it to me and that i might live in it i have     a very early recollection of hearing preaching in st georges     liverpool but it is this that i turned quickly to my mother and     said when will he have done the pilgrims progress undoubtedly     took a great and fascinating hold upon me so that anything which i     wrote was insensibly moulded in its style but it was by the force     of the allegory addressing itself to the fancy and was very like a     strong impression received from the arabian nights and from     another work called tales of the genii i think it was about the     same time that miss porters scottish chiefs and especially the     life and death of wallace used to make me weep profusely this     would be when i was about ten years old at a much earlier period     say six or seven i remember praying earnestly but it was for no     higher object than to be spared from the loss of a tooth here     however it may be mentioned in mitigation that the local dentist     of those days in our case a certain dr p of  street     liverpool was a kind of savage at his work possibly a very     goodnatured man too with no ideas except to smash and crash my     religious recollections then are a sad blank neither was i a     popular boy though not egregiously otherwise if i was not a bad     boy i think that i was a boy with a great absence of goodness i     was a child of slow in some points i think of singularly slow     development there was more in me perhaps than in the average boy     but it required greatly more time to set itself in order and just     so in adult and in middle and later life i acquired very tardily     any knowledge of the world and that simultaneous conspectus of the     relations of persons and things which is necessary for the proper     performance of duties in the world      i may mention another matter in extenuation i received unless my     memory deceives me very little benefit from teaching my father was     too much occupied my mothers health was broken we the four     brothers had no quarrelling among ourselves but neither can i     recollect any influence flowing down at this time upon me the     junior one odd incident seems to show that i was meek which i     should not have supposed not less than thrifty and penurious a     leaning which lay deep i think in my nature and which has     required effort and battle to control it it was this by some     process not easy to explain i had when i was probably seven or     eight and my elder brothers from ten or eleven to fourteen or     thereabouts accumulated no less than twenty shillings in silver my     brothers judged it right to appropriate this fund and i do not     recollect either annoyance or resistance or complaint but i     recollect that they employed the principal part of it in the     purchase of four knives and that they broke the points from the     tops of the blades of my knife lest i should cut my fingers      where was the official or appointed teacher all this time he was     the rev mr rawson of cambridge who had i suppose been passed by     mr simeon and become private tutor in my fathers house but as he     was to be incumbent of the church the bishop required a parsonage     and that he should live in it out of this grew a very small school     of about twelve boys to which i went with some senior brother or     brothers remaining for a while       mr rawson was a good man of high nopopery opinions his school      afterwards rose into considerable repute and it had dean stanley      and the sons of one or more other cheshire families for pupils but      i think this was not so much due to its intellectual stamina as to      the extreme salubrity of the situation on the pure dry sands of the      merseys mouth with all the advantages of the strong tidal action      and the fresh and frequent northwest winds at five miles from      liverpool exchange the sands delicious for riding were one      absolute solitude and only one house looked down on them between      us and the town to return to mr rawson everything was      unobjectionable i suppose i learnt something there but i have no      recollection of being under any moral or personal influence      whatever and i doubt whether the preaching had any adaptation      whatever to children as to intellectual training i believe that      like the other boys i shirked my work as much as i could i went      to eton in 1821 after a pretty long spell in a very middling state      of preparation and wholly without any knowledge or other      enthusiasm unless it were a priggish love of argument which i had      begun to develop i had lived upon a rabbit warren and what a      rabbit warren of a life it is that i have been surveying       my brother john three years older than myself and of a moral      character more manly and on a higher level had chosen the navy      and went off to the preparatory college at portsmouth but he      evidently underwent persecution for righteousness sake at the      college which was then say about 1820 in a bad condition of      this though he was never querulous his letters bore the traces      and i cannot but think they must have exercised upon me some kind      of influence for good as to miscellaneous notices i had a great      affinity with the trades of joiners and of bricklayers physically      i must have been rather tough for my brother john took me down at      about ten years old to wrestle in the stables with an older lad of      that region whom i threw among our greatest enjoyments were      undoubtedly the annual guy fawkes bonfires for which we had always      liberal allowances of wreck timber and a tarbarrel i remember      seeing when about eight or nine my first case of a dead body it      was the child of the head gardener derbyshire and was laid in the      cottage bed by tender hands with nice and clean accompaniments      it seemed to me pleasing and in no way repelled me but it made no      deep impression and now i remember that i used to teach pretty      regularly on sundays in the sundayschool built by my father near      the primrose bridge it was i think a duty done not under      constraint but i can recollect nothing which associates it with a      seriously religious life in myself8                                         ii                                    genealogy  to these fragments no long supplement is needed little of interest can be certainly established about his faroff ancestral origins and the ordinary twilight of genealogy overhangs the case of the glaidstanes gledstanes gladstanes gladstones whose name is to be found on tombstones and parish rolls in charterchests and royal certificates on the southern border of scotland the explorations of the genealogist tell of recognitions of their nobility by scottish kings in dim ages but the links are sometimes broken titledeeds are lost the same name is attached to estates in different counties roxburgh peebles lanark and in short until the close of the seventeenth century we linger in the old poets phrase among dreams of shadows as we have just been told during the eighteenth century no traces of their gentility survives and apparently they glided down from moderate lairds to small maltsters thomas gladstones grandfather of him with whom we are concerned made his way from biggar to leith and there set up in a modest way as corndealer wholesale and retail his wife was a neilson of springfield to them sixteen children were born and john gladstones b dec 11 1764 was their eldest son having established himself in liverpool he married in 1792 jane hall a lady of that city who died without children six years later in 1800 he took for his second wife anne robertson of dingwall her father was of the clan donnachaidh and her mother was of kin with mackenzies munros and other highland stocks9 their son therefore was of unmixed scottish origins half highland half lowland borderer10 with the possible exception of lord mansfieldthe rival of chatham in parliament one of the loftiest names among great judges and chief builder of the commercial law of the english world a man who might have been prime minister if he had chosenmr gladstone stands out as far the most conspicuous and powerful of all the public leaders in our history who have sprung from the northern half of our island when he had grown to be the most famous man in the realm of the queen he said i am not slow to claim the name of scotsman and even if i were there is the fact staring me in the face that not a drop of blood runs in my veins except what is derived from a scottish ancestry11 an illustrious opponent once described him by way of hitting his singular duality of disposition as an ardent italian in the custody of a scotsman it is easy to make too much of race but when we are puzzled by mr gladstones seeming contrarieties of temperament his union of impulse with caution of passion with circumspection of pride and fire with selfcontrol of ossianic flight with a steady foothold on the solid earth we may perhaps find a sort of explanation in thinking of him as a highlander in the custody of a lowlander  of john gladstone something more remains to be said about 1783 he was made a partner by his father in the business at leith and here he saved five hundred pounds four years later probably after a short period of service he was admitted to a partnership with two cornmerchants at liverpool his contribution to the total capital of four thousand pounds being fifteen hundred of which his father lent him five hundred and a friend another five at five per cent in 1787 he thought the plural ending of his name sounded awkwardly in the style of the firm corrie gladstones and bradshaw so he dropped the s12 he visited london to enlarge his knowledge of the corn trade in mark lane and here became acquainted with sir claude scott the banker not yet however a baronet scott was so impressed by his extraordinary vigour and shrewdness as to talk of a partnership but gladstones existing arrangement in liverpool was settled for fourteen years sometime in the nineties he was sent to america to purchase corn with unlimited confidence from sir claude scott on his arrival he found a severe scarcity and enormous prices a large number of vessels had been chartered for the enterprise and were on their way to him for cargoes to send them back in ballast would be a disaster thrown entirely on his own resources he travelled south from new york making the best purchases of all sorts that he could then loaded his ships with timber and other commodities one only of them with flour and the loss on the venture which might have meant ruin did not exceed a few hundred pounds energy and resource of this kind made fortune secure and when the fourteen years of partnership expired gladstone continued business on his own account with a prosperity that was never broken he brought his brothers to liverpool but it was to provide for them not to assist himself says mr gladstone and he provided for many young men in the same way i never knew him reject any kind of work in aid of others that offered itself to him                               john gladstone  it was john gladstones habit we are told to discuss all sorts of questions with his children and nothing was ever taken for granted between him and his sons he could not understand says the illustrious one among them nor tolerate those who perceiving an object to be good did not at once and actively pursue it and with all this energy he joined a corresponding warmth and so to speak eagerness of affection a keen appreciation of humour in which he found a rest and an indescribable frankness and simplicity of character which crowning his other qualities made him i think and i strive to think impartially the most interesting old man i have ever known13  to his fathers person and memory mr gladstones fervid and affectionate devotion remained unbroken one morning writes a female relative of his when i was breakfasting alone with mr gladstone at carlton house terrace something led to his speaking of his father i seem to see him now rising from his chair standing in front of the chimneypiece and in strains of fervid eloquence dwelling on the grandeur the breadth and depth of his character his generosity his nobleness last and greatest of allhis loving nature his eyes filled with tears as he exclaimed none but his children can know what torrents of tenderness flowed from his heart  the successful merchant was also the activeminded citizen his force says his son soon began to be felt as a prominent and then a foremost member of the community he had something of his descendants inextinguishable passion for pamphleteering and the copious effusion of public letters and articles as was inevitable in a scotsman of his social position at that day when tory rule of a more tyrannic stamp than was ever known in england since the revolution of 1688 had reduced constitutional liberty in scotland to a shadow john gladstone came to liverpool a whig and a whig he remained until canning raised the flag of a new party inside the entrenchments of eldonian toryism  in 1812 canning who had just refused lord liverpools proffer of the foreign office because he would not serve under castlereagh as leader in the house of commons was invited by john gladstone to stand for liverpool he was elected in triumph over brougham and held the seat through four elections down to 1822 when he was succeeded by huskisson whom he described to the constituency as the best man of business in england and one of the ablest practical statesmen that could engage in the concerns of a commercial country the speeches made to his constituents during the ten years for which he served them are excellent specimens of cannings rich gay aspiring eloquence in substance they abound in much pure toryism and his speech after the peterloo massacre and upon the topics relating to public meetings sedition and parliamentary reform though by sonorous splendour and a superb plausibility fascinating to the political neophyte is by no means free from froth without much relation either to social facts or to popular principles on catholic emancipation he followed pitt as he did in an enlarged view of commercial policy at liverpool he made his famous declaration that his political allegiance was buried in pitts grave at one at least of these performances the youthful william gladstone was present but it was at home that he learned canningite doctrine at seaforth house canning spent the days between the death of castlereagh and his own recall to power while he was waiting for the date fixed for his voyage to take up the viceroyalty of india                                canning  as from whig john gladstone turned canningite so from presbyterian also he turned churchman he paid the penalty of men who change their party and was watched with a critical eye by old friends but he was a liberal giver for beneficent public purposes and in 1811 he was honoured by the freedom of liverpool his ambition naturally pointed to parliament and he was elected first for lancaster in 1818 and next for woodstock in 1820 two boroughs of extremely easy political virtue lancaster cost him twelve thousand pounds towards which his friends in liverpool contributed onehalf in 1826 he was chosen at berwick but was unseated the year after his few performances in the house were not remarkable he voted with ministers and on the open question of catholic emancipation he went with canning and plunket he was one of the majority who by six carried plunkets catholic motion in 1821 and the matter figures in the earliest of the hundreds of surviving letters from his youngest son then over eleven and on the eve of his departure for eton       seaforth mar 10 1821       i address these few lines to you to know how my dear mother is to      thank you for your kind letter and to know whether edward may get      two padlocks for the wicket and large shore gate they are now      open and the people make a thoroughfare of the green walk and the      carriage road i read mr plunkets speech and i admire it      exceedingly i enclose a letter from mr rawson to you he told me      today that mrs r was a great deal better write to me again as      soon as you canever your most affectionate and dutiful son w      e gladstone  in after years he was fond of recalling how the liverpool with which he had been most familiar 181020 though the second commercial town in the kingdom did not exceed 100000 of population and how the silver cloud of smoke that floated above her resembled that which might now appear over any secondary borough or village of the country i have seen wild roses growing upon the very ground that is now the centre of the borough of bootle all that land is now partly covered with residences and partly with places of business and industry but in my time but one single house stood upon the space between primrose brook and the town of liverpool among his early recollections was the extraordinarily beautiful spectacle of a dock delivery on the mersey after a long prevalence of westerly winds followed by a change liverpool cannot imitate that now 1892 at least not for the eye                                    iii                     john gladstone as slaveholder  the gladstone firm was mainly an east india house but in the last ten years of his mercantile course john gladstone became the owner of extensive plantations of sugar and coffee in the west indies some in jamaica others in british guiana or demerara the infamy of the slavetrade had been abolished in 1807 but slave labour remained and the liverpool merchant like a host of other men of equal respectability and higher dignity including many peers and even some bishops was a slaveholder everybody who has ever read one of the most honourable and glorious chapters in our english history knows the case of the missionary john smith14 in 1823 an outbreak of the slaves occurred in demerara and one of john gladstones plantations happened to be its centre the rising was stamped out with great cruelty in three days martial law the savage instrument of race passion was kept in force for over five months fifty negroes were hanged many were shot down in the thickets others were torn in pieces by the lash of the cartwhip smith was arrested although he had in fact done his best to stop the rising tried before a court in which every rule of evidence was tyrannically set aside he was convicted on hearsay and condemned to death before the atrocious sentence could be commuted by the home authorities the fiery heat and noisome vapours of his prison killed him the death of the demerara missionary it has been truly said was an event as fatal to slavery in the west indies as the execution of john brown was its deathblow in the united states15 brougham in 1824 brought the case before the house of commons and in the various discussions upon it the gladstone estates made rather a prominent figure john gladstone became involved in a heated and prolonged controversy as to the management of his plantations as we shall see it did not finally die down till 1841 he was an indomitable man in a newspaper discussion through a long series of letters he did not defend slavery in the abstract but protested against the abuse levelled at the planters by all the intemperate credulous designing or interested individuals who followed the lead of that wellmeaning but mistaken man mr wilberforce he denounced the missionaries as hired emissaries whose object seemed to be rather to revolutionise the colonies than to diffuse religion among the people  in 1830 he published a pamphlet in the form of a letter to sir robert peel16 to explain that negroes were happier when forced to work that as their labour was essential to the welfare of the colonies he considered the difficulties in the way of emancipation insurmountable that it was not for him to seek to destroy a system that an overruling providence had seen fit to permit in certain climates since the very formation of society and finally with a parthian bolt he hinted that the public would do better to look to the condition of the lower classes at home than to the negroes in the colonies the pamphlet made its mark and was admitted by the abolitionists to be an attempt of unusual ingenuity to varnish the most heinous of national crimes three years later when emancipation came and the twenty million pounds of compensation were distributed john gladstone appears to have received individually and apart from his partnerships a little over seventyfive thousand pounds for 1609 slaves17  it is as well though in anticipation of the order of time to complete our sketch in view of the approach of full abolition john gladstone induced lord glenelg the whig secretary of state to issue an order in council 1837 permitting the west indian planters to ship coolies from india on terms drawn up by the planters themselves objections were made with no effect by the governor at demerara a humane and vigorous man who had done much work as military engineer under wellington and who after abolishing the flogging of female slaves in the bahamas now set such an iron yoke upon the planters and their agents in demerara that he said he could sleep satisfied that no person in the colony could be punished without his knowledge and sanction18 the importation of coolies raised old questions in new forms the voyage from india was declared to reproduce the horrors of the middle passage of the vanished guinea slavers the condition of the coolie on the sugar plantations was drawn in a light only less lurid than the case of the african negro and john gladstone was again in hot water thomas gladstone his eldest son defended him in parliament aug 3 1839 and commissioners sent to inquire into the condition of the various gladstone plantations reported that the coolies on vreedestein appeared contented and happy on the whole no one had ever maltreated or beaten them except in one case and those on vreedenhoop appeared perfectly contented the interpreter who had abused them had been fined punished and dismissed upon the motion of w e gladstone these reports were laid upon the table of the house in 184019  we shall have not unimportant glimpses as our story unfolds itself of all these transactions meanwhile it is interesting to note that the statesman whose great ensign was to be human freedom was thus born in a family where the palliation of slavery must have made a daily topic the union moreover of fervid evangelical religion with antagonism to abolition must in those days have been rare and in spite of his devoted faith in his father the youthful gladstone may well have had uneasy moments if so he perhaps consoled himself with the authority of canning canning in 1823 had formally laid down the neutral principles common to the statesmen of the day that amelioration of the lot of the negro slave was the utmost limit of action and that his freedom as a result of amelioration was the object of a pious hope and no more canning described the negro as a being with the form of a man and the intellect of a child to turn him loose in the manhood of his physical strength in the maturity of his physical passions but in the infancy of his uninstructed reason would be to raise up a creature resembling the splendid fiction of a recent romance20 the hero of which constructs a human form with all the corporal capabilities of a man but being unable to impart to the work of his hands a perception of right and wrong he finds too late that he has only created a more than mortal power of doing mischief i was bred said mr gladstone when risen to meridian splendour under the shadow of the great name of canning every influence connected with that name governed the politics of my childhood and of my youth with canning i rejoiced in the removal of religious disabilities and in the character which he gave to our policy abroad with canning i rejoiced in the opening he made towards the establishment of free commercial interchanges between nations with canning and under the shadow of the yet more venerable name of burke my youthful mind and imagination were impressed21 on slavery and even the slave trade burke too had argued against total abolition i confess he said i trust infinitely more according to the sound principles of those who ever have at any time meliorated the state of mankind to the effect and influence of religion than to all the rest of the regulations put together22  footnotes  1 the freedom was formally bestowed on him in 1863  2 sir william fraser died in 1898  3 researches into the ancestry of the

in the douglas book to the gledstanes of gledstanes the surname of gledstanes occurs at a very early period in the records of scotland families of that name acquired considerable landed estates in the counties of lanark peebles roxburgh and dumfries the old castle of gledstanes now in ruins was the principal mansion of the family the first of the name who has been found on record is herbert de gledstanes who swore fealty to edward i in 1296 for lands in the county of lanark the gledstanes long held the office of bailie under the earls of douglas and the connection between the two families seems to have lasted until the fall of the douglas family the gledstanes still continued to figure for many generations on the border about the middle of the eighteenth century two branches of the familythe gledstanes of cocklaw and of craigsfailed in the direct male line mr gladstone was descended from a third branch the gledstanes of arthurshiel in lanarkshire the first of this line who has been traced is william gledstanes who in the year 1551 was laird of arthurshiel his lineal descendants continued as owners of that property till william gledstanes disposed of it and went to live in the town of biggar about the year 1679 this william gledstanes was mr gladstones greatgreatgrandfather the connection between these three branches and herbert de gledstanes of 1296 has not been ascertained but he was probably the common ancestor of them all  4 john gladstone built st thomass church seaforth 181415 st andrews liverpool about 1816 the church at leith the episcopal chapel at

craftsmans hospital aberdeen established in 1833 occurs the name of georg gladstaines pewterer 300 merks £16 13s 4d sterling 1698 george joined the hammerman craft in 1656 when he would have been about 25 years of age his signature is still in existence appended to the burgess oath very few craftsmen could sign their names at that periodnot one in twentyso that george must have been fairly well educated mr gladstone replied that it was the first time that he had heard of the name so far north and that the pewterer was probably one planted out at dundee 1890 he mentioned that others of his name and blood appeared on the burgessroll as early as the fifteenth century as for his maternal grandfather the inverness courier march 2 year not given has the followingprovost robertson of dingwall was a descendant of the ancient family of the robertsons of inshes of whose early settlement in the north the following particulars are known the first was a member of the family of struan perthshire and was a merchant in inverness in 1420 in the battle of blairnaleine fought at the west end of lochlochy in 1544 john robertson a descendant of the above acted as standardbearer to lord lovat this battle was fought between the frasers and macdonalds of clanranald and derived its appellation from the circumstance of the combatants fighting only in their shirts the contest was carried on with such bloody determination foot to foot and claymore to claymore that only four of the frasers and ten of the macdonalds returned to tell the tale the former family was well nigh extirpated tradition however states that sixteen widows of the frasers who had been slain shortly afterwards as a providential succour gave birth to sixteen sons from the bloody onslaught at lochlochy young robertson returned home scaithless and his brave and gallant conduct was the theme of praise with all some time thereafter he married the second daughter of paterson of wester and easter inshes the eldest being married to cuthbert of macbeths castlehill now known as the crown lands possessed by mr fraser of abertarff on the death of paterson his fatherinlaw wester inshes became the property of young robertson and easter inshes that of the cuthberts who for the sake of distinction changed the name to castlehill the robertsons in regular succession until the present time possess the fine estate of inshes while that of castlehill which belonged to the powerful cuthberts for so many generations knows them no more the family of inshes in all ages stood high in respect throughout the highlands and many of them had signalised themselves in upholding the rights of their country and the worthy provost robertson of dingwall had no less distinguished himself who with other important reforms had cleared away the last burdensome relic of feudal times in that ancient burgh  10 the other sons and daughters of this marriage were thomas d 1889 robertson d 1875 john neilson d 1863 anne

are rare and splendid exceptions to be sure but in my      conscience i believe that england would not be what she is without      her system of public education and that no other country can

youthgladstone   in september 1821 the young gladstone was sent to eton life at eton lasted over six years until the christmas of 1827 it impressed images that never faded and left traces in heart and mind that the waves of time never effacedso profound is the early writing on our opening page cannings words at the head of our present chapter set forth a superstition that had a powerful hold on the english governing class of that day and the new etonian never shook it off his attachment to eton grew with the lapse of years to him it was ever the queen of all schools  i went he says under the wing of my eldest brother then in the upper division and this helped my start and much mitigated the sense of isolation that attends the first launch at a public school the door of his dames house looked down the long walk while the windows looked into the very crowded churchyard from this he never received the smallest inconvenience though it was his custom when master of the room to sleep with his window open both summer and winter the school said the new scholar has only about four hundred and ninety fellows in it which was considered uncommonly small he likes his tutor so much that he would not exchange him for any ten he has various rows with mrs shurey his dame and it is really a great shame the way they are fed he and his brother have far the best room in the dames house his captain is very goodnatured fighting is a favourite diversion hardly a day passing without one two three or even four more or less mortal combats                           manners at eton  you will be glad to hear he writes to his highland aunt johanna november 13 1821 of an instance of the highest and most honourable spirit in a highlander labouring under great disadvantages his name is macdonald he once had a brother here remarkably clever and a capital fighter he is tough as iron and about the strongest fellow in the school of his size being pushed out of his seat in school by a fellow of the name of arthur he airily asked him to give it him again which being refused with the additional insult that he might try what he could do to take it from him macdonald very properly took him at his word and began to push him out of his seat arthur struck at him with all his might and gave him so violent a blow that macdonald was almost knocked backwards but disdaining to take a blow from even a fellow much bigger than himself he returned arthurs blow with interest they began to fight after macdonald had made him bleed at both his nose and his mouth he finished the affair very triumphantly by knocking the arrogant arthur backwards over the form without receiving a single blow of any consequence he also labours under the additional disadvantage of being a new fellow and of not knowing any one here arthur in a former battle put his finger out of joint and as soon as it is recovered they are to have a regular battle in the playing fields  other encounters are described with equal zest especially one where the honour of liverpool was bravely sustained superior weight and size having such an advantage over toughness and strength that the foe of liverpool was too badly bruised and knocked about to appear in school on another occasion to the great joy of the narrator an oppidan vanquished a colleger though the colleger fought so furiously that he put his fingers out of joint and went back to the classic studies that soften manners with a face broken and quite black the windsor and slough coaches used to stop under the wall of the playing fields to watch these desperate affrays and once at least in these times a boy was killed with plenty of fighting went on plenty of flogging for the headmaster was the redoubtable dr keate with whom the appointed instrument of moral regeneration in the childish soul was the birch rod who on heroic occasions was known to have flogged over eighty boys on a single summer day and whose one mellow regret in the evening of his life was that he had not flogged far more religious instruction as we may suppose was under these circumstances reduced to zero there was no trace of the influence of the evangelical party at that moment the most active of all the religious sections and the ancient and pious munificence of henry vi now inspired a scene that was essentially little better than pagan modified by an official church of england varnish at eton mr gladstone wrote of this period forty years after the actual teaching of christianity was all but dead though happily none of its forms had been surrendered23  science even in its rudiments fared as ill as its eternal rival theology there was a mathematical master but nobody learned anything from him or took any notice of him in his anxiety for position the unfortunate man asked keate if he might wear a cap and gown thats as you please said keate must the boys touch their hats to me thats as they please replied the genial doctor24 gladstone first picked up a little mathematics not at eton but during the holidays going to liverpool for the purpose first in 1824 and more seriously in 1827 he seems to have paid much attention to french and even then to have attained considerable proficiency when i was at eton mr gladstone said we knew very little indeed but we knew it accurately there were many shades of distinction he observed among the fellows who received what was supposed to be and was in many respects their education some of those shades of distinction were extremely questionable and the comparative measures of honour allotted to talent industry and idleness were undoubtedly such as philosophy would not justify but no boy was ever estimated either more or less because he had much money to spend it added nothing to him if he had much it took nothing from him if he had little a sharp fellow who worked and a stupid fellow who was idle were both of them in good odour enough but a stupid boy who presumed to work was held to be an insufferable solecism25                             knowledge at eton       my tutor was the rev h h knapp practically all tutors were      clergymen in those days he was a reputed whig an easy and      kindtempered man with a sense of scholarship but no power of      discipline and no energy of desire to impress himself upon his      pupils i recollect but one piece of advice received later from      him it was that i should form my poetical taste upon darwin whose      poems the botanic garden and loves of the plants i obediently      read through in consequence i was placed in the middle remove      fourth form a place slightly better than the common run but      inferior to what a boy of good preparation or real excellence would      have taken my nearest friend of the first period was w w parr a      boy of intelligence something over my age next above me in the      school       at this time there was not in me any desire to know or to excel my      first pursuits were football and then cricket the first i did not      long pursue and in the second i never managed to rise above      mediocrity and what was termed the twentytwo there was a      barrister named henry hall joy a connection of my father through      his first wife and a man who had taken a firstclass at oxford he      was very kind to me and had made some efforts to inspire me with a      love of books if not of knowledge indeed i had read froissart      and hume with smollett but only for the battles and always      skipping when i came to the sections headed a parliament joy had      a taste for classics and made visions for me of honours at oxford      but the subject only danced before my eyes as a willofthewisp      and without attracting me i remained stagnant without heart or      hope a change however arrived about easter 1822 my remove was      then under hawtrey afterwards headmaster and provost who was      always on the lookout for any bud which he could warm with a little      sunshine  he always described hawtrey as the life of the school the man to whom eton owed more than to any of her sons during the century though not his pupil it was from him that gladstone when in the fourth form received for the first time incentives to exertion it was entirely due to hawtrey he records in a fragment that i first owed the reception of a spark the divinae particulam aurae and conceived a dim idea that in some time manner and degree i might come to know even then as i had really no instructor my efforts at eton down to 1827 were perhaps of the purest plodding ever known  evidently he was not a boy of special mark during the first three years at eaton in the evening he played chess and cards and usually lost he claimed in after life that he had once taken a drive in a hired tandem but etonians who knew him as a schoolboy decided that an aspiring memory here made him boast of crimes that were not his he was assiduous in the eton practice of working a small boat whether skiff funny or wherry singlehanded in the masquerade of montem he figured complacently in all the glories of the costume of a greek patriot for he was a faithful canningite the heroic struggle against the turk was at its fiercest and it was the year when byron died at missolonghi of montem as an institution he thought extremely ill the whole thing a wretched waste of time and money a most ingenious contrivance to exhibit us as baboons a bore in the full sense of the word he did not stand aside from the harmless gaieties of boyish life but he rigidly refused any part in boyish indecorums he was in short just the diligent cheerful healthyminded schoolboy that any good father would have his son to be he enjoys himself with his brother at the christopher and is glad to record that keate did not make any jaw about being so late half a dozen of them met every whole holiday or half and went up salt hill to bully the fat waiter eat toasted cheese and drink eggwine                               school days  he started as we have already seen in middle fourth form in the spring of 1822 hawtrey said to him continue to do as well as this and i will send you up for good again before the fourth of june before the end of june he tells his sailor brother of his success it far exceeds the most sanguine expectations i ever entertained i have got into the remove between the fourth and fifth forms i have been sent up for good a second time and have taken seven places in the summer of 1823 he announces that he has got into the fifth form after taking sixteen places and here instead of fagging he acquires the blessed power himself to fag in passing he launches for the first recorded time against the master of the remove from which he has just been promoted an invective that in volume and intensity anticipates the wrath of later attacks on neapolitan kings and turkish sultans  his letters written from eton breathe in every line the warm breath of family affection and of all those natural pieties that had so firm a root in him from the beginning to the end of the later store of genius and force that the touch of time was so soon to kindle into full glow they gave but little indication we smile at the precocious copia fandi that at thirteen describes the language of an admonishing acquaintance as so friendly manly sound and disinterested that notwithstanding his faults i must always think well of him he sends contributions to his brothers scrapbook and one of the first of them oddly enough in view of one of the great preoccupations of his later life is a copy of lord edward fitzgeralds stanzas on the night of his arrest    o ireland my country the hour      of thy pride and thy splendour has passed    and the chain which was spurned in thy moment of power      hangs heavy around thee at last  the temper and dialect of evangelical religion are always there a friend of the family dies and the boy pours out his regret but after all what is the merely natural death of dr n compared with the awful state of a certain clergyman also an intimate friend who has not only been guilty of attending a fancy ball but has followed that vicious prelude by even worse enormities unnamed that surely cannot escape the vigilance and the reproof of his bishop  his father is the steady centre of his life my father he writes to his brother is as active in mind and projects as ever he has two principal plans now in embryo one of these is a railroad between liverpool and manchester for the conveyance of goods by locomotivesteamengine the other is for building a bridge over the mersey at runcorn in may 1827 the gloucester and berkeley canal is opened a great and enterprising undertaking but still there is no fear of it beating liverpool meanwhile what prodigiously quick travelling to leave eton at twelve on monday and reach home at eight on tuesday i have he says in 1826 lately been writing several letters in the liverpool courier his father had been attacked in the local prints for sundry economic inconsistencies and the controversial pen that was to know no rest for more than seventy years to come was now first employed like the pious Æneas bearing off anchises in the filial duty of repelling his sires assailants ignorant of his nameless champion john gladstone was much amused and interested by the anonymous friend to fair dealing while the son was equally diverted by the criticisms and conjectures of the parent                            youthful reading  with the formidable keate the boy seems to have fared remarkably well and there are stories that he was even one of the tyrants favourites26 his school work was diligently supplemented his daily reading in 1826 covers a good deal of miscellaneous ground including molière and racine blairs sermons not very substantial tom jones tomlines life of pitt waterlands commentaries leslie on deism lockes defence of the reasonableness of christianity which he finds excellent paradise lost miltons latin poems and epitaphium damonis exquisite massingers fatal dowry most excellent ben jonsons alchemist scott including the bride of lammermoor a beautiful tale indeed and in after life his favourite of them all burke clarendon and others of the shining host whose very names are music to a scholars ear in the same year he reads a most violent article on milton by macaulay fair and unfair clever and silly allegorical and bombastic republican and antiepiscopala strange composition indeed in 1827 he went steadily through the second half of gibbon whom he pronounces elegant and acute as he is not so clear so able so attractive as hume does not impress my mind so much in the same year he reads coxes walpole don quixote hallams constitutional history measure for measure and much ado massingers grand duke of florence fords loves melancholy much of it good the end remarkably beautiful and broken heart which he liked better than either the other or tis pity locke on toleration much repetition  there is of course a steady refrain of greek iambics greek anapæsts an easy and nice metre a hodgepodge lot of hendecasyllables and thirty alcaic stanzas for a holiday task mention is made of many sermons on redeeming the time weighed in the balance and found wanting cease to do evil learn to do well and the other ever unexhausted texts one constant entry we may be sure is read bible with mants notes in a mood of deep piety he is prepared for confirmation his appearance at this time was recalled by one who had been his fag as a goodlooking rather delicate youth with a pale face and brown curling hair always tidy and well dressed27  he became captain of the fifth at the end of october 1826 and on february 20 1827 keate put him into the sixth was very civil indeed told me to take pains etc to be careful in using my authority etc he finds the sixth very preferable to all other parts of the school both as regards pleasure and opportunity for improvement they are more directly under the eye of keate he treats them with more civility and speaks to them differently so the days follow one another very much alikestudious cheerful sociable sedulous the debates in parliament take up a good deal of his time and he is overwhelmed by the horrible news of the defeat of the catholics in the house of commons march 81827 on a summers day in 1826 mr canning here inquired after me and missed me he was not at eton but at home when he heard of mr cannings death personally i must remember his kindness and condescension especially when he spoke to me of some verses which h joy had injudiciously mentioned to him                                     ii                             debating society  youthful intellect is imitative and in a great school so impregnated as eton with the spirit of public life and political association the few boys with active minds mimicked the strife of parliament in their debating society and copied the arts of journalism in the eton miscellany in both fields the young gladstone took a leading part the debating society was afflicted with the premonitory lethargy of death but the assiduous energy of gaskell seconded by the gifts of gladstone hallam and doyle soon sent a new pulse beating through it the politics of the hour that is to say everything not fifty years off were forbidden ground but the execution of strafford or of his royal master the deposition of richard ii the last four years of the reign of queen anne the peerage bill of 1719 the characters of harley and bolingbroke were themes that could be made by ingenious youth to admit a hundred cunning sidelights upon the catholic question the struggle of the greeks for independence the hard case of queen caroline and the unlawfulness of swamping the tories in the house of lords on duller afternoons they argued on the relative claims of mathematics and metaphysics to be the better discipline of the human mind whether duelling is or is not inconsistent with the character that we ought to seek or whether the education of the poor is on the whole beneficial it was on this last question october 29 1825 that the orator who made his last speech seventy years later now made his first made my first or maiden speech at the society he enters in his diary on education of the poor funked less than i thought i should by much it is a curious but a characteristic circumstance not that so many of his eton speeches were written out but that the manuscript should have been thriftily preserved by him all through the long space of intervening years mr president it begins in this land of liberty in this age of increased and gradually increasing civilization we shall hope to find few if indeed any among the higher classes who are eager or willing to obstruct the moral instruction and mental improvement of their fellow creatures in the humbler walks of life if such there are let them at length remember that the poor are endowed with the same reason though not blessed with the same temporal advantages let them but admit what i think no one can deny that they are placed in an elevated situation principally for the purpose of doing good to their fellow creatures then by what argument can they repel by what pretence can they evade the duty and so forth and so forth already we seem to hear the born speaker in the amplitude of rhetorical form in which juvenile though it may be a commonplace is cast is human grandeur so stable that they may deny to others that which they would in an humble situation desire themselves or has human pride reached such a pitch of arrogance that they have learned to defy both right and reason to reject the laws of natural kindness that ought to reign in the breast of all and to look on their fellow countrymen as the refuse of mankind is it morally just or politically expedient to keep down the industry and genius of the artisan to blast his rising hopes to quell his spirit a thirst for knowledge has arisen in the minds of the poor let them satisfy it with wholesome nutriment and beware lest driven to despair et cetera crude enough if we please but the year was 1826 and we may feel that the boyish speaker is already on the generous side and has the gift of fruitful sympathies  in the spacious tournaments of old history we may smile to hear debating forms and ceremony applied to everlasting controversies sir he opens on one occasion i declare that as far as regards myself i shall have very little difficulty in stating my grounds on which i give my vote for james graham the marquis of montrose it is because i look upon him as a hero not merely endowed with that animal ferocity which has often been the sole qualification which has obtained men that appellation from the multitudei should be sorry indeed if he had no testimonials of his merits save such as arise from the mad and thoughtless exclamations of popular applause in the same gallant style jan 26 1826 he votes for marcus aurelius in answer to the question whether trajan has any equal among the roman emperors from augustus onwards another time the question was between john hampden and clarendon sir i look back with pleasure to the time when we unanimously declared our disapprobation of the impeachment of the earl of strafford i wish i could hope for the same unanimity now but i will endeavour to regulate myself by the same principles as directed me then now sir with regard to the impeachment of the five members it is really a little extraordinary to hear the honourable opener talking of the violence offered by the king and the terror of the parliament sir do we not all know that the king at that time had neither friends nor wealth did the return of these members with a triumphant mob accompanying them indicate terror did the demands of the parliament or the insolence of their language show it so he proceeds through all the wellworn arguments and therefore it is he concludes that i give my vote to the earl of clarendon because he gave his support to the falling cause of monarchy because he stood by his church and his king because he adopted the part which loyalty reason and moderation combined to dictate poverty banishment and disgrace he endured without a murmur he still adhered to the cause of justice he still denounced the advocates of rebellion and if he failed in his reward in life oh sir let us not deny it to him after death in him sir i admire the sound philosopher the rigid moralist the upright statesman the candid historian in hampden i see the splendour of patriotic bravery obscured by the darkness of rebellion and the faculties by which he might have been a real hero and real martyr prostituted in the cause and so on with all the promise of the os magna soniturum of which time was to prove the resources so inexhaustible on one great man he passed a final judgment that years did not changedebate on sir r walpole hallam gaskell pickering and doyle spoke voted for him last time when i was almost entirely ignorant of the subject against him there were sundry considerable blots but nothing to overbalance or to spoil the great merit of being the bulwark of the protestant succession his commercial measures and in general his pacific policy28                              eton miscellany  as for the eton miscellany which was meant to follow earlier attempts in the same line the bestnatured critic cannot honestly count it dazzling such things rarely are for youth though the most adorable of our human stages cannot yet have knowledge or practice enough whether in life or books to make either good prose or stirring verse unless by a miracle of genius and even that inspiration is but occasional the microcosm 178687 and the etonian 1818 with such hands as canning and frere moultrie and praed were well enough the newcomer was a long way behind these in the freshness brilliance daring by which only such juvenile performances can either please or interest george selwyn and gladstone were joint editors and each provided pretty copious effusions i cannot keep my temper he wrote afterwards in his diary in 1835 on turning over the miscellany in perusing my own with few exceptions execrable productions certainly his contributions have no particular promise or savour no hint of the strong pinions into which the halffledged wings were in time to expand their motion such as it is must be pronounced mechanical their phrase and cadence conventional even when sincere feelings were deeply stirred the flight cannot be called high the most moving public event in his schooldays was undoubtedly the death of canning and to gladstone the stroke was almost personal in september 1827 he tells his mother that he has for the first time visited westminster abbeyhis object an eager pilgrimage to the newly tenanted grave of his hero and in the miscellany he pays a double tribute in the prose we hear sonorous things about meridian splendour premature extinction and inscrutable wisdom about falling like his great master pitt a victim to his proud and exalted station about being firm in principle and conciliatory in action the friend of improvement and the enemy of innovation nor are the versified reflections in westminster abbey much more striking    oft in the sculptured aisle and swelling dome   the yawning grave hath given the proud a home   yet never welcomed from his bright career   a mightier victim than it welcomed here   again the tomb may yawnagain may death   claim the last forfeit of departing breath   yet neer enshrine in slumber dark and deep   a nobler loftier prey than where thine ashes sleep  excellent in feeling to be sure but as a trial of poetic delicacy or power wanting the true note and only worth recalling for an instant as we go                                     iii                                  friends  as nearly always happens it was less by school work or spoken addresses in juvenile debate or early attempts in the great and difficult art of written composition than by blithe and congenial comradeship that the mind of the young gladstone was stimulated opened strengthened in after days he commemorated among his friends george selwyn afterwards bishop of new zealand and of lichfield a man whose character is summed up from alpha to omega in the single word noble and whose high office in a large measure it was to reintroduce among the anglican clergy the pure heroic type another was francis doyle whose genial character supplied a most pleasant introduction for his unquestionable poetic genius a third was james milnes gaskell a youth endowed with precocious ripeness of political faculty an enthusiast and with a vivacious humour that enthusiasts often miss doyle said of him that his nurse must have lulled him to sleep by parliamentary reports and his first cries on awaking in his cradle must have been hear hear proximity of rooms gave occasion or aid to the formation of another very valuable friendship that with gerald wellesley afterwards dean of windsor which lasted to my great profit for some sixty years until that light was put out in gaskells room four or five of them would meet and discuss without restraint the questions of politics that were too modern to be tolerated in public debate most of them were friendly to catholic emancipation and to the steps by which huskisson supported by canning was cautiously treading in the path towards free trade the brightest star in this cheerful constellation was the rare youth who though his shining course was run in twoandtwenty years yet in that scanty span was able to impress with his vigorous understanding and graceful imagination more than one of the loftiest minds of his time29 arthur hallam was a couple of years younger than gladstone no narrow gulf at that age but such was the sympathy of genius such the affinities of intellectual interest and aspiration spoken and unspoken such the charm and the power of the younger with the elder that rapid instinct made them close comrades they clubbed together their rolls and butter and breakfasted in one anothers rooms hallam was not strong enough for boating so the more sinewy gladstone used to scull him up to the shallows and he regarded this toilsome carrying of an idle passenger up stream as proof positive of no common value set upon his passengers company they took walks together often to the monument of gray close by the churchyard of the elegy arguing about the articles and the creeds about wordsworth byron shelley about free will for hallam was precociously full of jonathan edwards about politics old and new living and dead about pitt and fox and canning and peel for gladstone was a tory and hallam pure whig hallam was described by mr gladstone in his old age as one who enjoyed work enjoyed society and games which he did not enjoy he left contentedly aside his temper was as sweet as his manners were winning his conduct was without a spot or even a speck he was that rare and blessed creature anima naturaliter christiana he read largely and though not superficial yet with an extraordinary speed he had no high or exclusive ways thus as so many have known in that happy dawn of life before any of the imps of disorder and confusion have found their way into the garden it was the most careless hourscareless of all save truth and beautythat were the hours best filled                              arthur hallam  youth will commonly do anything rather than write letters but the friendship of this pair stood even that test the pages are redolent of a living taste for good books and serious thoughts and amply redeemed from strain or affectation by touches of gay irony and the collegians banter hallam applies to gladstone diomedes lines about odysseus of eager heart and spirit so manful in all manner of toils as the only comrade whom a man would choose30 but the greek hero was no doubt a complex character and the parallel is taken by gladstone as an equivocal compliment so hallam begs him at any rate to accept the other description how when he uttered his mighty voice from his chest and words fell like flakes of snow in winter then could no mortal man contend with odysseus31 as happy a forecast for the great orator of their generation as when in 1829 he told gladstone that tennyson promised fair to be its greatest poet hallams share in the correspondence reminds us of the friendship of two other etonians ninety years before of the letters and verses that gray wrote to richard west there is the same literary sensibility the same kindness but there is what gray and west felt not the breath of a busy and changing age each of these two had the advantage of coming from a home where politics were not mere gossip about persons and paragraphs but were matters of trained and continued interest the son of one of the most eminent of the brilliant band of the whig writers of that day hallam passes glowing eulogies on the patriotism and wisdom of the whigs in coalescing with canning against the bigotry of the king and the blunders of wellington and peel he contrasts this famous crisis with a similar crisis in the early part of the reign of george iii and observes how much higher all parties stood in the balance of disinterestedness and public virtue he goes to the opera and finds zucchelli admirable coradori divine he wonders 1826 about sir walters forthcoming life of napoleon how with his ultra principles scott will manage to make a hero of the corsican he asks if gladstone has read the new vivian grey 1827the second part of that amazing fiction into which an author not much older than themselves and destined to strange historic relations with one of them had the year before burst upon the world hallam is not without the graceful melancholy of youth so different from that other melancholy of ripe years and the deepening twilight under all is the recurrent note of a grave refrain that fatal issues made pathetic  never since the time when i first knew you hallam wrote to gladstone june 23 1830 have i ceased to love and respect your character  it will be my proudest thought that i may henceforth act worthily of their affection who like yourself have influenced my mind for good in the earliest season of its development circumstance my dear gladstone has indeed separated our paths but it can never do away with what has been the stamp of each of our minds is on the other many a habit of thought in each is modified many a feeling is associated which never would have existed in that combination had it not been for the old familiar days when we lived together  in the summer of 1827 hallam quitted eton for the journey to italy that set so important a mark on his literary growth and he bade his friend farewell in words of characteristic affection perhaps you will pardon my doing by writing what i hardly dare trust myself to do by words i received your superb burke yesterday and hope to find it a memorial of past and a pledge for future friendship through both our lives it is perhaps rather bold in me to ask a favour immediately on acknowledging so great a one but you would please me and oblige me greatly if you will accept

farewell to eton  gladstones farewell to eton came with christmas 1827 he writes to his sister his last etonian letter december 2 before departure and melancholy that departure is on the day before he had made his valedictory speech to the society and the empty shelves and dismantled walls the table strewn with papers the books packed away in their boxes have the effect of mingling in one lengthened mass all the boyish hopes and solicitudes and pleasures of his eton life i have long ago made up my mind that i have of late been enjoying what will in all probability be as far as my own individual case is concerned the happiest years of my life and they have fled from these few facts do we not draw a train of reflections awfully important in their nature and extremely powerful in their impression on the mind                                dr keate  two reminiscences of eton always gave him and those who listened to him much diversion whenever chance brought them to his mind and he has set them down in an autobiographic fragment for which this is the place       to dr keate nature had accorded a stature of only about five feet      or say five feet one but by costume voice manner including a      little swagger and character he made himself in every way the      capital figure on the eton stage and his departure marked i      imagine the departure of the old race of english public school      masters as the name of dr busby seems to mark its introduction      in connection with his name i shall give two anecdotes separated by      a considerable interval of years about the year 1820 the      eloquence of dr edward irving drew crowds to his church in london      which was presbyterian it required careful previous arrangements      to secure comfortable accommodation the preacher was solemn      majestic notwithstanding the squint and impressive carrying all      the appearance of devoted earnestness my father had on a certain      occasion when i was still a small eton boy taken time by the      forelock and secured the use of a convenient pew in the first rank      of the gallery from this elevated situation we surveyed at ease      and leisure the struggling crowds below the crush was everywhere      great but greatest of all in the centre aisle here the mass of      human beings mercilessly compressed swayed continually backwards      and forwards there was i looking down with infinite complacency      and satisfaction from this honourable vantage ground upon the floor      of the church filled and packed as one of our public meetings is      with people standing and pushing what was my emotion my joy my      exultation when i espied among this humiliated mass struggling      and buffetedwhom but keate keate the master of our existence      the tyrant of our days pure unalloyed unadulterated rapture      such a greek peripeteia such a reversal of human conditions of being      as that now exhibited between the eton lower boy uplifted to the      luxurious gallery pew and the headmaster of eton whom i was      accustomed to see in the roomy deck of the upper school with vacant      space and terror all around him it must be hard for any one to      conceive except the two who were the subjects of it never never      have i forgotten that moment32       i will now after the manner of novelists ask my reader to effect      along with me a transition of some eighteen years and to witness      another and if not a more complete yet a worthier turning of the      tables in the year 1841 there was a very special eton dinner held      in williss rooms to commemorate the fourth centenary of the      ancient school lord morpeth afterwards lord carlisle was in the      chair on his right not far off him was dr keate to whom i      chanced to have a seat almost immediately opposite in those days      at public dinners cheering was marked by gradations as the queen      was suspected of sympathy with the liberal government of lord      melbourne which advised her the toast of the sovereign was      naturally received with a moderate amount of acclamation decently      and thriftily doled out on the other hand the queen dowager either      was or was believed to be conservative and her health      consequently figured as the toast of the evening and drew forth      as a matter of course by far its loudest acclamation so much was      routine and we went through it as usual but the real toast of the      evening was yet to come i suppose it to be beyond doubt that of      the assembled company the vastly preponderating majority had been      under his sway at eton and if when in that condition any one of      them had been asked how he liked dr keate he would beyond      question have answered keate oh i hate him it is equally      beyond doubt that to the persons of the whole of them with the      rarest exceptions it had been the ease of dr keate to administer      the salutary correction of the birch but upon this occasion when      his name had been announced the scene was indescribable queen and      queen dowager alike vanished into insignificance the roar of      cheering had a beginning but never knew satiety or end like the      huge waves at biarritz the floods of cheering continually      recommenced the whole process was such that we seemed all to have      lost our selfpossession and to be hardly able to keep our seats      when at length it became possible keate rose that is to say his      head was projected slightly over the heads of his two neighbours      he struggled to speak i will not say i heard every syllable for      there were no syllables speak he could not he tried in vain to      mumble a word or two but wholly failed recommenced the vain      struggle and sat down it was certainly one of the most moving      spectacles that in my whole life i have witnessed                                     iv                               at wilmslow  some months passed between leaving eton and going to oxford in january 1828 gladstone went to reside with dr turner at wilmslow in cheshire and remained there until turner was made bishop of calcutta the bishops pupil afterwards testified to his amiability refinement and devoutness but the days of his energy were past and the religious condition of the parish was depressing among the neighbouring families with whom he made acquaintance while at wilmslow were the gregs of quarry bank a refined and philanthropic household including among the sons william r greg born in the same year as mr gladstone that ingenious urbane interesting and independent mind whose speculations dissolvent and other were afterwards to take an effective place in the writings of the time i fear he is a unitarian the young churchman mentions to his father and gives sundry reasons for that sombre apprehension it was indeed only too well founded  while at wilmslow feb 5 1828 gladstone was taken to dine with the rector of alderleyan extremely gentlemanly and said to be a very clever manafterwards to be known as the liberal and enlightened edward stanley bishop of norwich and father of arthur stanley the famous dean him on this occasion the young gladstone seems to have seen for the first time arthur stanley was six years his junior and there was then some idea of sending him to eton as it happened he too was a pupil at rawsons at seaforth and in the summer after the meeting at alderley the two lads met again the younger of them has described how he was invited to breakfast with william gladstone at seaforth house in what grand style they breakfasted how he devoured strawberries swam the newfoundland dog in the pond looked at books and pictures and talked to w gladstone almost all the time about all sorts of things he is so very goodnatured and i like him very much he talked a great deal about eton and said that it was a very good place for those who liked boating and latin verses he was very goodnatured to us all the time and lent me books to read when we went away33 a few months later as all the world knows stanley happily for himself and for all of us went not to eton but to rugby where arnold had just entered on his bold and noble task of changing the face of education in england  footnotes  23 gleanings vii p 138  24 a story sometimes told of provost goodall  25 at marlborough feb 3 1877 at mill hill school june 11 1879  26 doyle tells a story of the boy being flogged for bringing wine into his study when questioned on this mr gladstone said i was flogged but not for anything connected in any way with wine of which by the by my father supplied me with a small amount and insisted upon my drinking it or some of it all the time that i was at eton the reason why i was flogged was this i was præpostor of the remove on a certain day and from kindness or good nature was induced to omit from the list of boys against whom h the master had complained and who ought to have been flogged next day the names of three offenders the three boys in question got round me with a story that their friends were coming down from london to see them and that if they were put down on the flogging list they could not meet their friends next day when i went into school h roared out in a voice of thunder gladstone put down your own name on the list of boys to be flogged mr gladstone on this occasion told another tale of this worthys humour one day h called out to the præpostor write down hamiltons name to be flogged for breaking my window i never broke your window sir exclaimed hamilton præpostor retorted h write down hamiltons name for breaking my window and lying upon my soul sir i did not do it ejaculated the boy with increased emphasis præpostor write down hamiltons name for breaking my window lying and swearing against this final sentence there was no appeal and accordingly hamilton was flogged i believe unjustly next dayf lawley in daily telegraph may

to the      ideal to perfectionto beauty in a word which is only truth      seen from another sidem arnold   glorious to most are the days of life in a great school but it is at college that aspiring talent first enters on its inheritance oxford was slowly awakening from a long age of lethargy toryism of a stolid clownish type still held the thrones of collegiate power yet the eye of an imaginative scholar as he gazed upon the grey walls reared by piety munificence and love of learning in a faroff time might well discern behind an unattractive screen of academic sloth the venerable past not dim and cold but in its traditions rich nourishing and alive such an one could see before him present days of honourable emulation and stirring acquisitionfit prelude of a mans part to play in a strenuous future it is from gladstones introduction into this enchanted and inspiring world that we recognise the beginning of the wonderful course that was to show how great a thing the life of a man may be made                             christ church  the eton boy became the christ church man and there began residence october 10 1828 mr gladstones rooms during most of his undergraduate life were on the right hand and on the first floor of the staircase on the right as one enters by the canterbury gate he tells his mother that they are in a very fashionable part of the college and mentions as a delightful fact that gaskell and seymer have rooms on the same floor samuel smith was head until 1831 when he was succeeded by the more celebrated dr gaisford always described by mr gladstone as a splendid scholar but a bad dean gaisfords excellent services to the greek learning of his day are unquestioned and he had the signal merit of speech spartan brevity for a short time in 1806 he had been tutor to peel when lord liverpool offered him the greek professorship with profuse compliments on his erudition the learned man replied my lord i have received your letter and accede to the contentsyours t g and to the complaining parent of an undergraduate he wrote dear sirsuch letters as yours are a great annoyance to your obedient servant t gaisford34 this laconic gift the dean evidently had not time to transmit to all of his flock  christ church in those days was infested with some rowdyism and in one bearfight an undergraduate was actually killed in the chapel the new undergraduate found little satisfaction for the service was scarcely performed with common decency there seems however to have been no irreconcilable prejudice against reading and in the schools the college was at the top of its academic fame the influence of cyril jackson the dean in peels time whose advice to peel and other pupils to work like a tiger and not to be afraid of killing ones self by work was still operative35 at the summer examination of 1830 christ church won five first classes out of ten most commoners according to a letter of gaskells had from three hundred and fifty to five hundred pounds a year but gentlemen commoners like acland and gaskell had from five to six hundred at the end of 1829 mr gladstone received a studentship honoris causa by nomination of the deana system that would not be approved in our epoch of competitive examination but still an advance upon the timehonoured practice of deans and canons disposing of studentships on grounds of private partiality without reference to desert we may assume that the dean was not indifferent to academic promise when he told gladstone very goodnaturedly and civilly that he had determined to offer him his nomination the student designate wrote a theme read it out before the chapter passed a nominal or even farcical examination in homer and virgil was elected as matter of course by the chapter and after chapel on the morning of christmas eve having taken several oaths was formally admitted in the name of the holy trinity  mr biscoe his classical tutor was a successful lecturer on aristotle especially on the rhetoric with charles wordsworth son of the master of trinity at cambridge and afterwards bishop of saint andrews he read for scholarship apparently not wholly to his own satisfaction while still an undergraduate he writes to his father nov 2 1830 i am wretchedly deficient in the knowledge of modern languages literature and history and the classical knowledge acquired here though sound accurate and useful yet is not such as to complete an education it looked in truth as if the caustic saying of a brilliant colleague of his in later years were not at the time unjust as now it would happily be that it was a battle between eton and education and eton had won  mr gladstone never to the end of his days ceased to be grateful that oxford was chosen for his university at cambridge as he said in discussing hallams choice the pure refinements of scholarship were more in fashion than the study of the great masterpieces of antiquity in their substance and spirit the classical examination at oxford on the other hand was divided into the three elastic departments of scholarship and poetry history and philosophy in this list history somewhat outweighed the scholarship and philosophy was somewhat more regarded than history in each case the examination turned more on contents than on form and the influence of butler was at its climax                      character of oxford teaching  if mr gladstone had gone to oxford ten years earlier he would have found the ethics and the rhetoric treated only much less effectively in the cambridge method like dramatists and orators as pieces of literature as it was whatelys common sense had set a new fashion and aristotle was studied as the master of those who know how to teach us the right way about the real world36 aristotle butler and logic were the new acquisitions but in none of the three as yet did the teaching go deep compared with modern standards oxford scholars of our own day question whether there was even one single tutor in 1830 with the possible exception of hampden who could expound aristotle as a wholeso utterly had the oxford tradition perished37  the time was in truth the eve of an epoch of illumination and in these epochs it is not old academic systems that the new light is wont to strike with its first rays the summer of 1831 is the date of sir william hamiltons memorable exposure38 in his most trenchant and terrifying style and with a learning all his own of the corruption and vampire oppression of oxford its sacrifice of the public interests to private advantage its unhallowed disregard of every moral and religious bond the systematic perjury so naturalised in a great seminary of religious education the apathy with which the injustice was tolerated by the state and the impiety tolerated by the church copleston made a wretched reply but more than twenty years passed before the spirit of reform overthrew the entrenchments of academic abuse in that overthrow when the time came mr gladstone was called to play a part though hardly at first a very zealous one this was not for a quarter of a century for as we shall soon see both the revival of learning and the reform of institutions at oxford were sharply turned aside from their expected course by the startling theological movement that now proceeded from her venerable walls  what interests us here is not the system but the man and never was vital temperament more admirably fitted by its vigour sincerity conscience compass for whatever good seed from the hand of any sower might be cast upon it in an entry in his diary in the usual strain of evangelical devotion april 25 1830 is a sentence that reveals what was in mr gladstone the nourishing principle of growth in practice the great end is that the love of god may become the habit of my soul and particularly these things are to be sought1 the spirit of love 2 of selfsacrifice 3 of purity 4 of energy just as truly as if we were recalling some hero of the seventeenth or any earlier century is this the biographic clue  gladstone constantly reproaches himself for natural indolence and for a year and a half he took his college course pretty easily then he changed the time for halfmeasures and trifling and pottering in which i have so long indulged myself is now gone by and i must do or die his really hard work did not begin until the summer of 1830 when he returned to cuddesdon to read mathematics with saunders a man who had the reputation of being singularly able and stimulating to his pupils and with whom he had done some rudiments before going into residence at christ church in his description of this gentleman to his father we may hear for the first time the redundant roll that was for many long years to be so familiar and so famous saunders disposition it appears is one certainly of extreme benevolence and of a benevolence which is by no means less strong and full when purely gratuitous and spontaneous than when he seems to be under the tie of some definite and positive obligation dr gaisford would perhaps have put it that the tutor was no kinder where his kindness was paid for than where it was not                         catholic emancipation  the catholic question that was helping many another and older thing to divide england from ireland after having for a whole generation played havoc with the fortunes of party and the careers of statesmen was now drawing swiftly to its close the christ church student had a glimpse of one of the opening scenes of the last act he writes to his brother feb 6th 1829       i saw yesterday a most interesting scene in the convocation house      the occasion was the debate on the anticatholic petition which it      has long been the practice of the university to send up year by      year this time it was worded in the most gentle and moderate terms      possible all the ordinary business there is transacted in latin      i mean such things as putting the question speaking etc and      this rule i assure you stops many a mouth and i dare say saves      the roman catholics many a hard word there were rather above two      hundred doctors and masters of arts present three speeches were      made two against and one in favour of sending up the petition      instead of aye and no they had placet and nonplacet and in      place of a member dividing the house the question was petitne      aliquis scrutinium which was answered by peto peto      from many quarters however when the scrutiny took place it was      found that the petition was carried by 156 to 48 after the      division however came the most interesting part of the whole a      letter from peel resigning the seat for the university was read      before the assembly it was addressed to the vicechancellor and      had arrived just before it was understood and i suppose brought      hither the first positive and indubitable announcement of the      governments intention to emancipate the catholics  a few days later peel accepted the chiltern hundreds and after some deliberation allowed himself to be again brought forward for reelection he was beaten by 755 votes to 609 the relics of the contest the figures and the inscriptions on the walls soon disappeared but panic did not abate on gladstones way to oxford april 30 1829 a farmers wife got into the coach and in communicative vein informed him how frightened they had all been about catholic emancipation but she did not see that so much had come of it as yet the college scout declared himself much troubled for the kings conscience observing that if we make an oath at baptism we ought to hold by it the bedmakers gladstone writes home seem to continue in a great fright and mine was asking me this morning whether it would not be a very good thing if we were to give them the irish a king and a parliament of their own and so to have no more to do with them the old eggwoman is no whit easier and wonders how mr peel who was always such a wellbehaved man here can be so foolish as to think of letting in the roman catholics the unthinking and the ignorant of all classes were much alike arthur hallam went to see king john in 1827 and he tells his friend how the lines about the italian priest act iii sc 1 provoked rounds of clapping while a gentleman in the next box cried out at the top of his voice bravo bravo no pope the same correspondent told gladstone of the father of a common eton friend who had challenged him with the overwhelming question could i say that any papist had ever at any time done any good to the world a still stormier conflict than even the emancipation of the catholics was now to shake oxford and the country to the depths before mr gladstone took his degree                                      ii                             oxford friendships  his friendships at oxford mr gladstone did not consider to have been as a rule very intimate principal among them were frederick rogers long afterwards lord blachford doyle gaskell bruce afterwards lord elgin charles canning afterwards lord canning the two denisons lord lincoln these had all been his friends at eton among new acquisitions to the circle of his intimates at one time or another of his oxford life were the two aclands thomas and arthur hamilton afterwards bishop of salisbury phillimore destined to close and lifelong friendship f d maurice then of exeter college a name destined to stir so many minds in the coming generation of maurice arthur hallam had written to gladstone june 1830 exhorting him to cultivate his acquaintance i know many says hallam whom maurice has moulded like a second nature and these too men eminent for intellectual power to whom the presence of a commanding spirit would in all other cases be a signal rather for rivalry than reverential acknowledgment i knew maurice well says mr gladstone in one of his notes of reminiscence had heard superlative accounts of him from cambridge and really strove hard to make them all realities to myself one sunday morning we walked to marsh baldon to hear mr porter the incumbent a calvinist independent of the clique and a man of remarkable power as we both thought i think he and other friends did me good but i got little solid meat from him as i found him difficult to catch and still more difficult to hold  sidney herbert afterwards so dear to him now at oriel here first became an acquaintance manning though they both read with the same tutor and one succeeded the other as president of the union he did not at this time know well the lists of his guests at wines and breakfasts do not even contain the name of james hope indeed mr gladstone tells us that he certainly was not more than an acquaintance in the account of intimates is the unexpected name of tupper who in days to come acquired for a time a grander reputation than he deserved by his proverbial philosophy and on whom the public by and by avenged its own foolishness by severer doses of mockery than he had earned39 the friend who seems most to have affected him in the deepest things was anstice whom he describes to his father june 4 1830 as a very clever man and more than a clever man a man of excellent principle and of perfect selfcommand and of great industry if any circumstances could confer upon me the inestimable blessing of fixed habits and unremitting industry these the example of such a man will be they the diary tells how in august 1830 mr gladstone conversed with anstice in a walk from oxford to cuddesdon on subjects of the highest importance thoughts then first sprang up in my soul obvious as they may appear to many which may powerfully influence my destiny o for a light from on high i have no power none to discern the right path for myself they afterwards had long talks together about that awful subject which has lately almost engrossed my mind another dayconversation of an hour and a half with anstice on practical religion particularly as regards our own situation i bless and praise god for his presence here long talk with anstice would i were more worthy to be his companion conversation with anstice he talked much with saunders on the motive of actions contending for the love of god not selfishness even in its most refined form40                        evangelical in religion  in the matter of his own school of religion mr gladstone was always certain that oxford in his undergraduate days had no part in turning him from an evangelical into a high churchman the tone and dialect of his diary and letters at the time show how just this impression was we find him in 1830 expressing his satisfaction that a number of hannah mores tracts have been put on the list of the christian knowledge society in 1831 he bitterly deplores such ecclesiastical appointments as those of sydney smith and dr maltby both of them i believe regular latitudinarians he remembered his shock at butlers laudation of nature he was scandalised by a sermon in which calvin was placed upon the same level among heresiarchs as socinus and other like aliens from gospel truth he was delighted march 1830 with a university sermon against milmans history of the jews and hopes it may be useful as an antidote for milman though i do think without intentions directly evil does go far enough to be justly called a bane for instance he says that had moses never existed the hebrew nation would have remained a degraded pariah tribe or been lost in the mass of the egyptian populationand this notwithstanding the promise in all his letters in the period from eton to the end of oxford and later a language noble and exalted even in these youthful days is not seldom copiously streaked with a vein that to eyes not trained to evangelical light and to minds not tolerant of the expansion that comes to religious natures in the days of adolescence may seem unpleasantly strained and excessive the fashion of such words undergoes transfiguration as the epochs pass yet in all their fashions even the crudest they deserve much tenderness he consults a clergyman 1829 on the practice of prayer meetings in his rooms his correspondent answers that as the wicked have their orgies and meet to gamble and to drink so they that fear the lord should speak often to one another concerning him that prayer meetings are not for the cultivation or exhibition of gifts nor to enable noisy and forward young men to pose as leaders of a school of prophets but if a few young men of like tastes feel the withering influence of mere scholastic learning and the necessity of mutual stimulation and refreshment then such prayer meetings would be a safe and natural remedy the students attention to all religious observances was close and unbroken the most living part of his existence  the movement that was to convulse the church had not yet begun you may smile mr gladstone said long after when told that when i was at oxford dr hampden was regarded as a model of orthodoxy that dr newman was eyed with suspicion as a low churchman and dr pusey as leaning to rationalism what mr gladstone afterwards described as a steady clear but dry anglican orthodoxy bore sway and frowned this way or that on the first indication of any tendency to diverge from the beaten path41 he hears whately preach a controversial sermon 1831 just after he had been made archbishop of dublin doubtless he is a man of much power and many excellences but his antisabbatical doctrine is i fear as mischievous as it is unsound a sermon of kebles at st marys prompts the uneasy question are all mr kebles opinions those of scripture and the church of his life and heart and practice none could doubt all would admire a good sermon is mentioned from blanco white that strange and forlorn figure of whom in later life mr gladstone wrote an interesting account not conclusive in argument but assuredly not wanting in either delicacy or generosity42 dr pusey was very kind to me when i was an undergraduate at oxford he says but what their relations were i know not i knew and respected both bishop lloyd and dr pusey he says but neither of them attempted to exercise the smallest influence over my religious opinions with newman he seems to have been brought into contact hardly at all43 newman and one of the wilberforces came to dine at cuddesdon one day and on a later occasion he and another fellow of oriel were at a dinner with mr gladstone at the table of his friend philip pusey two or three of his sermons are mentioned one of them march 7 1831 contained much singular not to say objectionable matter if one may so speak of so good a man of anotherheard newman preach a good sermon on those who made excuse sept 25 1831 of the generality of university sermons he accepted the observation of his friend ansticedepend upon it such sermons as those can never convert a single person on some sundays he hears two of these discourses in the morning and afternoon and a third sermon in the evening for though he became the most copious of all speakers mr gladstone was ever the most generous of listeners it was at st ebbs that he found really congenial ministrationsan ecclesiastical centre described by him fifty years laterunder mr bulteel a man of some note in his day here the flame was at white heat and a score or two of young men felt its attractions44 he always remembered among the wonderful sights of his life st marys crammed in all parts by all orders when mr bulteel an outlying calvinist preached his accusatory sermon some of it too true against the university in the summer of 1830 mr gladstone notes poor bulteel has lost his church for preaching in the open air pity that he should have acted so and pity that it should be found necessary to make such an example of a man of god the preacher was impenitent for from a window mr gladstone again heard him conduct a service for a large congregation who listened attentively to a sermon that was interesting but evinced some soreness of spirit a most painful discourse from a mr crowther so moves mr gladstone that he sits down to write to the preacher earnestly expostulating with him on the character and the doctrines of the sermon and after rewriting his letter he delivers it with his own hand at the door of the displeasing divine the effect was not other than salutary for a little later he was happy to hear two sermons of good principles from mr crowther to his father october 27 1830dr chalmers has been passing through oxford and i went to hear him preach on sunday evening though it was at the baptist chapel i need hardly say that his sermon was admirable and quite as remarkable for the judicious and sober manner in which he enforced his views as for their lofty principles and piety he preached i think for an hour and forty minutes the admiration thus first aroused only grew with fuller knowledge in the coming years                               essay club  an essay club called from its founders initials the weg was formed at a meeting in gaskells rooms in october 1829 only two members out of the first twelve did not belong to christ church rogers of oriel and moncreiff of new45 the essay clubs transactions though not very serious deserve a glance mr gladstone reads an essay feb 20 1830 on the comparative rank of poetry and philosophy concluding with a motion that the rank of philosophy is higher than that of poetry it was beaten by seven to five without a division they determined that english poetry is of a higher order than greek the truth of the principles of phrenology was affirmed with the tremendous emphasis of eleven to one though trifling in degree the influence of the modern drama was pronounced in quality pernicious gladstone gave his casting vote against the capacious proposition of which philosophers had made so much in france switzerland and other places on the eve of the french revolution that education and other outward circumstances have more than nature to do with mans disposition by four to three mr tennysons poems were affirmed to show considerable genius gladstone happily in the too slender majority the motion that political liberty is not to be considered as the end of government was a great affair maurice who had been admitted to the club on coming to oxford from cambridge moved an amendment that every man has a right to perform certain personal duties with which no system of government has a right to interfere gladstone objected to an observation that had fallen from the mover a man finds himself in the world as if he did not come into the world under a debt to his parents under obligations to society the tame motion of lord abercorn that elizabeths conduct to mary queen of scots was unjustifiable and impolitic was stiffened into not only unjustifiable and impolitic but a base and treacherous murder and in that severe form was carried without a division  plenty of nonsense was talked we may be sure and so there was no doubt in the olive grove of academe or amid those surnamed peripatetics and the sect epicurean yet nonsense notwithstanding the essay club had members who proved in time to have superior minds if ever men had and their disputations in one anothers rooms helped to sharpen their mental apparatus to start trains of ideas however immature and to shake the cherished dogmatisms brought from beloved homes even if dogmatism as stringent took their place this is how the world moves and oxford was just beginning to rub its eyes awaking to the speculations of a new time  when he looked back in after times mr gladstone traced one great defect in the education of oxford perhaps it was my own fault but i must admit that i did not learn when i was at oxford that which i have learned sincenamely to set a due value on the imperishable and inestimable principle of british liberty the temper which too much prevailed in academical circles was that liberty was regarded with jealousy and fear something which could not wholly be dispensed with but which was to be continually watched for fear of excesses46                                    iii                    tries for the ireland scholarship  in march 1830 gladstone made the first of two attempts to win the scholarship newly founded by dean ireland and from the beginning one of the most coveted of university prizes in 1830 march 16 he wrotethere is it appears smaller chance than ever of its falling out of the hands of the shrewsbury people there is a very formidable one indeed by name scott come up from christ church if it is to go among them i hope he may get it this was robert scott afterwards master of balliol and then dean of rochester and the coadjutor with dean liddell in the famous greek lexicon brought out in 1843 a year later he tried again but little better success came either to himself or to scott he tells his father the story march 16th 1831 and collegians who have fought such battles may care to hear it       i must first tell you that i am not the successful candidate and      after this i shall have nothing to communicate but what will i      think give you pleasure the scholarship has been won by i      believe a native of liverpool47 his name is brancker and he is      now actually at shrewsbury but had matriculated here though he had      not come up to reside this result has excited immense surprise      for my own part i went into the examination solely depending for      any hope of preeminence above the shrewsbury men on three points      greek history one particular kind of greek verses and greek      philosophy it so fell out however that not one of these three      points was brought to bear on the examination though indeed it      is but a lame one without them accordingly from the turn it seemed      to take as it proceeded my own expectations regularly declined      and i thought i might consider myself very well off if i came in      pretty high as it is i am even with the great competitor scott      whom everybody almost thought the favourite candidate and above      the others allies an eton man scott and i are placed together      and short one of the examiners told us this morning that it was      an extremely near thing and he had great difficulty in making up      his mind which he never had felt in any former examination in      which he had been engaged and indeed he laid the preference given      to brancker chiefly on his having written short and concise      answers while ours were longwinded and in consideration of its      having been so closely contested the vicechancellor is to present      each of us with a set of books something however may fairly      enough be attributed to the fact that at eton we were not educated      for such objects as these the result will affect the      scholarship itself more than any individual character for previous      events have created and this has contributed amazingly to      strengthen a prevalent impression that the shrewsbury system is      radically a false one and that its object is not to educate the      mind but merely to cram and stuff it for these purposes however      we who are beaten are not fair judges i only trust that you      will not be more annoyed than i am by this event  brancker was said to have won because he answered all the questions not only shortly but most of them right and mr gladstones essay was marked desultory beyond belief below allies came sidney herbert then at oriel and grove afterwards a judge and an important name in the history of scientific speculation  he was equally unsuccessful in another field of competition he sent in a poem on richard coeur de lion for the newdigate prize in 1829 in 1893 somebody asked his leave to reprint it and at mr gladstones request sent him a copy       on perusing it i was very much struck by the contrast it exhibited      between the faculty of versification which i thought was good      and the faculty of poetry which was very defective this faculty      of verse had been trained i suppose by versemaking at eton and      was based upon the possession of a good or tolerable ear with which      nature had endowed me i think that a poetical faculty did develop      itself in me a little later that is to say between twenty and      thirty due perhaps to having read dante with a real devotion and      absorption it was however in my view true but weak and has      never got beyond that stage it was evidently absent from the      verses i will not say the poem on coeur de lion and without      hesitation i declined to allow any reprint48                            debates at the union  he was active in the debates at the union where he made his first start in the speaking line feb 1830 in a strong oration much admired by his friends in favourof all the questionable things in the worldof the treason and sedition acts of 1795 he writes home that he did not find the ordeal so formidable as it used to be before the smaller audiences at eton for at oxford they sometimes mustered as many as a hundred or a hundred and fifty he spoke for a stronglyworded motion on a happier theme in favour of the policy and memory of canning in the summer of 1831 he mentions a debate in which a motion was proposed in favour of speedy emancipation of the west indian slaves i moved an amendment that education of a religious kind was the fit object of legislation which was carried by thirtythree to twelve of the most notable of all his successes at the union we shall soon hear                                daily life  his little diary written for no eye but his own and in the use of which i must beware of the sin of violating the sanctuary contains in the most concise of daily records all his various activities and at least after the summer at cuddesdon it presents an attractive picture of duty industry and attention constant as the motion of the day the entries are much alike and a few of them will suffice to bring his life and him before us the days for 1830 may almost be taken at random       may 10

wednesday night when      shall we learn wisdom not that i see folly in the fact of playing      cards but it is too often accompanied by a dissipated spirit  he did not escape the usual sensations of the desultory when fate forces them to wear the collar in fact at times i find it very irksome and my having the inclination to view it in that light is to me the surest demonstration that my mind was in great want of some discipline and some regular exertion for hitherto i have read by fits and starts and just as it pleased me i hope that this vacation summer of 1830 will confer on me one benefit more important than any having reference merely to my classi mean the habit of steady application and strict economy of time                        correspondence with hallam  among the recorded fragmentary items of 1830 by the way he read mills celebrated essay on coleridge which when it was republished a generation later along with the companion essay on bentham made so strong an impression on the oxford of my day he kept up a correspondence with hallam now at cambridge and an extract from one of hallams letters may show something of the writer as of the friend for whose sympathising mind it was intended       academical honours would be less than nothing to me were it not for      my fathers wishes and even these are moderate on the subject if      it please god that i make the name i bear honoured in a second      generation it will be by inward power which is its own reward if      it please him not i hope to go down to the grave unrepining for i      have lived and loved and been loved and what will be the momentary      pangs of an atomic existence when the scheme of that providential      love which pervades sustains quickens this boundless universe      shall at the last day be unfolded and adored the great truth      which when we are rightly impressed with it will liberate mankind      is that no man has a right to isolate himself because every man is      a particle of a marvellous whole that when he suffers since it is      for the good of that whole he the particle has no right to      complain and in the long run that which is the good of all will      abundantly manifest itself to be the good of each other belief      consists not with theism this is its centre let me quote to their      purpose the words of my favourite poet it will do us good to hear      his voice though but for a moment                       one adequate support        for the calamities of mortal life        existsone only an assured belief        that the procession of our fate howeer        sad or disturbed is ordered by a being        of infinite benevolence and power        whose everlasting purposes embrace        all accidents converting them to good49  hallams father in that memoir so just and tender which he prefixes to his sons literary remains remarks that all his sons talk about this old desperate riddle of the origin and significance of evil like the talk of leibnitz about it resolved itself into an unproved assumption of the necessity of evil in truth there is little sign that either arthur hallam or gladstone had in him the making of the patient and methodical thinker in the high abstract sphere they were both of them cast in another mould but the efficacy of human relationships springs from a thousand subtler and more mysterious sources than either patience or method in our thinking such marked efficacy was there in the friendship of these two both of them living under pure skies but one of the pair endowed besides with the thews that throw the world  whether in gladstones diary or in his letters in the midst of herodotus and butler and aristotle and the rest of the timeworn sages we are curiously conscious of the presence of a spirit of action affairs excitement it is not the born scholar eager in search of knowledge for its own sake there is little of miltons quiet air of delightful studies and none of pascals labouring for truth with many a heavy sigh the end of it all is as aristotle said it should be not knowing but doinghonourable desire of success satisfaction of the hopes of friends a general literary appetite conscious preparation for private and public duty in the world a steady progression out of the shallows into the depths a gaze beyond garden and cloister in agmen in pulverem in clamorem to the dust and burning sun and shouting of the days of conflict                                      iv  in september 1829 as we have seen huskisson had disappeared thomas gladstone was in the train drawn by the dart that ran over the statesman and killed him       poor huskisson he writes to william gladstone the great promoter      of the railroad has fallen a victim to its opening as soon as      i heard that huskisson had been run over i ran and found him on      the ground close to the dukes wellington car his legs      apparently both broken though only one was the ground covered      with blood his eyes open but death written in his face when they      raised him a little he said leave me let me die god forgive      me i am a dead man i can never stand this on tuesday he      made a speech in the exchange reading room when he said he hoped      long to represent them he said too that day that we were sure      of a fine day for the duke would have his old luck talked      jokingly too of insuring his life for the ride  and he notes as others did the extraordinary circumstance that of half a million of people on the line of road the victim should be the dukes great opponent thus carried off suddenly before his eyes  there was some question of mr john gladstone taking huskissons place as one of the members for liverpool but he did not covet it he foresaw too many local jealousies his deafness would be sadly against him he was nearly sixtyfive and he felt himself too old to face the turmoil he looked upon the wellington government as the only government possible though as a friend of canning he freely recognised its defects the selfwill of the duke and the parcel of mediocrities and drones with whom excepting peel he had filled his cabinet his view of the state of parties in the autumn of 1830 is clear and succinct enough to deserve reproduction huskissons death he writes to his son at christ church october 29 1830 was a great gain to the duke for he was the most formidable thorn to prick him in the parliament of those who acted with huskisson none have knowledge or experience sufficient to enable them to do so as for the whigs they can all talk and make speeches but they are not men of business the ultratories are too contemptible and wanting in talent to be thought of the radicals cannot be trusted for they would soon pull down the venerable fabric of our constitution the liberals or independents must at least generally side with the duke they are likely to meet each other half way                             the reform bill  in less than a week after this acute survey the duke made his stalwart declaration in the house of lords against all parliamentary reform i have not said too much have i he asked of lord aberdeen on sitting down youll hear of it was aberdeens reply youve announced the fall of your government thats all said another in a fortnight november 18 the duke was out lord grey was in and the country was gradually plunged into a determined struggle for the amendment of its constitution  mr gladstone as a resolute canningite was as fiercely hostile to the second and mightier innovation as he had been eager for the relief of the catholics and it was in connection with the reform bill that he first made a public mark the reader will recall the stages of that event how the bill was read a second time in the commons by a majority of one on march 22nd 1831 how after a defeat by a majority of eight on a motion of going into committee lord grey dissolved how the country shaken to its depths gave the reformers such undreamed of strength that on july 8th the second reading of the bill was carried by a hundred and thirtysix how on october 8th the lords rejected it by fortyone and what violent commotions that deed provoked how a third bill was brought in december 12th 1831 and passed through the commons march 23rd 1832 how the lords were still refractory what a lacerating ministerial crisis ensued and how at last in june the bill which was to work the miracle of a millennium actually became the law of the land not even the pressure of preparation for the coming ordeal of the examination schools could restrain the activity and zeal of our oxonian canning had denounced parliamentary reform at liverpool in 1820 and afterwards had declared in the house of commons that if anybody asked him what he meant to do on the subject he would oppose reform to the end of his life under whatever shape it might appear cannings disciple at christ church was as vehement as the master50 to a friend he wrote in 1865       i think that oxford teaching had in our day an antipopular      tendency i must add that it was not owing to the books but rather      to the way in which they were handled and further that it tended      still more strongly in my opinion to make the love of truth      paramount over all other motives in the mind and thus that it      supplied an antidote for whatever it had of bane the reform bill      frightened me in 1831 and drove me off my natural and previous      bias burke and canning misled many on that subject and they      misled me  while staying at leamington whither his family constantly went in order to be under the medical care of the famous jephson mr gladstone went to a reform meeting at warwick of which he wrote a contemptuous account in a letter to the standard april 7 the gentry present were few the nobility none the clergy one only while the mob beneath the grand stand was athenian in its levity in its recklessness in its gaping expectancy in its selflove and selfconceitin everything but its acuteness if sir the nobility the gentry the clergy are to be alarmed overawed or smothered by the expression of popular opinion such as this and if no great statesman be raised up in our hour of need to undeceive this unhappy multitude now eagerly rushing or heedlessly sauntering along the pathway of revolution as an ox goeth to the slaughter or a fool to the correction of the stocks what is it but a symptom as infallible as it is appalling that the day of our greatness and stability is no more and that the chill and damp of death are already creeping over englands glory these dolorous spectres haunted him incessantly as they haunted so many who had not the sovereign excuse of youth and his rhetoric was perfectly sincere he felt bound to say that as far as he could form an opinion the ministry most richly deserved impeachment its great innovations and its small alike moved his indignation when brougham committed the enormity of hearing causes on good friday gladstone repeats with deep complacency a saying of wetherell that brougham was the first judge who had done such a thing since pontius pilate                           oxford electioneering  the undergraduates took their part in the humours of the great election and oxford turned out her chivalry gallantly to bring in the antireform candidate for the county to the nomination i mounted the mare to join the antireform procession writes the impassioned student to his father and we looked as well as we could do considering that we were all covered with mud from head to foot there was mob enough on both sides but i must do them justice to say they were for the most part exceedingly goodhumoured and after we had dismounted we went among them and elbowed one another and bawled and bellowed with the most perfect good temper at the nomination in the town hall there was so much row raised that not one of the candidates could be heard the effect of these exercitations was a hoarseness and cold which did not however prevent the sufferer from taking his part in a mighty bonfire in peckwater on another day       i went with denison and another man named jeffreys between eleven      and twelve we began to talk to some men among weylands friends      they crowded round and began to holloa at us and were making a      sort of ring round us preparatory to a desperate hustle when lo      up rushed a body of norreys men from st thomass broke their      ranks raised a shout and rescued us in great style i shall ever      be grateful to the men of st thomass when we were talking      jeffreys said something which made one man holloa oh his      fathers a parson this happened to be true and flabbergasted me      but he happily turned it by reminding them that they were going to      vote for mr harcourt son of the greatest parson in england but      one archbishop of york afterwards they left me and i pursued my      work alone conversed with a great number shook hands with a fair      proportion made some laugh and once very nearly got hustled when      alone but happily escaped you would be beyond measure astonished      how unanimous and how strong is the feeling among the freeholders      who may be taken as a fair specimen of the generality of all      counties against the catholic question reformers and      antireformers were alike sensitive on that point and perfectly      agreed one man said to me what vote for lord norreys why he      voted against the country both times for the catholic bill and      then against the reform what would this atrocious ministry have      said had the appeal to the voice of the people which they now      quote as their authority been made in 1829 i held forth to a      working man possibly a fortyshilling freeholder he adds in a      fragment of later years on the established text reform was      revolution to corroborate my doctrine i said why look at the      revolutions in foreign countries meaning of course france and      belgium the man looked hard at me and said these very words damn      all foreign countries what has old england to do with foreign      countries this is not the only time that i have received an      important lesson from a humble source                            speech at the union  a more important scene which his own future eminence made in a sense historic was a debate at the union upon reform in the same month where his contribution may 17th struck all his hearers with amazement so brilliant so powerful so incomparably splendid did it seem to their young eyes his description of it to his brother may 20th 1831 is modest enough       i should really have been glad if your health had been such as to      have permitted your visiting oxford last week so that you might      have heard our debate for certainly there had never been anything      like it known here before and will scarcely be again the      discussion on the question that the ministers were incompetent to      carry on the government of the country was of a miscellaneous      character and i moved what they called a rider to the effect      that the reform bill threatened to change the form of the british      government and ultimately to break up the whole frame of society      the debate altogether lasted three nights and it closed then      partly because the votes had got tired of dancing attendance      partly because the speakers of the revolutionary side were      exhausted there were eight or nine more on ours ready and indeed      anxious as it was there were i think fifteen speeches on our side      and thirteen on theirs or something of that kind every man spoke      above his average and many very far beyond it they were generally      short enough moncreiff a longwinded scotsman spouted nearly an      hour and i was guilty of threequarters i remember at eton where      we used when i first went into the society to speak from three to      ten minutes i thought it must be one of the finest things in the      world to speak for threequarters of an hour and there was a      legend circulated about an old member of the societys having done      so which used to make us all gape and stare however i fear it      does not necessarily imply much more than length doyle spoke      remarkably well and made a violent attack on mr cannings      friends which gaskell did his best to answer but very      ineffectually from the nature of the case we got a conversion      speech from a christ church gentlemancommoner named alston which      produced an excellent effect and the division was favourable      beyond anything we had hopedninetyfour to thirtyeight we      should have had larger numbers still had we divided on the first      night great diligence was used by both parties in bringing men      down but the tactics on the whole were better on our side and we      had fewer truants in proportion to our numbers england expects      every man to do his duty and ours humble as it is has been done      in reference to this question on friday i wrote a letter to the      standard giving an account of the division which you will see in      saturdays paper if you think it worth while to refer to it the      way in which the present generation of undergraduates is divided      on the question is quite remarkable  the occasion was to prove a memorable one in his career and a few more lines about it from his diary will not be considered superfluous       may 16thsleepy mathematics few and shuffling and lecture      read cannings reform speeches at liverpool and made extracts rode      out debate which was adjourned i am to try my hand tomorrow my      thoughts were but illarranged but i fear they will be no better      then wine with anstice singing tea with lincoln       may 17thethics little mathematics a good deal exhausted in      forenoon from heat last night dined with white and had wine with      him also with young acland cogitations on reform etc difficult      to select matter for a speech not to gather it spoke at the      adjourned debate for threequarters of an hour immediately after      gaskell who was preceded by lincoln row afterwards and      adjournment tea with wordsworth  when gladstone sat down one of his contemporaries has written we all of us felt that an epoch in our lives had occurred his father was so well pleased with the glories of the speech and with its effect that he wished to have it published besides his speech besides the composition of sturdy placards against the monstrous bill and besides the preparation of an elaborate petition51 and the gathering of 770 signatures to it the ardent antireformer though the distance from the days of doom in the examination schools was rapidly shrinking actually sat down to write a long pamphlet july 1831 and sent it to hatchard the publisher hatchard doubted the success of an anonymous pamphlet and replied in the too familiar formula that has frozen so many thousand glowing hearts that he would publish it if the author would take the money risk the most interesting thing about it is the criticism of the writers shrewd and wise father upon his sons performance too long for reproduction here he went with his son in the main he says but i cannot go all your lengths and the language of his judgment sheds a curious light upon the vehement temperament of mr gladstone at this time as it struck an affectionate yet firm and sober monitor                                                                         hears his first debate  in the autumn of 1831 mr gladstone took some trouble to be present on one of the cardinal occasions in this fluctuating history       october 3rd to 8thjourney to london from henley in      blackstones chaise present at five nights debate of infinite      interest in the house of lords the first i went forwards and      underwent a somewhat high pressure at the four others sat on a      round transverse rail very fortunate in being so well placed had      a full view of the peeresses there nine or ten hours every      evening read peels speech and sundry papers relating to kings      college which i went to see also london bridge read introduction      to butler wrote to saunders much occupied in orderhunting during      the morning lord broughams as a speech most wonderful delivered      with a power and effect which cannot be appreciated by any hearsay      mode of information and with fertile exuberance in sarcasm in      point of argument it had i think little that was new lord greys      most beautiful lord goderichs and lord lansdownes extremely      good and in these was comprehended nearly all the oratorical merit      of the debate the reasoning or the attempt to reason      independently of the success in such attempt certainly seemed to      me to be with the opposition their best speeches i thought were      those of lords harrowby carnarvon mansfield wynford next lords      lyndhurst wharncliffe and the duke of wellington lord greys      reply i did not hear having been compelled by exhaustion to leave      the house remained with ryder and pickering in the coffeeroom or      walking about until the division and joined wellesley and      illegible as we walked home went to bed for an hour      breakfasted and came off by the alert arrived safely thank god      in oxford wrote to my brother and to gaskell tea with phillimore      and spent the remainder of the evening with canning the      consequences of the vote may be awful god avert this but it was      an honourable and manly decision and so may god avert them  this was the memorable occasion when the lords threw out the reform bill by 199 to 158 the division not taking place until six oclock in the morning the consequences as the country instantly made manifest were awful enough to secure the reversal of the decision it seems so far as i can make out to have been the first debate that one of the most consummate debaters that ever lived had the fortune of listening to                                      v                          reading for the schools  meanwhile intense interest in parliament and the newspapers had not impaired his studies disgusted as he was at the political outlook in the beginning of july he had fallen fairly to work more or less close for ten or twelve hours a day it proved as of old a cure for illhumour though in itself not of the most delectable kind it is odd enough though true that reading hard closegrained stuff produces a much more decided and better effect in this way than books written professedly for the purpose of entertainment then his eyes became painful affected the head and in august almost brought him to a full stop after absolute remission of work for a few days he slowly spread full sail again and took good care no more to stint either exercise or sleep thinking himself strange as it now sounds rather below than above par for such exertions he declared that the bodily fatigue the mental fatigue and the anxiety as to the result made reading for a class a thing not to be undergone more than once in a lifetime time had mightier fatigues in store for him than even this the heavy work among the ideas of men of bygone days did not deaden intellectual projects of his own a few days before he went to see the lords throw out the reform bill he made a curious entry       october 3rd 1831yesterday an idea a chimera entered my      head of gathering during the progress of my life notes and      materials for a work embracing three divisions morals politics      education and i commit this notice to paper now that many years      hence if it please god i may find it either a pleasant or at      least an instructive reminiscence a pleasant and instructing one      i trust if i may ever be permitted to execute this design      instructive if it shall point while in embryo and serve to teach      me the folly of presumptuous schemes conceived during the buoyancy      of youth and only relinquished on a discovery of incompetency in      later years meanwhile i am only contemplating the gradual      accumulation of materials  the reading went on at a steady pace not without social intermissions       oct 11th and 12throde papers virgil thucydides both      days also some optics wrote a long letter home read a chapter of      butler each day hume breakfasted also with canning to meet lady      canning she received us i thought with great kindness and      spoke a great deal about lord greys conduct with reference to her      husbands memory with great animation and excitement her hand in      a strong tremor it was impossible not to enter into her feelings  then comes the struggle for the palm       monday november 7th to saturday 12thin the schools or      preparing read most of niebuhr finished going over the      agamemnon got up aristophanic and other hard words went over my      books of extracts etc read some of whatelys rhetoric got up a      little polybius and the history out of livy decade one in the      schools wednesday thursday and friday each day about six and a      half hours at work or under first stratfords speech into latin      with logical and rhetorical questionsthe latter somewhat      abstract dined at gaskells and met pearson a clever and      agreeable man on thursday a piece of johnsons preface in morning      in evening critical questions which i did very badly but i      afterwards heard better than the rest which i could not and      cannot understand on friday we had in the morning historical      questions wrote a vast quantity of matter ill enough digested in      the evening greek to translate and illustrate heard cheering      accounts indirectly of myself for which i ought to be very      thankful dined with pearson at the mitre very kind in him to      ask me made saturday in great measure an idle day had a good ride      with gaskell spent part of the evening with him read about six      hours sunday november 13thchapel thrice breakfast and      much conversation with cameron read bible some divinity of a      character approaching to cram looked over my shorter abstract of      butler tea with harrison walk with gaskell wine with hamilton      more of a party than i quite liked or expected altogether my mind      was in an unsatisfactory state though i heard a most admirable      sermon from tyler on bethesda which could not have been more      opportune if written on purpose for those who are going into the      schools but i am cold timid and worldly and not in a healthy      state of mind for the great trial of tomorrow to which i know i      am utterly and miserably unequal but which i also know will be      sealed for good  here is his picture of his viva voce examination       november 14thspent the morning chiefly in looking over my      polybius short abstract of ethics and definitions also some hard      words went into the schools at ten and from this time was little      troubled with fear examined by stocker in divinity i did not      answer as i could have wished hampden the famous heresiarch in      science a beautiful examination and with every circumstance in my      favour he said to me thank you you have construed extremely      well and appear to be thoroughly acquainted with your books or      something to that effect then followed a very clever examination      in history from garbett and an agreeable and short one in my poets      from cremer who spoke very kindly to me at the close i was only      put on in eight books besides the testament namely rhetoric      ethics phædo herodotus thucydides odyssey aristophanes      vespae and persius everything was in my favour the examiners      kind beyond everything a good many persons there and all      friendly at the end of the science of course my spirits were      much raised and i could not help at that moment giving thanks to      him without whom not even such moderate performances would have      been in my power afterwards rode to cuddesdon with the denisons      and wrote home with exquisite pleasure                          his double first class  i have read a story by some contemporary how all attempts to puzzle him by questions on the minutest details of herodotus only brought out his knowledge more fully how the excitement reached its climax when the examiner after testing his mastery of some point of theology said we will now leave that part of the subject and the candidate carried away by his interest in the subject answered no sir if you please we will not leave it yet and began to pour forth a fresh stream ten days later after a morning much disturbed and excited he rode in the afternoon and by halfpast four the list was out with gladstone and denison both of them in the first class phillimore and maurice in the second herbert in the fourth  then mathematics were to come the interval between the two schools he passed at cuddesdon working some ten hours a day at his hardest riding every day with denison and all of them in high spirits but optics algebra geometry calculus trigonometry and the rest filled him with misgivings for the future every day i read i am more and more thoroughly convinced of my incapacity for the subject my work continued and my reluctance to exertion increased with it for the sunday before the examination this is the entry and a characteristic and remarkable one it isteaching in the school morning and evening saunders preached well on ye cannot serve god and mammon read bible and four of horsleys sermons paid visits to old people  on december 10th the mathematical ordeal began and lasted four days the doctor gave him draughts to quiet his excitement better than draughts he read wordsworth every day on sunday december 11th he went as usual twice to chapel and heard newman preach a most able discourse of a very philosophical character more apt for reading than for hearingat least i in the jaded state of my mind was unable to do it any justice on december 14th the list was out and his name was again in the first class again along with denison as everybody knows peel had won a doublefirst twentythree years before and in mathematics peel had the first class to himself mr gladstone in each of the two schools was one of five anstice whose counsels and example he counted for so much at one epoch in his collegiate life in 1830 carried off the same double crown and was like peel alone in the mathematical first class       it was an hour of thrilling happiness between the past and the      future for the future was i hope not excluded and feeling was      well kept in check by the bustle of preparation for speedy      departure saw the dean biscoe saunders whom i thanked for his      extreme kindness and such of my friends as were in oxford all      most warm the mutual handshaking between denison jeffreys and      myself was very hearty wine with bruce packed up my      things wrote at more or less length to mrs g his mother      gaskell phillimore mr denison my old tutor knapp left      oxford on the champion       december 15thafter finding the first practicable coach to      cambridge was just able to manage breakfast in bedford square left      holborn at ten in cambridge before five  here he was received by wordsworth the master of trinity and father of his oxford tutor he had a visit full of the peculiar excitement and felicity that those who are capable of it know nowhere else than at oxford and cambridge he heard hallam recite his declamation was introduced to the mighty whewell to spedding the great baconian to smyth the professor of history to blakesley renewed his acquaintance with the elder hallam listened to glorious anthems at trinity and kings tried to hear a sermon from simeon the head of the english evangelicals met stanhope an old eton man and the two sons of lord grey and copied a letter of mr pitts from cambridge he made his way home having thus triumphantly achieved the first stage of his long life journey amid the manifold mutations of his career to oxford his affection was passionate as it was constant there is not a man that has passed through that great and famous university that can say with more truth than i can say i love her from the bottom of my heart52                                     vi                      thoughts on future profession  another episode must have a place before i close this chapter at the end of 1828 the youthful gladstone had composed a long letter of which the manuscript survives to a liverpool newspaper earnestly contesting its appalling proposition that man has no more control over his belief than he has over his stature or his colour and beseeching the editor to try leslies short method with the deists if he be unfortunate enough to doubt the authority of the bible at oxford his fervour carried him beyond the fluent tract to a personal decision on august 4th 1830 the entry is thisbegan thucydides also working up herodotus greek exêrtumenos construing thucydides at night uncomfortable again and much distracted with doubts as to my future line of conduct god direct me i am utterly blind wrote a very long letter to my dear father on the subject of my future profession wishing if possible to bring the question to an immediate and final settlement the letter is exorbitant in length it is vague it is obscure but the appeal contained in it is as earnest as any appeal from son to parent on such a subject ever was and it is of special interest as the first definite indication alike of the extraordinary intensity of his religious disposition and of that doublemindedness that division of sensibility between the demands of spiritual and of secular life which remained throughout one of the marking traits of his career he declares his conviction that his duty alike to man as a social being and as a rational and reasonable being to god summons him with a voice too imperative to be resisted to forsake the ordinary callings of the world and to take upon himself the clerical office the special need of devotion to that office he argues must be plain to any one who casts his eye over the moral wilderness of the world who contemplates the pursuits desires designs and principles of the beings that move so busily in it to and fro without an object beyond the finding food for it mental or bodily for the present moment this letter the reader will find in full elsewhere53 the missionary impulse the yearning for some apostolic destination the glow of selfdevotion to a supreme external will is a wellknown element in the youth of ardent natures of either sex in a thousand forms sometimes for good sometimes for evil such a mood has played its part in history in this case as in many another the impulse in its first shape did not endure but in essence it never faded  his father replied as a wise man was sure to do almost with sympathy with entire patience and with thorough common sense the son dutifully accepts the admonition that it is too early to decide so grave an issue and that the immediate matter is the approaching performance in the examination schools i highly approve his father had written nov 8th 1830 your proposal to leave undetermined the profession you are to follow until you return from the continent and complete your education in all respects you will then have seen more of the world and have greater confidence in the choice you may make for it will then rest wholly with yourself having our advice whenever you may wish for it the critical issue was now finally settled at almost equal length and in parts of this second letter no less vague and obscure than the first but with more concentrated power mr gladstone tells his father jan 17th 1832 how the excitement has subsided but still he sees at hand a great crisis in the history of mankind new principles he says prevail in morals politics education enlightened selfinterest is made the substitute for the old bonds of unreasoned attachment and under the plausible maxim that knowledge is power one kind of ignorance is made to take the place of another kind christianity teaches that the head is to be exalted through the heart but benthamism maintains that the heart is to be amended through the head the conflict proceeding in parliament foreshadows a contest for the existence of the church establishment to be assailed through its property the whole foundation of society may go under circumstances so formidable he dares not look for the comparative calm and ease of a professional life he must hold himself free of attachment to any single post and function of a technical nature and soto make the long story shortmy own desires for future life are exactly coincident with yours in so far as i am acquainted with them believing them to be a profession of the law with a view substantially to studying the constitutional branch of it and a subsequent experiment as time and circumstances might offer on what is termed public life it tortures me he had written to his brother john august 29th 1830 to think of an inclination opposed to that of my beloved father and this was evidently one of the preponderant motives in his final decision  in the same letter while the fire of apostolic devotion was still fervid within him he had penned a couple of sentences that contain words of deeper meaning than he could surely knowi am willing to persuade myself that in spite of other longings which i often feel my heart is prepared to yield other hopes and other desires for thisof being permitted to be the humblest of those who may be commissioned to set before the eyes of man still great even in his ruins the magnificence and the glory of christian truth especially as i feel that my temperament is so excitable that i should fear giving up my mind to other subjects which have ever proved sufficiently alluring to me and which i fear would make my life a fever of unsatisfied longings and expectations so men unconsciously often hint an oracle of their lives perhaps these forebodings of a highwrought hour may in other hues have at many moments come back to mr gladstones mind even in the full sunshine of a triumphant career of duty virtue power and renown                               meditations  the entry in his diary suggested by the return of his birthday dec 29 1831 closes with the words this has been my debating society year now i fancy done with politics are fascinating to me perhaps too fascinating higher thoughts than this press in upon him       industry of a kind and for a time there has been but the industry      of necessity not of principle i would fain believe that my      sentiments in religion have been somewhat enlarged and      untrammelled but if this be true my responsibility is indeed      augmented but wherein have my deeds of duty been proportionally      modified one conclusion theoretically has been much on my      mindit is the increased importance and necessity and benefit of      prayerof the life of obedience and selfsacrifice may god use me      as a vessel for his own purposes of whatever character and results      in relation to myself may the god who loves us all still      vouchsafe me a testimony of his abiding presence in the protracted      though well nigh dormant life of a desire which at times has risen      high in my soul a fervent and a buoyant hope that i might work an      energetic work in this world and by that work whereof the worker      is only god i might grow into the image of the redeemer it      matters not whether the sphere of duty be large or small but may      it be duly filled may those faint and languishing embers be      kindled by the truth of the everlasting spirit into a living and a      lifegiving flame  every reader will remember how just two hundred years before the sublimest of english poets had on his twentythird birthday closed the same selfreproach for sluggishness of inward life with the same aspiration    yet be it less or more or soon or slow   it shall be still in strictest measure even   to that same lot however mean or high   towards which time leads me and the will of heaven   all is if i have grace to use it so   as ever in my great taskmasters eye  two generations after he had quitted the university mr gladstone summed up her influence upon him       oxford had rather tended to hide from me the great fact that      liberty is a great and precious gift of god and that human      excellence cannot grow up in a nation without it and yet i do not      hesitate to say that oxford had even at this time laid the      foundations of my liberalism school pursuits had revealed little      but in the region of philosophy she had initiated if not inured me      to the pursuit of truth as an end of study the splendid integrity      of aristotle and still more of butler conferred upon me an      inestimable service elsewhere i have not scrupled to speak with      severity of myself but i declare that while in the arms of oxford      i was possessed through and through with a singleminded and      passionate love of truth with a virgin love of truth so that      although i might be swathed in clouds of prejudice there was      something of an eye within that might gradually pierce them  footnotes  34 charles wordsworths annals  35 after peel had begun his career jackson gave him a piece of advice that would have pleased mr gladstonelet no day pass without

to oxford where he laboured through his packing settled accounts heard a very able sermon indeed from newman at st marys took his bachelors degree jan 26 and after a day or two with relatives and friends in london left england along with his brother john at the beginning of february he did not return until the end of july he visited brussels paris florence naples rome venice and milan of this long journey he kept a full record and it contains one entry of no small moment in his mental history a conception now began to possess him that according to one religious school kindled a saving illumination and according to another threw something of a shade upon his future path in either view it marked a change of spiritual course a transformation not of religion as the centre of his being for that it always was but of the frame and mould within which religion was to expand  in entering st peters at rome march 31 1832 he experienced his first conception of unity in the church and first longed for its visible attainment here he felt the pain and shame of the schism which separates us from romewhose guilt surely rests not upon the venerable fathers of the english reformed church but upon rome itself yet whose melancholy effects the mind is doomed to feel when you enter this magnificent temple and behold in its walls the images of christian saints and the words of everlasting truth yet such is the mass of intervening encumbrances that you scarcely own and can yet more scantily realise any bond of sympathy or union this was no fleeting impression of a traveller it had been preceded by a disenchantment for he had made his way from turin to pinerol and seen one of the vaudois valleys he had framed a lofty conception of the people as ideal christians and he underwent a chill of disappointment on finding them apparently much like other men even the pastor though a quiet inoffensive man gave no sign of energy or of what would have been called in england vital religion with this chill at his heart he came upon the atmosphere of gorgeous rome it was however in the words of cloughs fine line from easter day through the great sinful streets of naples as he passed that a great mutation overtook him       one sunday may 13 something i know not what set me on examining      the occasional offices of the church in the prayer book they made      a strong impression upon me on that very day and the impression      has never been effaced i had previously taken a great deal of      teaching direct from the bible as best i could but now the figure      of the church arose before me as a teacher too and i gradually      found in how incomplete and fragmentary a manner i had drawn divine      truth from the sacred volume as indeed i had also missed in the      thirtynine articles some things which ought to have taught me      better such for i believe that i have given the fact as it      occurred in its silence and its solitude was my first      introduction to the august conception of the church of christ it      presented to me christianity under an aspect in which i had not yet      known it its ministry of symbols its channels of grace its      unending line of teachers joining from the head a sublime      construction based throughout upon historic fact uplifting the      idea of the community in which we live and of the access which it      enjoys through the new and living way to the presence of the most      high from this time i began to feel my way by decrees into or      towards a true notion of the church it became a definite and      organised idea when at the suggestion of james hope i read the      just published and remarkable work of palmer but the charm of      freshness lay upon that first disclosure of 1832  this mighty questionwhat is the nature of a church and what the duties titles and symbols of faithful membership which in divers forms had shaken the world for so many ages and now first dawned upon his ardent mind was the germ of a deep and lasting preoccupation of which we shall speedily and without cessation find abundant traces                                     ii                             offer of a seat  a few weeks later the great rival interest in mr gladstones life if rival we may call it was forced into startling prominence before him at milan he received a letter from lord lincoln saying that he was commissioned by his father the duke of newcastle to inform him that his influence in the borough of newark was at mr gladstones disposal if he should be ready to enter parliamentary life this was the fruit of his famous antireform speech at the oxford union no wonder that such an offer made him giddy this stunning and overpowering proposal he says to his father july 8 naturally left me the whole of the evening on which i received it in a flutter of confusion since that evening there has been time to reflect and to see that it is not of so intoxicating a character as it seemed at first first because the duke of newcastles offer must have been made at the instance of a single person lincoln that person young and sanguine and i may say in such a matter partial this much at least became clear to me by the time i had recovered my breath that decidedly more than mere permission from my dear father would be necessary to authorise my entering on the consideration of particulars at all and then he falls into a vein of devout reflection almost as if this sudden destination of his life were some irrevocable priesthood or vow of monastic profession and not the mere stringent secularity of labour in a parliament it would be thin and narrow to count all this an overstrain to a nature like his of such eager strength of equipment conscious of life as a battle and not a parade apt for all external action yet with a burning glow of light and fire in the internal spirit resolute from the first in small things and in great against aimless drift and eddyto such an one the moment of fixing alike the goal and the track may well have been grave  then points of doubt arose it is i daresay in your recollectionthis to his fatherthat at the time when mr canning came to power the duke of newcastle in the house of lords declared him the most profligate minister the country had ever had now it struck me to inquire of myself does the duke know the feelings i happen to entertain towards mr canning does he know or can he have had in his mind my fathers connection with mr canning the duke had in fact been one of the busiest and bitterest of cannings enemies and had afterwards in the same spirit striven with might and main to keep huskisson out of the wellington cabinet another awkwardness appeared the duke had offered a handsome contribution towards expenses would not this tend to abridge the members independence what was the footing on which patron and member were to stand mr gladstone was informed by his brother that the duke had neither heretofore asked for pledges nor now demanded them  after a very brief correspondence with his shrewd and generous father the plunge was taken and on his return to england after a fortnight spent in an amphibious state between that of a candidate and greek idiôtês or private person he issued his address to the electors of newark august 4 1832 he did not go actually on to the ground until the end of september the intervening weeks he spent with his family at torquay where he varied electioneering correspondence and yachting with plenty of sufficiently serious reading from blackstone and plato and the excursion down to corinne one sunday morning september 23 his father burst into his bedroom with the news that his presence was urgently needed at newark i rose dressed and breakfasted speedily with infinite disgust i left torquay at 8¾ and devoted my sunday to the journey was i right my father drove me to newton chaise to exeter there near an hour went to the cathedral and heard a part of the prayers mail to london conversation with a tory countryman who got in for a few miles on sunday travelling which we agreed in disapproving gave him some tracts excellent mail dined at yeovil read a little of the christian year published 1827 at 6½ am arrived at piccadilly 18½ hours from exeter went to fetter lane washed and breakfasted and came off at 8 oclock by a high flyer for newark the sun hovered red and cold through the heavy fog of london sky but in the country the day was fine tea at stamford arrived at newark at midnight such in forty hours was the first of mr gladstones countless political pilgrimages  his two election addresses are a curious startingpoint for so memorable a journey thrown into the form of a modern programme the points are theseunion of church and state the defence in particular of our irish establishments correction of the poor laws allotment of cottage grounds adequate remuneration of labour a system of christian instruction for the west indian slaves but no emancipation until that instruction had fitted them for it a dignified and impartial foreign policy the duke was much startled by the passage about labour receiving adequate remuneration which unhappily among several classes of our fellow countrymen is not now the case he did not however interfere the whig newspaper said roundly of the first of mr gladstones two addresses that a more jumbled collection of words had seldom been sent from the press the tory paper on the contrary congratulated the constituency on a candidate of considerable commercial experience and talent the antislavery men fought him stoutly they put his name into their black schedule with nineandtwenty other candidates they harried him with posers from a pamphlet of his fathers and they met his doctrine that if slavery were sinful the bible would not have commended the regulation of it by bluntly asking him on the hustings whether he knew a text in exodus declaring that he that stealeth a man and selleth him or if he be found in his hand he shall surely be put to death his fathers pamphlets undoubtedly exposed a good deal of surface we cannot be surprised that any adherent of these standard sophistries should be placed on the black list of the zealous soldiers of humanity the candidate held to the ground he had taken at oxford and in his election address and apparently made converts he had an interview with forty voters of abolitionist complexion at his hotel and according to the friendly narrative of his brother who was present he shone not only in his powers of conversation but by the tact quickness and talent with which he made his replies to the thorough and complete satisfaction of baptists wesleyan methodists and i may say even of almost every religious sect not one refused their vote they came forward and enrolled their names though before i believe they never supported any one on the dukes interest                        issues address at newark  the humours of an election of the ancient sort are a very old story and newark had its full share of them the register contained rather under sixteen hundred voters on a scot and lot qualification to elect a couple of members the principal influence over about one quarter of them was exercised by the duke of newcastle who three years before had punished the whigs of the borough for the outrage of voting against his nominee by serving in concert with another proprietor forty of them with notice to quit then the trodden worm turned the notices were framed affixed to poles and carried with bands of music through the streets even the audacity of a petition to parliament was projected the duke whose chief fault was not to know that time had brought him into a novel age defended himself with the haughty truism then just ceasing to be true that he had a right to do as he liked with his own this clearcut enunciation of a vanishing principle became a sort of landmark and gave to his name an unpleasing immortality in our political history in the high tide of agitation for reform the whigs gave the duke a beating and brought their man to the top of the poll a tory being his colleague handley the tory on our present occasion seemed safe and the fight lay between mr gladstone and sergeant wilde the sitting whig a lawyer of merit and eminence who eighteen years later went to the woolsack as lord truro reform at newark was already on the ebb mr gladstone though mocked as a mere schoolboy and fiercely assailed as a slavery man exhibited from the first hour of the fight tremendous gifts of speech and skill of fence his red club worked valiantly the sergeant did not play his cards skilfully and pretty early in the long struggle it was felt that the duke would this time come into his own again the young student soon showed that his double first class his love of books his religious preoccupations had not unfitted him by a single jot for one of the most arduous of all forms of the battle of life he proved a diligent and prepossessing canvasser an untiring combatant and of course the readiest and most fluent of speakers wilde after hearing him said sententiously to one of his own supporters there is a great future before this young man the rather rotten borough became suffused with the radiant atmosphere of olympus the ladies presented their hero with a banner of red silk and an address expressive of their conviction that the good old red cause was the salvation of their ancient borough the young candidate in reply speedily put it in far more glowing colours it was no trivial banner of a party club it was the red flag of england that he saw before him the symbol of national moderation and national power under which when every throne on the continent had crumbled into dust beneath the tyrannous strength of france mankind had found sure refuge and triumphant hope and the blast that tore every other ensign to tatters served only to unfold their own and display its beauty and its glory amid these oratorical splendours the old hands of the club silently supplemented eloquence and argument by darker agencies of which happily the candidate knew little until after there was a red band and each musician received fifteen shillings a day there happening accidentally to be among them no fewer than ten patriotic red plumpers large teaparties attracted red ladies the inns great and small were thrown joyously open on one side or other and when the time came our national heroes from robin hood to lord nelson and the duke of wellington as well as half the animal kingdom the swan and salmon horses bulls boars lions and eagles of all the colours of the rainbow and in every kind of strange partnership sent in bills for meat and liquor supplied to free and independent electors to the tune of a couple of thousand pounds apart from these black arts and apart from the dukes interest there was a good force of the staunch and honest type the lifeblood of electioneering and the salvation of party government who cried stoutly i was born red i live red and i will die red we started on the canvass says one who was with mr gladstone at eight in the morning and worked at it for about nine hours with a great crowd band and flags and innumerable glasses of beer and wine all jumbled together then a dinner of 30 or 40 with speeches and songs until say ten oclock then he always played a rubber of whist and about twelve or one i got to bed and not to sleep                        humours of an old election  at length the end came at the nomination the show of hands was against the reds but when the poll was taken and closed on the second day gladstone appeared at the head of it with 887 votes against 798 for his colleague handley and 726 for the fallen wilde yesterday dec 13 1832 he tells his father we went to the town hall at 9 am when the mayor cast up the numbers and declared the poll while he was doing this the popular wrath vented itself for the most part upon handley the sergeant obtained me a hearing and i spoke for perhaps an hour or more but it was flat work as they were no more than patient and agreed with but little that i said the sergeant then spoke for an hour and a half he went into matters connected with his own adieu to newark besought the people most energetically to bear with their disappointment like men and expressed his farewell with great depth of feeling affected to tears himself he affected others also in the evening near fifty dined here clinton arms and the utmost enthusiasm was manifested the new member began his first speech as a member of parliament as follows       gentlemen in looking forward to the field which is now opened      before me i cannot but conceive that i shall often be reproached      with being not your representative but the representative of the      duke of newcastle now i should rather incline to exaggerate than      to extenuate such connection as does exist between me and that      nobleman and for my part should have no reluctance to see every      sentiment which ever passed between us whether by letter or by      word of mouth exposed to the view of the world i met the duke of      newcastle upon the broad ground of public principle and upon that      ground alone i own no other bond of union with him than this that      he in his exalted sphere and i in my humble one entertained the      same persuasion that the institutions of this country are to be      defended against those who threaten their destruction at all      hazards and to all extremities why do you return me to      parliament not because i am the duke of newcastles man simply      but because coinciding with the duke in political sentiment you      likewise admit that one possessing so large a property here and      faithfully discharging the duties which the possession of that      property entails ought in the natural course of things to exercise      a certain influence you return me to parliament not merely      because i am the duke of newcastles man but because both the man      whom the duke has sent and the duke himself are your men                           returned for newark  the election was of course pointed to by rejoicing conservatives as a proof the more of that reaction which the ministerial and radical press was audacious enough to laugh at this borough says the local journalist was led away by the bubble reform to support those who by specious and showy qualification had dazzled their eyes delusion had vanished shadows satisfied no longer newark was restored to its high place in the esteem of the friends of order and good government of course the intimates of the days of his youth were delighted we want such a man as gladstone wrote hallam to gaskell october 1 1832 in some things he is likely to be obstinate and prejudiced but he has a fine fund of high chivalrous tory sentiment and a tongue moreover to let it loose with i think he may do a great deal  in the course of his three months of sojourn at newark mr gladstone paid his first visit to the great man at clumber       the duke received me he tells his father with the greatest      kindness and conversed with such ease and familiarity of manner as      speedily to dispel a certain degree of awe which i had previously      entertained and to throw me perhaps more off my guard than i ought      to have been in company with a man of his age and rank the      utmost regularity and subordination appears to prevail in the      family and no doubt it is in many respects a good specimen of the      old english style he is apparently a most affectionate father but      still the sons and daughters are under a certain degree of      restraint in his presence a man be his station of life what it      may more entirely divested of personal pride and arrogance more      singleminded and disinterested in his views or more courageous      and resolute in determination to adhere to them as the dictates of      his own conscience i cannot conceive  from this frigid interior mr gladstone made his way to the genial company of milnes gaskell at thornes and had a delightful week thence he proceeded to spend some days with his sick mother at leamington we have been singularly dealt with as a family he observes once snatched from a position where we were what is called entering society and sent to comparative seclusion as regards family establishmentand now again prevented from assuming the situation that seems the natural termination of a career like my fathers here is a noble trialfor me personally to exercise a kindly and unselfish feeling if amid the excitements and allurements now near me i am enabled duly to realise the bond of consanguinity and suffer with those whom providence has ordained to suffer and this assuredly was no mere entry in a journal in betrothals marriages deaths on all the great occasions of life in his circle his letters under oldfashioned formalities of phrase yet beat with a marked and living pulse of genuine interest solicitude sympathy unselfishness and union                                    iii  as always he sought refreshment from turmoil that was only moderately congenial to him in reading and writing among much else he learns shelley by heart but his devotion to wordsworth is unshaken one remarkable similarity prevails between wordsworth and shelley the quality of combining and connecting everywhere external nature with internal and unseen mind but how different are they in applications it frets and irritates the one it is the key to the peacefulness of the other two books of paradise regained he finds very objectionable on religious groundsthe books presumably where milton has been convicted of arian heresy he still has energy enough left for more mundane things to write a succession of articles for the liverpool standard and he finds time to record his joy december 7 over five eton first classes at oxford then by and by the election accounts come in the arrangement had been made that the expenses were not to exceed a thousand pounds of which the duke was to contribute one half and john gladstone the other half it now appeared that twice as much would not suffice the new member flung himself with all his soul into a struggle with his committee against the practice of opening public houses and the exorbitant demands that came of it open houses he protested meant profligate expenditure and organised drunkenness they were not a pecuniary question but a question of right and wrong in the afternoon of the second day of polling his agent had said to him speaking about special constables that he scarcely knew how they could be got if wanted for he thought nearly every man in the town was drunk it was in vain that the committee assured him of the discouraging truth that a certain proportion of the voters could not be got to the poll without a breakfast and an observer from another planet might perhaps have asked himself whether all this was so remarkable an improvement on the duke doing what he liked with his own mr gladstone still stood to it that a system of entertainment that ended in producing a state of general intoxication was the most demoralising and vicious of all forms of outlay and the newark worthies were bewildered and confounded by the gigantic dialectical and rhetorical resources of their incensed representative the fierce battle lasted with moments of mitigation over many of the thirteen years of the connection of all the measures that mr gladstone was destined in days to come to place upon the statute book none was more salutary than the law that purified corrupt practices at elections54                               his birthday  on his birthday at the close of this eventful year here is his entry in his diaryon this day i have completed my twentythird year the exertions of the year have been smaller than those of the last but in some respects the diminution has been unavoidable in future i hope circumstances will bind me down to work with a rigour which my natural sluggishness will find it impossible to elude i wish that i could hope my frame of mind had been in any degree removed from earth and brought nearer to heaven that the habit of my mind had been imbued with something of that spirit which is not of this world i have now familiarised myself with maxims sanctioning and encouraging a degree of intercourse with society perhaps attended with much risk nor do i now think myself warranted in withdrawing from the practices of my fellow men except when they really involve an encouragement of sin in which case i do certainly rank races and theatres periods like these he writes to his friend gaskell january 3 1833 grievous generally in many of their results are by no means unfavourable to the due growth and progress of individual character i remember a very wise saying of archidamus in thucydides that the being educated greek en tois anankaiotatois brings strength and efficacy to the character55  in one of his letters to his father at this exciting epoch mr gladstone says that before the sudden opening now made for him what he had marked out for himself was a good many years of silent reading and inquiry that blessed dream was over his own temperament and outer circumstances both of them made its realisation impossible but in a sense he clung to it all his days he entered at lincolns inn january 25 and he dined pretty frequently in hall down to 1839 meeting many old eton and oxford acquaintances more genuine law students than himself he kept thirteen terms but was never called to the bar if he had intended to undergo a legal training the design was ended by newark after residing for a short time in lodgings in jermyn street he took quarters at the albany march 1833 which remained his london home for six years i am getting on rapidly with my furnishing he tells his father and i shall be able i feel confident to do it all including plate within the liberal limits which you allow i cannot warmly enough thank you for the terms and footing on which you propose to place me in the chambers but i really fear that after this year my allowance in all will be greater not only than i have any title to but than i ought to accept without blushing he became a member of the oxford and cambridge club the previous month56 and now was elected without my will but not more than without it a member of the carlton club he would not go to dinner parties on sundays not even with sir robert peel he was closely attentive to the minor duties of social life if duties they be he was a strict observer of the etiquette of calls and on some afternoons he notes that he made a dozen or fourteen of them he frequented musical parties where his fine voice now reasonably well trained made him a welcome guest and he goes to public concerts where he finds pasta and schröder splendid his irrepressible desire to expand himself in writing or in speech found a vent in constant articles in the liverpool standard neither better nor worse than the ordinary juvenilia of a keen young college politician he was confident that whether estimated by their numbers their wealth or their respectability the conservatives indubitably held in their hands the means and elements of permanent power he discharges a fusillade from roman history against the bare idea of vote by ballot quotes cicero as its determined enemy and ascribes to secret suffrage the fall of the republic he quotes with much zest a sentence from an ultraradical journal that the life of the west indian negro is happiness itself compared with that of the poor inmate of our spinningmills he scores a good point for the patron of newark by an eloquent article on the one man who had laboured to retrieve the miserable condition of the factory children and ends with a taunting reminder to the reformers that this one man sadler57 was the nominee of a boroughmonger and that boroughmonger the duke of newcastle                               london life  it need not be said that his churchgoing never flagged in 1840 his friend the elder acland interested himself in forming a small brotherhood with rules for systematic exercises of devotion and works of mercy mr gladstone was one of the number the names were not published nor did any one but the treasurer know the amounts given the pledge to personal and active benevolence seems not to have been strongly operative for at the end of 1845 dec 7 mr gladstone writes to hope in reference to aclands schemethe desire we then both felt passed off as far as i am concerned into a plan of asking only a donation and subscription now it is very difficult to satisfy the demands of duty to the poor by money alone on the other hand it is extremely hard for meand i suppose possibly for youto give them much in the shape of time and thought for both with me are already tasked up to and beyond their powers i much wish we could execute some plan which without demanding much time would entail the discharge of some humble and humbling office if you thought with meand i do not see why you should not except to assume the reverse is paying myself a complimentlet us go to work as in the young days of the college plan but with a more direct and less ambitious purpose of this we may see something later at a great service at st pauls he notes the glory alike of sight and sound as possessing that remarkable criterion of the sublime a grand result from a combination of simple elements edward irving did not attract a scene pregnant with melancholy instruction he was immensely struck by melvill whom some of us have heard pronounced by the generation before us to be the most puissant of all the men in his calling his sentiments says mr gladstone are manly in tone he deals powerfully with all his subjects his language is flowing and unbounded his imagery varied and intensely strong vigorous and lofty as are his conceptions he is not i think less remarkable for soundness and healthiness of mind such a passage shows among other things how the diarist was already teaching himself to analyse the art of oratory i may note one rather curious habit no doubt practised with a view to training in the art of speech besides listening to as many sermons as possible he was also for a long time fond of reading them aloud especially dr arnolds in rather a peculiar way my plan is he says to strengthen or qualify or omit expressions as i go along                                       iv                                house of commons  in an autobiographical note written in the late days of his life when he had become the only commoner left who had sat in the old burned house of commons he says       i took my seat at the opening of 1833 provided unquestionably      with a large stock of schoolboy bashfulness the first time that      business required me to go to the arm of the chair to say something      to the speaker manners suttonthe first of seven whose subject i      have beenwho was something of a keate i remember the revival in      me bodily of the frame of mind in which a schoolboy stands before      his master but apart from an incidental recollection of this      kind i found it most difficult to believe with any reality of      belief that such a poor and insignificant creature as i could      really belong to really form a part of an assembly which      notwithstanding the prosaic character of its entire visible      equipment i felt to be so august what i may term its corporeal      conveniences were i may observe in passing marvellously small i      do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means      of so much as washing the hands the residences of members were at      that time less distant but they were principally reached on foot      when a large house broke up after a considerable division a      copious dark stream found its way up parliament street whitehall      and charing cross       i remember that there occurred some case in which a constituent      probably a maltster at newark sent me a communication which made      oral communication with the treasury or with the chancellor of the      exchequer then lord althorp convenient as to the means of      bringing this about i was puzzled and abashed some experienced      friend on the opposition bench probably mr goulburn said to me      there is lord althorp sitting alone on the treasury bench go to      him and tell him your business with such encouragement i did it      lord althorp received me in the kindest manner possible alike to      my pleasure and my surprise  the exact composition of the first reformed house of commons was usually analysed as tories 144 reformers 395 english and scotch radicals 76 irish repealers 43 mr gladstone was for counting the decided conservatives as 160 and reckoning as a separate group a small party who had once been tories and now ranked between conservative opposition and whig ministers the irish representatives he divided between 28 tories and a body of 50 who were made up of ministerialists conditional repealers and tithe extinguishers he heard joseph hume the most effective of the leading radicals get the first word in the reformed parliament speaking for an hour and perhaps justifying oconnells witty saying that hume would have been an excellent speaker if only he would finish a sentence before beginning the next but one after it  no more diligent member of parliament than mr gladstone ever sat upon the green benches he read his bluebooks did his duty by election committees and on the first occasion when in consequence of staying a little too long at a dinner at the duke of hamiltons he missed a division his selfreproach was almost as sharp as if he had fallen into mortal sin this is often enough the way with virtuous young members but mr gladstones zealous ideal of parliamentary duty lasted and both at first and always he was a singular union of deep meditative seriousness with untiring animation assiduity and practical energy and force working over a wide field definitely mapped                               maiden speech  in the assembly where he was one day to rank among the most powerful orators ever inscribed upon its golden roll he first opened his lips in a few words on a newark petition april 30 and shortly after may 21 he spoke two or three minutes on an edinburgh petition a little later the question of slavery where he knew every inch of the ground brought him to a serious ordeal in may stanley as colonial secretary introduced the proposals of the government for the gradual abolition of colonial slavery abolition was to be preceded by an intermediate stage designated as apprenticeship to last for twelve years and the planters were to be helped through the difficulties of the transition by a loan of fifteen millions in the course of the proceedings the intermediate period was shortened from twelve years to seven and the loan of fifteen millions was transformed into a free gift of twenty to this scheme john gladstone whose indomitable energy made him the leading spirit of the west indian interest was consistently opposed and he naturally became the mark of abolitionist attack the occasion of mr gladstones first speech was an attack by lord howick on the manager of john gladstones demerara estates whom he denounced as the murderer of slavesan attack made without notice to the two sons of the incriminated proprietor sitting in front of him he declared that the slaves on the vreedenhoop sugar plantations were systematically worked to death in order to increase the crop mr gladstone tried in vain to catch the eye of the chairman on may 30 and the next day he wished to speak but saw no good opportunity the emotions through which one passes at least through which i pass in anticipating such an effort as this are painful and humiliating the utter prostration and depression of spirit the deep sincerity the burdensome and overpowering reality of the feeling of mere feebleness and incapacity felt in the inmost heart yet not to find relief by expression because the expression of such things goes for affectationthese things i am unequal to describe yet i have experienced them now on june 3 the chance came here is his story of the day began le miei prigioni west india meeting of members at one at lord sandons resolutions discussed and agreed upon  dined early rearranged my notes for the debate rode house 5 to 1 spoke my first time for 50 minutes my leading desire was to benefit the cause of those who are now so sorely beset the house heard me very kindly and my friends were satisfied tea afterwards at the carlton the speech was an uncommon success stanley the minister mainly concerned congratulated him with more than those conventional compliments which the good nature of the house of commons expects to be paid to any decent beginner i never listened to any speech with greater pleasure said stanley himself the prince of debaters and then in the most brilliant part of his career the member for newark argued his case with a temper an ability and a fairness which may well be cited as a good model to many older members of this house his own leader though he spoke later said nothing in his speech about the new recruit but two days after mr gladstone mentioned that sir r peel came up to him and praised monday nights affair king william wrote to althorp he rejoices that a young member has come forward in so promising a manner as viscount althorp states mr w e gladstone to have done58  apart from its special vindication in close detail of the state of things at vreedenhoop as being no worse than others the points of the speech on this great issue of the time were familiar ones he confessed with shame and pain that cases of cruelty had existed and would always exist under the system of slavery and that this was a substantial reason why the british legislature and public should set themselves in good earnest to provide for its extinction he admitted too that we had not fulfilled our christian obligations by communicating the inestimable benefits of our religion to the slaves in our colonies and that the belief among the early english planters that if you made a man a christian you could not keep him a slave had led them to the monstrous conclusion that they ought not to impart christianity to their slaves its extinction was a consummation devoutly to be desired and in good earnest to be forwarded but immediate and unconditioned emancipation without a previous advance in character must place the negro in a state where he would be his own worst enemy and so must crown all the wrongs already done to him by cutting off the last hope of rising to a higher level in social existence at some later period of his life mr gladstone read a corrected report of his first speech and found its tone much less than satisfactory but of course he adds allowance must be made for the enormous and most blessed change of opinion since that day on the subject of negro slavery i must say however that even before this time i had come to entertain little or no confidence in the proceedings of the resident agents in the west indies i can now see plainly enough he said sixty years later the sad defects the real illiberalism of my opinions on that subject yet they were not illiberal as compared with the ideas of the times and as declared in parliament in 1833 they obtained the commendation of the liberal leaders                         common opinions on slavery  it is fair to remember that pitt fox grenville and grey while eager to bring the slave trade to an instant end habitually disclaimed as a calumny any intention of emancipating the blacks on the sugar islands in 1807 when the foul blot of the trade was abolished even wilberforce himself discouraged attempts to abolish slavery though the noble philanthropist soon advanced to the full length of his own principles peel in 1833 would have nothing to do with either immediate emancipation or gradual disraeli has put his view on deliberate record that the movement of the middle class for the abolition of slavery was virtuous but it was not wise it was an ignorant movement the history of the abolition of slavery by the english and its consequences would be a narrative of ignorance injustice blundering waste and havoc not easily paralleled in the history of mankind59  a week later lord howick proposed to move for papers relating to vreedenhoop lord althorp did not refuse to grant them but recommended him to drop his motion as mr gladstone insisted on the equal necessity of a similar return for all neighbouring plantations howick withdrew his motion though he afterwards asserted that ministers had declined the return which was not true when buxton moved to reduce the term of apprenticeship mr gladstone voted against him on the following day stanley without previous intimation announced the change from twelve years to seven i spoke a few sentences mr gladstone enters in his diary in much confusion for i could not easily recover from the sensation caused by the sudden overthrow of an entire and undoubting alliance  the question of electoral scandals at liverpool which naturally excited lively interest in a family with local ties so strong came up in various forms during the session and on one of these occasions july 4 mr gladstone spoke upon it for twenty minutes or more anything but satisfactorily to myself nor can the speech now be called satisfactory by any one else except for the enunciation of the sound maxim that the giver of a bribe deserves punishment quite as richly as the receiver four days later he spoke for something less than half an hour on the third reading of the irish church reform bill i was heard he tells his father with kindness and indulgence but it is after all uphill work to address an assembly so much estranged in feeling from ones self peels speech was described as temporising and the deliverance of his young lieutenant was temporising too though firm on the necessary principle as he called it of which the world was before long to hear so much from him that the nation should be taxed for the support of a national church  besides his speeches he gave a full number of party votes some of them interesting enough in view of the vast career before him i think the first of them all was in the majority of 428 against 40 upon oconnells amendment for repealan occasion that came vividly to his memory on the eve of his momentous change of policy in 1886 he voted for the worst clauses of the irish coercion bill including the courtmartial clause he fought steadily against the admission of jews to parliament he fought against the admission of dissenters without a test to the universities which he described as seminaries for the established church he supported the existing corn law he said no to the property tax and aye for retaining the house and window taxes he resisted a motion of humes for the abolition of military and naval sinecures february 14 and another motion of the same excellent mans for the abolition of all flogging in the army save for mutiny and drunkenness he voted against the publication of the division lists he voted with ministers both against shorter parliaments and april 25 against the ballot a cardinal reform carried by his own government forty years later on the other hand he voted july 5 with lord ashley against postponing his beneficent policy of factory legislation but he did not vote either way a fortnight later when althorp sensibly reduced the limit of ten hours work in factories from the impracticable age of eighteen proposed by ashley to the age of thirteen he supported a bill against work on sundays                                        v                              purchase of fasque  a page or two from his diary will

gladstone after much negotiation had bought the estate of fasque in kincardineshire for £80000 to which and to other scotch affairs he devoted his special and personal attention pretty exclusively the

grinds away through giffords pitt and reads hallams middle ages my method has usually been 1 to read over regularly 2 to glance again over all i have read and analyse he was just as little of the lounger in his lighter reading schillers plays he went through with attention finding it a good plan to read along with history historical plays of the same events for material illustration as well as aid to the memory he read scotts chapters on mary stuart in his history of scotland to enable me better to appreciate the admirable judgment of schiller in maria stuart both where he has adhered to history and where he has gone beyond it he finds fault with the temistocle of metastasio as too humane history should not be violated without a reason it may be set aside to fill up poetical verisimilitude if history assigns a cause inadequate to its effect or an effect inadequate to its cause poetry may supply the deficiency for the sake of an impressive whole but it is too much to overset a narrative and call it a historical play then came a tragic stroke in real life                             days in scotland       october 6 1833post hour today brought me a melancholy

forcibly dragging down the soul from that temper which is fit to      inhale the air of heaven jan 8 1834 edinburghbreakfast      with dr chalmers attended his lecture 23 more than ever      struck with the superabundance of dr cs gorgeous language which      leads him into repetitions until the stores of our tongue be      exhausted on each particular point yet the variety and      magnificence of his expositions must fix them very strongly in the      minds of his hearers in ordinary works great attention would be      excited by the very infrequent occurrence of the very brilliant      expressions and illustrations with which he cloys the palate his      gems lie like paving stones he does indeed seem to be an      admirable man  of edinburgh his knowledge soon became intimate his father and mother took him to that city as we have seen in 1814 he spent a spring there in 1828 just before going to oxford and he recollected to the end of his life a sermon of dr andrew thomsons on the repentance of judas a great and striking subject some circumstance or another brought him into relations with chalmers that ripened into friendship we used to have walks together mr gladstone remembered chiefly out of the town by the dean bridge and along the queensferry road on one of our walks together chalmers took me down to see one of his districts by the water of leith and i remember we went into one or more of the cottages he went in with smiling countenance greeting and being greeted by the people and sat down but he had nothing to say he was exactly like the duke of wellington who said of himself that he had no small talk his whole mind was always full of some great subject and he could not deviate from it he sat smiling among the people but he had no small talk for them and they had no large talk so after some time we came away he pleased to have been with the people and they proud to have had the doctor with them60 for chalmers he never lost a warm appreciation often expressed in admirable wordsone of natures nobles his warrior grandeur his rich and glowing eloquence his absorbed and absorbing earnestness above all his singular simplicity and detachment from the world among other memories there was a quaint old shop at the bowhead which used to interest me very much it was kept by a bookseller mr thomas nelson i remember being amused by a reply he made to me one day when i went in and asked for booths reign of grace he half turned his head towards me and remarked with a peculiar twinkle in his eye ay man but yere a young chiel to be askin after a book

mothersir robert peel caused me much gratification by the way in which he spoke to me of my speech and particularly the great warmth of his manner he told me he cheered me loudly and i said in return that i had heard his voice under me while speaking and was much encouraged thereby he ends the note already cited sept 6 1897 on the old house of commons which was burned down this year with what he calls a curious incident concerning sir robert peel and with a sentence or two upon the government of lord grey       cobbett made a motion alike wordy and absurd praying the king to      remove him peel from the privy council as the author of the act      for the reestablishment of the gold standard in 1819 the entire      house was against him except his colleague fielden of oldham who      made a second teller62 after the division i think lord althorp      at once rose and moved the expunction of the proceedings from the      votes or journals a severe rebuke to the mover sir robert in his      speech said i am at a loss sir to conceive what can be the      cause of the strong hostility to me which the honourable gentleman      exhibits i never conferred on him an obligation this stroke      was not original but what struck me at the time as singular was      this that notwithstanding the state of feeling which i have      described sir r peel was greatly excited in dealing with one who      at the time was little more than a contemptible antagonist at that      period shirt collars were made with gills which came up upon the      cheek and peels gills were so soaked with perspiration that they      actually lay down upon his neckcloth       in one of these years i think 1833 a motion was made by some      political economist for the abolition of the corn laws i an      absolute and literal ignoramus was much struck and staggered with      it but sir james grahamwho knew more of economic and trade      matters i think than the rest of the cabinet of 1841 all put      togethermade a reply in the sense of protection whether high or      low i cannot now say but i remember perfectly well that this      speech of his built me up again for the moment and enabled me i      believe to vote with the government                       a year of splendid legislation       the year 1833 was as measured by quantity and in part by quality      a splendid year of legislation in 1834 the government and lord      althorp far beyond all others did themselves high honour by the new      poor law act which rescued the english peasantry from the total      loss of their independence of the 658 members of parliament about      480 must have been their general supporters much gratitude ought      to have been felt for this great administration but from a variety      of causes at the close of the session 1834 the house of commons      had fallen into a state of cold indifference about it  he was himself destined one day to feel how soon parliamentary

ever walk with an unobserving mind at lochnagar saw highland women from strathspey coming down for harvest with heavy loads some with babies over these wild rough paths through wind and storm ah with what labour does a large portion of mankind subsist while we fare sumptuously every day this was the ready susceptibility to humane impression in the common circumstance of life the eye stirring the emotions of the feeling heart that nourished in him the soul of true oratory to say nothing of feeding the roots of statesmanship his bookmindedness is unabated he began with a resolution to work at least two hours every morning before breakfast and the resolution seems to have been manfully kept without prejudice to systematic reading for a good many hours of the day besides for the first time rather strange to say he read st augustines confessions and with the delight that might have been expected he finds in that famous composition a good deal of prolix and fanciful though acute speculation but the practical parts of the book have a wonderful force and inimitable sweetness and simplicity in other departments of religion he read archbishop leightons life and hannah mores arnolds sermons and milners church history and whewells bridgewater treatise once more he analyses the novum organum and the advancement of learning and he reads or rereads lockes essay he studies political science in the two great manuals of the old world and the new in the politics of aristotle and the prince of machiavelli he goes through three or four plays of schiller also manzoni and petrarch and dante at the patient rate of a couple of cantos a day then boccaccio from whom after a halfdozen of the days he willingly parts company only interested in him as showing a strange state of manners and how religion can be dissociated from conduct in modern politics he reads the memoirs of chatham and brougham on colonial policy of which he says that eccentricity paradox fast and loose reasoning and much more sentiment appear to have entered most deeply into the essence of this remarkable man when he wrote his colonial policy as now with the rarest power of expressing his thoughts has he any fixed law to guide them on roscoes leo x he remarks how interesting and highly agreeable it is in style and while disclaiming any right to judge its fidelity and research makes the odd observation that it has in some degree subdued the leaven of its authors unitarianism he writes occasional verses including the completion of some stanzas of december 1832 on the human heart but i am not impudent enough to call them by that name  in the midst of days well filled by warm home feeling reasonable pleasure and vigorous animation of intellect came the summons to action on november 18 a guest arrived with the astonishing news that ministers were out the king had dismissed the melbourne government partly because he did not believe that lord john russell could take the place of althorp as leader of the commons partly because like many cleverer judges he was sick of them and partly because as is perhaps the case with more cabinets than the world supposes the ministers were sick of one another and king william knew it mr gladstone in 187563 described the dismissal of the whigs in 1834 as the indiscreet proceeding of an honest and wellmeaning man which gave the conservatives a momentary tenure of office without power but provoked a strong reaction in favour of the liberals and greatly prolonged the predominance which they were on the point of losing through the play of natural causes64 sir robert peel was summoned in hot haste from rome and after a journey of twelve days over alpine snows eight nights out of the twelve in a carriage on december 9 he reached london saw the king and kissed hands as first lord of the treasury less than two years before he had said i feel that between me and office there is a wider gulf than there is perhaps between it and any other man in the house                           proposal of office  mr gladstone meanwhile at fasque worked off some of his natural excitement which he notes as invading even sundays by the composition of a political tract the tract has disappeared down the gulf of time december 11 was his fathers seventieth birthday his strength and energy wonderful and giving promise of many more within the week the fated message from the new prime minister arrived the case is apt to quicken the pulse of even the most serene of politicians and we may be sure that mr gladstone with the keen vigour of fiveandtwenty tingling in his veins was something more or less than serene       dec 17locke and russells modern europe in the morning      went to meet the post found a letter from peel desiring to see me      dated 13th all haste ready by 4no place reluctantly deferred      till the morning wrote to lincoln sir r peel etc a game of      whist this is a serious call i got my fathers advice to take      anything with work and responsibility 18thoff at 740 by      mail i find it a privation to be unable to read in a coach the      mind is distracted through the senses and rambles nowhere is it      to me so incapable of continuous thought newcastle at 9¼ pm      19thsame again at york at 6¼ am to 7 ran to peep at the      minster and bore away a faint twilight image of its grandeur      20tharrived safe thank god and well at the bull and mouth 5¾      am albany soon to bed for 2¼ hours went to peel about eleven  he writes to his father the same day       my interview with him was not more than six or eight minutes but      he was extremely kind he told me his letter to me was among his      first that he was prompted only by his own feelings towards me and      some more of that kind that i might have a seat either at the      admiralty or treasury boards but the latter was that which he      intended for me that i should then be in immediate and      confidential communication with himself and should thereby have      more insight into the general concerns of government that there      was a person very anxious for the seat at the treasury who would      go to the admiralty if i did not but that he meant to go upon the      principle of putting every one to the post for which he thought      them most fit so far as he could and therefore preferred the      arrangement he had named as he distinctly preferred the treasury      for me and assigned such reasons for the preference it appeared      to me that the question was quite settled and i immediately closed      with his offer i expressed my gratitude for the opinions of me      which he had expressed and said i thought it my duty to mention      that the question of my reelection at newark upon a single      vacancy had never been put to my friends and i asked whether i      should consider any part of what he had said as contingent upon the      answer i might receive from them he said no that he would      willingly take that risk at first he thought i had suspicions      about the duke of newcastle and assured me that he would be much      pleased of which i said i felt quite persuaded this inquiry      however served the double purpose of discharging my own duty and      drawing out something about the dissolution he said to me you      will address your constituents upon vacating your seat and      acquaint them of your intention to solicit a renewal of their      confidence whenever they are called upon to exercise their      franchise which i tell you confidentially he added will be      very soon i would have given a hundred pounds to be then and      there in a position to express my hopes and fears but it is then      you see certain that we are to have it and that they will not      meet the present parliament most bitterly do i lament it  mr gladstone at a later date july 25 1835 recorded that he had reason to believe from a conversation with a tory friend who was in many party secrets that the duke of wellington set their candidates in motion all over the country before sir roberts return active measures and of course expense had so generally begun so much impatience for the dissolution had been excited and the anticipations had been permitted for so long a time to continue and to spread as to preclude the possibility of delay65                         second election at newark  the appointment of the young member for newark was noted at the time as an innovation upon a semisacred social usage sir robert inglis said to him you are about the youngest lord who was ever placed at the treasury on his own account and not because he was his fathers son the prime minister no doubt rejoiced in finding for the public service a young man of this high promise sprung out of the same class and bred in the same academic traditions as his own66 the youthful ministers path was happily smoothed at newark this time blues and reds called a grand truce divided the honours and returned mr gladstone and sergeant wilde without a contest the question that excited most interest in the canvass was the new poor law mr gladstone gave the fallen ministers full credit for their measure most of their bills he said were projected from a mere craving for popularity but in the case of the poor law they acted in defiance of the public press and many of their own friends on the other hand he defended the new government as the government of a truly reforming party pointing to the commercial changes made by lord liverpools administration to the corporation and test acts and to catholic emancipation who could deny that these were changes of magnitude settled in peaceful times by a parliament unreformed who could deny that sir robert peel had long been a practical reformer of the law and that the duke of wellington had carried out great retrenchments let them then rally round throne and altar and resist the wild measures of the destructives the red hero was drawn through the town by six greys with postilions in silk jackets amid the music of bands the clash of bells and the cheers of the crowd when the red procession met the blue mutual congratulations took the place of the old insult and defiance and at five oclock each party sat down to its own feast the reds drank toasts of a spirited loyal and constitutional character many admirable speeches were made which the chronicler regrets that his limits will not allow him to reportregrets unshared by usand soon after eleven mr gladstone escaped after a day at clumber he was speedily on his way to london off at 10½ pm missed the high flyer at tuxford broke down in my chaise on the way to newark no injury thanks to god remained 2½ hours alone overtaken by the wellington at 3½ am arrived in london jan 8 before 8 pm good travelling on reckoning up his movements he finds that though not at all fond of travelling for the sake of going from place to place he has had in 1834 quite 2400 miles of it  before the dissolution sir h hardinge had told him that the conservatives would not be over 340 nor under 300 but by the middle of the month things looked less prosperous the reaction against the whigs had not yet reached full flood the royal dismissal of the administration was unpopular moderate people more especially in scotland could not stand a government where the duke of wellington the symbol of a benighted and stubborn toryism was seen over peels shoulder at present mr gladstone writes the case is even in my view hopeful in that of most here it is more and certainly to have this very privilege of entertaining a deliberate and reasonable hope to think that notwithstanding the ten pound clause a moderate parliament may be returned in fine to believe that we have now some prospect of surviving the reform bill without a bloody revolution is to me as surprising as delightful it seems to me the greatest and most providential mercy with which a nation was ever visited today i am going to dine with the lord chancellor lyndhurst having received a card to that effect last night  it was at this dinner that mr gladstone had his first opportunity of making a remarkable acquaintance in his diary he mentions as present three of the judges the flower of the bench as he supposes but he says not a word of the man of the strangest destiny there the author of vivian grey disraeli himself in a letter to his sister names young gladstone and others but condemns the feast as rather dull and declares that a swan very white and tender and stuffed with truffles was the best company at the table what mr gladstone carried away in his memory was a sage lesson of lyndhursts by which the two men of genius at his table were in time to show themselves extremely competent to profitnever defend yourself before a popular assemblage except with and by retorting the attack the hearers in the pleasure which the assault gives them will forget the previous charge as disraeli himself put it afterwards never complain and never explain                                       ii                               change of office  one afternoon a few days later while he was grappling at the treasury with a file of papers on the mysteries of superannuation mr gladstone was again summoned by the prime minister and again jan 26 he writes to his father       i have had an important interview with sir r peel the result of      which is that i am to be undersecretary for the colonies i will      give you a hurried and imperfect sketch of the conversation he      began by saying he was about to make a great sacrifice both of his      own feelings and convenience but that what he had to say he hoped      would be gratifying to me as a mark of his confidence and regard      i am going to propose to you gladstone that you should be for      you know wortley has lost his election undersecretary of state      for the colonies and i give you my word that i do not know six      offices which are at this moment of greater importance than that to      which is attached the representation of the colonial department in      the house of commons at a period when so many questions of      importance are in agitation i expressed as well as i could and      indeed it was but ill my unfeigned and deep sense of his kindness      my hesitation to form any opinion of my own competency for the      office and at the same time my general desire not to shrink from      any responsibility which he might think proper to lay upon me he      said that was the right and manly view to take he adverted to      my connection with the west indies as likely to give satisfaction      to persons dependent on those colonies and thought that others      would not be displeased in short i cannot go through it all but      i can only say that if i had always heard of him that he was the      warmest and freest person of all living in the expression of his      feelings such description would have been fully borne out by his      demeanour to me when i came away he took my hand and said well      god bless you wherever you are  from sir robert the new undersecretary made his way in fear and trembling to his new chief lord aberdeen       distinction of itself naturally and properly rather alarms the      young i had heard of his high character but i had also heard of      him as a man of cold manners and close and even haughty reserve      it was dark when i entered his room so that i saw his figure      rather than his countenance i do not recollect the matter of the      conversation but i well remember that before i had been three      minutes with him all my apprehensions had melted away like snow in      the sun i came away from that interview conscious indeed of his      dignity but of a dignity so tempered by a peculiar purity and      gentleness and so associated with impressions of his kindness and      even friendship that i believe i thought more about the wonder of      his being at that time so misunderstood by the outer world than      about the new duties and responsibilities of my office67  time only deepened these impressions it is not hard for a great party chief to win the affection and regard of his junior colleague and where good fortune has brought together a congenial pair no friendship outside the home can be more valuable more delightful alike to veteran and to tiro of all the host of famous or considerable men with whom he was to come into official and other relations none ever as we shall see held the peculiar place in mr gladstones esteem and reverence of the two statesmen under whose auspices he now first entered the enchanted circle of public office the promotion was a remarkable stride he was only fiveandtwenty his parliamentary existence had barely covered two years and he was wholly without powerful family connection you are aware peel wrote to john gladstone of the sacrifice i have made of personal feeling to public duty in placing your son in one of the most important officesthat of representative of the colonial department in the house of commons and thus relinquishing his valuable aid in my own immediate department wherever he may be placed he is sure to distinguish himself68                                       iii                             position of government  mr gladstones first spell of office was little more than momentary the liberal majority as has so often happened was composite but peel can hardly have supposed that the sections of which it was made up would fail to coalesce and coalesce pretty soon for the irresistible object of ejecting ministers who were liked by none of them and through whose repulse they could strike an avenging blow against the king ardent subalterns like mr gladstone took more vehement views the majority at once beat the government supported by the group of stanleyites fiftythree strong in the contest for the speakers chair other repulses followed the division writes mr gladstone to his father with the honourable warmth of the young party man i need not say was a disappointment to me but it must have been much more so to those who have ever thought well of the parliament our party mustered splendidly some few but very very few of the others appear to have kept away through a sense of decency they had not virtue enough to vote for the man whom they knew to be incomparably the best and against whom they had no charge to bring no more shameful act i think has been done by a british house of commons  not many days after fervently deprecating a general resignation an illomened purpose of this very course actually flitted across the mind of the young undersecretary himself a scheme was on the anvil for the education of the blacks in the west indies and a sudden apprehension startled mr gladstone that his chief might devote public funds to all varieties of denominational religious teaching any plan of that kind would be utterly opposed to what with him as we shall soon discover was then a fundamental principle of national polity happily the fatal leap was not needed but if either small men like the government whips or great men like peel and aberdeen could have known what was passing they would have shaken grave heads over this spirit of unseasonable scruple at the very start of the race in a brilliant man with all his life before him       feb 4 or 5charles canning told me peel had offered him the      vacant lordship of the treasury through his mother they were he      said very much gratified with the manner in which it had been      done though the offer was declined upon the ground stated in the      reply that though he did not anticipate any discrepancy in      political sentiments to separate him from the present government      yet he should prefer in some sense deserving an official station by      parliamentary conduct peels letter was written at some length      very friendly without any statesmanlike reserve or sensitive      attention to nicety of style in the last paragraph it spoke with      amiable embarrassment of mr canning stating that his respect      regard and admiration i think even apparently interrupted by      circumstances continued fresh and vivid and that those very      circumstances made him more desirous of thus publicly testifying      his real sentiments       march 30wished to speak on irish church no opportunity wrote      on it a nobleminded speech from sir j graham march 31spoke      on the irish churchunder forty minutes i cannot help here      recording that this matter of speaking is really my strongest      religious exercise on all occasions and today especially was      forced upon me the humiliating sense of my inability to exercise my      reason in the face of the h of c and of the necessity of my      utterly failing unless god gave me the strength and language it      was after all a poor performance but would have been poorer had he      never been in my thoughts as a present and powerful aid but this      is what i am as yet totally incompetent to effectto realise in      speaking anything however small which at all satisfies my mind      debating seems to me less difficult though unattained but to hold      in serene contemplative action the mental faculties in the turbid      excitement of debate so as to see truth clearly and set it forth      such as it is this i cannot attain to       as regards my speech in the irish church debate he tells his      father april 2 it was received by the house and has been      estimated in a manner extremely gratifying to me as regards      satisfaction to myself in the manner of its execution i cannot say      so much backed by a numerous and warmhearted party and strong in      the consciousness of a good cause i did not find it difficult to      grapple with the more popular parts of the question but i fell      miserably short of my desires in touching upon the principles which      the discussion involved and i am sure that it must be long before      i am enabled in any reasonable sense to be a speaker according even      to the conception which i have formed in my own mind  a few days later he received the congratulations of a royal personage       in the evening dining at lord salisburys i was introduced to the      duke of cumberland who was pleased to express himself favourably      of my speech he is fond of conversation and the common reputation      which he bears of including in his conversation many oaths appears      to be but too true yet he said he had made a point of sending his      son to george the fourths funeral thinking it an excellent      advantage for a boy to receive the impression which such a scene      was calculated to convey the duke made many acute remarks and      was i should say most remarkably unaffected and kind these are      fine social qualities for a prince though of course not the most      importantmy dear sir and thumps on the shoulder after a ten      minutes acquaintance he spoke broadly and freelymuch on the      disappearance of the bishops wigs which he said had done more      harm to the church than anything else                             ministers defeated  on the same night the catastrophe happened after a protracted and complex struggle lord john russells proposal for the appropriation of the surplus revenues of the irish church was carried against ministers the following day peel announced his resignation  though his official work had been unimportant mr gladstone had left an excellent impression behind him among the permanent men when he first appeared in the office henry taylor said i rather like gladstone but he is said to have more of the devil in him than appears a few weeks were enough to show him that gladstone was far the most considerable of the rising generation having besides his abilities an excellent disposition and great strength of character james stephen thought well of him but doubted if he had pugnacity enough for public life  a few days later mr gladstone dined with an official party at the fallen ministers       sir r peel made a very nice speech on lincolns proposing and our      drinking his health the following is a slight and bad sketchi      really can hardly call you gentlemen alone i would rather address      you as my warm and attached friends in whom i have the fullest      confidence and with whom it has afforded me the greatest      satisfaction to be associated during the struggle which has just      been brought to a close in undertaking the government from the      first i have never expected to succeed still it was my conviction      that good might be done and i trust that good has been effected i      believe we have shown that even if a conservative government be not      strong enough to carry on the public affairs of this country at      least we are so strong that we ought to be able to prevent any      other government from doing any serious mischief to its      institutions we meet now as we met at the beginning of the      session then perhaps in somewhat finer dresses but not i am      sure with kindlier feelings towards each other  the rest of the session mr gladstone passed in his usual pursuits reading all sorts of books from the correspondence of leibnitz with bossuet and alexander knoxs remains down to rousseaus confessions as to the last of these he scarcely knew whether to read on or to throw it aside and in fact he seems only to have persevered with that strange romance of a wandering soul for a day or two besides promiscuous reading he performed some scribbling including a sonnet recorded in his diary with notes of wondering exclamation his family were in london for most of may his mother in bad health no other engagement ever interrupted his sedulous attendance on her every day reading the bible to her and telling the news about levees and drawingrooms a great dinner at sir robert peels and all the rest of his business and recreations in the house he did little between the fall of the ministry and the close of the session he once wished to speak but was shut out by the length of other speeches so he moralises i had two useful lessons instead of one for the sense of helplessness which always possesses me in prospect of a speech is one very useful lesson and being disappointed after having attained some due state of excitement and anticipation is another                          speech at newark  in june at a feast at newark which terrible to relate lasted from four oclock to eleven mr gladstone gave them nearly an hour not to mention divers minor speeches his father expressed himself with beautiful and affectionate truth of feeling and the party sympathised his own speech deserves to be noted as indicating the political geography for three or four years to come the standing dish of the tory opposition of the period was highlyspiced reproach of the ministers for living on the support of oconnell and newark was regaled with an ample meal mr gladstone would not enter into a detail of the exploits character political opinions of that irish gentleman he would rather say what he thought of him in his presence than in his absence because he could unfortunately say nothing of him but what was bad this is not the first period in english history mr gladstone noted down at that time in which a government has leaned on the roman catholic interest in ireland for support under the administration of strafford and at the time of the scotch revolt charles i was enthusiastically supported by the recusants of the sister isle and what was the effect the religious sympathies of the people were touched then and they were so now with the same consequence in the gradual decline of the party to whom the suspicion attaches in popular fervour and estimation half a century later he may have recalled this early fruit of historic observation meanwhile in his newark speech he denounced the government for seeking to undo the mischief of the irish alliance by systematic agitation but it was upon the church question far deeper and more vital than municipal corporations that the fate of the government should be decided then followed a vindication of the church in ireland the protestant faith is held good for us and what is good for us is also good for the population of ireland that most disastrous of all our false commonplaces was received at newark as it has been received so many hundreds of times ever since all over england with loud and longcontinued cheering to be invariably followed in after act and event with loud and longcontinued groaning69 four years later mr gladstone heard words from lord john russell on this point that began to change his mind often do i think he wrote to lord russell in 1870 of a saying of yours more than thirty years back which struck me ineffaceably at the time you said the true key to our irish debates was this that it was not properly borne in mind that as england is inhabited by englishmen and scotland by scotchmen so ireland is inhabited by irishmen70  footnotes  63 gleanings i p 38  64 in another place he describes it as an action done with no sort of reason ib p 78 but the melbourne papers published in 1890 pp 219221 and 225 indicate that melbourne had spontaneously given the king good reasons for cashiering him and his colleagues  65 lord palmerston doubted nov 25 1834 whether peel would dissolve i think his own bias will rather be to abide by the decision of this house of commons and try to propitiate it by great professions of reform the effect of a dissolution must be injurious to the principles that he professes but he may be overborne by the violent people of his own party whom he will not be able to control ashleys life of palmerston 1879 i p 313  66 greville on the other hand grumbled at peel for taking high birth and connections as substitutes for other qualities because he made sidney herbert secretary at the board of control

passively receptive species he went forward in a sedulous process of import and export a mind actively at work on all the topics that passed before it  at the beginning of the year 1836 he was invited to pay a visit to drayton where he found only lord harrowbya link with the great men of an earlier generation for he had acted as pitts second in the duel with tierney and had been foreign secretary

in office were of a highly toned spirit of government that      brougham was the most powerful man he had ever known in the h of      c that no one had ever fallen so fast and so far that the      political difficulties of england might be susceptible of cure and      were not appalling but that the state of ireland was to all      appearance hopeless that there the great difficulty lay in      procuring the ordinary administration of justice that the very      institution of juries supposed a common interest of the juror and      the state a condition not fulfilled in the present instance that      it was quite unfit for the present state of society in ireland      lord harrowby thought that a strong conservative government might      still quell agitation and sir b peel said stanley had told him      that the whig government were on the point of succeeding in putting      a stop to the resistance to payment of tithe when lord althorp      alarmed at the expense already incurred wrote to stop its      collection by the military we should probably live to see the      independence of poland established       the duke of wellington and others arrived later in the day it was      pleasing to see the deference with which he was received as he      entered the library at the sound of his name everybody rose he is      addressed by all with a respectful manner he met peel most      cordially and seized both lady peels hands i now recollect that      it was with glee sir r peel said to me on monday i am glad to      say you will meet the duke here which had reference i doubt not      partly to the anticipated pleasure of seeing him partly to the      dissipation of unworthy suspicions he reported that government are      still labouring at a church measure without appropriation jan      20the duke of wellington appears to speak little and never for      speakings sake but only to convey an idea commonly worth      conveying he receives remarks made to him very frequently with no      more than ha a convenient suspensive expression which      acknowledges the arrival of the observation and no more of the two      days which he spent here he hunted on thursday shot on friday and      today travelled to strathfieldsay more i believe than 100      miles to entertain a party of friends to dinner with this bodily      exertion he mixes at 66 or 67 a constant attention to business sir      r peel mentioned to me tonight a very remarkable example of his      the dukes perhaps excessive precision whenever he signs a draft      on couttss he addresses to them at the same time a note apprising      them that he has done so this perfect facility of transition from      one class of occupation to their opposites and their habitual      intermixture without any apparent encroachments on either side is      i think a very remarkable evidence of selfcommand and a mental      power of singular utility sir robert is also i conceive a      thrifty dealer with his time but in a man of his age peel now 48      this is less beyond expectation  he said goodbye on the last night with regret in the midst of the great company he found time to

were      brought out too prominently a particular muscle of the national      frame the strength of the towns that the cure was to be found in      a large further enfranchisement i fancy of the

oconnell he set about demonstrating the change that had taken place in the character of public feeling during the last few years he pointed out that at the dissolution of 1831 the conservative members of the house of commons amounted perhaps to 50 in 1835 they saw this small dispirited band grow into a resolute and formidable phalanx of 300 the cry was resolute attachment to the institutions of the country one passage in the speech is of interest in the history of his attitude on toleration sir william moles worth had been invited to come forward as candidate for the representation of leeds a report spread that sir william was not a believer in the christian articles of faith somebody wrote to molesworth to know if this was true he answered that the question whether he was a believer in the christian religion was one that no man of liberal principles ought to propose to another or could propose without being guilty of a dereliction of duty on this incident mr gladstone said that he would ask is it not a time for serious reflection among moderate and candid men of all parties when such a question was actually thought impertinent interference surely they would say with him that men who have no belief in the divine revelation are not the men to govern this nation be they whigs or radicals long extraordinary and not inglorious was the ascent from such a position as this to the principles so nobly vindicated in the speech on the affirmation bill in 1883                              party councils  at the end of january he is back in london arranging books and papers and making a little daylight in his chaos what useful advice might a man who has been buon pezzo in parliament give to one going into it on this mechanical portion of his business the entries for 1837 are none of them especially interesting every day in the midst of full parliamentary work social engagements and public duties outside of the house of commons he was elaborating the treatise on the relations of church and state of which we shall see more in our following chapter at the beginning of the session he went to a dinner at peels at which lord stanley and some of his friends were presenta circumstance noted as a sign of the impending fusion between the whig seceders of 1834 and the conservative party sir robert seems to have gone on extending his confidence in him       i visited sir robert peel march 4th about the canada question      and again by appointment on the 6th with lord aberdeen on the      former day he said is there anyone else to invite i suggested      lord stanley he said perhaps he might be inclined to take a      separate view but in the interval he had apparently thought      otherwise for on monday he read to lord aberdeen and myself a      letter from stanley written with the utmost frankness and in a tone      of political intimacy saying that an engagement as chairman of a      committee at the house would prevent his meeting us the business      of the day was discussed in conversation and it was agreed to be      quite impossible to support the resolution on the legislative      council in its existing terms without at least a protest peel      made the following remark you have got another ireland growing up      in every colony you possess  a week later he was shocked by the death of lady canning breakfast with gaskell march 23rd and thence to lady cannings funeral in westminster abbey we were but eleven in attendance her coffin was laid on that of her illustrious husband canning showed a deep but manly sorrow may we live as by the side of a grave and looking in  in the same month he spoke on canada march 8th with insufficient possession of the subject and a week later on church rates for an hour or more with more success than the matter or manner deserved he finished his translation of the bride of corinth and the episode of ugolino from dante and read eckermanns conversations with goethe to which he gives the too commonplace praise of being very interesting he learned manzonis noble ode on the death of napoleon of which he byandby made a noble translation this by way of sparing his eyes and italian poetry not taking him nearly half the time of any other to commit to memory he found a beautiful and powerful production in channings letter to clay and he made the acquaintance of southey in appearance benignant melancholy and intellectual                                      ii                        the general election of 1837  in june king william iv died leaving a perilous legacy to his successor a month later july 14 mr gladstone went up with the oxford address and this was i suppose the first occasion on which he was called to present himself before the queen with whose long reign his own future career and fame were destined to be so closely and so conspicuously associated according to the old law prescribing a dissolution of parliament within six months of the demise of the crown mr gladstone was soon in the thick of a general election by july 17th he was at newark canvassing speaking handshaking and in lucid intervals reading filicaja he found a very strong angry and general sentiment not against the principle of the poor law as regards the ablebodied but against the regulations for separating man and wife and sending the old compulsorily to the workhouse with others of a like nature with the disapprobation on these heads he in great part concurred there was to be no contest but arrangements of this kind still leave room for some anxiety and in mr gladstones case a singular thing happened two days after his arrival at newark he was followed by a body of gentlemen from manchester with an earnest invitation that he would be a candidate for that great town he declined the invitation absolutely as he supposed but the manchester tories nominated him notwithstanding they assured the electors that he was the most promising young statesman of the day the whigs on the other hand vowed that he was an insulter of dissent a bigot of such dark hue as to wish to subject even the poor negroes of his fathers estates to the slavery of a dominant church a man who owed whatever wealth and consequence his family possessed to the crime of holding his fellowcreatures in bondage a man who though honest and consistent was a member of that small ultratory minority which followed the duke of cumberland when the votes were counted mr gladstone was at the bottom of the poll with a majority of many hundreds against him74  meantime he was already member for newark his own election was no sooner over than he caught the last vacant place on the mail to carlisle whence he hastened to the aid of his fathers patriotic labours as candidate for dundee here he worked hard at canvassing and meetings often pelted with mud and stones but encouraged by friends more buoyant than the event justified       aug 1stmy father beaten after all our promised votes in

         business with wellington  in november he was again in london to be sworn of the new parliament and at the end of the month he had for the first time an interview on business with the duke of wellingtonof interest as the collocation of two famous names the immediate subject was the cape of good hope his reception of me was plain but kind he came to the door of his room will you come in how do you do i am glad to see you we spoke a little of the cape he said with regard to the warand with sufficient modestythat he was pretty well aware of the operations that had taken place in it having been at the cape and being in some degree able to judge of those matters he said i suppose it is there as everywhere else as we had it last night about ireland and the house of lords they wont use the law as it is in canada as it is in the west indies they excite insurrection everywhere i however put in an apology for them in the west indies they want to play the part of opposition they are not a government for they dont maintain the law he appointed me to return to him tomorrow  the result of the general election was a slight improvement in the position of the conservatives but they still mustered no more than 315 against 342 supporters of the ministry including the radical and irish groups if melbourne and russell found their team delicate to drive peels difficulties were hardly less few people he wrote at this moment can judge of the difficulty there has frequently been in maintaining harmony between the various branches of the conservative party the great majority in the lords and the minority in the commons consisted of very different elements they included men like stanley and graham who had been authors and advocates of parliamentary reform and men who had denounced reform as treason to the constitution and ruin to the country even the animosities of 1829 and catholic emancipation were only half quenched within the tory ranks76 it was at a meeting held at peels on december 6 1837 that lord stanley for the first time appeared among the conservative members  the distractions produced in canada by mismanagement and misapprehension in downing street had already given trouble during the very short time when mr gladstone was undersecretary at the colonial office but they now broke into the flame of open revolt the perversity of a foolish king and weakness and disunion among his whig ministers had brought about a catastrophe at the beginning of the session 1838 the government introduced a bill suspending the constitution and conferring various absolute powers on lord durham as governor general and high commissioner it was in connection with this proposal that mr gladstone seems to have been first taken into the confidential consultations of the leaders of his party                             canadian speech  the sage marshalling and manoeuvring of the parliamentary squads was embarrassed by a move from sir william molesworth of whom we have just been hearing the editor of hobbes and one of the group nicknamed philosophic radicals with whom mr gladstone at this stage seldom or never agreed the new school of morals he called them which taught that success was the only criterion of merita delineation for which he would have been severely handled by bentham or james mill molesworth gave notice of a vote of censure on lord glenelg the colonial minister that is he selected a single member of the cabinet for condemnation on the ground of acts for which all the other ministers were collectively just as responsible for this discrimination the only precedent seems to be foxs motion against lord sandwich in 1779 mr gladstones memorandum77 completes or modifies the account of the dilemma of the conservative leader already known from sir robert peels papers78 and the reader will find it elsewhere it was the right of a conservative opposition to challenge a whig ministry yet to fight under radical colours was odious and intolerable on the other hand he could not vote for molesworth because he thought him unjust but he could not vote against him because that would imply confidence in the canadian policy of ministers a certain conservative contingent would not acquiesce in support of ministers against molesworth or in tame resort to the previous question again peel felt or feigned an apprehension that if by aggressive action they beat the government a conservative ministry must come in and he did not think that such a ministry could last even at this risk it became clear that the only way of avoiding the difficulty was an amendment to molesworths motion from the official opposition mr gladstone spoke mar 7 and was described as making his points with admirable precision and force though with something of a provincial manner like the rust to a piece of powerful steel machinery that has not worked into polish the debate on which such mighty issues were thought to hang lasted a couple of nights with not more than moderate spirit at the close the amendment was thrown out by a majority of twentynine for ministers the general result was to moderate the impatience of the carlton club men who wished to see their party in on the one hand and of the radical men who did not object to having the whigs out on the other it showed that neither administration nor opposition was in a station of supreme command                                     iii  at the end of march mr gladstone produced the strongest impression that he had yet made in parliament and he now definitely took his place in the front rank it was on the old embarrassment of slavery reports from the colonies showed that in some at least and more particularly in jamaica the apprenticeship system had led to harsher treatment of the negroes than under slavery as it has been well put the bad planters regarded their slaveapprentices as a bad farmer regards a farm near the end of an expiring term in 1836 buxton moved for a select committee to inquire into the working of the system mr gladstone defended it and he warned parliament against incautious and precipitate anticipations of entire success march 22 six days later he was appointed a member of the apprenticeship committee which at once began to investigate the complaints from jamaica mr gladstone acted as the representative of the planters on the committee and he paid very close attention to the proceedings during two sessions in the spring of 1838 a motion was made to accelerate by two years the end of the apprenticeship system on the slave plantations of the west indies brougham had been raising a tempest of humane sentiment by more than one of his most magnificent speeches the leading men on both sides in parliament were openly and strongly against a disturbance of the settlement but the feeling in the constituencies was hot and in liberal and tory camp alike members in fear and trembling tried to make up their minds sir george grey made an effective case for the law as it stood and peel spoke on the same side but it was agreed that mr gladstone by his union of fervour elevation and a complete mastery of the facts of the case went deeper than either even unwilling witnesses felt bound to admit the great ability he displayed his address was completely that of an advocate and he did not even affect to look on both sides of the question expressing his joy that the day had at length arrived when he could meet the charges against the planters and enter upon their defence       march 30thspoke from 11 to 1 received with the greatest and      most affecting kindness from all parties both during and after      through the debate i felt the most painful depression except mr      plumptre and lord john russell all who spoke damaged the question      to the utmost possible degree prayer earnest for the moment was      wrung from me in my necessity i hope it was not a blasphemous      prayer for support in pleading the cause of justice i am half      insensible even in the moment of delight to such pleasures as this      kind of occasion affords but this is a dangerous state      indifference to the world is not love of god                              speech on slavery  in writing to him upon this speech mr stephen his former ally at the colonial office addressed an admonition which is worth recalling both for its own sake and because it hits by anticipation what was to be one of the most admirable traits in the mighty parliamentarian to whom it was written it seems to me says stephen that this part of your speech establishes nothing more than the fact that your opponents are capricious in the distribution of their sympathy which is after all a reproach and nothing more now reproach is not only not your strength but it is the very thing in the disuse of which your strength consists and indulging as i do the hope that you will one day occupy one of the foremost stations in the house of commons if not the first of all i cannot help wishing that you may also be the founder of a more magnanimous system of parliamentary tactics than has ever yet been established in which recrimination will be condemned as unbefitting wise men and good christians in an assembly for candid deliberation modified by party spirit this is i fear almost as much a counsel of perfection as it would have been in a school of roman gladiators but at any rate it points the better way the speech itself has a close direct sinewy quality a complete freedom from anything vague or involved and shows for the first time a perfect mastery of the art of handling detail upon detail without an instant of tediousness and holding the attention of listeners sustained and unbroken it was a remonstrance against false allegations of the misbehaviour of the planters since the emancipating act but there is not a trace of backsliding upon the great issue we joined in passing the measure we declared a belief that slavery was an evil and demoralising state and a desire to be relieved from it we accepted a price in composition for the loss which was expected to accrue  neither now or at any time did mr gladstone set too low a value on that great deadlift effort not too familiar in history to heave off a burden from the conscience of the nation and set back the bounds of cruel wrong upon the earth on the day after this performance the entry in his diary isin the morning my father was greatly overcome and i could hardly speak to him now is the time to turn this attack into measures of benefit for the negroes more than once in the course of the spring he showed how much in earnest he was about the negroes by strenuously pressing his father to allow him to go to the west indies and view the state of things there for himself perhaps by prudent instinct his father disapproved and at last spoke decidedly against any project of the kind  the question of the education of the people was rising into political prominence and its close relations with the claims of the church sufficed to engage the active interest of so zealous a son of the church as mr gladstone from a very early stage we find him moving for returns serving on education committees in parliament corresponding energetically with manning acland and others of like mind in and out of parliament primary education is one of the few subjects on which the fossils of extinct opinion neither interest nor instruct it is enough to mark that mr gladstones position in the forties was that of the ultrachurchman of the time and such as no churchultra now dreams of fighting for we find him objecting to any infringement whatever of the principle on which the established church was foundedthat of confining the pecuniary support of the state to one particular religious denomination79  to dr hook march 12 1838 he speaks of a safe and precious interval perhaps the last to those who are desirous of placing the education of the people under the efficient control of the clergy the aims of himself and his allies were to plant training schools in every diocese to connect these with the cathedrals through the chapters to license the teachers by the bishops after examination  writing to manning feb 22 1839 he compares control by government to the little lion cub in the agamemnon which after being in its primeval season the delight of the young and amusement of the old gradually revealed its parent stock and grew to be a creature of huge mischief in the household80 he describes a divergence of view among them on the question whether the clergyman should have his choice as to admitting the children of dissenters without at once teaching them the catechism how mr gladstone went he does not say nor does it matter he was not yet thirty he accepted his political toryism on authority and in good faith and the same was true of his views on church policy he could not foresee that it was to be in his own day of power that the cub should come out fullgrown lion                               in society  his work did not prevent him from mixing pretty freely with men in society though he seems to have thought that little of what passed was worth transcribing nor in truth had mr gladstone ever much or any of the rare talent of the born diarist here are one or two miscellanea which must be made to serve       april 2538a long sitting and conversation with mr rogers      after the milnes marriage breakfast he spoke unfavourably of      bulwer well of milnes verses said his father wished them not to      be published because such authorship and its repute would clash      with the parliamentary career of his son mr rogers thought a      great author would undoubtedly stand better in parliament from      being such but that otherwise the additament of authorship unless      on germane subjects would be a hindrance he quoted swift on      women he has a good and tender opinion of them but went nearly      the

canning      observing to me is surely most wonderful he never loses the      thread and yet he habitually twists it into a thousand varieties      of intricate form he said when stanley came out in public life      and at the age of thirty he was by far the cleverest young man of      the day and at sixty he would be the same still by far the      cleverest young man of the day

have been favourably      impressed by the records of his being in society and then going      home and describing as lost in sin those with whom he had been      enjoying himself upon the other hand however he would have      exposed himself to the opposite reproach had he been more secluded      morosely withdrawing himself from the range of human sympathies he      remembered him as an admirable speaker agreed that the results of      his life were very great and the man must be in part measured by      them he disapproved of taking people to task by articles in the      papers for votes against their party       july 18thi complimented the speaker yesterday on the time he      had saved by putting an end to discussions upon the presentation of      petitions he replied that there was a more important advantage      that those discussions very greatly increased the influence of      popular feeling on the deliberations of the house and that by      stopping them he thought a wall was erected against such      influencenot as strong as might be wished probably some day it      might be broken down but he had done his best to raise it his      maxim was to shut out as far as might be all extrinsic pressure      and then to do freely what was right within doors  this high and sound way of regarding parliament underwent formidable changes before the close of mr gladstones career and perhaps his career had indirectly something to do with them but not i think with intention in 1838 he cited with approval an exclamation of roebucks in the house of commons we

parliament and the public judgment as the session went on is sufficiently manifest from a letter addressed to him at this time by samuel wilberforce four years his junior henceforth one of his nearest friends and always an acute observer of social and political forces it would be an affectation in you which you are above writes the future bishop april 20 1838 not to know that few young men have the

this speech he dealt with an attack made upon him by his opponent poulett thomson afterwards lord sydenham on the question of negro slavery  i have had some obloquy cast upon me by mr thomson in reference to the part which i took in the question of negro slavery now if there was ever a question upon which i would desire to submit all that i have ever said to a candid inquirer it is that of negro slavery he should try me in opposition to lord stanley and did lord stanley complain it is well known that he stated that the only two speeches which were decidedly hostile to that measure were delivered by two gentlemen who hold office under her majestys present government whilst on the contrary his lordship was pleased to express candidly his high approbation of my sentiments and my individual exertions for the settlement of that matter does mr thomson mean to say that the great conservative body in parliament has offered opposition to that measure who i would ask conducted the correspondence of the government office with reference to that important question will any man who knows the character of lord bathurstwill any man who knows the character of mr stephen the undersecretary for the coloniesthe chosen assistant of the noble lord in that ministry of which he was no unimportant memberwill any man say that mr stephen who was all along the advocate of the slaves with his liberal and enlightened views exercised an influence less than under lord stanley does mr thomson presume to state that lord aberdeen was guilty of neglect to the slaves when i add that the question underwent a considerable discussion last year in the house of commons when all parties and all interests were fairly represented and the best disposition was evinced to assist the proper working of the measure and to alter some parts that were considered injurious to the slaves and which had come under the immediate cognisance of the conservative party is it fair is it just

and a half centuries probably more      remarkable than the movement associated with the name of port      royal for that has passed away and left hardly a trace behind but      this has left ineffaceable marks upon the english church and      nationgladstone 1891   it was the affinity of great natures for great issues that made mr gladstone from his earliest manhood onwards take and hold fast the affairs of the churches for the objects of his most absorbing interest he was one and the same man his genius was one his persistent incursions all through his long life into the multifarious doings not only of his own anglican communion but of the latin church of the west as well as of the motley christendom of the east puzzled and vexed political whippersin wirepullers newspaper editors leaders colleagues they were the despair of party caucuses and they made the neutral man of the world smile as eccentricities of genius and rather singularly chosen recreations all this was in truth of the very essence of his character the manifestation of its profound unity  the quarrel upon church comprehension that had perplexed elizabeth and burleigh had distracted the councils of charles i and of cromwell had bewildered william of orange and tillotson and burnet was once more aglow with its old heat the still mightier dispute how wide or how narrow is the common ground between the church of england and the church of rome broke into fierce flame                         the religious question  then by and by these familiar contests of ancient tradition thus quickened in the eternal ebb and flow of human things into fresh vitality were followed by a revival with new artillery and larger strategy of a standing war that is roughly described as the conflict between reason and faith between science and revelation the controversy of laudian divines with puritans of hoadly with nonjurors of hanoverian divines with deists and freethinkers all may seem now to us narrow and dry when compared with such a drama of so many interesting characters strange evolutions and multiple and startling climax as gradually unfolded itself to mr gladstones ardent and impassioned gaze  his is not one of the cases like pascal or baxter or rutherford or a hundred others where a mans theological history is to the world however it may seem to himself the most important aspect of his career or character this is not the place for an exploration of mr gladstones strictly theological history nor is mine the hand by which such exploration could be attempted in the sphere of dogmatic faith apart from ecclesiastical politics and all the war of principles connected with such politics mr gladstone by the time when he was thirty had become a man of settled questions nor was he for his own part with a remarkable exception in respect of one particular doctrine towards the end of his life ever ready to reopen them what is extraordinary in the career of this farshining and dominant character of his age is not a development of specific opinions on dogma or discipline or ordinance on article or sacrament but the fact that with a steadfast tread he marched along the high anglican road to the summits of that liberalism which it was the original object of the new anglicans to resist and overthrow  the years from 1831 to 1840 mr gladstone marked as an era of a marvellous uprising of religious energy throughout the land it saved the church he says not only in oxford but in england he declares that party spirit within the church had fallen to a low ebb coming hurricanes were not foreseen in lord liverpools government patronage was considered to have been respectably dispensed and church reform was never heard of81 this dreamless composure was rudely broken the repeal of the test and corporation acts in 1828 first roused the church and her sons rubbed their eyes when they beheld parliament bringing frankly to an end the odious monopoly of office under the crown all corporate office all magistracy in men willing to take the communion at the altar of the privileged establishment the next year a deadlier blow fell after a more embittered fightthe admission of roman catholics to parliament and place the reform bill of 1832 followed even when half spent the forces that had been gathering for many years in the direction of parliamentary reform and had at last achieved more than one immense result rolled heavily forward against the church the opening of parliament and of close corporations was taken to involve an opening to correspond in the grandest and closest of all corporations the resounding victory of the constitutional bill of 1832 was followed by a drastic handling of the church in ireland and by a proposal to divert a surplus of its property to purposes not ecclesiastical a long and peculiarly unedifying crisis ensued stanley and graham two of the most eminent members of the reforming whig cabinet on this proposal at once resigned the grey ministry was thus split in 1834 and the peel ministry ejected in 1835 on the ground of the absolute inviolability of the property of the irish church the tide of reaction set slowly in the shock in political party was in no long time followed by shock after shock in the church as has happened on more than one occasion in our history alarm for the church kindled the conservative temper in the nation or to put it in another way that spontaneous attachment to the old order of things with all its symbols institutes and deep associations which the radical reformers had both affronted and ignored made the church its rallyingpoint the three years of tortuous proceedings on the famous appropriation clauseproceedings that political philosophers declared to have disgraced this country in the face of europe and that were certainly an ignominy and a scandal in a party called reformingwere among the things that helped most to prepare the way for the fall of the whigs and the conservative triumph of 1841 within ten years from the death of canning the church transfixed the attention of the politician the duke of wellington was hardly a wizard in political foresight but he had often a good soldiers eye for things that stood straight up in front of him the real question said the duke in 1838 that now divides the country and which truly divides the house of commons is church or no church people talk of the war in spain and the canada question but all that is of little moment the real question is church or no church                    changed position of the church  the position of the tory party as seen by its powerful recruit was when he entered public life a state of hopeless defeat and discomfiture but in my imagination wrote mr gladstone i cast over that party a prophetic mantle and assigned to it a mission distinctly religious as the champion in the state field of that divine truth which it was the office of the christian ministry to uphold in the church neither then did i nor now can i see on what ground this inviolability could for a moment be maintained except the belief that the state had such a mission he soon discovered how hard it is to adjust to the many angles of an english political party the seamless mantle of ecclesiastical predominance  the changes in the political constitution in 1828 in 1829 and in 1832 carried with them a deliberate recognition that the church was not the nation that it was not identical with the parliament who spoke for the nation that it had no longer a title to compose the governing order anda more startling disclosure still to the minds of churchmenthat laws affecting the church would henceforth be made by men of all churches and creeds or even men of none this hateful circumstance it was that inevitably began in multitudes of devout and earnest minds to produce a revolution in their conception of a church and a resurrection in curiously altered forms of that old ideal of miltons austere and lofty schoolthe ideal of a purely spiritual association that should leave each mans soul and conscience free from secular chains and hireling wolves                      changed social conditions  strange social conditions were emerging on every side the factory system established itself on a startling scale huge aggregates of population collected with little regard to antique divisions of diocese and parish colonies over the sea extended in boundaries and numbers and churchmen were zealous that these infant societies should be blessed by the same services rites ecclesiastical ordering and exhortation as were believed to elevate and sanctify the parent community at home the education of the people grew to be a formidable problem the field of angry battles and campaigns that never end trade markets wages hours and all the gaunt and haggard economics of the labour question added to the statesmans load pauperism was appalling in a word the need for social regeneration both material and moral was in the spirit of the time here were the hopes vague blind unmeasured formless that had inspired the wild clamour for the bill the whole bill and nothing but the bill the whig patricians carried away the prizes of great office though the work had been done by men of a very different stamp it was the utilitarian radicals who laid the foundations of social improvement in a reasoned creed with admirable ability perseverance unselfishness and public spirit bentham and his disciples had regenerated political opinion and fought the battle against debt pauperism classprivilege classmonopoly abusive patronage a monstrous criminal law and all the host of sinister interests82 as in every reforming age men approached the work from two sides evangelical religion divides with rationalism the glory of more than one humanitarian struggle brougham a more potent force than we now realise plunged with the energy of a titan into a thousand projects all taking for granted that ignorance is the disease and useful knowledge the universal healer all of them secular all dealing with man from the outside none touching imagination or the heart marchofmind became to many almost as wearisome a cry as wisdomofourancestors had been according to some eager innovators dogma and ceremony were to go the fabrics to be turned into mechanics institutes the clergy to lecture on botany and statistics the reaction against this dusty dominion of secularity kindled new life in rival schools they insisted that if society is to be improved and civilisation saved it can only be through improvement in the character of man and character is moulded and inspired by more things than are dreamed of by societies for useful knowledge the building up of the inward man in all his parts faculties and aspirations was seen to be what in every age it is the problem of problems this thought turned the eyes of manyof mr gladstone first among themto the church and stirred an endeavour to make out of the church what coleridge describes as the sustaining correcting befriending opposite of the world the compensating counterforce to the inherent and inevitable defects of the state as a state such was the new movement of the time between 1835 and 1845  it is surprising said proudhon the trenchant genius of french socialism in 1840 and onwards how at the bottom of our politics we always found theology it is true at any rate that the association of political and social change with theological revolution was the most remarkable of all the influences in the first twenty years of mr gladstones public life then rose once more into active prominence the supreme debate often cutting deep into the labours of the modern statesman always near to the heart of the speculations of the theologian in many fields urgent in its interest alike to ecclesiastic historian and philosopher the inquiry what is a church this opened the sluices and let out the floods what is the church of england to ask that question was to ask a hundred others creeds dogmas ordinances hierarchy parliamentary institution judicial tribunals historical tradition the prayerbook the bibleall these enormous topics sacred and profane with all their countless ramifications were rapidly swept into a tornado of such controversy as had not been seen in england since the revolution was the church a purely human creation changing with time and circumstance like all the other creations of the heart and brain and will of man were its bishops mere officers like high ministers of mundane state or were they in actual historic truth as in supposed theological necessity the direct lineal successors of the first apostles endowed from the beginning with the mystical prerogatives on which the efficacy of all sacramental rites depended what were its relations to the councils of the first four centuries what to the councils of the fifteenth century and the sixteenth what to the fathers the scottish presbyterians held the conception of a church as strongly as anybody83 but england broadly speaking had never been persuaded that there could be a church without bishops  in the answers to this group of hard questions terrible divisions that had been long muffled and huddled away burst into view the stupendous quarrel of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries again broke out to the erastian lawyer the church was an institution erected on principles of political expediency by act of parliament to the school of whately and arnold it was a corporation of divine origin devised to strengthen men in their struggle for goodness and holiness by the association and mutual help of fellowbelievers to the evangelical it was hardly more than a collection of congregations commended in the bible for the diffusion of the knowledge and right interpretation of the scriptures the commemoration of gospel events and the linking of gospel truths to a wellordered life to the high anglican as to the roman catholic the church was something very different from this not a fabric reared by man nor in truth any mechanical fabric at all but a mystically appointed channel of salvation an indispensable element in the relation between the soul of man and its creator to be a member of it was not to join an external association but to become an inward partaker in ineffable and mysterious graces to which no other access lay open such was the church catholic and apostolic as set up from the beginning and of this immense mystery of this saving agency of this incommensurable spiritual force the established church of england was the local presence and the organ                         hard questions revived  the noble restlessness of the profounder and more penetrating minds was not satisfied any more than bossuet had been to think of the church as only an element in a scheme of individual salvation they sought in it the comprehensive solution of all the riddles of life and time newman drew in powerful outline the sublime and sombre anarchy of human history  this is the enigma this the solution in faith and spirit in which mr gladstone lived and moved in him it gave to the energies of life their meaning and to duty its foundation while poetic voices and the oracles of sagesgoethe scott wordsworth shelley byron coleridgewere drawing men one way or another or else were leaving the void turbid and formless he in the midst of doubts distractions and fears saw a steadfast light where the oxford men saw it in that concrete representation of the unseen power that as he believed had made and guides and rules the world in that church catholic and apostolic which alone would have the force and the stoutness necessary to serve for a breakwater against the deluge yet to understand mr gladstones case we have ever to remember that what is called the catholic revival was not in england that which the catholic counterrevolution had been on the continent of europe primarily a political movement its workings were inward in the sphere of the mind in thought and faith in idealised associations of historic grandeur84                                     ii                            his religious growth  the reader has already been told how at rome and in naples in 1832 mr gladstone was suddenly arrested by the new idea of a church interweaving with the whole of human life a pervading and equalised spirit of religion long years after in an unfinished fragment he began to trace the golden thread of his religious growth       my environment in my childhood was strictly evangelical my dear      and noble mother was a woman of warm piety but broken health and i      was not directly instructed by her but i was brought up to believe      that doyly and mants bible then a standard book of the colour      ruling in the church was heretical and that every unitarian i      suppose also every heathen must as matter of course be lost      forever this deplorable servitude of mind oppressed me in a      greater or less degree for a number of years as late as in the      year i think 1836 one of my brothers married a beautiful and in      every way charming person who had been brought up in a family of      the unitarian profession yet under a mother very sincerely      religious i went through much mental difficulty and distress at      the time as there had been no express renunciation by her of the      ancestral creed and i absurdly busied myself with devising this or      that religious test as what if accepted might suffice85       so as will be seen the first access of churchlike ideas to my      mind by no means sufficed to expel my inherited and bigoted      misconception though in the event they did it as i hope      effectively but i long retained in my recollection an observation      made to me in i think the year 1829 by mrs benjamin gaskell of      thornes near wakefield a seed which was destined long to remain      in my mind without germinating i fell into religious conversation      with this excellent woman the mother of my eton friend milnes      gaskell himself the husband of an unitarian she said to me      surely we cannot entertain a doubt as to the future condition of      any person truly united to christ by faith and love whatever may      be the faults of his opinions here she supplied me with the key to      the whole question at this hour i feel grateful to her      accordingly for the scope of her remark is very wide and it is      now my rule to remember her in prayer before the altar       there was nothing at eton to subvert this frame of mind for      nothing was taught us either for it or against it but in the      spring and summer of 1828 i set to work on hookers      ecclesiastical polity and read it straight through intercourse      with my elder sister anne had increased my mental interest in      religion and she though generally of evangelical sentiments had      an opinion that the standard divines of the english church were of      great value hookers exposition of the case of the church of      england came to me as a mere abstraction but i think that i found      the doctrine of baptismal regeneration theretofore abhorred      impossible to reject and the way was thus opened for further      changes       in like manner at oxford i do not doubt that in 1830 and 1831 the      study of bishop butler laid the ground for new modes of thought in      religion but his teaching in the sermons on our moral nature was      not integrated so to speak until several years later by larger      perusal of the works of saint augustine i may however say that i      was not of a mind ill disposed to submit to authority       the oxford movement properly so called began in the year 1833      but it had no direct effect upon me i did not see the tracts and      to this hour i have read but few of them indeed my first      impressions and emotions in connection with it were those of      indignation at what i thought the rash intemperate censures      pronounced by mr hurrell froude upon the reformers my chief tie      with oxford was the close friendship i had formed in 1830 with      walter hamilton86 his character always loving and loved had      not very greatly later become deeply devout but i do not think he      at this time sympathised with newman and his friends and he had      the good sense in conjunction with mr denison afterwards bishop      to oppose the censure upon dr hampden to which i foolishly and      ignorantly gave in without however being an active or important      participator       but the blow struck by the prayerbook in 1832 set my mind in      motion and that motion was never arrested i found food for the      new ideas and tendencies in various quarters not least in the      religious writings of alexander knox all of which i perused      moreover i had an inclination to ecclesiastical conformity and      obedience as such which led me to concur with some zeal in the      plans of bishop blomfield in the course of two or three years      manning turned from a strongly evangelical attitude to one as      strongly anglican and about the same time converted his      acquaintance with me into a close friendship in the same manner      james hope whom i had known but slightly at eton or oxford made a      carefully considered change of the same kind which also became the      occasion of a fast friendship both these intimacies led me      forward hope especially had influence over me more than i think      any other person at any period of my life87       when i was preparing in 18378 the state in its relations with the      church he took a warm interest in the work which during my      absence on the continent he corrected for the press his attitude      towards the work however included a desire that its propositions      should be carried further the temper of the times among young      educated men was working in the same direction i had no low      churchmen among my near friends except walter farquhar anstice a      great loss died very early in his beautiful married life while i      was busy about my book hope made known to me palmers work on the      church which had just appeared i read it with care and great      interest it took hold upon me and gave me at once the clear      definite and strong conception of the church which through all      the storm and strain of a most critical period has proved for me      entirely adequate to every emergency and saved me from all      vacillation i did not however love the extreme rigour of the      book in its treatment of nonepiscopal communions it was not very      long after this i think in 1842 that i reduced into form my      convictions of the large and important range of subjects which      recent controversy had brought into prominence i conceive that in      the main palmer completed for me the work which inspection of the      prayerbook had begun       before referring further to my redaction of opinions i desire to      say that at this moment i am as closely an adherent to the      doctrines of grace generally and to the general sense of saint      augustine as at the date from which this narrative set out i hope      that my mind has dropped nothing affirmative but i hope also that      there has been dropped from it all the damnatory part of the      opinions taught by the evangelical school not only as regards the      roman catholic religion but also as to heretics and heathens      nonconformists and presbyterians i think that i always let off      pretty easily                                       iii                         influence of friends and books  the tractarian movement is by this time one of the most familiar chapters in our history and it has had singular good fortune in being told by three masters of the most winning graphic and melodious english prose of the century to which the tale belongs88 whether we call it by the ill name of oxford counterreformation or the friendlier name of catholic revival it remains a striking landmark in the varied motions of english religious thought and feeling for the threequarters of a century since the still unfinished journey first began in its early stages the movement was exclusively theological philanthropic reform still remained with the evangelical school that so powerfully helped to sweep away the slave trade cleansed the prisons and aided in humanising the criminal law it was they who helped to form a conscience if not a heart in the callous bosom of english politics while the very foremost of the oxford divines was scouting the fine talk about black men because they concentrated in themselves all the whiggery dissent cant and abomination that had been ranged on their side89 nor can we forget that shaftesbury the leader in that beneficent crusade of human mercy and national wisdom which ended in the deliverance of women and children in mines and factories was also a leader of the evangelical party  the tractarian movement as all know opened among other sources in antagonism to utilitarian liberalism yet j s mill the oracle of rationalistic liberalism in oxford and other places in the following generation had always much to say for the tractarians he used to tell us that the oxford theologians had done for england something like what guizot villemain michelet cousin had done a little earlier for france they had opened broadened deepened the issues and meanings of european history they had reminded us that history is european that it is quite unintelligible if treated as merely local he would say moreover that thought should recognise thought and mind always welcome mind and the oxford men had at least brought argument learning and even philosophy of a sort to break up the narrow and frigid conventions of reigning system in church and college in pulpits and professorial chairs they had made the church ashamed of the evil of her ways they had determined that spirit of improvement from within which if this sectridden country is ever really to be taught must proceed pari passu with assault from without90  one of the ablest of the oxford writers talking of the nonjurors remarks how very few of the movements that are attended with a certain romance and thus bias us for a time in their favour will stand full examination they so often reveal some gross offence against common sense91 want of common sense is not the particular impression left by the tractarians after we have put aside the plausible dialectic and winning periods of the leader and proceed to look at the effect not on their general honesty but on their intellectual integrity of their most peculiar situation and the methods which they believed that situation to impose nobody will be so presumptuous or uncharitable as to deny that among the divines of the oxford movement were men as pure in soul as fervid lovers of truth as this world ever possessed on the other hand it would be nothing short of a miracle in human nature if all that dreadful tangle of economies and reserves so largely practised and for a long time so insidiously defended did not familiarise a vein of subtlety a tendency to play fast and loose with words a perilous disposition to regard the nonnatural sense of language as if it were just as good as the natural a willingness to be satisfied with a bare and rigid logical consistency of expression without respect to the interpretation that was sure to be put upon that expression by the hearer and the reader the strain of their position in all these respects made newman and his allies no exemplary school their example has been perhaps rightly held to account for something that was often under the evil name of sophistry suspected and disliked in mr gladstone himself in his speeches his writings and even in his public acts              mischievous effects of oxford entanglements  it is true that to the impartial eye newman is no worse than teachers in antagonistic sects he is for instance no subtler than maurice the theologian who strove so hard in the name of anglican unity to develop all the catholic elements and hide out of sight all the calvinistic was not driven to any hardier exploits of verbal legerdemain than the theologian who strove against all reason and clear thinking to devise common formulæ that should embrace both catholic and calvinistic explanations together or indeed anything else that anybody might choose to bring to the transfusing alchemy of his rather smoky crucible nor was the third and at that moment the strongest of the church parties at oxford and in the country well able to fling stones at the other two what better right it was asked had low churchmen to shut their eyes to the language of rubrics creeds and offices than the high churchmen had to twist the language of the articles  the confusion was grave and it was unfathomable newman fought a skilful and persistent fight against liberalism as being nothing else than the egregious doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion and that one creed is as good as another dr arnold on the other hand denounced newmanism as idolatry declared that if you let in the little finger of tradition you would soon have in the whole monster horns and tail and all and even complained of the english divines in general with the noble exceptions of butler and hooker that he found in them a want of believing or disbelieving anything because it was true or false as if that were a question that never occurred to them92 the plain man who was but a poor master either of theology or of the history of the church of england but who loved the prayerbook and hated confession convents priestcraft and mariolatry was wrought to madness by a clergyman who should describe himself as did r h froude as a catholic without the popery and a church of england man without the protestantism the plain man knew that he was not himself clever enough to form any distinct idea of what such talk meant but then his helplessness only deepened his conviction that the more distinct his idea might become the more intense would his aversion be both to the thing meant and to the surpliced conjurer who as he bitterly supposed was by sophistic tricks trying hard to take him in  other portents were at the same time beginning to disturb the world the finds and the theories of geologists made men uncomfortable and brought down sharp anathemas wider speculations on cosmic and creative law came soon after and found their way into popular reading93 in prose literature in subtler forms than the verse of shelley new dissolving elements appeared that were destined to go far schleiermacher between 1820 and 1830 opened the sluices of the theological deep whether to deluge or to irrigate in 1830 an alarming note was sounded in the publication by a learned clergyman of a history of the jews we have seen p 56 how mr gladstone was horrified by it milmans book was the beginning of a new rationalism within the fold a line of thought was opened that seemed to make the history of religious ideas more interesting than their truth the special claims of an accepted creed were shaken by disclosing an unmistakeable family likeness to creeds abhorred a belief was deemed to be accounted for and its sanctity dissolved by referring it historically to human origins and showing it to be only one branch of a genealogical trunk historic explanation became a graver peril than direct attack                                     iv                          new ideas and tendencies  the first skirmish in a dire conflict that is not even now over or near its end happened in 1836 lord melbourne recommended for the chair of divinity at oxford dr hampden a divine whose clumsy handling of nice themes had brought him much against his intention under suspicion of unsound doctrine and who was destined eleven years later to find himself the centre of a still louder uproar evangelicals and tractarians flew to arms and the two hosts who were soon to draw their swords upon one another now for the first time if not the last swarmed forth together side by side against the heretic what was rather an affront than a penalty was inflicted upon hampden by a majority of some five to one of the masters of arts of the university and in accord with that majority as he has just told us though he did not actually vote was mr gladstone twenty years after when he had risen to be a shining light in the worlds firmament he wrote to hampden to express regret for the injustice of which in this instance the forward precipitancy of youth had made him guilty94 the case of hampden gave a sharp actuality to the question of the relations of church and crown the particular quarrel was of secondary importance but it brought home to the high churchmen what might be expected in weightier matters than the affair of dr hampden from whig ministers and confirmed the horrible apprehension that whig ministers might possibly have to fill all the regius chairs and all the sees for a whole generation to come  not less important than the theology of the oxford divines in its influence on mr gladstones line of thought upon things ecclesiastical was the speculation of coleridge on the teaching and polity of a national church his fertile book on church and state was given to the world in 1830 four years before his death and this and the ideas proceeding from it were the mainspring if not of the theology of the movement at least of mr gladstones first marked contribution to the stirring controversies of the time he has described the profound effect upon his mind of another book the treatise on the church of christ by william palmer of worcester college 1838 and to the end of his life it held its place in his mind among the most masterly performances of the day in the twin hemispheres of theology and church polity95 newman applauded the book for its magnificence of design and undoubtedly it covers much ground including a stiff rejection of lockes theory of toleration and the assertion of the strong doctrine that the christian prince has a right by temporal penalties to protect the church from the gathering together of the froward and the insurrection of wicked doers it has at least the merit so far from universal in the polemics of that day of clear language definite propositions and formal arguments capable of being met by a downright yes or no96 the question however that has often slumbered yet never dies of the right relations between the christian prince or state and the christian church was rapidly passing away from logicians of the cloister                              note to page 167       hawarden chester november 9 1856my lord bishopyour      lordship will probably be surprised at receiving a letter from me      as a stranger the simple purpose of it is to discharge a debt of      the smallest possible importance to you yet due i think from me      by expressing the regret with which i now look back on my      concurrence in a vote of the university of oxford in the year 1836      condemnatory of some of your lordships publications i did not      take actual part in the vote but upon reference to a journal kept      at the time i find that my absence was owing to an accident       for a good many years past i have found myself ill able to master      books of an abstract character and i am far from pretending to be      competent at this time to form a judgment on the merits of any      propositions then at issue i have learned indeed that many      things which in the forward precipitancy of my youth i should      have condemned are either in reality sound or lie within the just      limits of such discussion as especially befits an university but      that which after a delay due i think to the cares and pressing      occupations of political life brought back to my mind the      injustice of which i had unconsciously been guilty in 1836 was my      being called upon as a member of the council of kings college in      london to concur in a measure similar in principle with respect to      mr maurice that is to say in a condemnation couched in general      terms which did not really declare the point of imputed guilt and      against which perfect innocence could have no defence i resisted      to the best of my power though ineffectually the grievous wrong      done to mr maurice and urged that the charges should be made      distinct that all the best means of investigation should be      brought to bear on them ample opportunity given for defence and a      reference then made if needful to the bishop in his proper      capacity but the majority of laymen in the council were      inexorable it was only as i have said after mature reflection      that i came to perceive the bearing of the case on that of 1836      and to find that by my resistance i had condemned myself i then      lamented very sincerely that i had not on that occasion now so      remote felt and acted in a different manner       i beg your lordship to accept this expression of my cordial      regret and to

her foundations are on the holy hills her      charter is legibly divine she if she should be excluded from the      precinct of government may still fulfil all her functions and      carry them out to perfection her condition would be anything      rather than pitiable should she once more occupy the position      which she held before the reign of constantine but the state in      rejecting her would actively violate its most solemn duty and      would if the theory of the connection be sound entail upon itself      a cursegladstone 1838  according to mr gladstone a furore for church establishment came down upon the conservative squadrons between 1835 and 1838 he describes it as due especially to the activity of the presbyterian established church of scotland before the disruption and especially to the zealous and truly noble propagandism of dr chalmers a man with the energy of a giant and the simplicity of a child in 1837 mr gladstone says in one of the many fragments written when in his later years he mused over the past we had a movement for fresh parliamentary grants to build churches in scotland the leaders did not seem much to like it but had to follow i remember dining at sir r peels with the scotch deputation it included collins a church bookseller of note who told me that no sermon ought ever to fall short of an hour for in less time than that it was not possible to explain any text of the holy scripture  in the spring of 1838 the mighty chalmers was persuaded to cross the border and deliver in london half a dozen discourses to vindicate the cause of ecclesiastical establishments the rooms in hanover square were crowded to suffocation by intense audiences mainly composed of the governing class princes of the blood were there high prelates of the church great nobles leading statesmen and a throng of members of the house of commons from both sides of it the orator was seated but now and again in the kindling excitement of his thought he rose unconsciously to his feet and by ringing phrase or ardent gesture roused a whirlwind of enthusiasm such that vehement bystanders assure us it could not be exceeded in the history of human eloquence98 in chalmers fulminating energy the mechanical polemics of an appropriation clause in a parliamentary bill assume a passionate and living air he had warned his northern flock should the disaster ever befall us of vulgar and upstart politicians becoming lords of the ascendant and an infidel or demiinfidel government wielding the destinies of this mighty empire and should they be willing at the shrines of their own wretched partizanship to make sacrifice of those great and hallowed institutions which were consecrated by our ancestors to the maintenance of religious truth and religious libertyshould in particular the monstrous proposition ever be entertained to abridge the legal funds for the support of protestantismlet us hope that there is still enough not of fiery zeal but of calm resolute enlightened principle in the land to resent the outrageenough of energy and reaction in the revolted sense of this great country to meet and overbear it                         chalmers in london  the impression made by all this on mr gladstone he has himself described in an autobiographic note of 1897       the primary idea of my early politics was the church with this was      connected the idea of the establishment as being everything except      essential when therefore dr chalmers came to london to lecture on      the principle of church establishments i attended as a loyal      hearer i had a profound respect for the lecturer with whom i had      had the honour of a good deal of acquaintance during winter      residences in edinburgh and some correspondence by letter i was      in my earlier twenties and he near his sixties he was 58 with      a high and merited fame for eloquence and character he subscribed      his letters to me respectfully or most respectfully yours      and puzzled me extremely in the effort to find out what suitable      mode of subscription to use in return unfortunately the basis of      his lectures was totally unsound parliament as being christian was      bound to know and establish the truth but not being made of      theologians it could not follow the truth into its minuter      shadings and must proceed upon broad lines fortunately these      lines were ready to hand there was a religious system which taken      in the rough was truth this was known as protestantism and to      its varieties it was not the business of the legislature to have      regard on the other side lay a system which taken again in the      rough was not truth but error this system was known as popery      parliament therefore was bound to establish and endow some kind of      protestantism and not to establish or endow popery  in a letter to manning may 14 1838 he puts the case more bluntly       such a jumble of church unchurch and antichurch principles as      that excellent and eloquent man dr chalmers has given us in his      recent lectures no human being ever heard and it can only be      compared to the state of things         ante mare et terras et quod tegit omnia coelum99       he thinks that the state has not cognisance of spirituals except      upon a broad simple principle like that which separates popery from      protestantism namely that protestantism receives the word of god      only popery the word of god and the word of man alikeit is easy      he says such being the alternatives to judge which is preferable      he flogged the apostolic succession grievously seven bishops      sitting below him london winchester chester oxford llandaff      gloucester exeter and the duke of cambridge incessantly bobbing      assent but for fear we should be annoyed he then turned round on      the cathedrals plan and flogged it with at least equal vigour he      has a mind keenly susceptible of what is beautiful great and      good tenacious of an idea when once grasped and with a singular      power of concentrating the whole man upon it but unfortunately i      do not believe he has ever looked in the face the real doctrine of      the visible church and the apostolic succession or has any idea      what is the matter at issue  mr gladstone says he could not stand the undisputed currency in conservative circles of a theory like this and felt that the occasion ought to be seized for further entrenching the existing institution strong as it seemed in fact by more systematic defences in principle and theory he sat down to the literary task with uncommon vigour and persistency his object was not merely to show that the state has a conscience for not even the newest of new machiavellians denies that a state is bound by some moral obligations though in history and fact it is true that                      earth is sick   and heaven is weary of the hollow words   which states and kingdoms utter when they talk   of truth and justice100  but the obligation of conscience upon a state was not mr gladstones only point his propositions were that the state is cognisant of the difference between religious truth and religious error that the propagation of this truth and the discouragement of this error are among the ends for which government exists that the english state did recognise as a fundamental duty to give an active and exclusive support to a certain religion and finally that the condition of things resulting from the discharge of this duty was well worth preserving against encroachment from whatever quarter encroachment might threaten                         composition of his work  on july 23rd the draft of his book was at last finished and he dispatched it to james hope for free criticism suggestions and revision the physical state of the ms as mr gladstone calls it seems to have been rather indefensible and his excuse for writing irregularly and confusedly considering the pressure of other engagementsan excuse somewhat too common with himwas not quite so valid as he seems to have thought it the defects writes hope are such as must almost necessarily occur when a great subject is handled piecemeal and at intervals and i should recommend with a view to remedying them that you procure the whole to be copied out in a good legible hand with blank pages and that you read it through in this shape once connectedly with a view to the whole argument and again with a view to examining the structure of each part101 hope took as much trouble with the argument and structure of the book as if he were himself its author for many weeks the fervid toil went on  the strain on his eyesight that had embarrassed mr gladstone for several months now made abstinence from incessant reading and writing necessary and he was ordered to travel he first settled with his sister at ems august 15th whither the proofs of his book with hopes annotations followed nor did he finally get rid of the burden until the middle of september the tedium of life in hotels was almost worse than the tedium of revising proofs and at milan and florence he was strongly tempted to return home as the benefit was problematical it was even doubtful whether pictures were any less trying to his eyes than books he made the acquaintance of one celebrated writer of the time i went to see manzoni he says in his house some six or eight miles from milan in 1838 he was a most interesting man but was regarded as i found among the more fashionable priests in milan as a bacchettone hypocrite in his own way he was i think a liberal and a nationalist nor was the alliance of such politics with strong religious convictions uncommon among the more eminent italians of those days  october found him in sicily102 where he travelled with sir stephen glynne and his two sisters and here we shall soon see that with one of these sisters a momentous thing came to pass it was at catania that he first heard of the publication of his book a month or more was passed in rome in company with manning and together they visited wiseman mannings conversion still thirteen years off macaulay too now eightandthirty was at rome that winter on christmas eve he says i found gladstone in the throng and i accosted him as we had met though we had never been introduced to each other we talked and walked together in st peters during the best part of an afternoon he is both a clever and an amiable man at rome as the state of his eyesight forbade too close resort to picture galleries and museums he listened to countless sermons all carefully recorded in his diary dr wiseman gave him a lesson in the missal on his birthday he went with manning to hear mass with the popes choir and they were placed on the bench behind the cardinals at st peters he recalled that there his first conception of the unity of the church had come into his mind and the desire for its attainmentan object in every human sense hopeless but not therefore the less to be desired for the horizon of human hope is not that of divine power and wisdom that idea has been upon the whole i believe the ruling one of my life during the period that has since elapsed on january 19 he bade a reluctant adieu to the mysterious city whither he should repair who wishes to renew for a time the dream of life  a few years later mr gladstone noted some differences between english and italian preaching that are of interest       the fundamental distinction between english and italian preaching      is i think this the mind of the english preacher or reader of      sermons however impressive is fixed mainly upon his composition      that of the italian on his hearers the italian is a man applying      himself by his rational and persuasive organs to men in order to      move them the former is a man applying himself with his best      ability in many cases to a fixed form of matter in order to make      it move those whom he addresses the action in the one case is      warm living direct immediate from heart to heart in the other      it is transfused through a medium comparatively torpid the first      is surely far superior to the second in truth and reality the      preacher bears an awful message such messengers if sent with      authority are too much identified with and possessed by that      which they carry to view it objectively during its delivery it      absorbs their very being and all its energies they are their      message and they see nothing extrinsic to themselves except those      to whose hearts they desire to bring it in truth what we want is      the following of nature and her genial development march 20      palm sunday 42                                        ii                          goes abroad book published  it was the end of january 1839 before mr gladstone arrived in london and by that time his work had been out for six or seven weeks103 on his return we may be sure that his book and its fortunes were the young authors most lively interest church authorities and the clergy generally so far as he could learn approved many of them very warmly the bishop of london wrote this and the archbishop of canterbury said it it is easy to understand with what interest and delight the average churchman would welcome so serious a contribution to the good cause so bold an effort by so skilled a hand by lessons from history by general principles of national probity and a national religion and by welldigested materials gathered as hooker gathered his from the characteristic circumstances of the time to support the case for ecclesiastical privilege anglicans of the better sort had their intellectual selfrespect restored in mr gladstones book by finding that they need no longer subsist on the dregs of eldonian prejudice but could sustain themselves in intellectual dignity and affluence by large thoughts and sonorous phrases upon the nature of human society as a grand whole104 even unconvinced whigs who quarrelled with the arguments admitted that the tories had found in the young member for newark a wellread scholar with extraordinary amplitude of mind a man who knew what reasoning meant and a man who knew how to write  the first chapter dealing with establishment drew forth premature praise from many who condemned the succeeding chapters setting out high notions as to the church from both universities he had favourable accounts from scotland they are mixed those which are most definite tend to show there is considerable soreness at which god knows i am not surprised but i have not sought nor desired it the germans on the whole approved bunsen was exuberant there was nobody he said with whom he so loved greek symphilosophein kai symphilologein people have too much to do about themselves to have time to seek truth on its own account the greater therefore the merit of the writer who forces his age to decide whether they will serve god or baal gladstone is the first man in england as to intellectual power he cried and he has heard higher tones than any one else in this land the crown prince of prussia sent him civil messages and meant to have the book translated rogers the poet wrote that his mother was descended from stout nonconformists that his father was perverted to his mothers heresies and that therefore he himself could not be zealous in the cause but however that might be of this mr gladstone might be very sure that he would love and admire the author of the book as much as ever the duke of newcastle expected much satisfaction meanwhile declared it to be a national duty to provide churches and pastors parliament should vote even millions and millions then dissent would uncommonly soon disappear and a blessing would fall upon the land dr arnold told his friends how much he admired the spirit of the book throughout how he liked the substance of half of it how erroneous he thought the other half wordsworth pronounced it worthy of all attention doubted whether the author had not gone too far about apostolical descent but then like the sage that he was the poet admitted that he must know a great deal more ecclesiastical history be better read in the fathers and read the book itself over again before he could feel any right to criticise105                              its reception  his political leaders had as yet not spoken a word on february 9th mr gladstone dined at sir robert peels not a word from him stanley or graham yet even to acknowledge my poor book but no change in manner certainly none in peel or graham monckton milnes had been to drayton and told how the great man there had asked impatiently why anybody with so fine a career before him should go out of his way to write books sir robert peel says mr gladstone who was a religious man was wholly antichurch and unclerical and largely undogmatic i feel that sir r peel must have been quite perplexed in his treatment of me after the publication of the book partly through his own fault for by habit and education he was quite incapable of comprehending the movement in the church the strength it would reach and the exigencies it would entail lord derby i think early began to escape from the erastian yoke which weighed upon peel lord aberdeen was i should say altogether enlightened in regard to it and had cast it off so that he obtained from some the sobriquet during his ministry of the presbyterian puseyite even mr gladstones best friends trembled for the effect of his ecclesiastical zeal upon his powers of political usefulness and to the same effect was the general talk of the town the common suspicion that the writer was doing the work of the hated puseyites grew darker and spread further then in april came macaulays article in the edinburgh setting out with his own incomparable directness pungency and effect all the arguments on the side of that popular antagonism which was rooted far less in specific reasoning than in a general antisacerdotal instinct that lies deep in the hearts of englishmen john sterling called the famous article the assault of an equipped and practised sophist against a crude young platonist who happens by accident to have been taught the hard and broken dialect of aristotle rather than the deep continuous and musical flow of his true and ultimate master author and critic exchanged magnanimous letters worthy of two great and honourable men106 not the least wonderful thing about macaulays review is that he should not have seen how many of his own most trenchant considerations told no more strongly against mr gladstones theory than they told against that whig theory of establishment which at the end of his article he himself tried to set up in its place  praise indeed came and praise that no good man could have treated with indifference from men like keble and it came from other quarters whence it was perhaps not quite so welcome and not much more dangerous he heard march 19 that the duke of sussex at lord durhams had been strongly condemning the book and by an odd contrast just after as he was standing in conversation with george sinclair oconnell with evident purpose came up and began to thank him for a most valuable work for the doctrine of the authority of the church and infallibility in essentialsa great approximation to the church of romean excellent sign in one who if he lived etc etc it did not go far enough for the roman catholic archbishop of tuan but dr murray the archbishop of dublin was delighted with it he termed it an honest book while as to the charges against romanism mr gladstone was misinformed i merely said i was very glad to approximate to any one on the ground of truth ie rejoiced when truth immediately wrought out in whatever degree its own legitimate result of unity oconnell said he claimed half of me count montalembert came to me today march 23rd and sat long for the purpose of ingenuously and kindly impugning certain statements in my book viz 1 that the peculiar tendency of the policy of romanism before the reformation went to limit in the mass of men intellectual exercise upon religion 2 that the doctrine of purgatory adjourned until after death more or less the idea and practice of the practical work of religion 3 that the roman catholic church restricts the reading of the scriptures by the christian people he spoke of the evils i contended we had a balance of good and that the idea of duty in individuals was more developed here than in pure roman catholic countries                            the book too late  all was of no avail scarcely had my work issued from the press wrote mr gladstone thirty years later when i became aware that there was no party no section of a party no individual person probably in the house of commons who was prepared to act upon it i found myself the last man on a sinking ship exclusive support to the established religion of the country had been the rule but when i bade it live it was just about to die it was really a quickened not a deadened conscience in the country that insisted on enlarging the circle of state support107 the result was not wholly unexpected for in the summer of 1838 while actually writing the book he records that he told pusey for himself alone i thought my own church and state principles within one stage of being hopeless as regards success in this generation  another set of fragmentary notes composed in 1894 and headed some of my errors contains a further passage that points in a significant direction       oxford had not taught me nor had any other place or person the      value of liberty as an essential condition of excellence in human      things true oxford had supplied me with the means of applying a      remedy to this mischief for she had undoubtedly infused into my      mind the love of truth as a dominant and supreme motive of conduct      but this it took long to develop into its proper place and      function it may perhaps be thought that among these errors i      ought to record the publication in 1838 of my first work the      state in its relation with the church undoubtedly that work was      written in total disregard or rather ignorance of the conditions      under which alone political action was possible in matters of      religion it involved me personally in a good deal of      embarrassment in the sanguine fervour of youth having now      learned something about the nature of the church and its office      and noting the many symptoms of revival and reform within her      borders i dreamed that she was capable of recovering lost ground      and of bringing back the nation to unity in her communion a      notable projection from the ivory gate         sed falsa ad coelum mittunt insomnia manes108       from these points of view the effort seems contemptible but i      think that there is more to be said the land was overspread with a      thick curtain of prejudice the foundations of the historic church      of england except in the minds of a few divines were obscured      the evangelical movement with all its virtues and merits had the      vice of individualising religion in degree perhaps unexampled and      of rendering the language of holy scripture about mount sion and      the kingdom of heaven little better than a jargon to meet the      demands of the coming time it was a matter of vital necessity to      cut a way through all this darkness to a clearer and more solid      position immense progress has been made in that direction during      my lifetime and i am inclined to hope that my book imparted a      certain amount of stimulus to the public mind and made some small      contribution to the needful process in its earliest stage  in the early pages of this very book mr gladstone says that the union of church and state is to the church of secondary though great importance her foundations are on the holy hills and her condition would be no pitiable one should she once more occupy the position that she held before the reign of constantine109 faint echo of the unforgotten lines in which dante cries out to constantine what woes his fatal dower to the papacy had brought down on religion and mankind110 in these sentences lay a germ that events were speedily to draw towards maturity a foreshadowing of the supreme principle that neither oxford nor any other place had yet taught him the value of liberty as an essential condition of excellence in human things                        writes church principles  this revelation only turned his zeal for religion as the paramount issue of the time and of all times into another channel feeling the overwhelming strength of the tide that was running against his view of what he counted vital aspects of the church as a national institution he next flew to the new task of working out the doctrinal mysteries that this institution embodied and with mr gladstone to work out a thing in his own mind always meant to expound and to enforce for the minds of others his pen was to him at once as sword and as buckler and while the book on church and state though exciting lively interest was evidently destined to make no converts in theory and to be pretty promptly cast aside in practice he soon set about a second work on church principles it is true that with the tenacious instinct of a born controversialist he still gave a good deal of time to constructing buttresses for the weaker places that had been discovered by enemies or by himself in the earlier edifice and in 1841 he published a revised version of church and state111 but ecclesiastical discussion was by then taking a new shape and the fourth edition fell flat of church principles we may say that it was stillborn lockhart said of it that though a hazy writer gladstone showed himself a considerable divine and it was a pity that he had entered parliament instead of taking orders the divinity however did not attract the public are never very willing to listen to a political layman discussing the arcana of theology and least of all were they inclined to listen to him about the newfound arcana of anglocatholic theology as macaulay said this time it was a theological treatise not an essay upon important questions of government and the intrepid reviewer rightly sought a more fitting subject for his magicians gifts in the dramatists of the restoration newman said of it gladstones book is not open to the objections i feared it is doctrinaire and i think somewhat selfconfident but it will do good                                      iii  a few sentences more will set before us the earliest of his transitions and its gradual dates he is writing about the first election at newark       it was a curious piece of experience to a youth in his twentythird      year young of his age who had seen little or nothing of the      world who resigned himself to politics but whose desire had been      for the ministry of god the remains of this desire operated      unfortunately they made me tend to glorify in an extravagant      manner and degree not only the religious character of the state      which in reality stood low but also the religious mission of the      conservative party there was in my eyes a certain element of      antichrist in the reform act and that act was cordially hated      though the leaders soon perceived that there would be no step      backward it was only under the second government of sir robert      peel that i learned how impotent and barren was the conservative      office for the church though that government was formed of men      able upright and extremely welldisposed it was well for me that      the unfolding destiny carried me off in a considerable degree from      political ecclesiasticism of which i should at that time have made      a sad mess providence directed that my mind should find its food      in other pastures than those in which my youthfulness would have      loved to seek it i went beyond the general views of the tory party      in state churchism  it was my opinion that as to religions      other than those of the state the state should tolerate only and      not pay so i was against salaries for prison chaplains not of the      church and i applied a logic plaster to all difficulties so      that macaulay  was justified in treating me as belonging to the      ultra section of the tories had he limited himself to      ecclesiastical questions  in 1840 when he received mannings imprimatur for church principles he notes how hard the time and circumstances were in which he had to steer his little bark but the polestar is clear reflection shows me that a political position is mainly valuable as instrumental for the good of the church and under this rule every question becomes one of detail only by 1842 reflection had taken him a step further       i now approach the mezzo del cammin my years glide away it is      time to look forward to the close and i do look forward my life       has two prospective objects for which i hope the performance      of my present public duties may if not qualify yet extrinsically      enable me one the adjustment of certain relations of the church      to the state not that i think the action of the latter can be      harmonised to the laws of the former we have passed the point at      which that was possible but it would be much if the state would      honestly aim at enabling the church to develop her own intrinsic      means to this i look the second is unfolding the catholic system      within her in some establishment or machinery looking both towards      the higher life and towards the external warfare against ignorance      and depravity                            internal conflict  in the autumn of 1843 mr gladstone explains to his father the relative positions of secular and church affairs in his mind and this is only a few months after what to most men is the absorbing moment of accession to cabinet and its responsibilities i contemplate secular affairs he says chiefly as a means of being useful in church affairs though i likewise think it right and prudent not to meddle in church matters for any small reason i am not making known anything new to you these were the sentiments with which i entered public life and although i do not at all repent of having entered it and am not disappointed in the character of the employments it affords certainly the experience of them in no way and at no time has weakened my original impressions at the end of 1843 he reached what looked like a final stage       of public life i certainly must say every year shows me more and      more that the idea of christian politics cannot be realised in the      state according to its present conditions of existence for      purposes sufficient i believe but partial and finite i am more      than content to be where i am but the perfect freedom of the new      covenant can only it seems to me be breathed in other air and      the day may come when god may grant to me the application of this      conviction to myself  footnotes  98 hannas life of chalmers iv pp 3746  99 ovid met i 5chaos

we can but an elevated and lofty destinygladstone112   it is the business of biography to depict a physiognomy and not to analyse a type in our case there is all the more reason to think of this because type hardly applies to a figure like gladstones without any near or distant parallel and composed of so many curious dualisms and unforeseen affinities truly was it said of fénelon that half of him would be a great man and would stand out more clearly as a great man than does the whole because it would be simpler so of mr gladstone we are dazzled by the endless versatility of his mind and interests as man of action scholar and controversial athlete as legislator administrator leader of the people as the strongest of his time in the main branches of executive force strongest in persuasive force supreme in the exacting details of national finance master of the parliamentary arts yet always living in the noble visions of the moral and spiritual idealist this opulence vivacity profusion and the promise of it all in these days of early prime made an awakening impression even on his foremost contemporaries the impression might have been easier to reproduce if he had been less infinitely mobile i cannot explain my own foundation fénelon said it escapes me it seems to change every hour how are we to seek an answer to the same question in the history of mr gladstone                                      ii                              internal conflict  his physical vitalityhis faculties of free energy endurance elasticitywas a superb endowment to begin with we may often ask for ourselves and others how many of a mans days does he really live however men may judge the fruit it bore mr gladstone lived in vigorous activity every day through all his years time showed that he was born with a frame of steel though unlike some men of heroic strengthnapoleon for examplehe often knew fatigue and weariness yet his organs never failed to answer the call of an intense and persistent will as we have already seen in early manhood his eyes gave him much trouble and he both learned by heart and composed a good deal of verse by way of sparing them he was a great walker and at this time he was a sportsman as his diary has shown my object in shooting ill as i do it is the invigorating and cheering exercise which does so much for health 1842 one day this year sept 13 42 while out shooting the second barrel of a gun went off while he was reloading shattering the forefinger of his left hand the remains of the finger the surgeons removed i have hardly ever in my life he says had to endure serious bodily pain and this was short in 1845 he notes a hard day what a mercy that my strength in appearance not remarkable so little fails me in the autumn of 1853 he was able to record eight or nine days of bed illness the longest since i had the scarlet fever at nine or ten years old it was the same all through his bodily strength was in fact to prove extraordinary and was no secondary element in the long and strenuous course now opening before him  not second to vigour of physical organisationperhaps if we only knew all the secrets of mind and matter even connected with this vigourwas strength and steadfastness of will character as has been often repeated is completely fashioned will and this superlative requirement so indispensable for every man of action in whatever walk and on whatever scale was eminently mr gladstones from force of will with all its roots in habit example conviction purpose sprang his leading and most effective qualities he was never very ready to talk about himself but when asked what he regarded as his master secret he always said concentration slackness of mind vacuity of mind the wheels of the mind revolving without biting the rails of the subject were insupportable such habits were of the family of faintheartedness which he abhorred steady practice of instant fixed effectual attention was the key alike to his rapidity of apprehension and to his powerful memory in the orators temperament exertion is often followed by a reaction that looks like indolence this was never so with him by instinct by nature by constitution he was a man of action in all the highest senses of a phrase too narrowly applied and too narrowly construed the currents of daimonic energy seemed never to stop the vivid susceptibility to impressions never to grow dull he was an idealist yet always applying ideals to their purposes in act toil was his native element and though he found himself possessed of many inborn gifts he was never visited by the dream so fatal to many a wellladen argosy that genius alone does all there was nobody like him when it came to difficult business for bending his whole strength to it like a mighty archer stringing a stiff bow                       force of will and power or toil  sir james graham said of him in these years that gladstone could do in four hours what it took any other man sixteen to do and he worked sixteen hours a day when i came to know him long years after he told me that he thought when in office in the times that our story is now approaching fourteen hours were a common tale nor was it mere mechanic industry it was hard labour exact strenuous engrossing rigorous no hohenzollern soldier held with sterner regularity to the duties of his post needless to add that he had a fierce regard for the sanctity of time although in the calling of the politician it is harder than in any other to be quite sure when time is well spent and when wasted his supreme economy here like many other virtues carried its own defect and coupled with his constitutional eagerness and his quick susceptibility it led at all periods of his life to some hurry the tumult of business he says one year in his diary follows and whirls me day and night he speaks once in 1844 of a day restless as the sea there were many such that does not mean and has nothing to do with proud precipitance of soul nor haste in forming pregnant resolves here he was deliberate enough and in the ordinary conduct of life even minor things were objects of scrutiny and calculation far beyond the habit of most men for he was lowlander as well as highlander but a vast percentage of his letters from boyhood onwards contain apologies for haste more than once when his course was nearly run he spoke of his life having been passed in unintermittent hurry just as mill said he had never been in a hurry in his life until he entered parliament and then he had never been out of a hurry  it was no contradiction that deep and constant in him along with this vehement turn for action was a craving for tranquil collection of himself that seemed almost monastic to mrs gladstone he wrote a couple of years after their marriage dec 13 1841       you interpret so indulgently what i mean about the necessity of      quiescence at home during the parliamentary session that i need      not say much and yet i think my doctrine must seem so strange      that i wish again and again to state how entirely it is different      from anything like disparagement of george for example it is      always relief and always delight to see and to be with you and you      would i am sure be glad to know how near mary lady lyttelton      comes as compared with others to you as respects what i can hardly      describe in few words my mental rest when she is present but      there is no man however near to me with whom i am fit to be      habitually when hard worked i have told you how reluctant i have      always found myself to detail to my father on coming home when i      lived with him what had been going on in the house of commons      setting a tired mind to work is like making a man run up and down      stairs when his limbs are weary  if he sometimes recalls a fiery hero of the iliad at other times he is the grave and studious benedictine but whether in quietude or movement always a man with a purpose and never the loiterer or lounger never apathetic never a sufferer from that worst malady of the human soulfrom cheerlessness and cold  we need not take him through a phrenological table of elements powers faculties leanings and propensities very early as we shall soon see mr gladstone gave marked evidence of that sovereign quality of courage which became one of the most signal of all his traits he used to say that he had known three men in his time possessing in a supreme degree the virtue of parliamentary couragepeel lord john russell and disraeli to some other contemporaries for whom courage might be claimed he stoutly denied it nobody ever dreamed of denying it to him whether parliamentary courage or any other in either its active or its passive shape either in daring or in fortitude he had even the courage to be prudent just as he knew when it was prudent to be bold he applied in public things the spenserian line be bold be bold and everywhere be bold but neither did he forget the iron door with its admonition be not too bold the great condé when complimented on his courage always said that he took good care never to call upon it unless the occasion were absolutely necessary no more did mr gladstone go out of his way to summon courage for its own sake but only when spurred by duty then he knew no faltering capable of much circumspection yet soon he became known for a man of lion heart                         measure of his gifts  nature had bestowed on him many towering gifts whether humour was among them his friends were wont to dispute that he had a gaiety and sympathetic alacrity of mind that was near of kin to humour nobody who knew him would deny of playfulness his speeches give a thousand proofs of drollery and fun he had a ready sense though it was not always easy to be quite sure beforehand what sort of jest would hit or miss for irony save in its lighter forms as weapon in debate he had no marked taste or turn but he delighted in good comedy and he reproached me severely for caring less than one ought to do for the merry wives of windsor had he imagination in its high literary and poetic form he rose to few conspicuous flightssuch for example as burkes descent of hyder ali upon the carnaticin vast and fantastic conceptions such as arose from time to time in the brain of napoleon he had no part or lot but in force of moral and political imagination in bold excursive range in the faculty of illuminating practical and objective calculations with lofty ideals of the strength of states the happiness of peoples the whole structure of good government he has had no superior among the rulers of england his very ardour of temperament gave him imagination he felt as if everybody who listened to him in a great audience was equally fired with his own energy of sympathy indignation conviction and was transported by the same emotion that thrilled through himself all this however did not fully manifest itself at this time nor for some years to come  strength of will found scope for exercise where some would not discover the need for it in native capacity for righteous anger he abounded the flame soon kindled and it was no fire of straw but it did not master him mrs gladstone once said to me 1891 that whoever writes his life must remember that he had two sidesone impetuous impatient irrestrainable the other all selfcontrol able to dismiss all but the great central aim able to put aside what is weakening or disturbing that he achieved this selfmastery and had succeeded in the struggle ever since he was three or four and twenty first by the natural power of his character and second by incessant wrestling in prayerprayer that had been abundantly answered  problems of compromise are of the essence of the parliamentary and cabinet system and for some years at any rate he was more than a little restive when they confronted him though in the time to come he had abundant difference with colleagues he had all the virtues needed for political cooperation as cobden bright and mill had them nor did he ever mistake for courage or independence the unhappy preference for having a party or an opinion exclusively to ones self what is wanted above all things he said in the business of joint counsel is the faculty of making many one of throwing the mind into the common stock113 this was a favourite phrase with him for that power of working with other people without which a man would do well to stand aside from public affairs he used to say that of all the men he had ever known sir george grey had most of this capacity for throwing his mind into joint stock the demands of joint stock he never took to mean the quenching of the duty in a man to have a mind of his own he was always amused by the recollection of somebody at oxforda regius professor of divinity i am sorry to saywho was accustomed to define taste as a faculty of coinciding with the opinion of the majority  hard as he strove for a broad basis in general theory and high abstract principle yet always aiming at practical ends he kept in sight the opportune nobody knew better the truth so disastrously neglected by politicians who otherwise would be the very salt of the earth that not all questions are for all times for my part mr gladstone said i have not been so happy at any time of my life as to be able sufficiently to adjust the proper conditions of handling any difficult question until the question itself was at the door114 he could not readily apply himself to topics outside of those with which he chanced at the moment to be engrossedcan you not wait is it necessary to consider now that was part of his concentration nor did he fly at a piece of business deal with it then let it fall from his grasp it became part of him if circumstances brought it again into his vicinity they found him instantly ready with a prompt continuity that is no small element of power in public business  how little elastic and selfconfident at heart he was in some of his moods in early manhood we discern in the curious language of a letter to his brotherinlaw lyttelton in 1840       it is my nature to lean not so much on the applause as upon the      assent of others to a degree which perhaps i do not show from that      sense of weakness and utter inadequacy to my work which never      ceases to attend me while i am engaged upon these subjects i      wish you knew the state of total impotence to which i should be      reduced if there were no echo to the accents of my own voice i go      through my labour such as it is not by a genuine elasticity of      spirit but by a plodding movement only just able to contend with      inert force and in the midst of a life which indeed has little      claim to be called active yet is broken this way and that into a      thousand small details certainly unfavourable to calm and      continuity of thought  here we have a glimpse of a singular vein peculiarly rare in ardent genius at thirty but disclosing its traces in mr gladstone even in his ripest years                                  as orator  was this the instinct of the orator for it was in the noble arts of oratory that nature had been most lavish and in them he rose to be consummate the sympathy and assent of which he speaks are a part of oratorical inspiration and even if such sympathy be but superficial the highest efforts of oratorical genius take it for granted the work of the orator he once wrote from its very inception is inextricably mixed up with practice it is cast in the mould offered to him by the mind of his hearers it is an influence principally received from his audience so to speak in vapour which he pours back upon them in a flood the sympathy and concurrence of his time is with his own mind joint parent of the work he cannot follow nor frame ideals his choice is to be what his age will have him what it requires in order to be moved by him or else not to be at all115  among mr gladstones physical advantages for bearing the orators sceptre were a voice of singular fulness depth and variety of tone a falcons eye with strange imperious flash features mobile expressive and with lively play a great actors command of gesture bold sweeping natural unforced without exaggeration or a trace of melodrama his pose was easy alert erect to these endowments of external mien was joined the gift and the glory of words they were not sought they came whether the task were reasoning or exposition or expostulation the copious springs never failed nature had thus done much for him but he superadded ungrudging labour later in life he proffered to a correspondent a set of suggestions on the art of speaking       1 study plainness of language always preferring the simpler word      2 shortness of sentences 3 distinctness of articulation 4 test      and question your own arguments beforehand not waiting for critic      or opponent 5 seek a thorough digestion of and familiarity with      your subject and rely mainly on these to prompt the proper words      6 remember that if you are to sway an audience you must besides      thinking out your matter watch them all alongmarch 20 1875  the first and second of these rules hardly fit his own style yet he had seriously studied from early days the devices of a speakers training i find copied into a little notebook many of the precepts and maxims of quintilian on the making of an orator so too from ciceros de oratore including the words put into the mouth of catulus that nobody can attain the glory of eloquence without the height of zeal and toil and knowledge116 zeal and toil and knowledge working with an inborn faculty of powerful expressionhere was the double clue he never forgot the ciceronian truth that the orator is not made by the tongue alone as if it were a sword sharpened on a whetstone or hammered on an anvil but by having a mind well filled with a free supply of high and various matter117 his eloquence was inextricably mixed up with practice an old whig listening to one of his budget speeches said with a touch of bitterness ah oxford on the surface but liverpool below no bad combination he once had a lesson from sir robert peel mr gladstone being about to reply in debate turned to his chief and said shall i be short and concise no was the answer be long and diffuse it is all important in the house of commons to state your case in many different ways so as to produce an effect on men of many ways of thinking  in discussing macaulay sir francis baring an able and unbiassed judge advised a junior 1860 about patterns for the parliamentary aspirantgladstone is to my mind a much better model for speaking i mean he is happier in joining great eloquence and selection of words and rhetoric if you will with a style not a bit above debate it does not smell of the oil of course there has been plenty of labour and that not of today but during a whole life nothing could be truer certainly for more than the first forty years of his parliamentary existence he cultivated a style not above debate though it was debate of incomparable force and brilliance when simpletons say as if this were to dispose of every higher claim for him that he worked all his wonders by his gifts as orator do they ever think what power over such an assembly as the house of commons signifies hereand it was not until he had been for thirty years and more in parliament that he betook himself largely to the efforts of the platformhere he was addressing men of the world some of them the flower of english education and intellectual accomplishment experts in all the high practical lines of life bankers merchants lawyers captains of industry in every walk men trained in the wide experience and high responsibilities of public office lynxeyed rivals and opponents is this the scene or were these the men for the triumphs of the barren rhetorician and the sophist whose words have no true relation to the facts where could general mental strength be better tested as a matter of history most of those who have held the place of leading minister in the house of commons have hardly been orators at all any more than washington and jefferson were orators mr gladstone conquered the house because he was saturated with a subject and its arguments because he could state and enforce his case because he plainly believed every word he said and earnestly wished to press the same belief into the minds of his hearers finally because he was from the first an eager and a powerful athlete the man who listening to his adversary asks of his contention is this true is a lost debater just as a soldier would be lost who on the day of battle should bethink him that the enemys cause might after all perhaps be just the debater does not ask is this true he asks what is the answer to this how can i most surely floor him lord coleridge inquired of mr gladstone whether he ever felt nervous in public speaking in opening a subject often mr gladstone answered in reply never yet with this inborn readiness for combat nobody was less addicted to aggression or provocation it was with him a salutary maxim that if you have unpalatable opinions to declare you should not make them more unpalatable by the way of expressing them in his earlier years he did not often speak with passion this morning a famous divine once said i preached a sermon all flames mr gladstone sometimes made speeches of that cast but not frequently i think until the seventies meanwhile he impressed the house by his nobility his sincerity his simplicity for there is plenty of evidence besides mr gladstones case that simplicity of character is no hindrance to subtlety of intellect  contemporaries in these opening years describe his parliamentary manners as much in his favour his countenance they say is mild and pleasant and has a high intellectual expression his eyes are clear and quick his eyebrows are dark and rather prominent there is not a dandy in the house but envies his fine head of jetblack hair mr gladstones gesture is varied but not violent when he rises he generally puts both his hands behind his back and having there suffered them to embrace each other for a short time he unclasps them and allows them to drop on either side they are not permitted to remain long in that locality before you see them again closed together and hanging down before him118 other critics say that his air and voice are too abstract and you catch the sound as though he were communing with himself it is as though you saw a bright picture through a filmy veil his countenance without being strictly handsome is highly intellectual his pale complexion slightly tinged with olive and dark hair cut rather close to his head with an eye of remarkable depth still more impress you with the abstracted character of his disposition the expression of his face would be sombre were it not for the striking eye which has a remarkable fascination his triumphs as a debater are achieved not by the aid of the passions as with sir james graham or with mr sheil not of prejudice and fallacy as with robert peel not with imagination and high seductive colouring as with mr macaulay butof pure reason he prevails by that subdued earnestness which results from deep religious feelings and is not fitted for the more usual and more stormy functions of a public speaker119                                    iii                            action his field  we are not to think of him as prophet seer poet founder of a system or great born man of letters like gibbon macaulay carlyle of these characters he was none though he had warmth and height of genius to comprehend the value of them all andwhat was more curioushis oratory and his acts touched them and their work in such a way that men were always tempted to apply to him standards that belonged to them his calling was a different one and he was wont to appraise it lower his field lay in working the institutions of his country whether he would have played a part as splendid in the position of a high ruling ecclesiastic if the times had allowed such a personage we cannot tell perhaps he had not imperious immobility enough nor whether he would have made a judge of the loftier order perhaps his mind was too addicted to subtle distinctions and not likely to give a solid adherence to broad principles of law a superb advocate an evangelist as irresistible as wesley or as whitefield what matters it all agree that more magnificent power of mind was never placed at the service of the british senate  his letters to his father from 1832 onwards show all the interest of a keen young member in his calling though they contain few anecdotes or tales or vivid social traits of political gossip he admits to his father 1843 you always find me barren enough what comes out in all his letters to his kinsfolk is his unbounded willingness to take trouble in order to spare others even in prolonged and intricate money transactions of which we shall see something latertransactions of all others the most apt to produce irritationnot an accent of impatience or dispute escapes him though the guarded firmness of his language marks the steadfast selfcontrol we may say of mr gladstone that nobody ever had less to repent of from that worst waste in human life that comes of unkindness kingsley noticed with some wonder how he never allowed the magnitude and multiplicity of his labours to excuse him from any of the minor charities and courtesies of life  active hatred of cruelty injustice and oppression is perhaps the main difference between a good man and a bad one and here mr gladstone was sublime yet though anger burned fiercely in him over wrong nobody was more chary of passing moral censures what he said of himself in 1842 when he was three and thirty held good to the end       nothing grows upon me so much with lengthening life as the sense of      the difficulties or rather the impossibilities with which we are      beset whenever we attempt to take to ourselves the functions of the      eternal judge except in reference to ourselves where judgment is      committed to us and to form any accurate idea of relative merit      and demerit good and evil in actions the shades of the rainbow      are not so nice and the sands of the seashore are not such a      multitude as are all the subtle shifting blending forms of      thought and of circumstances that go to determine the character of      us and of our acts but there is one that seeth plainly and judgeth      righteously                                 his silences  this was only one side of mr gladstones many silences to talk of the silences of the most copious and incessant speaker and writer of his time may seem a paradox yet in this fluent orator this untiring penman this eager and most sociable talker at the dinnertable or on friendly walks was a singular faculty of selfcontainment and reserve quick to notice as he was and acutely observant of much that might have been expected to escape him he still kept as much locked up within as he so liberally gave out bulwer lytton was at one time as is well known addicted to the study of mediæval magic occult power and the conjunctions of the heavenly bodies and among other figures he one day amused himself by casting the horoscope of mr gladstone 1860 to him the astrologers son sent it like most of such things the horoscope has one or two ingenious hits and a dozen nonsensical misses but one curious sentence declares mr gladstone to be at heart a solitary man here i have often thought that the stars knew what they were about  whether mr gladstone ever became what is called a good judge of men it would be hard to say such characters are not common even among parliamentary leaders they do not always care to take the trouble the name is too commonly reserved for those who think dubiously or downright ill of their fellowcreatures those who are accustomed to make most of knowing men do their best to convince us that men are hardly worth knowing this was not mr gladstones way like lord aberdeen he had a marked habit of believing people it was part of his simplicity his life was a curious union of ceaseless contention and inviolable charitya true charity having nothing in common with a lazy spirit of unconcern he knew men well enough at least to have found out that none gains such ascendency over them as he who appeals to what is the nobler part in human nature nestors of the whigs used to wonder how so much imagination invention courage knowledge diligenceall the qualities that seem to make an orator and a statesmancould be neutralised by the want of a sound overruling judgment they said that gladstones faculties were like an army without a general or a jury without guidance from the bench120 yet when the time came this army without a general won the crowning victories of the epoch and for twenty years the chief findings of this jury without a judge proved to be the verdicts of the nation  it is not easy for those less extraordinarily constituted to realise the vigour of soul that maintained an inner life in all its absorbing exaltation day after day year after year decade after decade amid the everswelling rush of urgent secular affairs immersed in active responsibility for momentous secular things he never lost the breath of what was to him a diviner aether habitually he strove for the lofty uplands where political and moral ideas meet even in those days he struck all who came into contact with him by a goodness and elevation that matched the activity and power of his mind his political career might seem doubtful but there was no doubt about the man one of the most interesting of his notes about his own growth is this       there was a singular slowness in the development of my mind so far      as regarded its opening into the ordinary aptitudes of the man of      the world for years and years well into advanced middle life i      seem to have considered actions simply as they were in themselves      and did not take into account the way in which they would be taken      and understood by others i did not perceive that their natural or      probable effect upon minds other than my own formed part of the      considerations determining the propriety of each act in itself and      not unfrequently at any rate in public life supplied the decisive      criterion to determine what ought and what ought not to be done in      truth the dominant tendencies of my mind were those of a recluse      and i might in most respects with ease have accommodated myself      to the education of the cloister all the mental apparatus      requisite to constitute the public man had to be purchased by a      slow experience and inserted piecemeal into the composition of my      character  lord malmesbury describes himself in 1844 as curious to see mr gladstone for he is a man much spoken of as one who will come to the front he was greatly disappointed at his personal appearance which is that of a roman catholic ecclesiastic but he is very agreeable121 few men can have been more perplexed and few perhaps more perplexing as the social drama of the capital was in time unfolded to his gaze there he beheld the glitter of rank and station and palaces and men and women bearing famous names worlds within worlds high diplomatic figures the partisan leaders the constant stream of agitated rumours about weighty affairs in england and europe the keen play of ambition passions interests under easy manners and fugitive pleasantry gross and sordid aims as king hudson was soon to find out masked by exterior refinement so much kindness with a free spice of criticism and touches of illnature so much of the governing force of england still gathered into a few great houses exclusive and full of pride and yet after the astounding discovery that in spite of the deluge of the reform bill they were still alive as the directing class always so open to political genius if likely to climb and help them to climb into political power these were the last high days of the undisputed sway of territorial aristocracy in england the artificial scene was gay and captivating but much in it was well fitted to make serious people wonder queen victoria was assuredly not of the harsh fibre of the misanthropist in molières fine comedy yet she once said a strange and deep thing to an archbishop as i get older she said i cannot understand the world i cannot comprehend its littlenesses when i look at the frivolities and littlenesses it seems to me as if they were all a little mad122                             the social drama  this was the stage on which mr gladstone with the dominant tendencies of a recluse and a mind that might easily have been accommodated to the cloister came to play his partin which he was by a slow experience to insert piecemeal the mental apparatus proper to the character of the public man yet it was not among the booths and merchandise and hubbub of vanity fair it was among strata in the community but little recognised as yet that he was to find the field and the sources of his highest power his view of the secular world was never fastidious or unmanly looking back upon his long experience of it he wrote 1894       that political life considered as a profession has great dangers      for the inner and true life of the human being is too obvious it      has however some redeeming qualities in the first place i have      never known and can hardly conceive a finer school of temper than      the house of commons a lapse in this respect is on the instant an      offence a jar a wound to every member of the assembly and it      brings its own punishment on the instant like the sins of the jews      under the old dispensation again i think the imperious nature of      the subjects their weight and force demanding the entire strength      of a man and all his faculties leave him no residue at least for      the time to apply to selfregard no more than there is for a      swimmer swimming for his life he must too in retrospect feel      himself to be so very small in comparison with the themes and the      interests of which he has to treat it is a further advantage if      his occupation be not mere debate but debate ending in work for      in this way whether the work be legislative or administrative it      is continually tested by results and he is enabled to strip away      his extravagant anticipations his fallacious conceptions to      perceive his mistakes and to reduce his estimates to the reality      no politician has any excuse for being vain  like the stoic emperor mr gladstone had in his heart the feeling that the man is a runaway who deserts the exercise of civil reason                                      iv                           religion the mainspring  all his activities were in his own mind one this we can hardly repeat too often is the fundamental fact of mr gladstones history political life was only part of his religious life it was religion that prompted his literary life it was religious motive that through a thousand avenues and channels stirred him and guided him in his whole conception of active social duty including one pitiful field of which i may say something later the liberalism of the continent at this epoch was in its essence either hostile to christianity or else it was indifferent and when men like lamennais tried to play at the same time the double part of tribune of the people and catholic theocrat they failed the old world of pope and priest and socialist and red cap of liberty fought on as before in england too the most that can be said of the leading breed of the political reformers of that half century with one or two most notable exceptions is that they were theists and not all of them were even so much as theists123 if liberalism had continued to run in the grooves cut by bentham james mill grote and the rest mr gladstone would never have grown to be a liberal he was not only a fervid practising christian he was a christian steeped in the fourth century steeped in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries every man of us has all the centuries in him though their operations be latent dim and very various in his case the roots were as unmistakeable as the leafage the blossom and the fruits a little later than the date with which we are now dealing may 9 1854and here the date matters little for the case was always the samehe noted what in hours of strain and crisis the bible was to him       on most occasions of very sharp pressure or trial some word of      scripture has come home to me as if borne on angels wings many      could i recollect the psalms are the great storehouse perhaps i      should put some down now for the continuance of memory is not to      be trusted 1 in the winter of 1837 psalm 128 this came in a      most singular manner but it would be a long story to tell 2 in      the oxford contest of 1847 which was very harrowing the verseo      lord god thou strength of my health thou hast covered my head in      the day of battle 3 in the gorham contest after the judgment      and though all this be come upon us yet do we not forget thee      nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant our heart is not      turned back neither our steps gone out of thy way no not when      thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons and covered us with      the shadow of death 4 on monday april 17 1853 his first      budget speech it was o turn thee then unto me and have mercy      upon me give thy strength unto thy servant and help the son of      thine handmaid last sunday crimean war budget it was not from      the psalms for the day thou shalt prepare a table before me      against them that trouble me thou hast anointed my head with oil      and my cup shall be full  in that stage at least he had shaken off none of the grip of tradition in which his book and college training had placed him his mind still had greater faith in things because aristotle or augustine said them than because they are true124 if the end of education be to teach independence of mind the socratic temper the love of pushing into unexplored areasintellectual curiosity in a wordoxford had done none of all this for him in every field of thought and life he started from the principle of authority it fitted in with his reverential instincts his temperament above all his education                       place of dante in his mind  the lifelong enthusiasm for dante should on no account in this place be left out in mr gladstone it was something very different from casual dilettantism or the accident of a scholars taste he was always alive to the grandeur of goethes words im ganzen guten wahren resolut zu leben in wholeness goodness truth strenuously to live but it was in danteactive politician and thinker as well as poetthat he found this unity of thought and coherence of life not only illuminated by a sublime imagination but directly associated with theology philosophy politics history sentiment duty here are all the elements and interests that lie about the roots of the life of a man and of the general civilisation of the world this ever memorable picture of the mind and heart of europe in the great centuries of the catholic agemaking heaven the home of the human soul presenting the natural purposes of mankind in their universality of good and evil exalted and mean piteous and hateful tragedy and farce all commingled as a living wholewas exactly fitted to the quality of a genius so rich and powerful as mr gladstones in the range of its spiritual intuitions and in its masculine grasp of all the complex truths of mortal nature so true and real a book is it he once saidsuch a record of practical humanity and of the discipline of the soul amidst its wonderful poetical intensity and imaginative power in him this meant no spurious revivalism no flimsy and fantastic affectation it was the real and energetic discovery in the vivid conception and commanding structure of dante of a light a refuge and an inspiration in the labours of the actual world you have been good enough he once wrote to an italian correspondent 1883 to call that supreme poet a solemn master for me these are not empty words the reading of dante is not merely a pleasure a tour de force or a lesson it is a vigorous discipline for the heart the intellect the whole man in the school of dante i have learned a great part of that mental provision however insignificant it may be which has served me to make the journey of human life up to the term of nearly seventythree years he once asked of an accomplished woman possessing a scholars breadth of reading what poetry she most lived with she named dante for one but what of dante the paradiso she replied ah that is right he exclaimed thats my test in the paradiso it was that he saw in beams of crystal radiance the ideal of the unity of the religious mind the love and admiration for the high unseen things of which the christian church was to him the sovereign embodiment the mediæval spirit it is true wears something of a ghostly air in the light of our new day this attempt which has been made many a time before to unify two ages did not carry men far in the second half of the nineteenth century nevertheless it were an idle dream to think that the dead hand of dantes century and all that it represented is no longer to be taken into account by those who would be governors of men meanwhile let us observe once more that the statesman who had drunk most deeply from the mediæval fountains was yet one of the supreme leaders of his own generation in a notable stage of the long transition from mediæval to modern  at oxford he records i read rousseaus social contract which had no influence upon me and the writings of burke which had a great deal yet the day came when he too was drawn by the movement of things into the flaming circle of thought feeling phrase that in romance and politics and all the ways of life europe for a century associated with the name of rousseau there was what men call rousseau in a statesman who could talk of mens common flesh and blood in connection with a franchise bill indeed one of the strangest things in mr gladstones growth and career is this unconscious raising of a partially rousseauite structure on the foundations laid by burke to whom rousseau was of all writers on the nature of man and the ordering of states the most odious and contemptible we call it strange though such amalgams of contrary ways of thinking and feeling are more common than careless observers may suppose mr gladstone was never an equalitarian but the passion for simplicity he hadsimplicity in life manners feeling conduct the relations of men to men dislike of luxury and profusion and all the fabric of artificial and factitious needs it may well be that he went no further for all this than the sermon on the mount where so many secret elements of social volcano slumber however we may choose to trace the sources and relations of mr gladstones general ideas upon the political problems of his time what he said of himself in the evening of his day was at least true of its dawn and noon i am for old customs and traditions he wrote against needless change i am for the individual as against the state i am for the family and the stable family as against the state he must have been in eager sympathy with wordsworths line taken from old spenser in these very days perilous is sweeping change all chance unsound125 finally and above all he stood firm in the old christian faith life was to him in all its aspects an application of christian teaching and example if we like to put it so he was steadfast for making politics more human and no branch of civilised life needs humanising more  here we touch the question of questions at nearly every page of mr gladstones active career the vital problem stares us in the face of the correspondence between the rule of private morals and of public is the rule one and the same for individual and for state from these early years onwards mr gladstones whole language and the moods that it reproduceshis vivid denunciations his sanguine expectations his rolling epithets his aspects and appeals and points of viewall take for granted that right and wrong depend on the same set of maxims in public life and private the puzzle will often greet us and here it is enough to glance at it in every statesmans case it arises in mr gladstones it is cardinal and fundamental                                       v                           maxims of ordered life  to say that he had drawn prizes in what is called the lottery of life would not be untrue but just as true is it that one of those very prizes was the determined conviction that life is no lottery at all but a serious business worth taking infinite pains upon to one of his sons at oxford he wrote a little paper of suggestions that are the actual description of his own lifelong habit and unbroken practice       strathconan oct 7 18721 to keep a short journal of      principal employments in each day most valuable as an accountbook      of the allprecious gift of time       2 to keep also an accountbook of receipt and expenditure and the      least troublesome way of keeping it is to keep it with care this      done in early life and carefully done creates the habit of      performing the great duty of keeping our expenditure and therefore      our desires within our means       3 read attentively and it is pleasant reading taylors essay on      money126 which if i have not done it already i will give you      it is most healthy and most useful reading       4 establish a minimum number of hours in the day for study say      seven at present and do not without reasonable cause let it be      less noting down against yourself the days of exception there      should also be a minimum number for the vacations which at oxford      are extremely long       5 there arises an important question about sundays though we      should to the best of our power avoid secular work on sundays it      does not follow that the mind should remain idle there is an      immense field of knowledge connected with religion and much of it      is of a kind that will be of use in the schools and in relation to      your general studies in these days of shallow scepticism so      widely spread it is more than ever to be desired that we should be      able to give a reason for the hope that is in us       6 as to duties directly religious such as daily prayer in the      morning and evening and daily reading of some portion of the holy      scripture or as to the holy ordinances of the gospel there is      little need i am confident to advise you one thing however i      would say that it is not difficult and it is most beneficial to      cultivate the habit of inwardly turning the thoughts to god though      but for a moment in the course or during the intervals of our      business which continually presents occasions requiring his aid      and guidance       7 turning again to ordinary duty i know no precept more wide or      more valuable than this cultivate selfhelp do not seek nor like      to be dependent upon others for what you can yourself supply and      keep down as much as you can the standard of your wants for in      this lies a great secret of manliness true wealth and      happiness as on the other hand the multiplication of our wants      makes us effeminate and slavish as well as selfish       8 in regard to money as well as to time there is a great      advantage in its methodical use especially is it wise to dedicate      a certain portion of our means to purposes of charity and religion      and this is more easily begun in youth than in after life the      greatest advantage of making a little fund of this kind is that      when we are asked to give the competition is not between self on      the one hand and charity on the other but between the different      purposes of religion and charity with one another among which we      ought to make the most careful choice it is desirable that the      fund thus devoted should not be less than onetenth of our means      and it tends to bring a blessing on the rest       9 besides giving this we should save something so as to be      before the world ie to have some preparation to meet the      accidents and unforeseen calls of life as well as its general      future  fathers are generally wont to put their better mind into counsels to their sons in this instance the counsellor was the living pattern of his own maxims his accountbooks show in full detail that he never at any time in his life devoted less than a tenth of his annual incomings to charitable and religious objects the peculiarity of all this halfmechanic ordering of a wise and virtuous individual life was that it went with a genius and power that moulded a mighty states decrees and sought the widest process of the suns                                       vi                                mental growth  once more his whole temper and spirit turned to practice his thrift of time his just and regulated thrift in money his hatred of waste were only matched by his eager and minute attention in affairs of public business he knew how to be content with small savings of hours and of material resources he was not downcast if progress were slow in watching public opinion in feeling the pulse of a cabinet in softening the heart of a colleague even when skies were gloomiest he was almost provokingly anxious to detect signs of encouragement that to others were imperceptible he was of the mind of the roman emperor hope not for the republic of plato but be content with ever so small an advance and look on even that as a gain worth having127 a commonplace but not one of the commonplaces that are always laid to heart  if faith was one clue then next to faith was growth the fundamentals of christian dogma so far as i know and am entitled to speak are the only region in which mr gladstones opinions have no history everywhere else we look upon incessant movement in views about church and state tests national schools in questions of economic and fiscal policy in relations with party in the questions of popular governmentin every one of these wide spheres of public interest he passes from crisis to crisis the dealings of church and state made the first of these marked stages in the history of his opinions and his life but it was only the beginning       i was born with smaller natural endowments than you he wrote to      his old friend sir francis doyle 1880 and i had also a narrower      early training but my life has certainly been remarkable for the      mass of continuous and searching experience it has brought me ever      since i began to pass out of boyhood i have been feeling my way      owing little to living teachers but enormously to four dead      ones128 over and above the four gospels it has been experience      which has altered my politics my toryism was accepted by me on      authority and in good faith i did my best to fight for it but if      you choose to examine my parliamentary life you will find that on      every subject as i came to deal with it practically i had to deal      with it as a liberal elected in 32 i began with slavery in 1833      and was commended by the liberal minister mr stanley i took to      colonial subjects principally and in 1837 was commended for      treating them liberally by lord russell then sir r peel carried      me into trade and before i had been six months in office i wanted      to resign because i thought his corn law reform insufficient in      ecclesiastical policy i had been a speculator but if you choose to      refer to a speech of sheils in 1844 on the dissenters chapels      bill129 you will find him describing me as predestined to be a      champion of religious equality all this seems to show that i have      changed under the teaching of experience  and much later he wrote of himself       the stock in trade of ideas with which i set out on the career of      parliamentary life was a small one i do not think the general      tendencies of my mind were even in the time of my youth illiberal      it was a great accident that threw me into the antiliberal      attitude but having taken it up i held to it with energy it was      the accident of the reform bill of 1831 for teachers or idols or      both in politics i had had mr burke and mr canning i followed      them in their dread of reform and probably caricatured them as a      raw and unskilled student caricatures his master this one idea on      which they were antiliberal became the masterkey of the      situation and absorbed into itself for the time the whole of      politics this however was not my only disadvantage i had been      educated in an extremely narrow churchmanship that of the      evangelical party this narrow churchmanship too readily embraced      the idea that the extension of representative principles which was      then the essential work of liberalism was associated with      irreligion an idea quite foreign to my older sentiment on behalf      of roman catholic emancipation autobiographic note july 22      1894                                        vii                             limitations of interest  notwithstanding his humility his willingness within a certain range to learn his profound reverence for what he took for truth he was no more ready than many far inferior men to discern a certain important rule of intellectual life that was expressed in a quaint figure by one of our old english sages he is a wonderful man said the sage that can thread a needle when he is at cudgels in a crowd and yet this is as easy as to find truth in the hurry of disputation130 the strenuous member of parliament the fervid minister fighting the clauses of his bill the disputant in cabinet when he passed from man of action to the topics of balanced thought nice scrutiny long meditation did not always succeed in getting his thread into the needles eye  as to the problems of the metaphysician mr gladstone showed little curiosity nor for abstract discussion in its highest shapefor investigation of ultimate propositionshad he any of that power of subtle and ingenious reasoning which was often so extraordinary when he came to deal with the concrete the historic and the demonstrable a still more singular limitation on the extent of his intellectual curiosity was hardly noticed at this early epoch the scientific movement which along with the growth of democracy and the growth of industrialism formed the three propelling forces of a new agewas not yet developed in all its range the astonishing discoveries in the realm of natural science and the philosophic speculations that were built upon them though quite close at hand were still to come darwins origin of species for example was not given to the world until 1859 mr gladstone watched these things vaguely and with misgiving instinct must have told him that the advance of natural explanation whether legitimately or not would be in some degree at the expense of the supernatural but from any full or serious examination of the details of the scientific movement he stood aside safe and steadfast within the citadel of tradition  he was once asked to subscribe to a memorial of tyndale the translator of the bible131 and he put his refusal upon grounds that show one source at least of his scruple about words he replies that he has been driven to a determination to renounce all subscriptions for the commemoration of ancient worthies as he finds that he cannot signify gratitude for services rendered without being understood to sanction all that they have said or done and thus becoming involved in controversy or imputation about them i am often amazed he goes on at the construction put upon my acts and words but experience has shown me that they are commonly put under the microscope and then found to contain all manner of horrors like the animalcules in thames water this microscope was far too valuable an instrument in the contentions of party ever to be put aside and the animalcules duly magnified to the frightful size required were turned into firstrate electioneering agents even without party microscopes those who feel most warmly for mr gladstones manifold services to his country may often wish that he had inscribed in letters of gold over the door of the temple of peace a certain sentence from the wise oracles of his favourite butler for the conclusion of this said the bishop let me just take notice of the danger of overgreat refinements of going beside or beyond the plain obvious first appearances of things upon the subject of morals and religion132 nor would he have said less of politics it is idle to ignore in mr gladstones style an overrefining in words an excess of qualifying propositions a disproportionate impressiveness in verbal shadings without real difference nothing irritated opponents more they insisted on taking literary sin for moral obliquity and because men could not understand they assumed that he wished to mislead yet if we remember how carelessness in words how the slovenly combination under the same name of things entirely different how the taking for granted as matter of positive proof what is at the most only possible or barely probablewhen we think of all the mischief and folly that has been wrought in the world by loose habits of mind that are almost as much the master vice of the head as selfishness is the master vice of the heart men may forgive mr gladstone for what passed as sophistry and subtlety but was in truth scruple of conscience in that region where lack of scruple half spoils the world                             verbal refining  this peculiar trait was connected with another that sometimes amused friends but always exasperated foes among the papers is a letter from an illustrious man to mr gladstonewickedly no better dated by the writer than saturday and no better docketed by the receiver than t b macaulay march 1showing that mr gladstone was just as energetic say in some year between 1835 and 1850 in defending the entire consistency between a certain speech of the dubious date and a speech in 1833 as he ever afterwards showed himself in the same too familiar process in later times he described himself as a sort of purist in what touches the consistency of statesmen change of opinion he said in those to whose judgment the public looks more or less to assist its own is an evil to the country although a much smaller evil than their persistence in a course which they know to be wrong it is not always to be blamed but it is always to be watched with vigilance always to be challenged and put upon its trial133 to this challenge in his own caseand no man of his day was half so often put upon his trial for inconsistencyhe was always most easily provoked to make a vehement reply in that process mr gladstones natural habit of resort to qualifying words and his skill in showing that a new attitude could be reconciled by strict reasoning with the logical contents of old dicta gave him wonderful advantage his adversary as he strode confidently along the smooth grass suddenly found himself treading on a serpent he had overlooked a condition a proviso a word of hypothesis or contingency that sprang from its ambush and brought his triumph to naught on the spot if mr gladstone had only taken as much trouble that his hearers should understand exactly what it was that he meant as he took trouble afterwards to show that his meaning had been grossly misunderstood all might have been well as it was he seemed to be completely satisfied if he could only show that two propositions thought by plain men to be directly contradictory were all the time capable on close construction of being presented in perfect harmony as if i had a right to look only to what my words literally mean or may in good logic be made to mean and had no concern at all with what the people meant who used the same words or with what i might have known that my hearers were all the time supposing me to mean hopescott once wrote to him november 24 1841 we live in a time in which accurate distinctions especially in theology are absolutely unconsidered the common sense or general tenor of questions is what alone the majority of men are guided by and i verily believe that semiarian confessions or any others turning upon nicety of thought and expression would be for the most part considered as fitter subjects for scholastic dreamers than for earnest christians in politics at any rate bishop butler was wiser  the explanation of what was assailed as inconsistency is perhaps a double one in the first place he started on his journey with an intellectual chart of ideas and principles not adequate or well fitted for the voyage traced for him by the spirit of his age if he held to the inadequate ideas with which oxford and canning and his father and even peel had furnished him he would have been left helpless and useless in the days stretching before him the second point is that the orator of mr gladstones commanding school exists by virtue of large and intense expression then if circumstances make him as vehement for one opinion today as he was vehement for what the world regards as a conflicting opinion yesterday his intellectual selfrespect naturally prompts him to insist that the opinions do not really clash but are in fact identical you may call this a weakness if you choose and it certainly involved mr gladstone in much unfruitful and not very edifying exertion but it is at any rate better than the front of brass that takes any change of opinion for matterofcourse expedient as to which the least said will be soonest mended and it is better still than the disastrous selfconsciousness that makes a man persist in a foolish thing today because he chanced to say or do a foolish thing yesterday                                      viii                                 minor morals  in this period of his life with the battle of the world still to come mr gladstone to whose grave temperament everything little or great was matter of deliberate reflection of duty and scruple took early note of minor morals as well as major characteristically he found some fault with a sermon of dr wordsworths upon saint barnabas for       hardly pushing the argument for the connection of good manners with      christianity to the full extent of which it is fairly capable the      whole system of legitimate courtesy politeness and refinement is      surely nothing less than one of the genuine though minor and often      unacknowledged results of the gospel scheme all the great moral      qualities or graces which in their large sphere determine the      formation and habits of the christian soul as before god do also      on a smaller scale apply to the very same principles in the common      intercourse of life and pervade its innumerable and separately      inappreciable particulars and the result of this application is      that good breeding which distinguishes christian civilisation      march 31 1844  it is not for us to discuss whether the breeding of plato or cicero or the arabs of cordova was better or worse than the breeding of the eastern bishops at nicæa or ephesus good manners we may be sure hardly have a single masterkey unless it be simplicity or freedom from the curse of affectation what is certain is that nobody of his time was a finer example of high good manners and genuine courtesy than mr gladstone himself he has left a little sheaf of random jottings which without being subtle or recondite show how he looked on this side of human things here is an example or two       there are a class of passages in mr wilberforces journals      eg some of those recording his successful speeches which      might in many men be set down to vanity but in him are more fairly      i should think ascribable to a singlemindedness which did not      inflate surely with most men it is the safest rule to make      scanty records of success achieved and yet more rarely to notice      praise which should pass us like the breeze enjoyed but not      arrested there must indeed be some sign a stone as it were set      up to remind us that such and such were occasions for      thankfulness but should not the memorials be restricted wholly and      expressly for this purpose for the fumes of praise are rapidly and      fearfully intoxicating it comes like a spark to the tow if once      we give it as it were admission within us 1838       there are those to whom vanity brings more of pain than of      pleasure there are also those whom it oftener keeps in the      background than thrusts forward the same man who today      volunteers for that which he is not called upon to do may      tomorrow flinch from his obvious duty from one and the same      causevanity or regard to the appearance he is to make for its      own sake and perhaps that vanity which shrinks is a more subtle      and farsighted a more ethereal a more profound vanity than that      which presumes 1842       a question of immense importance meets us in ethical inquiries as      follows is there a sense in which it is needful right and      praiseworthy that man should be much habituated to look back upon      himself and keep his eye upon himself a selfregard and even a      selfrespect which are compatible with the selfrenunciation and      selfdistrust which belong to christianity in the observance of a      single distinction we shall find perhaps a secure and sufficient      answer we are to respect our responsibilities not ourselves we      are to respect the duties of which we are capable but not our      capabilities simply considered there is to be no complacent      selfcontemplation beruminating upon self when self is viewed it      must always be in the most intimate connection with its purposes      how well were it if persons would be more careful or rather more      conscientious in paying compliments how often do we delude      another in subject matter small or great into the belief that he      has done well what we know he has done ill either by silence or      by so giving him praise on a particular point as to imply      approbation of the whole now it is undoubtedly difficult to      observe politeness in all cases compatibly with truth and      politeness though a minor duty is a duty still 1838       if truth permits you to praise but binds you to praise with a      qualification observe how much more acceptably you will speak if      you put the qualification first than if you postpone it for      example this is a good likeness but it is a hard painting is      surely much less pleasing than this is a hard painting but it is      a good likeness the qualification is generally taken to be more      genuinely the sentiment of the speakers mind than the main      proposition and it carries ostensible honesty and manliness to      propose first what is the less acceptable 18356                                      ix                            spirit of submission  to go back to fénelons question about his own foundation the great work of religion as mr gladstone conceived it was set out in some sentences of a letter written by him to mrs gladstone in 1844 five years after they were married in these sentences we see that under all the agitated surface of a life of turmoil and contention there flowed a deep composing stream of faith obedience and resignation that gave him in face of a thousand buffets the free mastery of all his resources of heart and brain       to mrs gladstone       13 ch terrace sunday evening jan 21 1844although i have      carelessly left at the board of trade with your other letters that      on which i wished to have said something yet i am going to end      this day of peace by a few words to show that what you said did not      lightly pass away from my mind there is a beautiful little      sentence in the works of charles lamb concerning one who had been      afflicted he gave his heart to the purifier and his will to the      sovereign will of the universe134 but there is a speech in the      third canto of the paradiso of dante spoken by a certain      piccarda which is a rare gem i will only quote this one line         in la sua volontade è nostra pace135       the words are few and simple and yet they appear to me to have an      inexpressible majesty of truth about them to be almost as if they      were spoken from the very mouth of god it so happened that unless      my memory much deceives me i first read that speech on a morning      early in the year 1836 which was one of trial i was profoundly      impressed and powerfully sustained almost absorbed by these      words they cannot be too deeply graven upon the heart in short      what we all want is that they should not come to us as an      admonition from without but as an instinct from within they      should not be adopted by effort or upon a process of proof but      they should be simply the translation into speech of the habitual      tone to which all tempers affections emotions are set in the      christian mood which ought never to be intermitted the sense of      this conviction should recur spontaneously it should be the      foundation of all mental thoughts and acts and the measure to      which the whole experience of life inward and outward is      referred the final state which we are to contemplate with hope      and to seek by discipline is that in which our will shall be one      with the will of god not merely shall submit to it not merely      shall follow after it but shall live and move with it even as the      pulse of the blood in the extremities acts with the central      movement of the heart and this is to be obtained through a double      process the first that of checking repressing quelling the      inclination of the will to act with reference to self as a centre      this is to mortify it the second to cherish exercise and expand      its new and heavenly power of acting according to the will of god      first perhaps by painful effort in great feebleness and with many      inconsistencies but with continually augmenting regularity and      force until obedience become a necessity of second nature       resignation is too often conceived to be merely a submission not      unattended with complaint to what we have no power to avoid but it      is less than the whole of a work of a christian your full triumph      as far as that particular occasion of duty is concerned will be to      find that you not merely repress inward tendencies to murmurbut      that you would not if you could alter what in any matter god has      plainly willed here is the great work of religion here is the      path through which sanctity is attained the highest sanctity and      yet it is a path evidently to be traced in the course of our daily      duties       when we are thwarted in the exercise of some innocent laudable      and almost sacred affection as in the case though its scale be      small out of which all of this has grown satan has us at an      advantage because when the obstacle occurs we have a sentiment      that the feeling baffled is a right one and in indulging a      rebellious temper we flatter ourselves that we are merely as it      were indulgent on behalf not of ourselves but of a duty which we      have been interrupted in performing but our duties can take care      of themselves when god calls us away from any of them to be      able to relinquish a duty upon command shows a higher grace than to      be able to give up a mere pleasure for a duty                        responsibility for gifts  the resignation thus described with all this power and deep feeling is of course in one form of thoughts and words of symbol and synthesis or another the foundation of all the great systems of life a summary of mr gladstones interpretation of it is perhaps found in a few words used by him of blanco white a heterodox writer whose strange spiritual fortunes painfully interested and perplexed him he cherished says mr gladstone with whatever associations the love of god and maintained resignation to his will even when it appears almost impossible to see how he could have had a dogmatic belief in the existence of a divine will at all there was in short in blanco white a disposition to resist the tyranny of self to recognise the rule of duty to maintain the supremacy of the higher over the lower parts of our nature136 this very disposition might with truth no less assured have been assigned to the writer himself these three bright crystal laws of life were to him like pointer stars guiding a travellers eye to the celestial pole by which he steers  when all has been said of a mans gifts the critical question still stands over how he regards his responsibility for using them once in a conversation with mr gladstone some fifty years from the epoch of this present chapter we fell upon the topic of ambition well he said i do not think that i can tax myself in my own life with ever having been much moved by ambition the remark so astonished me that as he afterwards playfully reported to a friend i almost jumped up from my chair we soon shall reach a stage in his career when both remark and surprise may explain themselves we shall see that if ambition means love of power or fame for the sake of glitter decoration external renown or even dominion and authority on their own accountand all these are common passions enough in strong natures as well as weakthen his view of himself was just i think he had none of it ambition in a better sense the motion of a resolute and potent genius to use strength for the purposes of strength to clear the path dash obstacles aside force good causes forwardsuch a quality as that is the very law of the being of a personality so vigorous intrepid confident and capable as his  footnotes  112 hawarden grammar school sept 19 1877  113 mr gladstone on lord houghtons life speaker nov 29 1890  114 gleanings vii p 133  115 homeric studies vol iii

country it is but selfishness indolence a perverse      fastidiousness an unmanliness and no virtue or praise to bury      our talent in a napkincardinal newman   along with his domestic and parliamentary concerns we are to recognise the ferment that was proceeding in mr gladstones mind upon new veins of theology but it was an interior working of feeling and reflection and went forward without much visible relation to the outer acts and facts of his life during this period as to those one entry in the diary feb 1st 1839 tells a sufficient tale for the next two years i find i have besides family and parliamentary concerns and those of study ten committees on hand milbank society for propagation of the gospel church building metropolis church commercial school national schools inquiry and correspondence upper canada clergy additional curates fund carlton library oxford and cambridge club these things distract and dissipate my mind well they might for in any man with less than mr gladstones amazing faculty of rapid and powerful concentration such dispersion must have been disastrous both to effectiveness and to mental progress as it is i find little in the way of central facts to remark in either mental history or public action he strayed away occasionally from the fathers and their pastures and dipped into the new literature of the hour associated with names of dawning popularity carlyle he found hard to lay down some of emerson too he became acquainted with as we have already seen but his mind was far too closely filled with transcendentalisms of his own to offer much hospitality to the serene and beautiful transcendentalism of emerson he read oliver twist and nicholas nickleby and on the latter he makes a characteristic commentthe tone is very human it is most happy in touches of natural pathos no church in the book and the motives are not those of religion so with hallams history of literature finished oct 10 1839 his theological chapter in which i am sorry to find amidst such merits what is even far more grievous than his antichurch sarcasms such notions on original sin as in iv p 161 he found chillingworths religion of protestants a work of the most mixed merits an ambiguous phrase which i take to mean not that its merits were various but that they were much mixed with those demerits for which the puritan cheynell baited the unlucky latitudinarian to death about this time also he first began father pauls famous history of the council of trent a work that always stood as high in his esteem as in macaulays who liked sarpi the best of all modern historians  to the great veteran poet of the time mr gladstones fidelity was unchanging even down to compositions that the ordinary wordsworthian gives up       read aloud wordsworths cumberland beggar and peter bell the      former is generally acknowledged to be a noble poem the same      justice is not done to the latter i was more than ever struck with      the vivid power of the descriptions the strong touches of feeling      the skill and order with which the plot upon peters conscience is      arranged and the depth of interest which is made to attach to the      humblest of quadrupeds it must have cost great labour and is an      extraordinary poem both as a whole and in detail  let not the scorner forget that matthew arnold that admirable critic and fine poet confesses to reading peter bell with pleasure and edification  in the political field he moved steadily on sir r peel spoke to him april 19 1839 in the house about the debate and wished him to speak after sheil if graham who was to speak about 8 or 9 could bring him up peel showed him several points with regard to the committee which he thought might be urged this is very kind in him as a mark of confidence and assures me that if as i suspect he considers my book as likely to bring me into some embarrassment individually yet he is willing to let me still act under him and fight my own battles in that matter as best with gods help i may which is thoroughly fair it imposes however a great responsibility i was not presumptuous enough to dream of following sheil not that his speech is formidable but the impression it leaves on the house is i meant to provoke him a mean man may fire at a tiger but it requires a strong and bold one to stand his charge and the longer i live the more i feel my own intrinsically utter powerlessness in the house of commons but my principle is thisnot to shrink from any such responsibility when laid upon me by a competent person sheil however did not speak so i am reserved and may fulfil my own idea please god tonight                             the jamaica case  we come now to one of the memorable episodes in this vexed decade of our political history the sullen demon of slavery died hard the negro still wore about his neck galling links of the broken chain the transitory stage of apprenticeship was in some respects even harsher than the bondage from which it was to bring deliverance and the old iniquity only worked in new ways the pity and energy of the humane at home drove a perplexed and sluggish government to pass an act for dealing with the abominations of the prisons to which the unhappy blacks were committed in jamaica the assembly of that island a planter oligarchy resented the new law from the mother country as an invasion of their constitutional rights and stubbornly refused in their exasperation even after a local dissolution to perform duties that were indispensable for working the machinery of administration the cabinet in consequence asked parliament april 9th to suspend the constitution of jamaica for a term of five years the tory opposition led by peel with all his force aided by the aversion of a section of the liberals to a measure in which they detected a flavour of dictatorship ran the ministers may 6th within five votes of defeat on a cardinal stage  i was amused says mr gladstone with observing yesterday the differences of countenance and manner in the ministers whom i met on my ride ellice their friend would not look at me at all charles wood looked but askance and with the hat over the brow grey shouted wish you joy lord howick gave a remarkably civil and smiling nod and morpeth a hand salute with all his might as we crossed in riding on monday night after the division peel said just as it was known and about to be announced jamaica was a good horse to start of his own share in the performance mr gladstone only says that he spoke a dry speech to a somewhat reluctant house i cannot work up my matter at all in such a plight however considering what it was they behaved very well a loud cheer on the announcement of the numbers from our people in which i did not join  to have won the race by so narrow a majority as five seemed to the whigs wearied of their own impotence and just discredit a good plea for getting out of office peel proceeded to begin the formation of a government but the operation broke down upon an affair of the bedchamber he supposed the queen to object to the removal of any of the ladies of her household and the queen supposed him to insist on the removal of them all the situation was unedifying and nonsensical but the queen was not yet twenty and lord melbourne had for once failed to teach a prudent lesson a few days saw melbourne back in office and in office he remained for two years longer137                                      ii                                  marriage  in june 1839 the understanding arrived at with miss catherine glynne during the previous winter in sicily ripened into a definite engagement and on the 25th of the following july their marriage took place amid much rejoicing and festivity at hawarden at the same time and place mary glynne the younger sister was married to lord lyttelton sir stephen glynne their brother was the ninth and as was to happen the last baronet their mother born mary neville was the daughter of the second lord braybrooke and mary grenville his wife sister of the first marquis of buckingham hence lady glynne was one of a historic clan granddaughter of george grenville the minister of american taxation and niece of william lord grenville head of the cabinet of all the talents in 1806 she was first cousin therefore of the younger pitt and the glynnes could boast of a family connection with three prime ministers or if we choose to add lord chatham who married hester grenville with four138 i told her mr gladstone recorded on this occasion of their engagement june 8th what was my original destination and desire in life in what sense and manner i remained in connection with politics i have given her led by her questions these passages for canons of our living    le fronde onde sinfronda tutto lorto    dell ortolano eterno am io cotanto    quanto da lui a lor di bene è porto139  and dante again    in la sua volontade è nostra pace    ella è quel mare al qual tutto si muove140  in few human unions have the good hopes and fond wishes of a bridal day been better fulfilled or brought deeper and more lasting content sixty long years after mr gladstone said it would not be possible to unfold in words the value of the gifts which the bounty of providence has conferred upon me through her and the blessing remained radiant and unclouded to the distant end  at the close of august after posting across scotland from greenock by a route better known now than then to every tourist the young couple made their way to fasque where the new bride found an auspicious approach and the kindest of welcomes her entrance into her adoptive family was much more formidable than it would be to those who had been less loved or less influential or less needed and leant upon in the home where she was so long a queen at fasque all went as usual soon after his arrival his father communicated that he meant actually to transfer to his sons his demerara propertiesrobertson to have the management this increased wealth so much beyond my needs with its attendant responsibility is very burdensome however on his part the act be beautiful                                    iii  the parliamentary session of 1840 was unimportant and dreary the government was tottering the conservative leaders were in no hurry to pluck the pear before it was ripe and the only men with any animating principle of active public policy in them were cobden and the league against the corn law the attention of the house of commons was mainly centred in the case of stockdale and the publication of debates but mr gladstones most earnest thoughts were still far away from what he found to be the dry sawdust of the daily politics as the following lines may show       march 16th 1849manning dined with us he kindly undertook      to revise my manuscript on church principles       march 18thyesterday i had a long conversation with james      hope he came to tell me with great generosity that he would      always respond to any call according to the best of his power      which i might make on him for the behalf of the common causehe      had given up all views of advancement in his professionhe had      about £400 a year and this which includes his fellowship was      quite sufficient for his wants his time would be devoted to      church objects in the intermediate region he considered himself as      having the first tonsure       hope urged strongly the principle let every man abide in the      calling  i thought even over strongly my belief is that he      foregoes the ministry from deeming himself unworthy the object      of my letter to hope was in part to record on paper my abhorrence      of party in the church whether oxford party or any other       march 18thtoday a meeting at peels on the china question      considered in the view of censure upon the conduct of the      administration and a motion will accordingly be made objecting to      the attempts to force the chinese to modify their old relations      with us and to the leaving the superintendent without military      force it was decided not to move simultaneously in the      lordsparticularly because the radicals would if there were a      double motion act not on the merits but for the ministry      otherwise it seemed to be thought we should carry a motion the      duke of wellington said god if it is carried they will go      that they were as near as possible to resignation on the last      defeat and would not stand it again peel said he understood four      ministers were then strongly for resigning the duke also said our      footing in china could not be reestablished unless under some      considerable naval and military demonstration now that matters had      gone so far he appeared pale and shaken but spoke loud and a good      deal much to the point and with considerable gesticulation the      minds life i never saw more vigorous                            the china question  the chinese question was of the simplest british subjects insisted on smuggling opium into china in the teeth of chinese law the british agent on the spot began war against china for protecting herself against these malpractices there was no pretence that china was in the wrong for in fact the british government had sent out orders that the opiumsmugglers should not be shielded but the orders arrived too late and war having begun great britain felt bound to see it through with the result that china was compelled to open four ports to cede hong kong and to pay an indemnity of six hundred thousand pounds so true is it that statesmen have no concern with pater nosters the sermon on the mount or the vade mecum of the moralist we shall soon see that this transaction began to make mr gladstone uneasy as was indeed to be expected in anybody who held that a state should have a conscience141 on april 8 1840 his journal says read on china house spoke heavily strongly against the trade and the war having previously asked whether my speaking out on them would do harm and having been authorised an unguarded expression brought him into a debating scrape but his speech abounded in the pure milk of what was to be the gladstonian word       i do not know how it can be urged as a crime against the chinese      that they refused provisions to those who refused obedience to      their laws whilst residing within their territory i am not      competent to judge how long this war may last nor how protracted      may be its operations but this i can say that a war more unjust      in its origin a war more calculated in its progress to cover this      country with disgrace i do not know and i have not read of mr      macaulay spoke last night in eloquent terms of the british flag      waving in glory at canton and of the animating effect produced      upon the minds of our sailors by the knowledge that in no country      under heaven was it permitted to be insulted but how comes it to      pass that the sight of that flag always raises the spirits of      englishmen it is because it has always been associated with the      cause of justice with opposition to oppression with respect for      national rights with honourable commercial enterprise but now      under the auspices of the noble lord palmerston that flag is      hoisted to protect an infamous contraband traffic and if it were      never to be hoisted except as it is now hoisted on the coast of      china we should recoil from its sight with horror and should      never again feel our hearts thrill as they now thrill with      emotion when it floats magnificently and in pride upon the      breeze although the chinese were undoubtedly guilty of much      absurd phraseology of no little ostentatious pride and of some      excess justice in my opinion is with them and whilst they the      pagans and semicivilised barbarians have it we the enlightened      and civilised christians are pursuing objects at variance both with      justice and with religion142       may 14thconsulted various persons on opium all but sir r      inglis were on grounds of prudence against its a motion against      the compensation demanded from china being brought forward to      this majority of friendly and competent persons i have given way i      hope not wrongfully but i am in dread of the judgment of god upon      england for our national iniquity towards china it has been to me      matter of most painful and anxious consideration i yielded      specifically to this the majority of the persons most trustworthy      feel that to make the motion would our leaders being in such a      position and disposition with respect to it injure the cause      june 1stmeeting of the society for suppression of the slave      trade this was the occasion of a speech from prince albert who      presided exeter hall crammed is really a grand spectacle samuel      wilberforce a beautiful speaker in some points resembles macaulay      peel excellent june 12ththis evening i voted for the irish      education grant on the ground that in its principle according to      lord stanleys letter it is identical practically with the english      grant of 338 and i might have added with the kildare place      grant to exclude doctrine from exposition is in my judgment as      truly a mutilation of scripture as to omit bodily portions of the      sacred volume                             social diversion  his first child and eldest son was born june 3 and manning and hope became his godfathers these two were mr gladstones most intimate friends at this period social diversions were never wanting one june afternoon he went down to greenwich grillions fish dinner to the speaker great merriment and an excellent speech from stanley good sense and good nonsense a modest one from morpeth but though we dined at six these expeditions do not suit me i am ashamed of paying £2 10s for a dinner but on this occasion the object was to do honour to a dignified and impartial speaker he had been not at all grateful by the way for the high honour of admission to grillions dining club this yeara thing quite alien to my temperament which requires more soothing and domestic appliances after the feverish and consuming excitements of party life but the rules of society oblige me to submit as it happened so narrow is mans foreknowledge grillions down to the very end of his life nearly sixty years ahead had no more faithful or congenial member       july 1stlast evening at lambeth palace i had a good deal of      conversation with colonel gurwood about the duke of wellington and      about canada he told me an anecdote of lord seaton which throws      light upon his peculiar reserve and shows it to be a modesty of      character combined no doubt with military habits and notions when      captain colborne and senior officer of his rank in the 21st foot      he lord seaton was military secretary to general fox during the      war a majority in his regiment fell vacant gen fox desired him      to ascertain who was the senior captain on the command captain      soandso of the 80th i think write to colonel gordon and      recommend him to his royal highness for the vacant majority he      did it the answer came to this effect the recommendation will      not be refused but we are surprised to see that it comes in the      handwriting of captain colborne the very man who according to the      rules of the service ought to have this majority general fox had      forgotten it and captain colborne had not reminded him the error      was corrected he gurwood said he had never known the duke of      wellington speak on the subject of religion but once when he      quoted the story of oliver cromwell on his deathbed and said      that state of grace in my opinion is a state or habit of doing      right of persevering in duty and to fall from it is to cease from      acting right he always attends the service at 8 am in the      chapel royal and says it is a duty which ought to be done and the      earlier in the day it is discharged the better july 24th heard      james hope in the house of lords against the chapters bill and      he spoke with such eloquence learning lofty sentiment clear and      piercing diction continuity of argument just order sagacious      tact and comprehensive method as one would say would have      required the longest experience as well as the greatest natural      gifts yet he never acted before save as counsel for the edinburgh      and glasgow railway if hearts are to be moved it must be by this      speech143 july 27thagain went over and got up the subject      of opium compensation as it respects the chinese i spoke thereon      1½ hours for the liberation of my conscience and to afford the      friends of peace opposite an opportunity of which they would not      avail themselves  in august he tells mrs gladstone how he has been to dine with such an odd party at the guizots austin radical lawyer john mill radical reviewer m gaskell monckton milnes thirlwall new bishop of st davids george lewis poor law commissioner not very ill mixed however the host is extremely nice an odd party indeed it comprised four at least of the strongest heads in england and two of the most illustrious names of all the century in europe                            examiner at eton  in march 1840 mr gladstone and lord lyttelton went to eton together to fulfil the ambitious functions of examiner for the newcastle scholarship in thanking mr gladstone for his services hawtrey speaks of the advantage of public men of his stamp undertaking such duties in the good cause of the established system of education as against the nonsense of utilitarians and radicals the questions ran in the familiar mould in divinity niceties of ancient grammar obscurities of classical construction caprices of vocabulary and all the other points of the old learning the general merit mr gladstone found beyond anything possible or conceivable when he was a boy at eton a dozen years before       we sit with the boys 39 in number and make about ten hours a day      in looking over papers with great minuteness although it is in      quantity hard work it is lightened by a warm interest and the      refreshment of early love upon a return to this sweet place it is      work apart from human passion and is felt as a moral relaxation      though it is not one in any other sense this is a curious      experience to me of jaded body and mind refreshed i propose for      latin theme a little sentence of burkes which runs to this effect

second son of the historian the junior of arthur by some fourteen or fifteen years mr gladstone more than a generation later described a touching supplement to his eton story in 1850 henry hallam had attained an age exceeding only by some four years the limit of his brothers life during that autumn i was travelling post between turin and genoa upon my road to naples a family coach met us on the road and the glance of a moment at the inside showed me the familiar face of mr hallam i immediately stopped my carriage descended and ran after his on overtaking it i found the dark clouds accumulated on his brow and learned with indescribable pain that he was on his way home from florence where he had just lost his second and only remaining son from an attack corresponding in its suddenness and its devastating rapidity with that which had struck down his eldest born son seventeen years before  at fasque where his autumn sojourn began in september he threw himself with special ardour into his design for a college for scotch episcopalians especially for the training of clergy he wrote to manning aug 31 1840       hope and i have been talking and writing upon a scheme for raising      money to found in scotland a college akin in structure to the      romish seminaries in england that is to say partly for training      the clergy partly for affording an education to the children of      the gentry and others who now go chiefly to presbyterian schools or      are tended at home by presbyterian tutors i think £25000 would do      it and that it might be got i must have my fathers sanction      before committing myself to it hopes intended absence for the      winter is a great blow were he to be at home i do not doubt that      great progress might be made in the kirk toil and trouble double      double the fires burn and cauldrons bubble and though i am not      sanguine as to very speedy or extensive resumption by the church of      her spiritual rights she may have a great part to play at present      she is very weakly manned and this is the way i think to      strengthen the crew                                   glenalmond  the scheme expanded as time went on his father threw himself into it with characteristic energy and generosity contributing many thousand pounds for the sum required greatly exceeded the modest figure above mentioned mr gladstone conducted a laborious and sometimes vexatious correspondence in the midst of more important public cares plans were mature and adequate funds were forthcoming and in the autumn of 1842 hope and the two gladstones made what they found an agreeable tour examining the various localities for a site and finally deciding on a spot on a mountainstream ten miles from perth at the very gate of the highlands it was 1846 before the college at glenalmond was opened for its destined purposes144 we all know examples of men holding opinions with trenchancy decision and even a kind of fervour and yet with no strong desire to spread them mr gladstone was at all times of very different temper consumed with missionary energy and the fire of ardent propagandism                          letter from cobden  he laboured hard at the fourth edition of his book sometimes getting eleven hours of work a good day as times gomontesquieu burke bacon clarendon and others of the masters of civil and historic wisdom being laid under ample contribution by christmas he was at hawarden in january he made a speech at a meeting held in liverpool for the foundation of a church union and a few days later he hurried off to walsall to help his brother john then the tory candidate and a curious incident happened       i either provided myself or i was furnished from headquarters      with a packet of pamphlets in favour of the corn laws these i      read and i extracted from them the chief material of my speeches      i dare say it was sad stuff furbished up at a moments notice we      carried the election cobden sent me a challenge to attend a public      discussion of the subject whether this was quite fair i am not      certain for i was young made no pretension to be an expert and      had never opened my lips in parliament on the subject but it      afforded me an excellent opportunity to decline with modesty and      with courtesy as well as reason i am sorry to say that to the      best of my recollection i did far otherwise and the pith of my      answer was made to be that i regarded the anticorn law league as      no better than a big boroughmongering association such was my      first capital offence in the matter of protection redeemed from      public condemnation only by obscurity  the letters are preserved but a sentence or two from mr gladstones to cobden are enough the phrases which you quote from a report in the times have reference not to the corn law but to the anticorn law league and its operations in walsall complaining apparently of these you desire me to meet you in discussion not upon the league but upon the corn law i cannot conceive two subjects more distinct i admit the question of the repeal of the corn laws to be a subject fairly open to discussion although i have a strong opinion against it but as to the anticorn law league i do not admit that any equitable doubt can be entertained as to the character of its present proceedings and excepting a casual familiarity of phrase i adhere rigidly to the substance of the sentiments which i have expressed i know not who may be answerable for these measures nor was your name known to me or in my recollection at the time when i spoke time soon changed all this and showed who was teacher and who the learner  by and by the session of 1841 opened the whigs moving steadily towards their fall and mr gladstone almost overwhelmed with floods of domestic business he settled in the pleasant region which is to the metropolis what delphi was to the habitable earth and where if we include in it downing street he passed all the most important years of his life in london145 though he speaks of being overwhelmed by domestic business and he was undoubtedly hard beset by all the demands of early housekeeping yet he very speedily recovered his balance he resisted now and always as jealously as he could those promiscuous claims on time and attention by which men of less strenuous purpose suffer the effectiveness of their lives to be mutilated i well know he writes to his young wife who was expecting him to join her at hagley you would not have me come on any conditions with which ones sense of duty could not be quieted and would i hope send me back by the next train these delays are to you a practical exemplification of the difficulty of reconciling domestic and political engagements the case is one that scarcely admits of compromise the least that is required in order to the fulfilment of ones duty is constant bodily presence in london until the fagend of the session is fairly

offend me       april 3two or three nights ago mrs wilbraham told catherine      that stanley was extremely surprised to find after his speech on      the tarmworth and rugby railway bill that peel had been very much      annoyed with the expression he had used that his right hon      friend had in pleading for the bill made use of all that art and      ingenuity with which he so well knew how to dress up a statement      for that house and that he showed his annoyance very much by his      manner to him s afterwards he upon reflecting that this was      the probable cause wrote a note to peel to set matters to rights      in which he succeeded but he thought peel very thinskinned wm      cowper told me the other day at milness that lord john russell is      remarkable among his colleagues for his anxiety during the recess      for the renewal of the session of parliament that he always argues      for fixing an early day of meeting and finds pleas for it and      finds the time long until it recommences  a visit to nuneham april 12 and thence to oxford brought him into the centre of the tractarians he saw much of hamilton went to afternoon service at littlemore breakfasted in company with newman at merton had a long conversation with pusey on tract 90 and gathered that newman thought differently of the council of trent from what he had thought a year or two back and that he differed from pusey in thinking the english reformation uncatholic mr gladstone replied that no 90 had the appearance to his mind of being written by a man if in not of the church of england and would be interpreted as exhibiting the tridentine system for the ideal the anglican for a mutilated and just tolerable actual then in the same month he finished palmer on the articles deep earnest and generally trustworthy worked upon a notion of private eucharistical devotions to be chiefly compiled and attended a meeting about colonial bishoprics where he spoke but indifferently                                      iv                              new fiscal policy  in 1841 the whigs in the expiring hours of their reign launched parliament and parties upon what was to be the grand marking controversy of the era to remedy the disorder into which expenditure mainly due to highhanded foreign policy had brought the national finance they proposed to reconstruct the fiscal system by reducing the duties on foreign sugar and timber and substituting for wellingtons corn law a fixed eight shilling duty on imported wheat the wiser heads like lord spencer were aware that as an electioneering expedient the new policy would bring them little luck but their position in any case was desperate the handling of their proposals was curiously maladroit and even if it had been otherwise ministerial repute alike for competency and for sincerity was so damaged both in the house of commons and the country that their doom was certain the reduction of the duty on slavegrown sugar from foreign countries was as obnoxious to the abolitionist as it was disadvantageous to the west indian proprietors and both of these powerful sections were joined by the corngrower well aware that his turn would come next many meetings took place at sir robert peels upon the sugar resolutions and mr gladstone worked up the papers and figures so as to be ready to speak if necessary at one of these meetings by the way he thought it worth while to write down that peel had the tradesmens household books upon his deska circumstance that he mentioned also to the present writer when by chance we found ourselves together in the same room fifty years later  on may 10th his speech on the sugar duties came off in due course in this speech he took the sound point that the new arrangement must act as an encouragement to the slave trade that monster which while war pestilence and famine were slaying their thousands slew from year to year with unceasing operation its tens of thousands as he went on he fell upon macaulay for being member of a cabinet that was thus deserting a cause in which macaulays father had been the unseen ally of wilberforce and the pillar of his strengtha man of profound benevolence of acute understanding of indefatigable industry and of that selfdenying temper which is content to work in secret and to seek for its reward beyond the grave macaulay was the last man to suffer rebuke in silence and he made a sharp reply on the following day followed by a magnanimous peacemaking behind the speakers chair                       defeat of whig ministry  meanwhile the air was thick and loud with rumours lord eliot told mr gladstone in the middle of the debate that there had been a stormy cabinet that morning and that ministers had at last made up their minds to follow lord spencers advice to resign and not to dissolve when the division on the sugar duties was taken ministers were beaten may 19 by a majority of 36 after fine performances from sir robert and a good one from palmerston on the other side the cabinet with a tenacity incredible in our own day were still for holding on until their whole scheme with the popular element of cheap bread in it was fully before the country peel immediately countered them by a vote of want of confidence and this was carried june 4 by a majority of one       on saturday morning the division in the house of commons presented      a scene of the most extraordinary excitement while we were in our      lobby we were told that we were 312 and the government either 311      or 312 it was also known that they had brought down lord  who      was reported to be in a state of total idiocy after returning to      the house i went to sit near the bar where the other party were      coming in we had all been counted 312 and the tellers at the      government end had counted to 308 there remained behind this      unfortunate man reclining in a chair evidently in total      unconsciousness of what was proceeding loud cries had been raised      from our own side when it was seen that he was being brought up      to clear the bar that the whole house might witness the scene and      every one stood up in intense curiosity there were now only this      figure less human even than an automaton and two persons r      stuart and e ellice pushing the chair in which he lay a loud cry      of shame shame burst from our side those opposite were silent      those three were counted without passing the tellers and the      moment after we saw that our tellers were on the right in walking      to the table indicating that we had won fremantle gave out the      numbers and then the intense excitement raised by the sight we had      witnessed found vent in our enthusiastic quite irregular hurrah      with great waving of hats upon looking back i am sorry to think      how much i partook in the excitement that prevailed but how could      it be otherwise in so extraordinary a case i thought lord johns a      great speechit was delivered too under the pressure of great      indisposition he has risen with adversity he seemed rather below      par as a leader in 1835 when he had a clear majority and the ball      nearly at his foot in each successive year the strength of his      government has sunk and his own has risen  then came the dissolution and an election memorable in the history of party thinking quite as much of the scotch college the colonial bishoprics and tract ninety as of sugar duties or the corn law mr gladstone hastened to newark he was delighted with the new colleague who had been provided for him as a candidate he writes to his wife lord john manners is excellent his speaking is popular and effective and he is a good canvasser by virtue not i think of effort but of a general kindliness and warmth of disposition which naturally shows itself to every one nothing can be more satisfactory than to have such a partner in his address mr gladstone only touched on the poor law and the corn law on the first he would desire liberal treatment for aged sick and widowed poor and reasonable discretion to the local administrators of the law as to the second the protection of native agriculture is an object of the first economical and national importance and should be secured by a graduated scale of duties on foreign grain manners and i he says were returned as protectionists my speeches were of absolute dulness but i have no doubt they were sound in the sense of my leaders peel and graham and others of the party the election offered no new incidents one old lady reproached him for not being content with keeping bread and sugar from the people but likewise by a new faith the mysterious monster of puseyism stealing away from them the bread of life he found the wesleyans shaky partly because they disliked his book and were afraid of the oxford tracts and partly from his refusal to subscribe to their school otherwise flags bands suppers processions all went on in high ceremonial order as before day after day passed with nothing worse than the threat of a blue candidate but one sunday morning june 26 as people came out of church they found an address on the walls and a dark rumour got afloat that the new man had brought heavy bags of money for this rumour there was no foundation but it inspired annoying fears in the good and cheerful hopes in the bad the time was in any case too short and at four oclock on june 29 the poll was found to be gladstone 633 manners 630 hobhouse 391 his own election safely over mr gladstone turned to take part in a fierce contest in which sir stephen glynne was candidate for the representation of flintshire but bribery faggotry abduction personation riot factious delays landlords intimidations partiality of authorities carried the day and to the bitter dismay of hawarden sir stephen was narrowly beaten one ancient dame overwhelmed by the defeat of the family that for eighty years she had idolised cried aloud to mrs gladstone i am a great woman for thinking of the lord but o my dear lady this has put it all out of my head the election involved him in what would now be thought a whimsical correspondence with one of the grosvenor family who complained of mr gladstone for violating the sacred canons of electioneering etiquette by canvassing lord westminsters tenants i did think says the wounded patrician that interference between a landlord with whose opinions you were acquainted and his tenants was not justifiable according to those laws of delicacy and propriety which i considered binding in such cases                            election of 1841  at last he was able to snatch a holiday with his wife and child by the seaside at hoylake which rather oddly struck him as being like pæstum without the temples he read away at gibbon and dante until he went to hawarden partly to consider the state of its financial affairs as to these something is to be said later walked alone in the hawarden grounds he says one day during his stay ruminated on the lastnamed subject accounts also on anticipated changes in government i can digest the crippled religious action of the state but i cannot be a party to exacting by blood opium compensation from the chinese then to london aug 18 he attended the select party meetings at sir robert peels and lord aberdeens dining at grillions he heard stanley speaking of the new parliament express a high opinion of roebuck as an able man and clear speaker likely to make a figure and also of cobden as a resolute perspicacious man familiar with all the turns of his subject and when the new house assembled he had made up his mind for himself that cobden will be a worrying man on corn this was cobdens first entry into the house at last the whigs were put out of office by a majority of 91 and peel undertook to form a government       aug 3141in consequence of a note received this morning from      sir robert peel i went to him at halfpast eleven the following is      the substance of a quarter of an hours conversation he said in      this great struggle in which we have been and are to be engaged      the chief importance will attach to questions of finance it would      not be in my power to undertake the business of chancellor of the      exchequer in detail i therefore have asked goulburn to fill that      office and i shall be simply first lord i think we shall be very      strong in the house of commons if as a part of this arrangement you      will accept the post of vicepresident of the board of trade and      conduct the business of that department in the house of commons      with lord ripon as president i consider it an office of the      highest importance and you will have my unbounded confidence in      it146       i said of the importance and responsibility of that office at the      present time i am well aware but it is right that i should say as      strongly as i can that i really am not fit for it i have no      general knowledge of trade whatever with a few questions i am      acquainted but they are such as have come across me incidentally      he said the satisfactory conduct of an office of that kind must      after all depend more upon the intrinsic qualities of the man than      upon the precise amount of his previous knowledge i also think you      will find lord ripon a perfect master of these subjects and depend      upon it with these appointments at the board of trade we shall      carry the whole commercial interests of the country with us                   vicepresident of the board of trade       he resumed if there be any other arrangement that you would      prefer my value and affectionate regard for you would make me      most desirous to effect it so far as the claims of others would      permit to be perfectly frank and unreserved i should tell you      that there are many reasons which would have made me wish to send      you to ireland but upon the whole i think that had better not be      done some considerations connected with the presbyterians of      ireland make me prefer on the whole that we should adopt a      different plan147 then if i had had the exchequer i should      have asked you to be financial secretary to the treasury but under      the circumstances i have mentioned that would be an office of      secondary importance and i am sure you will not estimate that i now      propose to you by the mere name which it bears he also made an      allusion to the admiralty of which i do not retain the exact form      but i rather interposed and said my objection on the score of      fitness would certainly apply with even increased force to anything      connected with the military and naval services of the country for      of them i know nothing nor have i any other object in view there      is no office to which i could designate myself i think it my duty      to act upon your judgment as to my qualifications if it be your      deliberate wish to make me vicepresident of the board of trade i      will not decline it i will endeavour to put myself into harness      and to prepare myself for the place in the best manner i can but      it really is an apprenticeship he said i hope you will be      content to act upon the sense which others entertain of your      suitableness for this office in particular and i think it will be      a good arrangement both with a view to the present conduct of      business and to the brilliant destinies which i trust are in store      for you i answered that i was deeply grateful for his many acts      of confidence and kindness and that i would at once assent to the      plan he had proposed only begging him to observe that i had      mentioned my unfitness under a very strong sense of duty and of the      facts and not by any means as a mere matter of ceremony i then      added that i thought i should but ill respond to his confidence if      i did not mention to him a subject connected with his policy which      might raise a difficulty in my mind i cannot i said      reconcile it to my sense of right to exact from china as a term      of peace compensation for the opium surrendered to her he      agreed that it was best to mention it observed that in consequence      of the shape in which the chinese affair came into the hands of the      new government they would not be wholly unfettered seemed to hint      that under any other circumstances the vicepresident of board of      trade need not so much mind what was done in the other departments      but remarked that at present every question of foreign relations      and many more would be very apt to mix themselves with the      department of trade he thought i had better leave the question      suspended       i hesitated a moment before coming away and said it was only from      my anxiety to review what i had said and to be sure that i had      made a clean breast on the subject of my unfitness for the      department of trade nothing could be more friendly and warm than      his whole language and demeanour it has always been my hope that      i might be able to avoid this class of public employment on this      account i have not endeavoured to train myself for them the place      is very distasteful to me and what is of more importance i fear i      may hereafter demonstrate the unfitness i have today only stated      however it comes to me i think as a matter of plain duty it may      be all the better for not being according to my own bent and      leaning i must forthwith go to work as a reluctant schoolboy      meaning well       sept 3this day i went to claremont to be sworn in when the      council was constructed the duke of buckingham and lord liverpool      were first called in to take their oaths and seats then the      remaining four followed lincoln eliot ernest bruce and i the      queen sat at the head of the table composed but dejectedone      could not but feel for her all through the ceremonial we knelt      down to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy and stood up to      take i think the councillors oath then kissed the queens hand      then went round the table shaking hands with each member beginning      from prince albert who sat on the queens right and ending with      lord wharncliffe on her left we then sat at the lower end of the      table excepting lord e bruce who went to his place behind the      queen as vicechamberlain then the chancellor first and next the      duke of buckingham were sworn to their respective offices c      greville forgot the dukes privy seal and sent him off without it      the queen corrected him and gave it then were read and approved      several orders in council among which was one assigning a district      to a church and another appointing lord ripon and me to act in      matters of trade these were read aloud by the queen in a very      clear though subdued voice and she repeated approved after each      upon that relating to lord r and myself we were called up and      kissed hands again then the queen rose as did all the members of      the council and retired bowing we had luncheon in the same room      half an hour later and went off the duke of wellington went in an      open carriage with a pair all our other grand people with four      peel looked shy all through i visited claremont once before 27      years ago i think as a child to see the place soon after the      princess charlottes death it corresponded pretty much with my      impressions                         sworn of the privy council  he secured his reelection at newark on september 14 without opposition and without trouble beyond the pressure of a notion rooted in the genial mind of his constituency that as master of the mint he would have an unlimited command of public coin for all purposes whether general or particular his reflections upon his ministerial position are of much biographic interest he had evidently expected inclusion in the cabinet       sept 16upon quietly reviewing past times and the degree of      confidence which sir robert peel had for years habitually i may      say reposed in me and especially considering its climax in my      being summoned to the meetings immediately preceding the debate on      the address in august i am inclined to think after allowing for      the delusions of self love that there is not a perfect      correspondence between the tenor of the past on the one hand and      my present appointment and the relations in which it places me to      the administration on the other he may have made up his mind at      those meetings that i was not qualified for the consultations of a      government nor would there be anything strange in this except the      supposition that he had not seen it before having however taken      the alarm so to speak upon the invitation at that time and been      impressed with the idea that it savoured of cabinet office i      considered and consulted on the chinese question which i regarded      as a serious impediment to office of that description and i had      provisionally contemplated saying to peel in case he should offer      me ireland with the cabinet to reply that i would gladly serve his      government in the secretaryship but that i feared his chinese      measures would hardly admit of my acting in the cabinet i am very      sorry now to think that i may have been guilty of an altogether      absurd presumption in dreaming of the cabinet but it was wholly      suggested by that invitation and i still think that there must      have been some consultation and decision relating to me in the      interval between the meetings and the formation of the new      ministry which produced some alteration in confirmation of the      notion i have recorded above i am distinct in the recollection      that there was a shyness in peels manner and a downward eye when      he opened the conversation and made the offer not usual with him      in speaking to me  in after years he thus described his position when he went to the board of trade       i was totally ignorant both of political economy and of the      commerce of the country i might have said as i believe was said      by a former holder of the vicepresidency that my mind was in      regard to all those matters a sheet of white paper except that      it was doubtless coloured by a traditional prejudice of protection      which had then quite recently become a distinctive mark of      conservatism in a spirit of ignorant mortification i said to      myself at the moment the science of politics deals with the      government of men but i am set to govern packages in my journal      for aug 2 i find this recorded since the address meetings      which were quasicabinets the idea of the irish secretaryship      had nestled imperceptibly in my mind148  the vicepresidency was the post by the way impudently proposed four years later by the whigs to gobden after he had taught both whigs and tories their business mr gladstone at least was quick to learn the share of packages in the government of men                        reflections on his office       sept 30closing the month and a period of two years      comprehended within this book i add a few words my position is      changed by office in opposition i was frequently called or      sometimes at least to the confidential councils of the party on a      variety of subjects in office i shall of course have to do with      the department of trade and with little or nothing beyond there is      some point in the query of the westminster review whether my      appointments are a covet satire but they bring great advantages      much less responsibility much less anxiety i could not have made      myself answerable for what i expect the cabinet will do in china      it must be admitted that it presents an odd appearance when a      person whose mind and efforts have chiefly ranged within the circle      of subjects connected with the church is put into office of the      most different description it looks as if the first object were to      neutralise his mischievous tendencies but i am in doubt whether to      entertain this supposition would be really a compliment to the      discernment of my superiors or a breach of charity therefore it      is best not entertained  paragraphs appeared in newspapers imputing to mr gladstone a strong reprobation of the prime ministers opinions upon church affairs and he thought it worth while to write to sir robert a strong and most excessively lengthy disclaimer of being among other things an object of hope to unbending tories as against their moderate and cautious leader149 should party spirit he went on run very high against your commercial measures i have no doubt that the venom of my religious opinions will be plentifully alleged to have infused itself into your policy even in that direction  and more than ever will be heard of your culpability in taking into office a person of my bigoted and extreme sentiments peel replied october 19 1841 with kindness and good sense he had not taken the trouble to read the paragraph he had read the works from which a mischievous industry had tried to collect means of defaming their author he found nothing in them in the most distant manner to affect political cooperation and he signed his name to the letter with an esteem and regard which are proof against evilminded attempts to sow jealousy and discord150  footnotes  137 for mr gladstones later view of this transaction see gleanings i p 39 he composed a letter on the subject

hands of the treasury connected with the fiscal laws of the countrymr gladstone at leeds oct 8 1881 in 1880 writing to mr chamberlain then president he says if you were to look back to the records of your department thirtyfive and forty years ago you would find how much of the public trade business was transacted in it revenue was then largely involved and hence i imagine it came about that this business was taken over in a great degree by the treasury i myself have drawn up new tariffs in both at the b of t in 1842 and 18445 and at the treasury in 1853 and 1860 why and how the old b of t functions also passed in part to the fo i do not so well know  147 i suppose this points to incompatibility in the fevers of the hour between protestant ulster and a puseyite chief secretary  148

of our solid commercial policy it established our railway system it settled the currency and by no means least it gave us a good national character in europe as lovers of moderation equity and peace little as most members of the new cabinet saw it their advent definitely marked the rising dawn of an economic era if you had to constitute new societies peel said to croker then you might on moral and social grounds prefer cornfields to cotton factories and you might like an agricultural population better than a manufacturing as it was the national lot was cast and statesmen were powerless to turn back the tide the food of the people their clothing the raw material for their industry their education the conditions under which women and children were suffered to toil markets for the products of loom and forge and furnace and mechanics shopthese were slowly making their way into the central field of political vision and taking the place of fantastic follies about foreign dynasties and the balance of power as the true business of the british statesman on the eve of entering parliament september 17 1832 mr gladstone recounts some articles of his creed at the time to his friend gaskell and to modern eyes a curious list it is the first place is given to his views on the relative merits of pedro miguel donna maria in respect of the throne of portugal the second goes to poland the third to the affairs of lombardy free trade comes last this was still the lingering fashion of the moment and it died hard  the new ministry contained an unusual number of men of mark and capacity and they were destined to form a striking group at their head was a statesman whose fame grows more impressive with time not the author or inspirer of large creative ideas but with what is at any rate next besta mind open and accessible to those ideas and endowed with such gifts of skill vigilance caution and courage as were needed for the government of a community rapidly passing into a new stage of its social growth one day in february 1842 he sent for mr gladstone on some occasion of business peel happened not to be well and in the course of the conversation his doctor called sir james graham who had come in said to his junior in peels absence with the physician the pressure upon him is immense we never had a minister who was so truly a first minister as he is he makes himself felt in every department and is really cognisant of the affairs of each lord grey could not master such an amount of business canning could not do it now he is an actual minister and is indeed capax imperii next to peel as parliamentary leaders stood graham himself and stanley they had both of them sat in the cabinet of lord grey and now found themselves the colleagues of the bitterest foes of greys administration as we have seen mr gladstone pronounces graham to have known more about economic subjects than all the rest of the government put together such things had hitherto been left to men below the first rank in the hierarchy of public office like huskisson pedro and miguel held the field                       end of his protectionist stage  mr gladstones own position is described in an autobiographic fragment of his last years       when i entered parliament in 1832 the great controversy between      protection or artificial restraint and free trade of which cobden      was the leading figure did not enter into the popular      controversies of the day and was still in the hands of the      philosophers my father was an active and effective local      politician and the protectionism which i inherited from him and      from all my youthful associations was qualified by a thorough      acceptance of the important preliminary measures of mr huskisson      of whom he was the first among the local supporters moreover for      the first six years or so of my parliamentary life free trade was      in no way a party question and it only became strictly such in      1841 at and somewhat before the general election when the whig      government in extremis proposed a fixed duty upon corn my mind      was in regard to it a sheet of white paper but i accepted the      established conditions in the lump and could hardly do      otherwise in 1833 only the question was debated in the house of      commons and the speech of the mover against the corn laws made me      uncomfortable but the reply of sir james graham restored my peace      of mind i followed the others with a languid interest yet i      remember being struck with the essential unsoundness of the      argument of mr villiers it was this under the present corn law      our trade on which we depend is doomed for our manufacturers      cannot possibly contend with the manufacturers of the continent if      they have to pay wages regulated by the protection price of food      while their rivals pay according to the natural or free trade      price the answer was obvious thank you we quite understand you      your object is to get down the wages of your workpeople it was      cobden who really set the argument on its legs and it is futile to      compare any other man with him as the father of our system of free      trade       i had in 1840 to dabble in this question and on the wrong side of      it152 the matter passed from my mind full of churches and      church matters in which i was now gradually acquiring knowledge      in 1841 the necessities of the whig government led to a further      development of the great controversy but i interfered only in the      colonial part of it in connection with the colonies and the slave      trade to porto rico and brazil we west indians were now great      philanthropists when sir robert peel assumed the government he had      become deeply committed to protection which in the last two or      three years had become the subject of a commanding controversy i      suppose that at newark i followed suit but i have no records on      the change of government peel with much judgment offered me the      vicepresidentship of the board of trade on sound principles of      party discipline i took the office at once and having taken it i      set to work with all my might as a worker in a very short time i      came to form a low estimate of the knowledge and information of      lord ripon and of the cabinet sir james graham i think knew      most and now the stones of which my protectionism was built up      began to get uncomfortably loose when we came to the question of      the tariff we were all nearly on a par in ignorance and we had a      very bad adviser in macgregor secretary to the board of trade but      i had the advantage of being able to apply myself with an undivided      attention my assumption of office at the board of trade was      followed by hard steady and honest work and every day so spent      beat like a battering ram on the unsure fabric of my official      protectionism by the end of the year i was far gone in the      opposite sense i had to speak much on these questions in the      session of 1842 but it was always done with great moderation                                      ii                           peels slow conversion  the case on the accession of the new ministers was difficult peel himself has drawn the picture by incompetent finance by reckless colonial expenditure by solving political difficulties through gifts or promises of cash from the british treasury by war and foreign relations hovering on the verge of war and necessitating extended preparations the whigs had brought the national resources into an embarrassment that was extreme the accumulated deficits of five years had become a heavy incubus and the deficit of 18423 was likely to be not less than two and a half millions more commerce and manufactures were languishing distress was terrible poorrates were mounting and grantsinaid would extend impoverishment from the factory districts to the rural judge then said peel whether we can with safety retrograde in manufactures153  so grave a crisis could only be met by daring remedies with the highest courage moral courage no less than political peel resolved to ask parliament to let him raise four or five millions a year by incometax in order to lower the duties on the great articles of consumption and by reforming the tariff both to relieve trade and to stimulate and replenish the reciprocal flow of export and import that he at this time or perhaps in truth at any time had acquired complete mastery of those deeper principles and wider aspects of free trade of which adam smith had been the great exponentprinciples afterwards enforced by the genius of cobden with such admirable still persistency and patriotic spiritthere was nothing to show such a scheme had no originality in it huskisson and men of less conspicuous name had ten years earlier urged the necessity of a new general system of taxation based upon remission of duty on raw materials and on articles of consumption and upon the imposition of an incometax the famous report of the committee on import duties of 1840 often rightly called the charter of free trade and of which peel not much to his credit had at this moment not read a word154 laid the foundations of the great policy of tariff reform with which the names of peel and gladstone are associated in history the policy advocated in 1830 in the admirable treatise of sir henry parnell is exactly the policy of peel in 1842 as he acknowledged after all it is an idle quarrel between the closet strategist and the victorious commander between the man who first discerns some great truth of government and the man who gets the thing or even a part of the thing actually done                           peels government  mr gladstone has left on record some particulars of his own share as subordinate minister not in the cabinet in this first invasion upon the old tory corn law of 1827 peel from the beginning appreciated the powers of his keen and zealous lieutenant and even in the autumn of 1841 he had taken him into confidential counsel155 besides a letter of observations on the general scheme of commercial freedom mr gladstone prepared for the prime minister a special paper on the corn laws       the ordinary business of the department soon fell into my hands to      transact with the secretaries one of them macgregor a      looseminded free trader and the other lefevre a clear and      scientific one in that autumn i became possessed with the desire      to relax the corn law which formed i believe the chief subject      of my meditations hence followed an important consequence very      slow in acquiring relative and secondary knowledge and honestly      absorbed in my work i simply thought on and on as to what was      right and fair under the circumstances  in january 1842 as the session approached they came to close quarters the details of all the mysteries of protectionist iniquity we may well spare ourselves peel feeling the pulse of his agricultural folk thought it would never do to give them less than a tenshilling duty when the price of wheat was at sixtytwo shillings the quarter while mr gladstone thought a twelveshilling duty at a price of sixty far too low a relief to the consumer his eyes were beginning to be opened       feb 2i placed in sir r peels hands a long paper on the corn      law in the month of november which on wishing to refer to it he      could not find and he requested me to write out afresh my argument      upon the value of a rest or dead level and the part of the scale      of price at which it should arrive this i did       on monday i wrote another paper arguing for a rest between 60 and      70 or thereabouts and yesterday a third intended to show that the      present law has been in practice fully equivalent to a      prohibition up to 70 lord ripon then told me the cabinet had      adopted peels scale as it originally stoodand seemed to doubt      whether any alteration could be made on his announcing the      adoption i said in a marked manner i am very sorry for      itbelieving that it would be virtual prohibition up to 65 or      66 and often beyond to the minimum and not being able in spite      of all the good which the government is about to do with respect to      commerce to make up my mind to support such a protection i see      from conversations with them today that lord ripon peel and      graham are all aware the protection is greater than is necessary                      mr gladstones rapid advance  this mood soon carried the vicepresident terribly far on feb 5 he met most of the members of the cabinet at peels house he argued his point that the scale would operate as virtual protection up to seventy shillings and in a private interview with peel afterwards hinted at retirement peel declared himself so taken by surprise that he hardly knew what to say he was thunderstruck and he told his young colleague that the retirement of a person holding his office on this question immediately before his introducing it would endanger the existence of the administration and that he much doubted whether in such a case he could bring it on       i fear peel was much annoyed and displeased for he would not give      me a word of help or of favourable supposition as to my own motives      and belief he used nothing like an angry or unkind word but the      negative character of the conversation had a chilling effect on my      mind i came home sick at heart in the evening and told all to      catherine my lips being to every one else as i said to sir r      peel absolutely sealed       he might have gained me more easily i think mr gladstone wrote      years afterwards by a more open and supple method of      expostulation but he was not skilful i think in the management      of personal or sectional dilemmas as he showed later on with      respect to two important questions the factory acts and the crisis      on the sugar duties in 1844 this sharp and unnecessary corner      safely turned mr gladstone learned the lesson how to admire a      great master overcoming a legislators difficulties       i have been much struck he wrote feb 26 throughout the private      discussions connected with the new project of a corn law by the      tenacity with which sir robert peel firstly by adhering in every      point to the old arrangements where it seemed at all possible and      since the announcement of the plan to parliament by steadily      resisting changes in any part of the resolutions has narrowed the      ground and reduced in number the points of attack and thus made      his measure practicable in the face of popular excitement and a      strong opposition until we were actually in the midst of the      struggle i did not appreciate the extraordinary sagacity of his      parliamentary instinct in this particular he said yesterday to      lord ripon and to me among ourselves in this room i have no      hesitation in saying that if i had not had to look to other than      abstract considerations i would have proposed a lower protection      but it would have done no good to push the matter so far as to      drive knatchbull out of the cabinet after the duke of buckingham      nor could i hope to pass a measure with greater reductions through      the house of lords  when lord john russell proposed an amendment substituting an eightshilling duty for a sliding scale peel asked mr gladstone to reply to him this i did feb 14 1842 he says and with my whole heart for i did not yet fully understand the vicious operation of the sliding scale on the corn trade and it is hard to see how an eightshilling duty could even then have been maintained                                    iii                             the new policy  the three centres of operations were the corn bill then the bill imposing the incometax and finally the reform of the duties upon seven hundred and fifty out of the twelve hundred articles that swelled the tariff the corn bill was the most delicate the tariff the most laborious the incometax the boldest the most fraught alike with peril for the hour and with consequences of pith and moment for the future it is hardly possible for us to realise the general horror in which this hated impost was then enveloped the fact of brougham procuring the destruction of all the public books and papers in which its odious accounts were recorded only illustrates the intensity of the common sentiment against the dire hydra evoked by mr pitt for the destruction of the regicide power of france and sent back again to its gruesome limbo after the ruin of napoleon from 1842 until 1874 the question of the incometax was the vexing enigma of public finance  it was upon mr gladstone that the burden of the immense achievement of the new tariff fell and the toil was huge he used afterwards to say that he had been concerned in four revisions of the tariff in 1842 1845 1853 and 1860 and that the first of them cost six times as much trouble as the other three put together he spoke one hundred and twentynine times during the session he had only once sat on a committee of trade and had only once spoken on a purely trade question during the nine years of his parliamentary life all his habits of thought and action had been cast in a different mould it is ordinarily assumed that he was a born financier endowed besides with a gift of idealism and the fine training of a scholar as matter of fact it was the other way he was a man of high practical and moral imagination with an understanding made accurate by strength of grasp and incomparable power of rapid and concentrated apprehension yoked to finance only by force of circumstancea man who would have made a shining and effective figure in whatever path of great public affairs whether ecclesiastical or secular duty might have called for his exertions  it is curious that the first measure of commercial policy in this session should have been a measure of protection in the shape of a bill introduced by the board of trade imposing a duty on corn wheat and flour brought from the united states into canada156 but this was only a detail though a singular one in a policy that was in fact a continuance of the relaxation of the commercial system of the colonies which had been begun in 1822 and 1825 by robinson and huskisson in his present employment mr gladstone was called upon to handle a mass of questions that were both of extreme complexity in themselves and also involved collision with trade interests always easily alarmed irritated and even exasperated with merchants and manufacturers importers and exporters brokers and bankers with all the serried hosts of british trade with the laws and circumstances of international commerce he was every day brought into close detailed and responsible contactwhether the duty on straw bonnets should go by weight or by number what was the difference between bootfronts at six shillings per dozen pairs and a 15 per cent duty ad valorem how to distinguish the regulus of tin from mere ore and how to fix the duty on copper ore so as not to injure the smelter how to find an adjustment between the liquorice manufacturers of london and the liquorice growers of pontefract what was the special case for muscatels as distinct from other raisins whether 110 pounds of ship biscuits would be a fair deposit for taking out of bond 100 pounds of wheat if not kilndried or 96 pounds if kilndried whether there ought to be uniformity between hides and skins he applies to cornewall lewis then a poorlaw commissioner not on the astronomy of the ancients or the truth of early roman history but to find out for a certain series of years past the contract price of meat in workhouses he listens to the grievances of the lathrenders of the coopers who complain that casks will come in too cheap of the coalwhippers and the framework knitters and he examines the hard predicament of the sawyers who hold government answerable both for the fatal competition of machinery and the displacement of wood by iron these deputations he says were invaluable to me for by constant close questioning i learned the nature of their trades and armed with this admission to their interior made careful notes and became able to defend in debate the propositions of the tariff and to show that the respective businesses would be carried on and not ruined as they said i have ever since said that deputations are most admirable aids for the transaction of public business provided the receiver of them is allowed to fix the occasion and the stage at which they appear                         peel to john gladstone  among the deputations of this period mr gladstone always recalled one from lancashire as the occasion on which he first saw mr bright       the deputation was received not by me but by lord ripon in the      large room at the board of trade i being present a long line of      fifteen or twenty gentlemen occupied benches running down and at      the end of the room and presented a formidable appearance all      that i remember however is the figure of a person in black or      dark quaker costume seemingly the youngest of the band eagerly he      sat a little forward on the bench and intervened in the discussion      i was greatly struck with him he seemed to me rather fierce but      very strong and very earnest i need hardly say this was john      bright a year or two after he made his appearance in      parliament157  the best testimony to mr gladstones share in this arduous task is supplied in a letter written by the prime minister himself to john gladstone and that he should have taken the trouble to write it shows moreover that though peel may have been a bad horse to go up to in the stable his reserve easily melted away in recognition of difficult duty well done                       sir robert peel to john gladstone       whitehall june 16 1842you probably have heard that we have      concluded the discussions the preliminary discussions at least on      the subject of the tariff i cannot resist the temptation if it be      only for the satisfaction of my own feelings of congratulating you      most warmly and sincerely on the distinction which your son has      acquired by the manner in which he has conducted himself      throughout those discussions and all others since his appointment      to office at no time in the annals of parliament has there been      exhibited a more admirable combination of ability extensive      knowledge temper and discretion your paternal feelings must be      gratified in the highest degree by the success which has naturally      and justly followed the intellectual exertions of your son and you      must be supremely happy as a father in the reflection that the      capacity to make such exertions is combined in his case with such      purity of heart and integrity of conduct  more than fifty years later in offering to a severe opponent magnanimous congratulations in debate on his sons successful maiden speech mr gladstone said he knew how refreshing to a fathers heart such good promise must ever be and in his own instance peels generous and considerate letter naturally drew from john gladstone a worthy and feeling response                        john gladstone to sir r peel       june 17the receipt last evening of your kind letter of      yesterday filled my eyes with tears of gratitude to almighty god      for having given me a son whose conduct in the discharge of his      public duties has received the full approbation of one who of all      men is so well qualified to form a correct judgment of his merits      permit me to offer you my most sincere thanks for this truly      acceptable testimonial which i shall carefully preserve william      is the youngest of my four sons in the conduct of all of them i      have the greatest cause for thankfulness for neither have ever      caused me a pang he excels his brothers in talent but not so in      soundness of principles habits of usefulness or integrity of      purpose my eldest as you are aware has again and in a most      satisfactory manner got into parliament to have the third also      again there whilst the services of naval men circumstanced as he      is who seek unsuccessfully for employment are not required we      are desirous to effect and wait for a favourable opportunity to      accomplish whenever we may succeed i shall consider my cup to be      filled for the second is honourably and usefully engaged as a      merchant in liverpool occupying the situation i held there for so      many years  it was while they were in office that peel wrote from windsor to beg mr gladstone to sit for his portrait to lucas the same artist who had already painted graham for him i shall be very glad of this addition to the gallery of the eminent men of my own time                           entry into the cabinet  it was evident that mr gladstones admission to the cabinet could not be long deferred and in the spring of the following year the head of the government made him the coveted communication                                             whitehall may 13 1843       my dear gladstonei have proposed to the queen that lord ripon      should succeed my lamented friend and colleague lord fitzgerald      as president of the board of control i at the same time      requested her majestys permission and it was most readily      conceded to propose to you the office of president of the board of      trade with a seat in the cabinet if it were not for the occasion      of the vacancy i should have had unmixed satisfaction in thus      availing myself of the earliest opportunity that has occurred since      the formation of the government of giving a wider scope to your      ability to render public service and of strengthening that      government by inviting your aid as a minister of the crown for      myself personally and i can answer also for every other member of      the government the prospect of your accession to the cabinet is      very gratifying to our feelingsbelieve me my dear gladstone      with sincere esteem and regard most truly yours                                                        robert peel       at two today may 13 mr gladstone records i went to sir r      peels on the subject of his letter i began by thanking him for      the indulgent manner in which he had excused my errors and more      than appreciated any services i might have rendered and for the      offer he had made and the manner of it i said that i went to the      board of trade without knowledge or relish but had been very happy      there found quite enough to occupy my mind enough responsibility      for my own strength and had no desire to move onwards but should      be perfectly satisfied with any arrangement which he might make as      to lord ripons successor he spoke most warmly of service      received said he could not be governed by any personal      considerations and this which he proposed was obviously the right      arrangement i then stated the substance of what i had put in my      memorandum first on the opium question to which his answer was      that the immediate power and responsibility lay with the east india      company he did not express agreement with my view of the      cultivation of the drug but said it was a minor subject as      compared with other imperial interests constantly brought under      discussion intimated that the duke of wellington had surrendered      his opinion i think upon the boundary question and he referred      to the change in his own views and said that in future he      questioned whether he could undertake the defence of the corn laws      on principle his words were addressed to a sympathising hearer my      speeches in the house had already excited dissatisfaction if not      dismay  then came something about the preservation of the two bishoprics in north wales158 to mr gladstones surprise peel reckoned this a more serious matter as it involved a practical course after much had been said on the topic mr gladstone asked for a day or two to consider the question i have to consider with gods help by monday whether to enter the cabinet or to retire altogether at least such is probably the second alternative he wished to consult hope and manning and they upon discussion urged that the point was too narrow on which to join issue with the government this brought him round i well remember he says of this early case of compromise that i pleaded against them that i should be viewed as a traitor and they observed to me in reply that i must be prepared for that if necessary that and indeed i now feel in these times the very wisest and most effective servants of any cause must necessarily fall so far short of the popular sentiment of its friends as to be liable constantly to incur mistrust and even abuse but patience and the power of character overcome all these difficulties i am certain that hope and manning in 1843 were not my tempters but rather my good angels159  peel had been in parliament as long and almost as long in office as mr gladstone had lived but experience of public life enlarges the man of high mind and peel while perhaps he wondered at his juniors bad sense of proportion was the last man to laugh at force of sincerity and conscience men of the other sort as he knew were always to be had for the asking he spoke again of the satisfaction of his colleagues and even said he did not recollect former instances of a single vacancy in a cabinet on which there was an entire concurrence i repeated what i had said of his and their most indulgent judgment and took occasion distinctly to apologise for my blunder and the consequent embarrassment which i caused to him in feb 1842 on the corn scale160                         parliamentary success  his parliamentary success had been extraordinary from the first his gifts of reasoning and eloquence had pleased the house his union of sincerity and force had attracted it as sincerity and force never fail to do and his industry and acuteness his steady growth in political stature substance and acquisition had gained for him the confidence of the austerest of leaders he had reached a seat in the cabinet before he was thirtyfour and after little more than ten years of parliamentary life canning was thirtyseven before he won the same eminence and he had been thirteen years in the house while peel had the cabinet within reach when he was fourandthirty and had been in the house almost thirteen years of which six had been passed in the arduous post of irish secretary mr gladstone had shown that he had in him the qualities that make a minister and a speaker of the first class though he had shown also the perilous quality of a spirit of minute scruple he had not yet displayed those formidable powers of contention and attack that were before long to resemble some tremendous projectile describing a path the law of whose curves and deviations as they watched its journey through the air in wonder and anxiety for the shattering impact men found it impossible to calculate  mr gladstones brief notes of his first and second cabinets are worth transcribing the judicious reader will have little difficulty in guessing the topic for deliberation it figured in the latest of his cabinets as in the earliest as well as in most of those that intervened may 15my first cabinet on irish repeal meetings no fear of breach of the peace grounded on reasons therefore no case for interference the duke however was for issuing a proclamation may 20second cabinet repeal constabulary tainted it would be safe to say of any half dozen consecutive meetings of the queens servants taken at random during the reign that ireland would be certain to crop up still protection was the burning question from one cause or another said mr gladstone looking back to these times my reputation among the conservatives on the question of protection oozed away with rapidity it died with the year 1842 and early in 1843 a duke i think the duke of richmond speaking in the house of lords described some renegade proceeding as a proceeding conducted under the banner of the vicepresident of the board of trade he was not always as careful as peel and sometimes came near to a scrape       in my speech on lord howicks motion mar 10 1843 i was      supposed to play with the question and prepare the way for a      departure from the corn law of last year and i am sensible that i      so far lost my head as not to put well together the various and      if taken separately conflicting considerations which affect the      question it so happens that i spoke under the influence of a      new and most sincere conviction having reference to the recent      circumstances of commercial legislation abroad to the effect that      it would not be wise to displace british labour for the sake of      cheap corn without the counteracting and sustaining provisions      which exchange not distorted by tariffs all but prohibitory would      supply this it is clear is a slippery position for a man who      does not think firmly in the midst of ambiguous and adverse      cheering and i did my work most imperfectly but i do think      honestly sir r peels manner by negative signs showed that he      thought either my ground insecure or my expressions dangerous                        an artificial situation  the situation was essentially artificial there was little secret of the surrender of protection as a principle in introducing the proposals for the reform of the customs tariff peel made the gentlemen around him shiver by openly declaring that on the general principle of free trade there was no difference of opinion that all agreed in the rule that we should buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest that even if the foreigner were foolish enough not to follow suit it was still for the interest of this country to buy as cheap as we could whether other countries will buy from us or no161 even important cabinet colleagues found this too strong doctrine for them  on tuesday night says mr gladstone peel opened the tariff anew and laid down in a manner which drew great cheering from the opposition the doctrine of purchasing in the cheapest market stanley said to me afterwards peel laid that down a great deal too broadly last night he lord s sat down angry with himself and turned to me and said it does not signify i cannot speak on these subjects i quite lost my head i merely answered that no one but himself would have discovered it yet it was able men apt to lose their heads in economics whom peel had to carry along with him on another night says mr gladstone i thought sir r peel appeared in an attitude of conspicuous intellectual greatness and on comparing notes next day with sir j graham at the palace i found he was similarly impressed sheil delivered a very effective rhetorical speech lord stanley had taken a few notes and was to follow him sheil was winding up just as the clock touched twelve lord stanley said to peel it is twelve shall i follow him i think not peel said i do not think it will do to let this go unanswered he had been quite without the idea of speaking that night sheil sat down and peals of cheering followed stanley seemed to hesitate a good deal and at last said as it were to himself no i wont its too late in the meantime the adjournment had been moved but when peel saw there was no one in the breach he rose the cheers were still a little spitefully prolonged from the other side he had an immense subject a disturbed house a successful speech an entire absence of notice to contend against but he began with power gathered power as he went on handled every point in his usual mode of balanced thought and language and was evidently conscious at the close of what no one could deny that he had made a deep impression on the house                                    iv  mr gladstone kept pretty closely in step with his leader from sir robert he slowly learned lessons of circumspection that may not seem congenial to his temperament though for that matter we should remember all through that his temperament was double he was of opinion as he told the house of commons that a slidingscale a fixed duty and free trade were all three open to serious objection he regarded the defects of the existing law as greatly exaggerated and he refused to admit that the defects of the law whatever they might be were fatal to every law with a slidingscale he wished to relieve the consumer to steady the trade to augment foreign commerce and the demand for labour connected with commerce on the other hand he desired to keep clear of the countervailing evils of disturbing either vast capitals invested in land or the immense masses of labour employed in agriculture162 he noted with some complacency that during the great controversy of 1846 and following years he never saw any parliamentary speech of his own quoted in proof of the inconsistency of the peelites here are a couple of entries from lord broughtons diary for 1844june 17 brougham said gladstone was a dd fellow a prig and did much mischief to the government alluding to his speech about keeping sugar duties june 27 gladstone made a decided agricultural protection speech and was lauded therefor by milesso the rebels were returning to their allegiance gladstones arguments somebody said were in favour of free trade and his parentheses were in favour of protection  well might the whole position be called as slippery a one as ever occurred in british politics it was by the principles of free trade that peel and his lieutenant justified tariffreform and they indirectly sapped protection in general by dwelling on the mischiefs of minor forms of protection in particular they assured the country gentlemen that the sacred principle of a scale was as tenderly cherished in the new plan as in the old on the other hand they could assure the leaguers and the doubters that the structure of the two scales was widely different we cannot wonder that honest tories who stuck to the old doctrine not always rejected even by huskisson that a country ought not to be dependent on foreign supply were mystified and amazed as they listened to the two rival parties disputing to which of them belonged the credit of originating a policy that each of them had so short a time before so scornfully denounced the only difference was the difference between yesterday and the day before yesterday the whigs with their fixed duty were just as open as the conservatives with their slidingscale to the taunts of the manchester school when they decorated economics by high a priori declaration that the free importation of corn was not a subject for the deliberations of the senate but a natural and inalienable law of the creator rapid was the conversion even lord palmerston of all people in the world denounced the arrogance and presumptuous folly of dealers in restrictive duties setting up their miserable legislation instead of the great standing laws of nature mr disraeli still warmly on the side of the minister flashed upon his uneasy friends around him a reminder of the true pedigree of the dogmas of free trade was it not mr pitt who first promulgated them in 1787 who saw that the loss of the market of the american colonies made it necessary by lowering duties to look round for new markets on the continent of europe and was it not fox burke sheridan and the minor whig luminaries who opposed him while not a single member of his own government in the house of lords was willing or able to defend him but even reminiscences of mr pitt and oracular descriptions of lord shelburne as the most remarkable man of his age brought little comfort to men sincerely convinced with fear and trembling that free corn would destroy rent close their mansions and their parks break up their lives and beggar the country they remembered also one or two chapters of history nearer to their own time they knew that lord john had a right to revive the unforgotten contrast between peels rejection of socalled protestant securities in 1817 and 1825 and the total surrender of emancipation in 1829 natural forebodings darkened their souls that protectionism would soon share the fate of protestantism and that capitulation to cobden was doomed to follow the old scandal of capitulation to oconnell they felt that there was something much more dreadful than the mere sting of a parliamentary recrimination in the contrast between the corn bill of 1842 and peels panegyrics in 39 40 and 41 on the very system which that bill now shattered on the other side some could not forget that in 1840 the whig prime minister the head of a party still even at the eleventh hour unregenerated by manchester predicted a violent struggle as the result of the manchester policy stirring society to its foundations kindling bitter animosities not easy to quench and creating convulsions as fierce as those of the reform bill  a situation so precarious and so unedifying was sure to lead to strange results in the relations of parties and leaders in july 1843 the speaker told hobhouse that peel had lost all following and authority all but votes hobhouse meeting a tory friend told him that sir robert had got nothing but his majority he wont have that long the tory replied who will make sacrifices for such a fellow they call me a frondeur but there are many such peel thinks he can govern by fremantle and a little clique but it will not do the first election that comes out he must go melbourne only half in jest was reported to talk of begging peel to give him timely notice lest the queen might take him by surprise on one occasion hobhouse wished a secondary minister to tell sir robert how much he admired a certain speech i exclaimed the minister he would kick me away if i dared to speak to him a man hobhouse observes who will not take a civil truth from a subaltern is but a sulky fellow after all there is no true dignity or pride in such reserve oddly enough lord john was complaining just as loudly about the same time of his own want of hold upon his party  the tariff operations of 1842 worked no swift social miracle general stagnation still prevailed capital was a drug in the market but food was comparatively cheap163 stocks were light and there was very little false credit in spite of all these favouring conditions mr gladstone march 20 1843 had to report to his chief that the deadness of foreign demand keeps our commerce in a state of prolonged paralysis cobden had not even yet convinced them that the true way to quicken foreign demand was to open the ports to that foreign supply with which they paid us for what they bought from us mr gladstone saw no further than the desire of making specific arrangement with other countries for reciprocal reductions of import duties  in one of his autobiographic notes 1897 mr gladstone describes the short and sharp parliamentary crisis in 1844 brought about by the question of the sugar duties but this may perhaps be relegated to an appendix164                                    v  from 1841 to 1844 mr gladstones department was engaged in other matters lying beyond the main stream of effort we were anxiously and eagerly endeavouring to make tariff treaties with many foreign countries austria i think may have been included but i recollect especially france prussia portugal and i believe spain and the state of our tariff even after the law of 1842 was then such as to supply us with plenty of material for liberal offers notwithstanding this we failed in every case i doubt whether we advanced the cause of free trade by a single inch  the question of the prohibition against the export of machinery came before him the customhouse authorities pronounced it ineffective and recommended its removal a parliamentary committee in 1841 had reported in favour of entire freedom the machine makers of course were active and the general manufacturers of the country excepting the nottingham lace makers and the flaxspinners of the north of ireland had become neutral only a very limited portion of the trade was any longer subject to restriction and mr gladstone after due consultation with superior ministers proposed a bill for removing the prohibition altogether165 he also brought in a bill april 1844 for the regulation of companies it was when he was president of the board of trade that the first telegraph act was passed i was well aware he wrote of the advantage of taking them into the hands of the government but i was engaged in a plan which contemplated the ultimate acquisition of the railways by the public and which was much opposed by the railway companies so that to have attempted taking the telegraphs would have been hopeless the bill was passed but the executive machinery two years afterwards broke down                                 railways  questions that do not fall within the contentions of party usually cut a meagre figure on the page of the historian and the railway policy of this decade is one of those questions it was settled without much careful deliberation or foresight and may be said in the main to have shaped itself at the time when mr gladstone presided over the department of trade an immense extension of the railway system was seen to be certain and we may now smile at what then seemed the striking novelty of such a prospect mr gladstone proposed a select committee on the subject guided its deliberations drew its reports and framed the bill that was founded upon them he dwelt upon the favour now beginning to be shown to the new roads by the owners of land through which they were to pass so different from the stubborn resistance that had for long been offered upon the cheapened cost of construction upon the growing disposition to employ redundant capital in making railways instead of running the risks that had made foreign investment so disastrous it was not long indeed before this very disposition led to a mania that was even more widely disastrous than any foreign investment had been since the days of the south sea bubble meanwhile mr gladstones railway act of 1844 besides a number of working regulations for the day laid down two principles of the widest range reserving to the state the full right of intervention in the concerns of the railway companies and giving to the state the option to purchase a line at the end of a certain term at twentyfive years purchase of the divisible profits166  it was during these years of labour under peel that he first acquired principles of administrative and parliamentary practice that afterwards stood him in good stead on no account to try to deal with a question before it is ripe never to go the length of submitting a difference between two departments to the prime minister before the case is exhausted and complete never to press a proposal forward beyond the particular stage at which it has arrived pure commonplaces if we will but they are not all of them easy to learn we cannot forget that peel and mr gladstone were in the strict line of political succession they were alike in social origin and academic antecedents they started from the same point of view as to the great organs of national life the monarchy the territorial peerage and the commons the church the universities they showed the same clear knowledge that it was not by its decorative parts or what burke styled solemn plausibilities that the community derived its strength but that it rested for its real foundations on its manufactures its commerce and its credit even in the lesser things in reading sir robert peels letters those who in later years served under mr gladstone can recognise the school to which he went for the methods the habits of mind the practices of business and even the phrases which he employed when his own time came to assume the direction of public affairs the surmounting of administrative difficulties the piloting of complex measures and the handling of troublesome persons  footnotes  151 undated fragment of letter to the queen see appendix  152 see above p 232  153 parker ii pp 499 529 533  154 ibid p 509 before the end of the session aug 10 1842 he

general assent of the episcopal bench and the church at large but sentiment soon changed and a hostile cry was raised before the death of the bishop of st asaph when its provisions would come into

conciliation  in pursuit of the policy of conciliation with which he was now endeavouring to counter oconnell peel opened to his colleagues in 1844 a plan for dealing with the sum annually voted by parliament to the seminary for the training of catholic clergy at maynooth the original grant was made by the irish parliament protestant as it was and was accepted even by anticatholic leaders after 1800 as virtually a portion of the legislative union with ireland peels proposal by making an annual grant permanent by tripling the amount by incorporating the trustees established a new and closer connection between the state and the college it was one of the boldest things he ever did what lord aberdeen wrote to madame de lieven in 1852 was hardly a whit less true in 1845 there is more intense bigotry in england at this moment than in any other country in europe peel said to mr gladstone at the beginning of 1845i wish to speak without any reserve and i ought to tell you i think it will very probably be fatal to the government he explained that he did not know whether the feeling among goulburns constituents the university of cambridge might not be too strong for him that in scotland as he expected there would be a great opposition and he seemed to think that from the church also there might be great resistance and he said the proceedings in the diocese of exeter showed a very sensitive state of the public mind during the whole of 1844 the project simmered at a very early moment mr gladstone grew uneasy he did not condemn the policy in itself but whatever else might be said it was in direct antagonism to the principle elaborately expounded by him only six years before as the sacred rule and obligation between a christian state and christian churches he had marked any departure from that rule as a sign of social declension as a descent from a higher state of society to a lower as a note in the ebb and flow of national life was it not inevitable then that his official participation in the extension of the public endowment of maynooth would henceforth give to every one the right to say of him that man cannot be trusted he was not indeed committed by anything that he had written to the extravagant position that the peace of society should be hazarded because it could no longer restore its ancient theories of religion but was he not right in holding it indispensable that any vote or further declaration from him on these matters should be given under circumstances free from all just suspicions of his disinterestedness and honesty167  in view of these approaching difficulties upon maynooth on july 12 he made a truly singular tender to the head of the government he knew peel to be disposed to entertain the question of a renewal of the public relations with the papal court at rome first to be opened by indirect communications through the british envoy at florence or naples what i have to say mr gladstone now wrote to the prime minister is that if you and lord aberdeen should think fit to appoint me to florence or naples and to employ me in any such communications as those to which i have referred i am at your disposal of this startling offer to transform himself from president of the board of trade into vatican envoy mr gladstone left his own later judgment upon record here it is and no more needs to be said upon it       about the time of my resignation on account of the contemplated      increase of the grant to the college of maynooth i became      possessed with the idea that there was about to be a renewal in      some shape of our diplomatic relations with the see of rome and      i believe that i committed the gross error of tendering myself to      sir robert peel to fill the post of envoy i have difficulty at      this date 1894 in conceiving by what obliquity of view i could      have come to imagine that this was a rational or in any way      excusable proposal and this although i vaguely think my friend      james hope had some hand in it seems to show me now that there      existed in my mind a strong element of fanaticism i believe that i      left it to sir r peel to make me any answer or none as he might      think fit and he with great propriety chose the latter      alternative                         intention to resign  in the autumn of 1844 the prime minister understood that if he proceeded with the maynooth increase he would lose mr gladstone the loss peel said to graham was serious and on every account to be regretted but no hope of averting it would justify the abandonment of a most important part of their irish policy meanwhile in the midst of heavy labours on the tariff in preparation for the budget of 1845 mr gladstone was sharply perturbed as some of his letters to mrs gladstone show       whitehall nov 22 44it is much beyond my expectation that      newman should have taken my letter so kindly it seemed to me so      like the operation of a clumsy bungling surgeon upon a sensitive      part i cannot well comment upon his meaning for as you may easily      judge what with cabinet board and oak farm i have enough in my      head todayand the subject is a fine and subtle one but i may      perhaps be able to think upon it tonight in the meantime i think      yours is a very just conjectural sketch we have not got in cabinet      today to the really pinching part of the discussion the roman      catholic religious education that comes on monday my mind does      not waver pray for me that i may do right i have an appointment      with peel tomorrow and i rather think he means to say something      to me on the question       nov 23you will see that whatever turns up i am sure to be in      the wrong an invitation to windsor for us came this morning and i      am sorry to say one including sundaynov 30 to dec 2 i have      had a long battle with peel on the matters of my office not      another syllable so far as it goes this tends to make me think he      does not calculate on any change in me yet on the whole i lean the      other way manning comes up on monday       nov 25events travel fast and not slow my opinion is that i      shall be out on friday evening we have discussed maynooth today      an intermediate letter which sir james graham has to write to      ireland for information causes thus much of delay i have told them      that if i go i shall go on the ground of what is required by my      personal character and not because my mind is made up that the      course which they propose can be avoided far less because i      consider myself bound to resist it i had the process of this      declaration to repeat i think they were prepared for it but they      would not assume that it was to be and rather proceeded as if i      had never said a word before upon the subject it was painful but      not so painful as the last time and by an effort i had altogether      prevented my mind from brooding upon it beforehand at this moment      6¼ i am sure they are talking about it over the way i am going      to dine with sir r peel under these circumstances the windsor      visit will be strange enough in the meantime my father writes to      me most urgently desiring me to come to liverpool i hope for      some further light from him on wednesday morning       nov 26i have no more light to throw upon the matters which i      mentioned yesterday the dinner at peels went off as well as could      be expected i did not sit near him lord aberdeen was with me      today and said very kindly it must be prevented but i think it      cannot and friendly efforts to prolong the day only aggravate the      pain manning was with me all this morning he is well and is to      come back tomorrow       jan 9 45another postponement but our explanations were as      satisfactory as could possibly be made under such circumstances      the tone and manner as kind as at any timenothing like murmur at      the same time peel said he thought it right to intimate a belief      that the government might very probably be shipwrecked upon the      maynooth question partly in connection with my retirement but      also as he intimated from the uncertainty whether there might not      be a very strong popular feeling against it he takes upon      himself all responsibility for any inconvenience to which the      government may possibly be put from the delay and a consequent      abrupt retirement and says i have given him the fullest and      fairest notice i saw manning for two hours this morning and      let the cat out of the bag to him in part have a note from      lockhart saying the bishop of london had sent his chaplain to      murray to express high approval of the article on wardand      enclosing the vulgar addition of £63                           at windsor castle       windsor castle jan 10first owing to the spanish      ambassadors not appearing lady lyttelton was suddenly invited      and fell to my lot to hand in and sit by which was very pleasant      i am as you know a shockingly bad witness to looks but she      appeared to me i confess a little worn and aged she ought to      have at least two months holiday every year after dinner the      queen inquired as usual about you and rather particularly with      much interest about lady glynne i told her plainly all i could      this rather helped the queen through the conversation as it kept      me talking and she was evidently hard pressed at the gaps then we      went to cards and played commerce fortunately i was never the      worst hand and so was not called upon to pay for i had locked up      my purse before going to dinner but i found i had won 2s 2d at      the end 8d of which was paid me by the prince i mean to keep the      2d piece the 6d i cannot identify accordingly unless i lose it      again tonight i had rather a nice conversation with him about the      international copyright convention with prussia       whitehall jan 11i came back from windsor this morning very      kindly used the queen mentioned particularly that you were not      asked on account of presumed inconvenience and sent me a private      print of the prince of wales and on my thanking for it through      lady lyttelton another of the princess also she brought the      little people through the corridor yesterday after luncheon where      they behaved very well and she made them come and shake hands with      me the prince of wales has a very good countenance the baby i      should call a very fine child indeed the queen said after your      own you must think them dwarfs but i answered that i did not think      the princess royal short as compared with willy we had more cards      last evening lady  made more blunders and was laughed at as      usual       jan 13i think there will certainly be at least one cabinet      more in the end of the week my position is what would commonly be      called uncomfortable i do not know how long the maynooth matter      may be held over i may remain a couple of months or only a      weekmay go at any time at twentyfour hours notice i think on      the whole it is an even chance whether i go before or after the      meeting of parliament so that i am unfeignedly put to obey the      precept of our lord take no thought for the morrow the morrow      will take thought for the things of itself i am sorry that a part      of the inconvenience falls on your innocent head i need not tell      you the irksomeness of business is much increased and ones      purposes unmanned by this indefiniteness still having very      important matters in preparation i must not give any signs of      inattention or indifference       cabinet room jan 14i have no news to give you about myself      but continue to be quite in the dark there is a certain maynooth      bill in preparation and when that appears for decision my time      will probably have come but i am quite ignorant when it will be      forthcoming i am to be with peel tomorrow morning but i think on      board of trade business only graham has just told us that the      draft of the maynooth bill will be ready on saturday but it      cannot i think be considered before the middle of next week at      the earliest       jan 15the nerves are a little unruly on a day like this      between official life and death so much of feeling mixes with      the more abstract question which would be easily disposed of if it      stood alone diary  it was february 3 before mr gladstone wrote his last note from his desk at the board of trade thanking the prime minister for a thousand acts of kindness which he trusted himself not readily to forget the feeling of the occasion he described to manning       do you know that daily intercourse and cooperation with men upon      matters of great anxiety and moment interweaves much of ones being      with theirs and parting with them leaving them under the pressure      of their work and setting myself free feels i think much like      dying more like it than if i were turning my back altogether upon      public life i have received great kindness and so far as personal      sentiments are concerned i believe they are as well among us as      they can be  one other incident he describes to his wife       peel thought i should ask an audience of the queen on my      retirement and accordingly at the palace today feb 3 he      intimated and then the lordinwaiting as is the usage formally      requested it i saw the queen in her private sittingroom as she      did not commence speaking immediately after the first bow i      thought it my part to do so and i said i have had the boldness      to request an audience madam that i might say with how much pain      it is that i find myself separated from your majestys service and      how gratefully i feel your majestys many acts of kindness she      replied that she regretted it very much and that it was a great      loss i resumed that i had the greatest comfort i could enjoy under      the circumstances in the knowledge that my feelings towards her      majestys person and service and also towards sir r peel and my      late colleagues were altogether unchanged by my retirement after      a few words more she spoke of the state of the country and the      reduced condition of chartism of which i said i believed the main      feeder was want of employment at the pauses i watched her eye for      the first sign to retire but she asked me about you before we      concluded then one bow at the spot and another at the door which      was very near and so it was all over        feb 4ruminated on the dangers of my explanation right and      left and it made me unusually nervous h of c 4½9 i was kindly      spoken of and heard and i hope attained practically purposes i had      in view but i think the house felt that the last part by taking      away the sting reduced the matter to flatness                          resignation of office  according to what is perhaps a questionable usage lord john russell invited the retiring minister to explain his secession from office to the house in the suspicion distraction tension that marked that ominous hour in the history of english party people insisted that the resignation of the head of the department of trade must be due to divergence of judgment upon protection the prime minister while expressing in terms of real feeling his admiration for mr gladstones character and ability and his high regard for his colleagues private qualities thought well to restate that the resignation came from no question of commercial policy for three years he went on i have been closely connected with mr gladstone in the introduction of measures relating to the financial policy of the country and i feel it my duty openly to avow that it seems almost impossible that two public men acting together so long should have had so little divergence in their opinions upon such questions if anybody found fault with mr gladstone for not resigning earlier the prime minister was himself responsible i was unwilling to lose until the latest moment the advantages i derived from one whom i consider capable of the highest and most eminent services168  the point of mr gladstones reply was in fact an extremely simple and a highly honourable one while carefully abstaining from laying down any theory of political affairs as under all circumstances inflexible and immutable yet he thought that one who had borne such solemn testimony as he had borne in his book to a particular view of a great question ought not to make himself responsible for a material departure from it without at least placing himself openly in a position to form a judgment that should be beyond all mistake at once independent and unsuspected that position in respect of the maynooth policy he could not hold so long as he was a member of the cabinet proposing it and therefore he had resigned though it was understood that he would not resist the maynooth increase itself all this i fancy might easily have been made plain even to those who thought his action a display of overstrained moral delicacy as it was his anxiety to explore every nook and cranny of his case and to defend or discover in it every point that human ingenuity could devise for attack led him to speak for more than an hour at the end of which even friendly and sympathetic listeners were left wholly at a loss for a clue to the labyrinth what a marvellous talent is this cobden exclaimed to a friend sitting near him here have i been sitting listening with pleasure for an hour to his explanation and yet i know no more why he left the government than before he began i could not but know mr gladstone wrote on this incident long years after that i should inevitably be regarded as fastidious and fanciful fitter for a dreamer or possibly a schoolman than for the active purposes of public life in a busy and moving age169                        views of his resignation  sir robert inglis begged him to lead the opposition to the bill in the course of the conversation inglis went back to the fatal character and consequences of the act of 1829 and wished that his advice had then been taken which was that the duke of cumberland should be sent as lord lieutenant to ireland with thirty thousand men as that good and very kind man spoke the words mr gladstone says my blood ran cold and he too had helped me onwards in the path before me william palmer wrote that the grant to maynooth was the sin of 1829 over again and would bring with it the same destruction of the conservative party lord winchilsea one of his patrons at newark protested against anything that savoured of the national endowment of romanism mr disraeli was reported as saying that with his resignation on maynooth mr gladstones career was over  the rough verdict pronounced his act a piece of political prudery one journalistic wag observed a ladys footman jumped off the great western train going forty miles an hour merely to pick up his hat pretty much like this act so disproportional to the occasion is mr gladstones leap out of the ministry to follow his book when the time came he voted for the second reading of the maynooth bill april 11 with remarkable emphasis i am prepared in opposition to what i believe to be the prevailing opinion of the people of england and of scotland in opposition to the judgment of my own constituents from whom i greatly regret to differ and in opposition to my own deeply cherished predilections to give a deliberate and even anxious support to the measure  the dreamer and the schoolman meanwhile had left behind him a towering monument of hard and strenuous labour in the shape of that second and greater reform of the tariff in which besides the removal of the export duty on coal and less serious commodities no fewer than four hundred and thirty articles were swept altogether away from the list of the customs officer glass was freed from an excise amounting to twice or thrice the value of the article and the whole figure of remission was nearly three times as large as the corresponding figure in the bold operations of 1842 whether the budget of 1842 or that of 1845 marked the more extensive advance we need not discuss it is enough that mr gladstone himself set down the construction of these two tariffs among the principal achievements in the history of his legislative works his unofficial relations with the colleagues whom he had left were perfectly unchanged you will be glad to know he writes to his father that the best feeling as i believe subsists between us although our powers of entertaining guests are not of the first order yet with a view partly to these occurrences we asked sir r and lady peel to dinner today and also lord and lady stanley and lord aberdeen all accepted but unfortunately an invitation to windsor has carried off sir r and lady peel a small matter but i mention it as a symbol of what is material  before many days were over he was working day and night on a projected statement involving much sifting and preparation upon the recent commercial legislation lord john russell had expressed a desire for a competent commentary on the results of the fiscal changes of 1842 and the pamphlet in which mr gladstone showed what those results had been was the reply three editions of it were published within the year170  this was not the only service that mr gladstone had an opportunity of rendering in the course of the session to the government that he had quitted peel he says had a plan for the admission of free labour sugar on terms of favour lord palmerston made a motion to show that this involved a breach of our old treaties with spain i examined the case laboriously and though i think his facts could not be denied i undertook myself out of office to answer him on behalf of the government this i did and peel who was the most conscientious man i ever knew in spareness of eulogium said to me when i sat down that was a wonderful speech gladstone the speech took four hours and was i think the last that he made in parliament for two years and a half for reasons that we shall presently discover                      thoughts of visiting ireland  in the autumn of 1845 mr gladstone made a proposal to hopescott as ireland he said is likely to find this country and parliament so much employment for years to come i feel rather oppressively an obligation to try and see it with my own eyes instead of using those of other people according to the limited measure of my means he suggested that they should devote some time to a working tour in ireland eschewing all grandeur and taking little account of scenery compared with the purpose of looking at close quarters at the institutions for religion and education of the country and at the character of the people philip pusey was inclined to join them it will not alarm you says pusey if i state my belief that in these agrarian outrages the irish peasants have been engaged in a justifiable civil war because the peasant ejected from his land could no longer by any efforts of his own preserve his family from the risk of starvation this view is that of a very calm utilitarian george lewis171 they were to start from cork and the south and work their way round by the west carrying with them lewiss book blue books and a volume or two of plato Æschylus and the rest the expedition was put off by puseys discovery that the times was despatching a correspondent to carry on agrarian investigations mr gladstone urged that the irish land question was large enough for two and so indeed it swiftly proved for ireland was now on the edge of the black abysses of the famine  footnotes  167 the letters from mr gladstone to peel on this topic are given by mr parker peel iii pp 160 163 166  168 in the course of may 1845 peel made some remarks on resignations of which mr gladstone thought the report worth preservingi admit that there may be many occasions when it would be the duty of a public man to retire from office rather than propose measures which are contrary to the principles he has heretofore supported i think that the propriety of his taking that course will mainly depend upon the effect which his retirement will have upon the success of that public measure which he believes to be necessary for the good of his country i think it was perfectly honourable perfectly just in my right honourable friend the late president of the board of trade to relinquish office the hon gentleman thinks i ought to have pursued the same course in 1829 that was precisely the course i wished to pursueit was precisely the course which i intended to pursue until within a month of the period when i consented to bring forward the measure for the relief of the roman catholics i did contemplate retiring from officenot because i shrank from the responsibility of proposing that measurenot from the fear of being charged with inconsistencynot because i was not prepared to make the painful sacrifice of private friendships and political connections but because i believed that my retirement from office would promote the success of the measure i thought that i should more efficiently assist my noble friend in carrying that measure if i retired from office and gave the measure my cordial support in a private capacity i changed my opinion when it was demonstrated to me that there was a necessity for sacrificing my own feelings by retaining officewhen it was shown to me that however humble my abilities yet considering the station which i occupied my retiring from office would render the carrying of that measure totally impossiblewhen it was proved to me that there were objections in the highest quarters which would not be overcome unless i was prepared to sacrifice much that was dear to mewhen it was intimated to my noble friend that there was an intention on the part of the highest authorities in the church of england to offer a decided opposition to the measure and when my noble friend intimated to me that he thought if i persevered in my intention to retire success was out of the question it was then i did not hesitate to say that i would not expose others to obloquy or suspicions from which i myself shrunk  169 gleanings vii p 118  170 remarks upon recent commercial legislation suggested by the expository statement of the revenue from customs and other papers lately submitted to parliament by the right hon w e gladstone mp for newark london murray 1845 mr gladstone had written on the same subject in the foreign and colonial quarterly review january 1843  171 see his memorable work on irish disturbances published in 1836                                 chapter x                triumph of policy and fall of the minister                                1846       change of opinion in those to whose judgment the public looks more      or less to assist its own is an evil to the country although a      much smaller evil than their persistence in a course which they      know to be wrong it is not always to be blamed but it is always      to be watched with vigilance always to be challenged and put upon      its trialgladstone  not lingering for the moment on mr gladstones varied preoccupations during 1845 and not telling over again the wellknown story of the circumstances that led to the repeal of the corn law i pass rapidly to mr gladstones partit was a secondary partin the closing act of the exciting political drama on which the curtain had risen in 1841 the end of the session of 1845 had left the government in appearance even stronger than it was in the beginning of 1842 two of the most sagacious actors knew better what this was worth disraeli was aware how the ties had been loosened between the minister and his supporters and cobden was aware that in words used at the time three weeks of rain when the wheat was ripening would rain away the corn law172                           an exciting december  everybody knows how the rain came and alarming signs of a dreadful famine in ireland came how peel advised his cabinet to open the ports for a limited period but without promising them that if the corn duties were ever taken off they could ever be put on again how lord john seized the moment wrote an edinburgh letter and declared for total and immediate repeal how the minister once more called his cabinet together invited them to support him in settling the question and as they would not all assent resigned how lord john tried to form a government and failed and how sir robert again became first minister of the crown but not bringing all his colleagues back with him i think said mr gladstone in later days he expected to carry the repeal of the corn law without breaking up his party but meant at all hazard to carry it       peels conduct in 1846 lord aberdeen said to a friend ten years      later was very noble with the exception of graham and myself his      whole cabinet was against him lyndhurst goulburn and stanley      were almost violent in their resistance still more opposed to him      if it were possible was the duke of wellington to break up the      cabinet was an act of great courage to resume office when lord      john had failed in constructing one was still more courageous he      said to the queen i am ready to kiss hands as your minister      tonight i believe i can collect a ministry which will last long      enough to carry free trade and i am ready to make the attempt      when he said this there were only two men on whom he could rely      one of the first to join him was wellington the queens      government he said must be carried on we have done all that we      could for the landed interest now we must do all that we can for      the queen173  on one of the days of this startling december mr gladstone writes to his father if peel determines to form a government and if he sends for me a compound uncertainty i cannot judge what to do until i know much more than at present of the irish case it is there if anywhere that he must find his justification there if anywhere that one returned to parliament as i am can honestly find reason for departing at this time from the present corn law two other letters of mr gladstones show us more fully why he followed peel instead of joining the dissentients of whom the most important was lord stanley the first of these was written to his father four and a half years later       6 carlton gardens june 30 1849as respects my having made      peel a free trader i have never seen that idea expressed      anywhere and i think it is one that does great injustice to the      character and power of his mind in every case however the head      of a government may be influenced more or less in the affairs of      each department of state by the person in charge of that      department if then there was any influence at all upon peels      mind proceeding from me between 1841 and 1845 i have no doubt it      may have tended on the whole towards free trade but all this      ceased with the measures of 1845 when i left office it was during      the alarm of a potato famine in the autumn of that year that the      movement in the government about the corn laws began i was then on      the continent looking after helen his sister and not dreaming      of office or public affairs i myself had invariably during      peels government spoken of protection not as a thing good in      principle but to be dealt with as tenderly and cautiously as might      be according to circumstances always moving in the direction of      free trade it then appeared to me that the case was materially      altered by events it was no longer open to me to pursue that      cautious course a great struggle was imminent in which it was      plain that two parties only could really find place on the one      side for repeal on the other side for permanent maintenance of a      corn law and a protective system generally and on principle it      would have been more inconsistent in me even if consistency had      been the rule to join the latter party than the former but      independently of that i thought and still think that the      circumstances of the case justified and required the change so far      as relates to the final change in the corn law you will see that      no influence proceeded from me but rather that events over which i      had no control and steps taken by sir r peel while i was out of      the government had an influence upon me in inducing me to take      office i noticed some days ago that you had made an observation on      this subject but i did not recollect that it was a question had i      adverted to this i should have answered it at once if i had any      motive for avoiding the subject it was i think thisthat it is      not easy to discuss such a question as that of an influence of mine      over a mind so immeasurably superior without something of egotism      and vanity                            secretary of state  so much for the general situation the second letter is to mrs gladstone and contributes some personal details       13 carlton house terrace dec 22 6 pm 1845it is offensive      to begin about myself but i must within the last two hours i have      accepted the office of secretary for the colonies succeeding lord      stanley who resigns the last twentyfour have been very anxious      hours yesterday afternoon two hours after holy communion lincoln      came to make an appointment on peels part i went to meet him in      lincolns house at five oclock he detailed to me the      circumstances connected with the late political changes asked me      for no reply and gave me quantities of papers to read including      letters of his own the queens and lord j russells during the      crisis this morning i had a conversation with bonham the party      whipperin upon the general merits but without telling him      precisely what the proposal made to me was upon the whole my mind      though i felt the weight of the question was clear i had to      decide what was best to be done now i arrived speedily at the      conviction that now at any rate it is best that the question      should be finally settled that peel ought and is bound now to try      it that i ought to support it in parliament that if in deciding      the mode he endeavours to include the most favourable terms for      the agricultural body that it is in his power to obtain i ought      not only to support it by which i mean vote for it in parliament      but likewise not to refuse to be a party to the proposal i found      from him that he entirely recognised this view and did feel      himself bound to make the best terms that he believed attainable      while on the other hand i am convinced that we are now in a      position that requires provision to be made for the final abolition      of the corn law such being the state of matters with a clear      conscience but with a heavy heart i accepted office he was      exceedingly warm and kind but it was with a heavy heart i      have seen lord stanley i am extremely glad to hear you have taken      office said he we go to windsor tomorrow to a councilhe to      resign the seals and i to receive them  in the diary he enters       saw sir r peel at 3 and accepted officein opposition as i have      the consolation of feeling to my leanings and desires and with      the most precarious prospects peel was most kind nay fatherly we      held hands instinctively and i could not but reciprocate with      emphasis his god bless you       i well remember mr gladstone wrote in a memorandum of oct 4      1851 peels using language to me in the duke of newcastles house      on sunday dec 21 1845 which as i conceive distinctly      intimated his belief that he would be able to carry his measure      and at the same time hold his party together he spoke with a kind      of glee and complacency in his tone when he said making up his      meaning by signs i have not lived near forty years in public life      to find myself wholly without the power of foreseeing the course of      events in the house of commonsin reference to the very point of      the success of his government  one thing is worth noting as we pass the exact proceedings of the memorable cabinets of november and the opening days of december are still obscure it has generally been held that disraeli planted a rather awkward stroke when he taunted peel with his inconsistency in declaring that he was not the proper minister to propose repeal and yet in trying to persuade his colleagues to make the attempt before giving the whigs a chance the following note of mr gladstones written in 1851 after reading sir r peels original memoir on the corn act of 1846 throws some light on the question       when sir r peel invited me to take office in december 1845 he did      not make me aware of the offer he had made to the cabinet in his      memorandum i think of dec 2 to propose a new corn law with a      lowered sliding duty which should diminish annually by a shilling      until in some eight or ten years the trade would be free no doubt      he felt that after lord john russell had made his attempt to form a      government and after by lord stanleys resignation he had lost      the advantages of unanimity he could not be justified in a      proposal involving so considerable an element of protection it has      become matter of history but as matter of history it is important      to show how honestly and perseveringly he strove to hold the      balance fairly between contending claims and how far he was from      being the mere puppet of abstract theories  that is to say what he proposed to his cabinet early in december was not the total and immediate repeal to which he was led by events before the end of the month                                     ii                             out of parliament  the acceptance of office vacated the seat at newark and mr gladstone declined to offer himself again as a candidate he had been member for newark for thirteen years and had been five times elected so ended his connection with the first of the five constituencies that in his course he represented i part from my constituents he tells his father with deep regret though i took office under circumstances which might reasonably arouse the jealousy of my friends an agricultural constituency the great majority of my committee were prepared to support me and took action and strong measures in my favour my deep obligation he says to the duke of newcastle for the great benefit he conferred upon me not only by his unbroken support but far above all by his original introduction of me to the constituency made it my duty at once to decline some overtures made to me for the support of my reelection so it only remained to seek a seat elsewhere some faint hopes were entertained by mr gladstones friends that the duke might allow him to sit for the rest of the parliament but the duke was not the man to make concessions to a betrayer of the territorial interest mr gladstone too we must not forget was still and for many years to come a tory when it was suggested that he might stand for north notts he wrote to lord lincolnit is not for one of my political opinions without an extreme necessity to stand upon the basis of democratic or popular feeling against the local proprietary for you who are placed in the soil the case is very different  soon after the session of 1846 began it became known that the protectionist petition against the peelite or liberal sitting member for wigan was likely to succeed in unseating him proposals were made to me to succeed him which were held to be eligible i even wrote my address on a certain day i was going down by the mail train but it was an object for our opponents to keep a secretary of state out of parliament during the corn law crisis and their petition was suddenly withdrawn the consequence was that i remained until the resignation of the government in july a minister of the crown without a seat in parliament this was a state of things not agreeable to the spirit of parliamentary government and some objection was taken but rather slightly in the house of commons sir r peel stood fire there can be little doubt that in our own day a cabinet minister without a seat in either house of parliament would be regarded in mr gladstones words as a public inconvenience and a political anomaly too dark to be tolerated and he naturally felt it his absolute duty to peep in at every chink and cranny where a seat in parliament could be had a peelite however had not a good chance at a byelection and mr gladstone remained out of the house until the general election in the year following174 lord lincoln also a member of the cabinet vacated his seat but unlike his friend found a seat in the course of the session  mr gladstones brotherinlaw lyttelton was invited to represent the colonial office in the lords but had qualms of conscience about the eternal question of the two welsh bishoprics how could the government of this wonderful empire peel wrote to mr gladstone be ever constructed if a difference on such a point were to be an obstruction to union might not any one now say with perfect honour and what is of more importance if they are not identical perfect satisfaction to his own conscience i will not so far set up my own judgment on one isolated measure against that of a whole administration to such an extent as to preclude me from cooperation with them at a critical period this of course assumes general accordance of sentiment on the great outlines of public policy wise words and sound that might prevent some of the worst mistakes of some of the best men                                     iii                            the session of 1846  this memorable session of 1846 was not a session of argument but of lobby computations the case had been argued to the dregs the conclusion was fixed and all interest was centred in the play of forces the working of high motives and low the balance of parties the secret ambitions and antagonism of persons mr gladstone therefore was not in the shaping of the parliamentary result seriously missed as he had been missed in 1845 it soon became evident says a leading whig in his journal of the time that peel had very much overrated his strength even the expectation of december that he could have carried with him enough of his own followers to enable lord john if that statesman had contrived to form a government to pass the repeal of the corn law was perceived to have been groundless when the formidable number of the protectionist dissentients appeared so many even of those who remained with peel avowed that they disapproved of the measure and only voted in its favour for the purpose of supporting peels government175 the tyranny of the accomplished fact obscures ones sense of the danger that peels high courage averted it is not certain that lord john as head of a government could have carried the whole body of whigs for total and immediate repeal lord lansdowne and palmerston openly stating their preference for a fixed duty and not a few of the smaller men cursing the precipitancy of the edinburgh letter it is certain as is intimated above that peel could not have carried over to him the whole of the 112 men who voted for repeal solely because it was his measure in the course of this session sir john hobhouse met mr disraeli at an evening party and expressed a fear lest peel having broken up one party would also be the means of breaking up the other that you may depend upon it he will replied disraeli or any other party that he has anything to do with it was not long after this when all was over that the duke of wellington told lord john that he thought peel was tired of party and was determined to destroy it after the repeal of the corn law was safe the minister was beaten on the irish coercion bill by what wellington called a blackguard combination between the whigs and the protectionists he resigned and lord john russell at the head of the whigs came in  until three or four days before the division on the coercion bill mr gladstone says in a memorandum written at the time i had not the smallest idea beyond mere conjecture of the views and intentions of sir r peel with respect to himself or to his government only we had been governed in all questions so far as i knew by the determination to carry the corn bill and to let no collateral circumstance interfere with that main purpose he sent round a memorandum some days before the division arguing for resignation against dissolution there was also a correspondence between the duke of wellington and him the duke argued for holding our ground and dissolving but when we met in cabinet on friday the 26th of june not an opposing voice was raised it was the shortest cabinet i ever knew peel himself uttered two or three introductory sentences he then said that he was convinced that the formation of a conservative party was impossible while he continued in office that he had made up his mind to resign that he strongly advised the resignation of the entire government some declared their assent none objected and when he asked whether it was unanimous there was no voice in the negative this was simply as mr gladstone added in later notes because he had very distinctly and positively stated his own resolution to resign it amounted therefore to thisno one proposed to go on without him one other note of mr gladstones on this grave decision is worth quoting       i must put into words the opinion which i silently formed in my      room at the colonial office in june 1846 when i got the      circulation box with peels own memorandum not only arguing in      favour of resignation but intimating his own intention to resign      and with the duke of wellingtons in the opposite sense the duke      in my opinion was right and peel wrong but he had borne the brunt      of battle already beyond the measure of human strength and who can      wonder that his heart and soul as well as his physical organisation      needed rest176                         defeat of the government  in announcing his retirement to the house june 29 peel passed a magnanimous and magnificent eulogium on cobden177 strange to say the panegyric gave much offence and among others to mr gladstone the next day he entered in his diary       much comment is made upon peels declaration about cobden last      night my objection to it is that it did not do full justice for      if his power of discussion has been great and his end good his      tone has been most harsh and his imputation of bad and vile motives      to honourable men incessant i do not think the thing was done in a      manner altogether worthy of peels mind but he like some smaller      men is i think very sensible of the sweetness of the cheers of      opponents  he describes himself at the time as grieved and hurt at these closing sentences and even a year later in answer to some inquiry from his father who still remained protectionist he wrote july 1 47i do not know anything about peels having repented of his speech about cobden but i hope that he has seen the great objection to which it is as i think fairly open some of his own men who voted for peel declared that after this speech they bitterly repented                         peels tribute to cobden  the suspected personal significance of the cobden panegyric is described in a memorandum written by mr gladstone a few days later july 12       a day or two afterwards i met lord stanley crossing the park and      we had some conversation first on colonial matters then he said      well i think our friend peel went rather far last night about      cobden did he not i stated to him my very deep regret on reading      that passage as well as what followed about the monopolists and      that not for its impolicy but for its injustice all that he said      was true but he did not say the whole truth and the effect of the      whole as a whole was therefore untrue mr cobden has throughout      argued the corn question on the principle of holding up the      landlords of england to the people as plunderers and as knaves for      maintaining the corn law to save their rents and as fools because      it was not necessary for that purpose this was passed by while he      was praised for sincerity eloquence indefatigable zeal       on thursday the 2nd i saw lord aberdeen he agreed in the general      regret at the tone of that part of the speech he said he feared it      was designed with a view to its effects for the purpose of making      it impossible that peel should ever again be placed in connection      with the conservative party as a party he said that peel had      absolutely made up his mind never again to lead it never again to      enter office that he had indeed made up his mind at one time to      quit parliament but that probably on the queens account and in      deference to her wishes he had abandoned this part of his      intentions but that he was fixed in the idea to maintain his      independent and separate position taking part in public questions      as his views of public interests might from time to time seem to      require i represented that this for him and in the house of      commons was an intention absolutely impossible to fulfil that      with his greatness he could not remain there overshadowing and      eclipsing all governments and yet have to do with no governments      that acts cannot for such a man be isolated they must be in      series and his view of public affairs must coincide with one body      of men rather than another and that the attraction must place him      in relations with them lord aberdeen said that earl spencer in his      later days was sir r peels idealrare appearances for serious      purposes and without compromise generally to the independence of      his personal habits i put it that this was possible in the house      of lords but only there on saturday i saw him again as he came      from the palace he represented that the queen was sorely grieved      at this change which indeed i had already heard from catherine      through lady lyttelton but this showed that it continued and      again on monday we heard through lady lyttelton that the queen said      it was a comfort to think that the work of that day would soon be      over it appears too that she spoke of the kindness she had      received from her late ministers and that the princes sentiments      are quite as decided       on monday we delivered up the seals at our several audiences her      majesty said simply but very kindly to me i am very sorry to      receive them from you i thanked her for my fathers baronetcy      and apologised for his not coming to court she had her glove half      off which made me think i was to kiss hands but she simply bowed      and retired her eyes told tales but she smiled and put on a      cheerful countenance it was in fact the 1st of september 1841 over      again as to feelings but this time with more mature judgment and      longer experience lord aberdeen and sir j graham kissed hands      but this was by favour       the same night i saw sidney herbert at lady pembrokes he gave me      in great part the same view of sir r peels speech himself      holding the same opinion with lord aberdeen but he thought that      peels natural temper which he said is very violent though usually      under thorough discipline broke out and coloured that part of the      speech but that the end in view was to cut off all possibility of      reunion he referred to a late conversation with peel in which      peel had intimated his intention of remaining in parliament and      acting for himself without party to which herbert replied that he      knew of no minister who had done so except lord bute a bad      precedent peel rejoined lord grenville showing that his mind      had been at work upon the subject he had heard him not long ago      discussing his position with lord aberdeen and sir james graham      when he said putting his hand up to the side of his head ah you      do not know what i suffer here       yesterday lord lyndhurst called on me he proceeded to ask me      what i thought with respect to our political course he said he      conceived that the quarrel was a bygone quarrel that the      animosities attending it ought now to be forgotten and the old      relations of amity and confidence among the members of the      conservative body resumed i told him in the first place that i      felt some difficulty in answering him in my state of total      ignorance so far as direct communication is concerned of sir r      peels knowledge and intentions that on tuesday i had seen him on      colonial matters and had talked on the probable intentions of the      new government as to the sugar duties but that i did not like to      ask what he did not seem to wish to tell and that i did not obtain      the smallest inkling of light as to his intentions in respect to      that very matter now immediately pending he observed it was a pity      sir r peel was so uncommunicative but that after having been so      long connected with him he would certainly be very unwilling to do      anything disagreeable to him still if i and others thought fit      he was ready to do what he could towards putting the party together      again i then replied that i thought so far as extinguishing the      animosities which had been raised in connection with the corn law      was concerned i could not doubt its propriety that i thought we      were bound to give a fair trial to the government and not to      assume beforehand an air of opposition and that if so much of      confidence is due to them much more is it due towards friends from      whom we have differed on the single question of free trade that      our confidence should be reposed in them that i thought however      that in any case before acting together as a party we ought to      consider well the outline of our further course particularly with      reference to irish questions and the church there as i was of      opinion that it was very doubtful whether we had now a      justification for opposing any change with respect to it meaning      as to the property he said with his accustomed facility ah yes      it will require to be considered what course we shall take178                       conversations with colleagues       i met lord aberdeen the same afternoon in bond street and told him      the substance of this conversation he said it is stated that      lord g bentinck is to resign and that they are to have you      that i replied was quite new to me the late chancellor had      simply said when i pointed out that the difficulties lay in the      house of commons that it was true and that my being there would      make the way more open i confess i am very doubtful of that and      much disposed to believe that i am regretted as things and      persons absent often are in comparison with the present at      dinner i sat between graham and jocelyn the latter observed      particularly on the absence from sir r peels speech of any      acknowledgment towards his supporters and his colleagues these      last however are named jocelyn said the new government were much      divided jocelyn believes that lord palmerston will not be very      long in union with this cabinet       with sir j graham i had much interesting conversation i told him      i thought it but fair to mention to him the regret and blame which      i found to have been elicited from all persons whom i saw and      conversed with by the passage relating to cobden he said he      believed it was the same on all hands and that the new government      in particular were most indignant at it he feared that it was      deliberately preconceived and for the purpose and went on to      repeat what lord aberdeen had told me that sir r peel had been      within an ace of quitting parliament and was determined to abjure      party and stand aloof for ever and never resume office i replied      as before that in the house of commons it was impossible he went      on to sketch the same kind of future for himself he was weary of      labour at thirteen or fourteen hours a day and of the intolerable      abuse to which he was obliged to submit but his habits were formed      in the house of commons and for it and he was desirous to continue      there as an independent gentleman taking part from time to time in      public business as he might find occasion and giving his leisure      to his family and to books i said are you not building houses of      cards do you conceive that men who have played a great part who      have swayed the great moving forces of the state who have led the      house of commons and given the tone to public policy can at their      will remain there but renounce the consequences of their      remaining and refuse to fulfil what must fall to them in some      contingency of public affairs the country will demand that they      who are the ablest shall not stand by inactive he said sir robert      peel had all but given up his seat i answered that would at any      rate have made his resolution a practicable one       he said you can have no conception of what the virulence is      against peel and me i said no that from having been out of      parliament during these debates my sense of these things was less      lively and my position in some respects different he replied      your position is quite different you are free to take any course      you please with perfect honour i told him of lord lyndhursts      visit and the purport of his conversation of the meaning of the      junction on the opposition bench in the lords and of what we had      said of the difficulties in the commons he said my resentment is      not against the new government but against the seventythree      conservative members of parliament who displaced the late      government by a factious vote nearly all of them believed the bill      to be necessary for ireland and they knew that our removal was not      desired by the crown not desired by the country i find no fault      with the new ministers they are fairly in possession of powerbut      with those gentlemen i can never unite later however in the      evening he relented somewhat and said he must admit that what they      did was done under great provocation that it was no wonder they      regarded themselves as betrayed and that unfortunately it had been      the fate of sir r peel to perform a similar operation twice       graham dwelt with fondness and with pain on lord stanley said he      had very great qualitiesthat his speech on the corn law      consisting as it did simply of old fallacies though in new dress      was a magnificent speech one of his greatest and happiest      effortsthat all his conduct in the public eye had been perfectly      free from exception that he feared however he had been much in      lord geo bentincks counsels and had concurred in much more than      he had himself done and had aided in marking out the course taken      in the house of commons he had called on lord stanley several      times but had never been able to see him he trusted through      accident but seemed to doubt       on the cobden eulogy though he did not defend it outright by any      means he said do you think if cobden had not existed the repeal      of the corn law would have been carried at this moment i said      very probably not that he had added greatly to the force of the      movement and accelerated its issue that i admitted the truth of      every word that peel had uttered but complained of its omissions      of its spirit towards his own friends of its false moral effect      as well as and much more than of its mere impolicy179                                         iv                           farewell interview with peel  still more interesting is an interview with the fallen minister himself written ten days after it took place       july 24on monday the 13th i visited sir r peel and found him      in his dressingroom laid up with a cut in one of his feet my      immediate purpose was to let him know the accounts from new zealand      which lord grey had communicated to me however i led on from      subject to subject for i thought it my duty not to quit town at      the end possibly of my political connection with sir r peel that      is if he determined to individualise himself without giving the      opportunity at least for free communication though he opened      nothing yet he followed unreluctantly i said the government      appeared to show signs of internal discord or weakness he said      yes related that lord john did not mean to include lord grey that      he sent sir g grey and c wood to propitiate him that lord grey      was not only not hostile but volunteered his services at last i      broke the ice and said you have seen lord lyndhurst he said      yes i mentioned the substance of my interview with lord      lyndhurst and also what i had heard from goulburn of his he said      i am hors de combat i said to him is that possible whatever      your present intentions may be can it be done he said he had      been twice prime minister and nothing should induce him again to      take part in the formation of a government the labour and anxiety      were too great and he repeated more than once emphatically with      regard to the work of his post no one in the least degree knows      what it is i have told the queen that i part from her with the      deepest sentiments of gratitude and attachment but that there is      one thing she must not ask of me and that is to place myself again      in the same position then he spoke of the immense accumulation      there is the whole correspondence with the queen several times a      day and all requiring to be in my own hand and to be carefully      done the whole correspondence with peers and members of      parliament in my own hand as well as other persons of      consequence the sitting seven or eight hours a day to listen in      the house of commons then i must of course have my mind in the      principal subjects connected with the various departments such as      the oregon question for example and all the reading connected with      them i can hardly tell you for instance what trouble the new      zealand question gave me then there is the difficulty that you      have in conducting such questions on account of your colleague whom      they concern       it was evident from this as it had been from other signs that he      did not think stanley had been happy in his management of the new      zealand question i said however i can quite assent to the      proposition that no one understands the labour of your post that      i think is all i ever felt i could know about it that there is      nothing else like it but then you have been prime minister in a      sense in which no other man has been it since mr pitts time he      said but mr pitt got up every day at eleven oclock and drank      two bottles of port wine every night and died of old age at      fortysix i replied this all strengthens the case i grant your      full and perfect claim to retirement in point of justice and      reason if such a claim can be made good by amount of service i do      not see how yours could be improved you have had extraordinary      physical strength to sustain you and you have performed an      extraordinary task your government has not been carried on by a      cabinet but by the heads of departments each in communication with      you he assented and added it had been what every government      ought to be a government of confidence in one another i have      felt the utmost confidence as to matters of which i had no      knowledge and so have the rest lord aberdeen in particular said      that nothing would induce him to hold office on any other      principle or to be otherwise than perfectly free as to previous      consultations and he spoke of the defects of the melbourne      government as a mere government of departments without a centre of      unity and of the possibility that the new ministers might      experience difficulty in the same respect i then went on to say      mr perceval lord liverpool lord melbourne were not prime      ministers in this sense what mr canning might have been the time      was too short to show i fully grant that your labours have been      incredible but allow me to say that is not the question the      question is not whether you are entitled to retire but whether      after all you have done and in the position you occupy before the      country you can remain in the house of commons as an isolated      person and hold yourself aloof from the great movements of      political forces which sway to and fro there he said i think      events will answer that question better than any reasoning      beforehand i replied that is just what i should rely upon and      should therefore urge how impossible it is for you to lay down with      certainty a foregone conclusion such as that which you have      announced today and which events are not to influence merely      that you will remain in parliament and yet separate yourself from      the parliamentary system by which our government is carried on      then he said if it is necessary i will go out of      parliamentthe first part of the sentence was indistinctly      muttered but the purport such as i have described to which i      merely replied that i hoped not and that the country would have      something to say upon that too       no man can doubt that he is the strong man of this parliamentof      this political generation then it is asked is he honest but this      is a question which i think cannot justly be raised nor treated as      admissible in the smallest degree by those who have known and      worked with him he spoke of the immense multiplication of      details in public business and the enormous task imposed upon      available time and strength by the work of attendance in the house      of commons he agreed that it was extremely adverse to the growth      of greatness among our public men and he said the mass of public      business increased so fast that he could not tell what it was to      end in and did not venture to speculate even for a few years upon      the mode of administering public affairs he thought the      consequence was already manifest in its being not well done       it sometimes occurred to him whether it would after all be a good      arrangement to have the prime minister in the house of lords which      would get rid of the very encroaching duty of attendance on and      correspondence with the queen i asked if in that case it would not      be quite necessary that the leader in the commons should frequently      take upon himself to make decisions which ought properly to be      made by the head of the government he said certainly and that      that would constitute a great difficulty that although lord      melbourne might be very well adapted to take his part in such a      plan there were he believed difficulties in it under him when      lord j russell led the house of commons that when he led the      house in 1828 under the duke of wellington as premier he had a      very great advantage in the disposition of the duke to follow the      judgments of others in whom he had confidence with respect to all      civil matters he said it was impossible during the session even to      work the public business through the medium of the cabinet such is      the pressure upon time he told me he had suffered dreadfully in      his head on the left sidethat twentytwo or twentythree years      ago he injured the ear by the use of a detonating tube in shooting      since then he had always had a noise on that side and when he had      the work of office upon him this and the pain became scarcely      bearable at times as i understood him brodie told him that as      some overwork one part and some another he had overworked his      brain but he said that with this exception his health was good      it was pleasant to me to find and feel by actual contact as it were      though i had no suspicion of the contrary his manner as friendly      and as much unhurt as at any former period                                       v  before leaving office peel wrote to mr gladstone june 20 requesting him to ask his father whether it would be acceptable to him to be proposed to the queen for a baronetcy i should name him to the queen he said as the honoured representative of a great class of the community which has raised itself by its integrity and industry to high social eminence i should gratify also my own feeling by a mark of personal respect for a name truly worthy of such illustration as hereditary honour can confer john gladstone replied in becoming words but honestly mentioned that he had published his strong opinion of the injurious consequences that he dreaded from the stupendous experiment about to be made in commercial policy peel told him that this made no difference180                           lord george bentinck  at the close of the session a trivial incident occurred that caused mr gladstone a disproportionate amount of vexation for several months hume stated in the house that the colonial secretary had countersigned what was a lie in a royal patent appointing a certain indian judge the lie consisted in reciting that a judge then holding the post had resigned whereas he had not resigned and the correct phrase was that the queen had permitted him to retire lord george bentinck whose rage was then at its fiercest pricked up his ears and a day or two later declared that mr secretary gladstone had deliberately affirmed not through any oversight or inadvertence or thoughtlessness but designedly and of his own malice prepense that which in his heart he knew not to be true things of this sort may either be passed over in disdain or taken with logicians severity mr gladstone might well have contented himself with the defence that his signature had been purely formal and that every secretary of state is called upon to put his name to recitals of minute technical fact which he must take on trust from his officials as it was he chose to take bentincks reckless aspersion at its highest and the combat lasted for weeks and months bentinck got up the case with his usual industrious tenacity he insisted that the queens name stood at that moment in the degrading position of being prefixed to a proclamation that all her subjects knew to recite and to be founded upon falsehood he declared that the whole business was a job perpetrated by the outgoing ministers to fill up a post that was not vacant he imputed no corrupt motive to mr gladstone he admitted that mr gladstone was free from the betrayal and treachery practised by his political friends but he could not acquit him of having been in this particular affair the tool and the catspaw of two old foxes greedier and craftier than himself to all this unmannerly stuff the recipient of it only replied by holding its author the more tight to the point of the original offence the blood of his highland ancestors was up and the poets contest between eagle and serpent was not more dire the affair was submitted to lord stanley he reluctantly consented oct 29 to decide the single question whether bentinck was justified on the information before him in using the language quoted there was a dispute what information bentinck had before him and upon this point where bentincks course might in his own polite vocabulary be marked as pure shuffling lord stanley returned the papers feb 8 1847 and expressed his deep regret that he could bring about no more satisfactory result even so late as the spring of 1847 mr gladstone was only dissuaded by the urgent advice of lord lincoln and others from pursuing the fray it was so far as i know the only personal quarrel into which he ever allowed himself to be drawn  footnotes  172 perhaps i may refer to my life of cobden which had the great advantage of being read before publication by mr bright chapters xiv and xv  173 lord aberdeen to senior sept 1856 mrs simpsons many memories p 233  174 sibthorp asked peel in the h of c when gladstone and lincoln would appear peel replied that if s would take the chiltern hundreds g should stand against him s retorted that the chiltern hundreds is a place under government and he would never take place from peel but if p would dissolve he would welcome gladstone to lincolnor p himself and added privately that he would give p or g best bottle of wine in his cellar if he would come to lincoln and fight him fairlylord broughtons diaries  175 halifax papers  176 cobden also wrote to peel strongly urging him to hold on and peel replied with an effective defence of his own view life of cobden i chap 18  177 there is a name that ought to be associated with the success of these measures it is not the name of lord john russell neither is it my name sir the name which ought to be and will be associated with these measures is the name of a man who acting from pure and disinterested motives has advocated their cause with untiring energy and by appeals to reason expressed by an eloquence the more to be admired because it was unaffected and unadornedthe name which ought to be associated with the success of these measures is the name of richard cobden without scruple sir i attribute the success of these measures to him  178 see life of lord lyndhurst by lord campbell p 163  179 six years later nov 26 1852 mr gladstone in the house of commons said of cobden with words of characteristic qualificationagree you may in his general politics or you may not complain you may if you think you have cause of the mode and force with which in the freedom of debate he commonly states his opinions in this house but it is impossible for us to deny that those benefits of which we are now acknowledging the existence are in no small part at any rate due to the labours in which he has borne so prominent a share  180 parker iii pp 4345                                  chapter xi                        the tractarian catastrophe                               18411846       the movement of 1833 started out o£ the antiroman feelings of the      emancipation time it was antiroman as much as it was      antisectarian and antierastian it was to avert the danger of      people becoming romanists from ignorance of church principles this      was all changed in one important section of the party the      fundamental conceptions were reversed it was not the roman church      but the english church that was put on its trial from this      point of view the object of the movement was no longer to elevate      and improve an independent english church but to approximate it as      far as possible to what was assumed to be undeniablethe perfect      catholicity of romedean church   the fall of peel and the breakup of his party in the state coincided pretty nearly with a hardly less memorable rupture in that rising party in the church with which mr gladstone had more or less associated himself almost from its beginning two main centres of authority and leading in the land were thus at the same moment dislodged and dispersed a long struggle in secular concerns had come to a decisive issue and the longer struggle in religious concerns had reached a critical and menacing stage the reader will not wonder that two events so farreaching as the secession of newman and the fall of sir robert coupled as these public events were with certain importunities of domestic circumstance of which i shall have more to say by and by brought mr gladstone to an epoch in his life of extreme perturbation roughly it may be said to extend from 1845 to 1852  at the time of his resignation in the beginning of 1845 he wrote to lord john manners then his colleague at newark a curious account of his views on party life lord john was then acting with the young england group inspired by disraeli who has left a picture of them in sybil the most farseeing of all his novels                           to lord john manners       jan 30 1845you i have no doubt are disappointed as to the      working of a conservative government and so should i be if i were      to estimate its results by a comparison with the anticipations      which from a distance and in the abstract i had once entertained      of political life but now my expectations not only from this but      from any government are very small if they do a little good if      they prevent others from doing a good deal of evil if they      maintain an unblemished character it is my fixed conviction that      under the circumstances of the times i can as an independent member      of parliament for i am now virtually such ask no more and i do      entertain the strongest impression that if with your honourable      and upright mind you had been called upon for years to consult as      one responsible for the movements of great parliamentary bodies if      you thus had been accustomed to look into public questions at close      quarters your expectations from an administration and your      dispositions towards it would be materially changed       the principles and moral powers of government as such are sinking      day by day and it is not by laws and parliaments that they can be      renovated i must venture even one step further and say that      such schemes of regeneration as those which were propounded not i      am bound to add by you at manchester181 appear to me to be      most mournful delusions and their reissue for their real      parentage is elsewhere from the bosom of the party to which we      belong an omen of the worst kind if they were likely to obtain      currency under the new sanction they have received it is most easy      to complain as you do of laissezfaire and laissezaller nor      do i in word or in heart presume to blame you but i should sorely      blame myself if with my experience and convictions of the growing      impotence of government for its highest functions i were either      to recommend attempts beyond its powers which would react      unfavourably upon its remaining capabilities or to be a party to      proposed substitutes for its true moral and paternal work which      appear to me mere counterfeits                           religion at oxford  on this letter we may note in passing first that the tariff legislation did in the foundations what the young england party wished to do in a superficial and flimsy fashion and second it was the tariff legislation that drove back a rising tide of socialism both directly by vastly improving the condition of labour and indirectly by force of the doctrine of free exchange which was thus corroborated by circumstances of this we shall see more by and by  throughout the years of sir robert peels government mr gladstone had been keenly intent upon the progress of religious affairs at oxford from 1841 till the beginning of 1845 he says in a fragmentary note i continued a hardworking official man but with a decided predominance of religious over secular interests although i had little of direct connection with oxford and its teachers i was regarded in common fame as tarred with their brush and i was not so blind as to be unaware that for the clergy this meant not yet indeed prosecution but proscription and exclusion from advancement by either party in the state and for laymen a vague and indeterminate prejudice with serious doubts how far persons infected in this particular manner could have any real capacity for affairs sir robert peel must i think have exercised much selfdenial when he put me in his cabinet in 1843 the movement that began in 1833 had by the opening of the next decade revealed startling tendencies and its first stage was now slowly but unmistakeably passing into the second mr gladstone has told us182 how he stood at this hour of crisis how strongly he believed that the church of england would hold her ground and even revive the allegiance not only of the masses but of those large and powerful nonconforming bodies who were supposed to exist only as a consequence of the neglect of its duties by the national church he has told us also how little he foresaw the second phase of the oxford movementthe breakup of a distinguished and imposing generation of clergy the spectacle of some of the most gifted sons reared by oxford for the service of the church of england hurling at her head the hottest bolts of the vatican and along with this strange deflexion on one side a not less convulsive rationalist movement on the otherall ending in contention and estrangement and in suspicions worse than either because less accessible and more intractable                                      ii  the landmarks of the tractarian story are familiar and i do not ask the reader in any detail to retrace them the publication of froudes remains was the first flagrant beacon lighting the path of divergence from the lines of historical high churchmen in an essentially antiprotestant direction mr gladstone read the first instalment of this book 1838 with repeated regrets then came the blaze kindled by tract ninety 1841 this in the language of its author and his friends was the famous attempt to clear the articles from the glosses encrusting them like barnacles and to bring out the old catholic truth that man had done his worst to disfigure and to mutilate and yet in spite of all mans endeavour it was in the articles still mr gladstone as we have seen regarded tract ninety with uneasy doubts as to its drift its intentions the way in which the church and the world would take it this no ninety of tracts for the times which i read by desire of sir r inglis he writes to lord lyttelton is like a repetition of the publication of froudes remains and newman has again burned his fingers the most serious feature in the tract to my mind is that doubtless with very honest intentions and with his mind turned for the moment so entirely towards those inclined to defection and therefore occupying their point of view exclusively he has in writing it placed himself quite outside the church of england in point of spirit and sympathy as far as regards the proposition for which he intended mainly to argue i believe not only that he is right but that it is an a b c truth almost a truism of the reign of elizabeth namely that the authoritative documents of the church of england were not meant to bind all men to every opinion of their authors and particularly that they intended to deal as gently with prepossessions thought to look towards rome as the necessity of securing a certain amount of reformation would allow certainly also the terms in which newman characterises the present state of the church of england in his introduction are calculated to give both pain and alarm and the whole aspect of the tract is like the assumption of a new position                          tractarian landmarks  next followed the truly singular struggle for the university chair of poetry at the end of the same year between a nopopery candidate and a puseyite seldom surely has the service of the muses been pressed into so alien a debate mr gladstone was cut to the heart at the prospect of a sentence in the shape of a vote for this professorship passed by the university of oxford upon all that congeries of opinions which the rude popular notion associates with the tracts for the times such a sentence would be a disavowal by the university of catholic principles in the gross the association between catholic principles and the church of england would be miserably weakened and those who at all sympathised with the tracts would be placed in the position of aliens corporally within the pale but in spirit estranged or outcast if the church should be thus broken up there would be no space for catholicity between the rival pretensions of an ultraprotestantised or decatholicised english church and the communion of rome miserable choice these and other arguments are strongly pressed december 3 1841 in favour of an amicable compromise in a letter addressed to his close friend frederic rogers in the same letter mr gladstone says that he cannot profess to understand or to have studied the tracts on reserve183 he partakes perhaps in the popular prejudice against them anybody can now see in the coolness of distant time that it was these writings on reserve that roused not merely prejudice but fury in the public minda fury that without either justice or logic extended from hatred of romanisers to members of the church of rome itself it affected for the worse the feeling between england and ireland for in those days to be ultraprotestant was to be antiirish and it greatly aggravated first the storm about the maynooth grant in 1845 and then the far wilder storm about the papal aggression six years later                        the jerusalem bishopric  further fuel for excitement was supplied the same year 1841 in a fantastic project by which a bishop appointed alternately by great britain and prussia and with his headquarters at jerusalem was to take charge through a somewhat miscellaneous region of any german protestants or members of the church of england or anybody else who might be disposed to accept his authority the scheme stirred much enthusiasm in the religious world but it deepened alarm among the more logical of the high churchmen ashley and the evangelicals were keen for it as the blessed beginning of a restoration of israel and the king of prussia hoped to gain over the lutherans and others of his subjects by this sidedoor into true episcopacy politics were not absent and some hoped that england might find in the new protestant church such an instrument in those uncomfortable regions as russia possessed in the greek church and france in the latin dr arnold was delighted at the thought that the new church at jerusalem would comprehend persons using different liturgies and subscribing different articleshis favourite pattern for the church of england pusey at first rather liked the idea of a bishop to represent the ancient british church in the city of the holy sepulchre but newman and hope with a keener instinct for their position distrusted the whole design in root and branch as a betrayal of the church and pusey soon came to their mind with caustic scorn newman asked how the anglican church without ceasing to be a church could become an associate and protector of nestorians jacobites monophysites and all the heretics one could hear of and even form a sort of league with the mussulman against the greek orthodox and the latin catholics mr gladstone could not be drawn to go these lengths nobody could be more of a logician than mr gladstone when he liked no logician could wield a more trenchant blade but nobody ever knew better in complex circumstance the perils of the logical short cut hence according to his general manner in all dubious cases he moved slowly and laboured to remove practical grounds for objection ashley describes him october 16 at a dinner at bunsens rejoicing in the bishopric and proposing the health of the new prelate and this gave ashley pleasure for gladstone is a good man and a clever man and an industrious man184 while resolute against any plan for what hope called gathering up the scraps of christendom and making a new church out of them and resolute against what he himself called the inauguration of an experimental or fancy church mr gladstone declared himself ready to brave misconstruction for the sake of union with any christian men provided the terms of union were not contrary to sound principles with a strenuous patience that was thoroughly characteristic he set to work to bring the details of the scheme into an order conformable to his own views and he even became a trustee of the endowment fund two bishops in succession filled the see but in the fulness of time most men agreed with newman who never heard of any either good or harm that bishopric had ever done except what it had done for him to him it gave a final shake and brought him on to the beginning of the end185  in the summer of 1842 mr gladstone received confidences that amazed him here is a passage from his diary       july 31 1842walk with r williams to converse on the subject      of our recent letters i made it my object to learn from him the      general view of the ulterior section of the oxford writers and      their friends it is startling they look not merely to the renewal      and development of the catholic idea within the pale of the church      of england but seem to consider the main condition of that      development and of all health some tending even to say of all      life to be reunion with the church of rome as the see of peter      they recognise however authority in the church of england and      abide in her without love specifically fixed upon her to seek the      fulfilment of this work of reunion it is for example he said      the sole object of oakeleys life they do not look to any defined      order of proceedings in the way of means they consider that the      end is to be reached through catholicising the mind of the members      of the church of england but do not seem to feel that this can be      done to any great degree in working out and giving free scope to      her own rubrical system they have no strong feeling of revulsion      from actual evils in the church of rome first because they do not      wish to judge secondly especially not to judge the saints      thirdly they consider that infallibility is somewhere and nowhere      but there they could not remain in the church of england if they      thought that she dogmatically condemned anything that the church of      rome has defined de fide but they do and will remain on the      basis of the argument of tract 90 upon which after mental      conflict they have settled steadily down they regret what newman      has said strongly against the actual system of the church of rome      and they could not have affirmed though neither do they positively      deny it wherever roman doctrine de fide is oppugned they must      protest but short of this they render absolute obedience to their      ecclesiastical superiors in the church of england they expect to      work on in practical harmony with those who look mainly to the      restoration of catholic ideas on the foundation laid by the church      of england as reformed and who take a different view as to reunion      with rome in particular though of course desiring the reunion of      the whole body of christ all this is matter for very serious      consideration in the meantime i was anxious to put it down while      fresh                             position of newman  now was the time at which mr gladstones relations with manning and hope began to approach their closest newman the great enchanter in obedience to his bishop had dropped the issue of the tracts had withdrawn from all public discussion of ecclesiastical politics had given up his work in oxford and had retired with a neophyte or two to littlemore a hamlet on the outskirts of the ever venerable city there to pursue his theological studies to prepare translations of athanasius to attend to his little parish and generally to go about his own business so far as he might be permitted by the restlessness alike of unprovoked opponents and unsought disciples this was the autumn of 1843 in october manning sent to mr gladstone two letters that he had received from newman indicating only too plainly as they were both convinced that the foundations of their leaders anglicanism had been totally undermined by the sweeping repudiation alike by episcopal and university authority of the doctrines of tract ninety dr pusey on the other hand admitted that the expressions in newmans letter were portentous but did not believe that they necessarily meant secession in a man of the world this would not have been regarded as candid for newman says i formally told pusey that i expected to leave the church of england in the autumn of 1843 and begged him to tell others that no one might be taken by surprise or might trust me in the interval186 but newman has told us that he had from the first great difficulty in making dr pusey understand the differences between them the letters stand in the apologia chapter iv § 2 to tell their own tale to mr gladstone their shock was extreme not only by reason of the catastrophe to which they pointed but from the illomened shadow that they threw upon the writers probity of mind if not of heart i stagger to and fro like a drunken man he wrote to manning i am at my wits end he found some of newmans language forgive me if i say it more like the expressions of some faust gambling for his soul than the records of the inner life of a great christian teacher in his diary he puts it thus       oct 28 1843s simon and s jude st jamess 11 am with a      heavy heart another letter had come from manning enclosing a      second from newman which announced that since the summer of 1839      he had had the conviction that the church of rome is the catholic      church and ours not a branch of the catholic church because not in      communion with rome that he had resigned st marys because he      felt he could not with a safe conscience longer teach in her that      by the article in the british critic on the catholicity of the      english church he had quieted his mind for two years that in his      letter to the bishop of oxford written most reluctantly he as      the best course under the circumstances committed himself again      that his alarms revived with that wretched affair of the jerusalem      bishopric and had increased ever since that mannings      interference had only made him the more realise his views that      manning might make what use he pleased of his letters he was      relieved of a heavy heart yet he trusted that god would beep him      from hasty steps and resolves with a doubting conscience how are      the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished  with the characteristic spirit with which in politics and in every other field he always insisted on espying patches of blue sky where others saw unbroken cloud he was amazed that newman did not in spite of all the pranks of the oxford heads perceive the english church to be growing in her members more catholic from year to year and how much more plain and undeniable was the sway of catholic principles within its bounds since the time when he entertained no shadow of doubt about it but while repeating his opinion that in many of the tracts the language about the roman church had often been far too censorious mr gladstone does not nor did he ever shrink from designating conversion to that church by the unflinching names of lapse and fall187 as he was soon to put it the temptation towards the church of rome of which some are conscious has never been before my mind in any other sense than as other plain and flagrant sins have been before it188  two days later he wrote to manning again        oct 30 1843  i have still to say that my impressions      though without more opportunity of testing them i cannot regard      them as final are still and strongly to the effect that upon the      promulgation of those two letters to the world newman stands in      the general view a disgraced manand all men all principles      with which he has had to do disgraced in proportion to the      proximity of their connection and further i am persuaded that were      he not spellbound and entranced he could not fail to see the gross      moral incoherence of the parts of his two statements and that were      i upon the terms which would warrant it i should feel it my duty      at a time when as now summa res agitur to tell him so after      having however tried my own views by reference to some other      mind for instance to your own but surely it will be said that his      committing himself again was simply a deliberate protestation of      what he knew to be untrue i have no doubt of his having proceeded      honestly no doubt that he can show it but i say that those two      letters are quite enough to condemn a man in whom one has no      greek pistis êthikê much more then one whom a great majority of the      community regard with prejudice and deep suspicion with regard      to your own feelings believe me that i enter into them and indeed      our communications have now for many years been too warm free and      confiding to make it necessary for me as i trust to say what a      resource and privilege it is to me to take counsel with you upon      those absorbing subjects and upon the fortunes of the church to      which i desire to feel with you that life strength and all means      and faculties ought freely to be devoted and indeed from such      devotion alone can they derive anything of true value189                               wards ideal  the next blow was struck in the summer of 1844 by wards ideal of a christian church which had the remarkable effect of harassing and afflicting all the three high campsthe historical anglicans the puseyites and moderate tractarians and finally the newmanites and moderate romanisers190 the writer was one of the most powerful dialecticians of the day defiant aggressive implacable in his logic unflinching in any stand that he chose to take the masterrepresentative of tactics and a temper like those to which laud and strafford gave the pungent name of thorough it was not its theology still less its history that made his book the signal for the explosion it was his audacious proclamation that the whole cycle of roman doctrine was gradually possessing numbers of english churchmen and that he himself a clergyman in orders and holding his fellowship on the tenure of church subscription had in so subscribing to the articles renounced no single roman doctrine this and not the six hundred pages of argumentation was the ringing challenge that provoked a plain issue precipitated a decisive struggle and brought the first stage of tractarianism to a close                               article on ward  it was impossible that mr gladstone even in the thick of his tariffs his committees and deputations his cabinet duties and all the other absorbing occupations of an important minister in strong harness should let a publication in his view so injurious pass in silence191 with indignation he flew to his intrepid pen and dealt as trenchantly with ward as ward himself had dealt trenchantly with the reformers and all others whom he found planted in his dialectic way mr gladstone held the book up to stringent reproof for its capricious injustice for the triviality of its investigations of fact for the savageness of its censures for the wild and wanton opinions broached in its pages for the infatuation of mind manifested in some of its arguments and for the lamentable circumstance that it exhibited a far greater debt in mental culture to mr john stuart mill than to the whole range of christian divines in a sentence ward had launched on the great deep of human controversy as frail a bark as ever carried sail and his reviewer undoubtedly let loose upon it as shrewd a blast as ever blew from the Æolian wallet the article was meant for the quarterly review and it is easy to imagine the dire perplexities of lockharts editorial mind in times so fervid and so distracted the practical issue after all was not the merits or the demerits of cranmer ridley latimer nor the real meaning of hooker jewel bull but simply what was to be done to ward lockhart wrote to murray that he had very seriously studied the article and studied wards book and not only these but also the articles and the canons of the church and he could not approve of the review committing itself to a judgment on the line proper to be taken by the authorities of church and university and the expression of such a judgment he suspected to be mr gladstones main object in writing mr gladstone describing himself most truly as one of those soldiers who do not know when they are beat saw his editor declared that what he sought was three things first that the process of mobbing out by invective and private interpretations is bad and should be stopped second that the church of england does not make assent to the proceedings of the reformation a term of communion and third that before even judicial proceedings in one direction due consideration should be had of what judicial proceedings in another direction consistency might entail if that game were once begun as ward himself had virtually put it show me how any of the recognised parties in the church can subscribe in a natural sense before you condemn me for subscribing in a nonnatural192 the end was a concordat between editor and contributor followed by an immense amount of irksome revision mutilation and rerevision reducing the argument in some places almost to tatters but the writer was in the long run satisfied that things were left standing in it which it was well to plant in a periodical like the quarterly review  we have a glimpse of the passionate agitation into which this great controversy partly theologic partly moral threw mr gladstone       feb 6breakfast at mr macaulays conversation chiefly on      aristotles politics and on the oxford proceedings i grew hot for      which ignoscat deus feb 13oxford 15 we were in the      theatre ward was like himself honest to a fault as little like      an advocate in his line of argument as well could he and strained      his theology even a point further than before the forms are      venerable the sight imposing the act is fearful the degradation      of ward if it did not leave strong hope of its revisal by law  to dr pusey he writes feb 7       indignation at this proposal to treat mr newman worse than a dog      really makes me mistrust my judgment as i suppose one should      always do when any proposal seeming to present an aspect of      incredible wickedness is advanced feb 17i concur with my      whole heart and soul in the desire for repose and i fully believe      that the gift of an interval of reflection is that which would be      of all gifts the most precious to us all which would restore the      faculty of deliberation now almost lost in storms and would afford      the best hope both of the development of the soundest elements that      are in motion amongst us and of the mitigation or absorption of      those which are more dangerous  in the proceedings at oxford against ward february 13 1845 mr gladstone voted in the minority both against the condemnation of the book and against the proposal to strip its writer of his university degree he held that the censure combined condemnation of opinions with a declaration of personal dishonesty and the latter question he held to be one not fit for the adjudication of a human tribunal  all this has a marked place in mr gladstones mental progress though primarily and ostensibly the concern of the established church yet the series of proceedings that had begun with the attack on hampden in 1836 and then were followed down to our own day by academical ecclesiastical and legal censures and penalties or attempts at censure and penalty on newman pusey maurice gorham essays and reviews colenso and ended if they have yet ended in a host of judgments affecting minor personages almost as good as namelessall constitute a chapter of extraordinary importance in the general history of english toleration extending in its consequences far beyond the pale of the communion immediately concerned it was a long and painful journey often unedifying not seldom squalid with crooked turns not a few and before it was over casting men into strange companionship upon bleak and hazardous shores mr gladstone though he probably was not one of those who are as if born by nature tolerant was soon drawn by circumstance to look with favour upon that particular sort of toleration which arose out of the need for comprehension when the six doctors condemned pusey june 1843 for preaching heresy and punished him by suspension mr gladstone was one of those who signed a vigorous protest against a verdict and a sentence passed upon an offender without hearing him and without stating reasons this was at least the good beginning of an education in liberal rudiments                                      iii                              newmans secession  in october 1845 the earthquake came newman was received into the roman communion of this step mr gladstone said that it has never yet been estimated at anything like the full amount of its calamitous importance the leader who had wielded a magicians power in oxford was followed by a host of other converts more than once i have heard mr gladstone tell the story how about this time he sought from manning an answer to the question that sorely perplexed him what was the common bond of union that led men of intellect so different of character so opposite of such various circumstance to come to the same conclusion mannings answer was slow and deliberate their common bond is their want of truth i was surprised beyond measure mr gladstone would proceed and startled at his judgment193  most ordinary churchmen remained where they were an erastian statesman of our own time when alarmists ran to him with the news that a couple of noblemen and their wives had just gone over to rome replied with calm show me a couple of grocers and their wives who have gone over then you will frighten me the great body of church people stood firm and so did pusey keble gladstone and so too for half a dozen years to come did his two closest friends manning and hope the dominant note in mr gladstones mind was clear and it was constant as he put it to manning august 11845that one should entertain love for the church of rome in respect of her virtues and her glories is of course right and obligatory but one is equally bound under the circumstances of the english church in direct antagonism with rome to keep clearly in view their very fearful opposites  tidings of the great secession happened to find mr gladstone in a rather singular atmosphere in the course of 1842 to the keen distress of her relatives his sister had joined the roman church and her somewhat peculiar nature led to difficulties that taxed patience and resource to the uttermost she had feelings of warm attachment to her brother and spoke strongly in that sense to dr wiseman and it was for the purpose of carrying out some plans of his fathers for her advantage that in the autumn of 1845 september 24november 18 mr gladstone passed nearly a couple of months in germany the duty was heavy and dismal but the journey brought him into a society that could not be without effect upon his impressionable mind at munich he laid the foundation of one of the most interesting and cherished friendships of his life hopescott had already made the acquaintance of dr döllinger and he now begged mr gladstone on no account to fail to present himself to him as well as to other learned and political men good catholics and good men with no ordinary talent and information nothing mr gladstone once wrote in after years ever so much made me anglican versus roman as reading in döllinger over forty years ago the history of the fourth century and athanasius contra mundum here is his story to his wife       munich sept 30 1845yesterday evening after dinner with two      travelling companions an italian negoziante and a german i must      needs go and have a shillings worth of the augsburg opera where      we heard mozart don juan well played and very respectably      sung today i have spent my evening differently in tea and      infinite conversation with dr döllinger who is one of the first      among the roman catholic theologians of germany a remarkable and a      very pleasing man his manners have great simplicity and i am      astonished at the way in which a busy student such as he is can      receive an intruder his appearance is singular to say just      compounded of those of two men who are among the most striking in      appearance of our clergy newman and dr mill he surprises me by      the extent of his information and the way in which he knows the      details of what takes place in england most of our conversation      related to it he seemed to me one of the most liberal and catholic      in mind of all the persons of his communion whom i have known      tomorrow i am to have tea with him again and there is to be a      third dr görres who is a man of eminence among them do not      think he has designs upon me indeed he disarms my suspicions in      that respect by what appears to me a great sincerity                                 dr dÖllinger       oct 2on tuesday after post i began to look about me and      though i have not seen all the sights of munich i have certainly      seen a great deal that is interesting in the way of art and having      spent a good deal of time in dr döllingers company last night      till one oclock i have lost my heart to him what i like perhaps      most or what crowns other causes of liking towards him is that      he like rio seems to take hearty interest in the progress of      religion in the church of england apart from the so to speak      party question between us and to have a mind to appreciate good      wherever he can find it for instance when in speaking of wesley i      said that his own views and intuitions were not heretical and that      if the ruling power in our church had had energy and a right mind      to turn him to account or if he had been in the church of rome i      was about to add he would then have been a great saint or      something to that effect but i hesitated thinking it perhaps too      strong and even presumptuous but he took me up and used the very      words declaring that to be his opinion again speaking of      archbishop leighton he expressed great admiration of his piety and      said it was so striking that he could not have been a real      calvinist he is a great admirer of england and english character      and he does not at all slur over the mischief with which religion      has to contend in germany lastly i may be wrong but i am      persuaded he in his mind abhors a great deal that is too frequently      taught in the church of rome last night he spoke with such a      sentiment of the doctrine that was taught on the subject of      indulgences which moved luther to resist them and he said he      believed it was true that the preachers represented to the people      that by money payments they could procure the release souls from      purgatory i told him that was exactly the doctrine i had heard      preached in messina and he said a priest preaching so in germany      would be suspended by his bishop       last night he invited several of his friends whom i wanted to meet      to an entertainment which consisted first of weak tea immediately      followed by meat supper with beer and wine and sweets for two      hours was i there in the midst of five german professors or four      and the editor of a paper who held very interesting discussions i      could only follow them in part and enter into them still less as      none of them except dr d seemed to speak any tongue but their      own with any freedom but you would have been amused to see and      hear them and me in the midst i never saw men who spoke together      in a way to make one another inaudible as they did always      excepting dr döllinger who sat like rogers being as he is a much      more refined man than the rest but of the others i assure you      always two sometimes three and once all four were speaking at      once very loud each not trying to force the attention of the      others but to be following the current of his own thoughts one of      them was dr görres194 who in the time of napoleon edited a      journal that had a great effect in rousing germany to arms      unfortunately he spoke more thickly than any of them195       at badenbaden october 16 he made the acquaintance of mrs      craven the wife of the secretary of the stuttgart mission and      authoress of the récit dune soeur some of the personages of that      alluring book were of the company i have drunk tea several times      at her house and have had two or three long conversations with      them on matters of religion they are excessively acute and also      full of christian sentiment but they are much more difficult to      make real way with than a professor of theology because they are      determined what is vulgarly called to go the whole hog just as      in england usually when you find a woman antipopish in spirit      she will push the argument against them to all extremes                                 further advance       it was at the same time that he read bunsens book on the church      it is dismal he wrote home to mrs gladstone and i must write      to him to say so as kindly as i can bunsen would seem all the      more dismal from the contrast with the spiritual graces of these      catholic ladies and the ripe thinking and massive learning of one      who was still the great catholic doctor at no time in mr      gladstones letters to manning or to hope is there a single      faltering accent in respect of rome the question is not for an      instant or in any of his moods open he never doubts nor wavers      none the less these impressions of his german journey would rather      confirm than weaken his theological faith within the boundaries of      anglican form and institution with my whole soul i am convinced      he says to manning june 23 1850 that if the roman system is      incapable of being powerfully modified in spirit it never can be      the instrument of the work of god among us the faults and the      virtues of england are alike against it                             the lady hewley case  i need spend no time in pointing out how inevitably these new currents drew mr gladstone away from the old moorings of his first book even in 1844 he had parted company with the high ecclesiastical principles of good tories like sir robert inglis peel to his great honour in that year brought in what macaulay truly called an honest an excellent bill introduced from none but the best and purest motives it arose from a judicial decision in what was known as the lady hewley case and its object was nothing more revolutionary or latitudinarian than to apply to unitarian chapels the same principle of prescription that protected gentlemen in the peaceful enjoyment of their estates and their manorhouses the equity of the thing was obvious in 1779 parliament had relieved protestant dissenting ministers from the necessity of declaring their belief in certain church articles including especially those affecting the doctrine of the trinity in 1813 parliament had repealed the act of william iii that made it blasphemy to deny that doctrine this legislation rendered unitarian foundations legal and the bill extended to unitarian congregations the same prescriptions as covered the titles of other voluntary bodies to their places of worship their schoolhouses and their burialgrounds but what was thus a question of property was treated as if it were a question of divinity bigotry sought aid from chicane and a tremendous clamour was raised by anglicans wesleyans presbyterians not because they had an inch of locus standi in the business but because unitarianism was scandalous heresy and sin follett made a masterly lawyers speech sheil the speech of a glittering orator guarding unitarians by the arguments that had or perhaps i should say had not guarded irish catholics peel and gladstone made political speeches lofty and sound and macaulay the speech of an eloquent scholar and a reasoner manfully enforcing principles both of law and justice with a luxuriance of illustration all his own from jurists of imperial rome sages of old greece hindoos peruvians mexicans and tribunals beyond the mississippi196 we do not often enjoy such parliamentary nights in our time  mr gladstone supported the proposal on the broadest grounds of unrestricted private judgment       i went into the subject laboriously he says and satisfied myself      that this was not to be viewed as a mere quieting of titles based      on lapse of time but that the unitarians were the true lawful      holders because though they did not agree with the puritan      opinions they adhered firmly to the puritan principle which was      that scripture was the rule without any binding interpretation and      that each man or body or generation must interpret for himself      this measure in some ways heightened my churchmanship but      depressed my churchandstatesmanship  far from feeling that there was any contrariety between his principles of religious belief and those on which legislation in their case ought to proceed he said that the only use he could make of these principles was to apply them to the decisive performance of a great and important act founded on the everlasting principles of truth and justice sheil who followed mr gladstone made a decidedly striking observation he declared how delighted he was to hear from such high authority that the bill was perfectly reconcilable with the strictest and the sternest principles of state conscience i cannot doubt he continued that the right hon gentleman the champion of free trade will ere long become the advocate of the most unrestricted liberty of thought time was to justify sheils acute prediction unquestionably the line of argument that suggested it was a great advance from the arguments of 1838 of which macaulay had said that they would warrant the roasting of dissenters at slow fires                                     iv  in this vast field of human interest what engaged and inflamed him was not in the main place that solicitude for personal salvation and sanctification which under sharp stress of argument of pious sensibility of spiritual panic now sent so many flocking into the roman fold it was at bottom more like the passion of the great popes and ecclesiastical masterbuilders for strengthening and extending the institutions by which faith is spread its lamps trimmed afresh its purity secured what wrung him with affliction was the laying waste of the heritage of the lord the promise he cried indeed stands sure to the church and the elect in the farthest distance there is peace truth glory but what a leap to it over what a gulf for himself the old dilemma of his early years still tormented him i wish he writes to manning march 8 1846 good humouredly i could get a synodical decision in favour of my retirement from public life for i profess to remain there to myself for the service of the church and my views of the mode of serving her are getting so fearfully wide of those generally current that even if they be sound they may become wholly unavailable the question whether the service of the church can be most effectually performed in parliament was incessantly present to his mind manning pressed him in one direction the inward voice drew him in the other i could write down in a few lines he says to manning the measures after the adoption of which i should be prepared to say to a young man entering life if you wish to serve the church do it in the sanctuary and not in parliament unless he were otherwise determined by his station and not always then it must depend upon his inward vocation and should not think it at all absurd to say the same thing to some who have already placed themselves in this latter sphere for when the end is attained of letting the church help herself and when it is recognised that active help can no longer be given the function of serving the church in the state such as it was according to the old idea dies of itself and what remains of duty is of a character essentially different then a pregnant passageit is the essential change now in progress from the catholic to the infidel idea of the state which is the determining element in my estimate of this matter and which has i think no place in yours for i hold and believe that when that transition has once been effected the state never can come back to the catholic idea by means of any agency from within itself that if at all it must be by a sort of reconversion from without i am not of those excellent as i think them who say remain and bear witness for the truth there is a place where witness is ever to be borne for truth that is to say for full and absolute truth but it is not there197  he reproaches himself with being actively engaged in carrying on a process of lowering the religious tone of the state letting it down demoralising it and assisting in its transition into one which is mechanical the objects that warrant public life in one in whose case executive government must be an element must be very special true that in all probability the church will hold her nationality in substance beyond our day i think she will hold it as long as the monarchy subsists so long the church will need parliamentary defence but in what form the dissenters had no members for universities and yet their real representation was far better organised in proportion to its weight than the church though formally not organised at all strength with the people will for our day at least be the only effectual defence of the church in the house of commons as the want of it is now our weakness there it is not everything that calls itself a defence that is really such198                          hopes for the church  manning expressed a strong fear amounting almost to a belief that the church of england must split asunder nothing can be firmer in my mind mr gladstone replied aug 31 1846 than the opposite idea she will live through her struggles she has a great providential destiny before her recollect that for a century and a half a much longer period than any for which puritan and catholic principles have been in conflict within the church of england jansenist and antijansenist dwelt within the church of rome with the unity of wolf and lamb their differences were not absorbed by the force of the church they were in full vigour when the revolution burst upon both then the breach between nation and church became so wide as to make the rivalries of the two church sections insignificant and so to cause their fusion later he thinks that he finds a truer analogy between the superstition and idolatry that gnaws and corrodes the life of the roman church and the puritanism that with at least as much countenance from authority abides in the english church there are two systems he says in the english church vitally opposed to one another and if they were equally developed they could not subsist together in the same sphere if puritanical doctrines were the base of episcopal and collegiate teaching then the church must either split or become heretical as it is the basis is on the whole antipuritanic and what we should call catholic the conflict may go on as now and with a progressive advance of the good principle against the bad one that has been on the whole the course of things during our lifetime and to judge from present signs it is the will of god that it should so continue dec 7 1846  the following to mr phillimore sums up the case as he then believed it to stand june 24 1847        the church is now in a condition in which her children may and      must desire that she should keep her national position and her      civil and proprietary rights and that she should by degrees obtain      the means of extending and of strengthening herself not only by      covering a greater space but by a more vigorous organisation her      attaining to this state of higher health depends in no small degree      upon progressive adaptations of her state and her laws to her ever      enlarging exigencies these depend upon the humour of the state      and the state cannot and will not be in good humour with her if      she insists upon its being in bad humour with all other communions       it seems to me therefore that while in substance we should all      strive to sustain her in her national position we shall do well on      her behalf to follow these rules to part earlier and more freely      and cordially than heretofore with such of her privileges here      and there as may be more obnoxious than really valuable and some      such she has and further not to presume too much to give      directions to the state as to its policy with respect to other      religious bodies this is not political expediency as opposed to      religious principle nothing did so much damage to religion as the      obstinate adherence to a negative repressive and coercive course      for a century and more from the revolution it brought us nothing      but outwardly animosities and inwardly lethargy the revival of a      livelier sense of duty and of god is now beginning to tell in the      altered policy of the church as her sense of her spiritual work      rises she is becoming less eager to assert her exclusive claim      leaving that to the state as a matter for itself to decide and she      also begins to forego more readily but cautiously her external      prerogatives  footnotes  181 some proceedings i think of mr disraeli and his young england

has made england great among the nations of the world that is not      strongly developed and plainly traceable in our universities for      eight hundred or a thousand years they have been intimately      associated with everything that has concerned the highest interests      of the countrygladstone   in 1847 the fortunes of a general election brought mr gladstone into relations that for many years to come deeply affected his political course as a planets orbit has puzzled astronomers until they discover the secret of its irregularities in the attraction of an unseen and unsuspected neighbour in the firmament so some devious motions of this great luminary of ours were perturbations due in fact to the influence of his new constituency as we have seen mr gladstone quitted newark when he entered the cabinet to repeal the corn law at the end of 1846 writing to lord lyttelton from fasque he tells him i wish to be in parliament but coldly feeling at the same time that i ought to wish it warmly on many grounds but my father is so very keen in his protective opinions and i am so very decidedly of the other way of thinking that i look forward with some reluctance and regret to what must when it happens place me in marked and public contrast with him the thing soon happened       i remained he says without a seat until the dissolution in june      1847 but several months before this occurred it had become known      that mr estcourt would vacate his seat for oxford and i became a      candidate it was a serious campaign the constituency much to its      honour did not stoop to fight the battle on the ground of      protection but it was fought and that fiercely on religious      grounds there was an incessant discussion and i may say      dissection of my character and position in reference to the oxford      movement this cut very deep for it was a discussion which each      member of the constituency was entitled to carry on for himself      the upshot was favourable the liberals supported me gallantly so      did many zealous churchmen apart from politics and a good number      of moderate men so that i was returned by a fair majority i held      the seat for eighteen years but with five contests and a final      defeat  the other sitting member after the retirement of mr estcourt was sir robert harry inglis who had beaten peel by a very narrow majority in the memorable contest for the university seat on the final crisis of the catholic question in 1829 he was blessed with a genial character and an open and happy demeanour and the fact that he was equipped with a full store of sincere and inexorable prejudices made it easy for him to be the most upright honourable kindly and consistent of political men repeal of the test acts relief of the catholics the reform bill relief of the jews reform of the irish church the grant to maynooth the repeal of the corn lawsone after another he had stoutly resisted the whole catalogue of revolutionising change so manful a record made his seat safe in the struggle for the second seat mr gladstones friends encountered first mr cardwell a colleague of his as secretary of the treasury in the late government cardwell was deep in the confidence and regard of sir robert peel and he earned in after years the reputation of an honest and most capable administrator but in these earlier days the illnatured called him peelandwater others labelled him latitudinarian and indifferent and though he had the support of peel promised before mr gladstones name as candidate was announced he thought it wise at a pretty early hour to withdraw from a triangular fight the old highanddry party and the evangelical party combined to bring out mr round if he had achieved no sort of distinction mr round had at least given no offence above all he had kept clear of all those tractarian innovations which had been finally stamped with the censure of the university two years before                           oxford supporters  charles wordsworth his old tutor and now warden of glenalmond found it hard to give mr gladstone his support because he himself held to the high principle of state conscience while the candidate seemed more than ever bent on the rival doctrine of social justice mr hallam joined his committee and what that learned veterans adhesion was in influence among older men that of arthur clough was among the younger northcote described clough to mr gladstone as a very favourable specimen of a class growing in numbers and importance among the younger oxford men a friend of carlyles frank newmans and others of that stamp well read in german literature and an admirer of german intellect but also a still deeper admirer of dante just now busily taking all his opinions to pieces and not beginning to put them together again but so earnest and good that he might be trusted to work them into something better than his friends inclined to fear ruskin again who had the year before published the memorable second volume of his modern painters he was still well under thirty was on the right side and the oxford chairman is sure that mr gladstone will appreciate at its full value the support of such high personal merit and extraordinary natural genius scott the learned grecian who had been beaten along with mr gladstone in the contest for the ireland scholarship

eighteen years off he had reached the dignity of a bachelor of divinity but nearly all the rest were no more than junior masters  routh the old president of magdalen declined to vote for him on the wellestablished ground that christ church had no business to hold both seats mr gladstone at once met this by the dexterous proposition that though christ church was not entitled to elect him against the wish of the other colleges yet the other colleges were entitled to elect him if they liked by giving him a majority not made up of christ church votes his eldest brother had written to tell him in terms of affectionate regret that he could take no part in the election mere political differences would be secondary but in the case of a university religion came first and there it was impossible to separate a candidate from his religious opinions when the time came however partly under strong pressure from sir john thomas gladstone took a more lenient view and gave his brother a vote  the round men pointed triumphantly to their heros votes on maynooth and on the dissenters chapels bill and insisted on the urgency of upholding the principles of the united church of england and ireland in their full integrity the backers of mr gladstone retorted by recalling their champions career how in 1834 he first made himself known by his resistance to the admission of dissenters to the universities how in 1841 he threw himself into the first general move for the increase of the colonial episcopate which had resulted in the erection of eleven new sees in six years how zealously with energy and money he had laboured for a college training for the episcopalian clergy in scotland how instrumental he was in 1846 during the few months for which he held the seals of secretary of state in erecting four colonial bishoprics how the society for the propagation of the gospel through the mouth of the archbishop of canterbury himself had thanked him for his services how long he had been an active supporter of the great societies for the spread of church principles the propagation of church doctrines and the erection of church fabrics as for the dissenters chapels bill it was an act of simple justice and involved no principles at issue between the church and dissent and mr gladstones masterly exposition of the tendency of dissent to drop one by one all the vital truths of christianity was proclaimed to be a real service to the church the reader will thus see the lie of the land what it meant to be member for a university and why mr gladstone thought the seat the highest of electoral prizes                               the contest  a circular was issued impugning his position on protestant grounds i humbly trust wrote mr gladstone in reply july 26 that its writers are not justified in exhibiting me to the world as a person otherwise than heartily devoted to the doctrine and constitution of our reformed church but i will never consent to adopt as the test of such doctrine a disposition to identify the great and noble cause of the church of england with the restraint of the civil rights of those who differ from her much was made of mr gladstones refusal to vote for the degradation of ward people wrote to the newspapers that it was an admitted and notorious fact that a sister of mr gladstones under his own influence had gone over to the church of rome200 the fable was retracted but at once revived in the still grosser untruth that he habitually employed a jesuitical system of argument to show that nobody need leave the church of england because all might be had there that was to be enjoyed in the church of rome maurice published a letter to a london clergyman vigorously remonstrating against the bigoted spirit that this election was warming into life and fervently protesting against making a belief in the nicene creed into the same thing as an opinion about a certain way of treating the property of unitarians one artifice of this kind said maurice has been practised in this election which it makes me blush to speak of mr ward called the reformation a vile and accursed thing mr gladstone voted against a certain measure for the condemnation of mr ward therefore he spoke of the reformation as a vile and accursed thing i should not have believed it possible that such a conclusion had been drawn from such premisses even by our religious press  the worthy mr round on the other hand was almost impregnable a diligent scrutiny at last dragged the dark fact to the light of day that he had actually sat on peels election committee at the time of catholic emancipation in 1829 and had voted for him against inglis so it appears said the mocking gladstonians that the protestant mr round was willing to lend a helping hand to the first of a series of measures which are considered by his supporters as fraught with danger to the countrys very best interests a still more sinister rumour was next bruited abroad that mr round attended a dissenting place of worship and he was constrained to admit that once in 1845 and thrice in 1846 he had been guilty of this blacksliding the lost ground however was handsomely recovered by a public declaration that the very rare occasions on which he had been present at other modes of christian worship had only confirmed his affection and reverential attachment to the services and formularies of his own church                          victory at the poll  the nomination was duly made in the sheldonian theatre july 29 the scene of so many agitations in these fiery days inglis was proposed by a canon of christ church round by the master of balliol and gladstone by dr richards the rector of exeter the prime claim advanced for him by his proposer was his zeal for the english church in word and deed above all his energy in securing that wherever the english church went thither bishoprics should go too besides all this his master work he had found time to spare not only for public business of the commonwealth but for the study of theology philosophy and the arts201 then the voting began the gladstonians went into the battle with 1100 promises northcote202 passing vigilant days in the convocation house sent daily reports to mr gladstone at fasque peel went up to vote for him splitting for inglis ashley went up to vote against him at the close of the second day things looked well but there was no ground for overconfidence inglis was six hundred ahead of gladstone and gladstone only a hundred and twenty ahead of round the next day round fell a little more behind and when the end came august 3 the figures stoodinglis 1700 gladstone 997 round 824 giving gladstone a majority of 173 over his competitor  numbers were not the only important point when the poll came to be analysed by eager statisticians the decision of the electors was found to have a weight not measured by an extra hundred and seventy votes for example mr gladstone had among his supporters twentyfive doublefirsts against seven for round and of single firstclasses he had one hundred and fiftyseven against rounds sixtysix of ireland and hertford scholars mr gladstone had nine to two and three to one respectively and of chancellors prizemen who voted he had fortyfive against twelve of fellows of colleges he had two hundred and eighteen against one hundred and twentyeight and his majority in this class was highest where the elections to fellowships were open the heads of the colleges told a different tale of these sixteen voted for round and only four for gladstone this discrepancy it was that gave its significance to the victory sitting in the convocation house watching the last casual voters drop in at the rate of two or three an hour through the summer afternoon the ever faithful northcote wrote to mr gladstone at fasque       since i have been here the contest has seemed even more      interesting than it did in london the effect of the contest itself      has apparently been good it has brought together the younger men      without distinction of party and has supplied the elements of a      very noble party which will now look to you as a leader i think      men of all kinds are prepared to trust you and though each feels      that you will probably differ from his set in some particulars      each seems disposed to waive objections for the sake of the general      good he expects       the victory is not looked upon as puseyite it is a victory of      the masters over the hebdomadal board and as such a very important      one the heads felt it their last chance and are said to have      expressed themselves accordingly the provost of queens who is      among the dissatisfied supporters of round said the other day he      would rather be represented by an old woman than by a young man      it is not as a maynoothian that you are dreaded here though they      use the cry against you and though that is the country feeling but      as a possible reformer and a man who thinks on the other hand the      young men exult partly in the hope that you will do something for      the university yourself partly in the consciousness that they have      shown the strength of the magisterial party by carrying you against      the opposition of the heads and have proved their title to be      considered an important element of the university they do not seem      yet to be sufficiently united to effect great things but there is      a large amount of ability and earnestness which only wants      direction and this contest has tended to unite them puseyism      seems rather to be a name of the past though there are still      puseyites of importance marriott mozley and church appear to be      regarded as leaders but church who is now abroad is looked upon      as something more and i am told may be considered on the whole      the fairest exponent of the feelings of the place stanley jowett      temple and others are great names in what is nicknamed the      germanising party lake and perhaps i should say temple hold an      intermediate position between the two parties whatever may have      been the evils attendant on the puseyite movement and i believe      they were neither few nor small it has been productive of great      results and it is not a little satisfactory to see how its      distinctive features are dying away and the spirit surviving      instead of the spirit departing and leaving a great sham behind it                       peculiarity of election  of the many strange positions to which in his long and ardent life mr gladstone was brought none is more startling than to find him as in this curious moment at oxford the common rallyingpoint of two violently antagonistic sections of opinion dr pusey supported him stanley and jowett supported him the old school who looked on oxford as the ancient and peculiar inheritance of the church were zealous for him the new school who deemed the university an organ not of the church but of the nation eagerly took him for their champion a great ecclesiastical movement reviving authority and tradition had ended in complete academic repulse in 1845 it was now to be followed by an antiecclesiastical movement critical sceptical liberal scornful of authority doubtful of tradition yet both the receding force and the rising force united to swell the stream that bore mr gladstone to triumph at the poll the fusion did not last the two bands speedily drew off into their rival camps to arm themselves in the new conflict for mastery between obscurantism and illumination the victor was left with his laurels in what too soon proved to be after all a vexed and precarious situation that he could neither hold with freedom nor quit with honour  meanwhile he thoroughly enjoyed his much coveted distinction                            to mrs gladstone       exeter coll nov 2 1847this morning in company with sir r

must here pause for material affairs of money and business with which as a rule in the case of its heroes the public is considered to have little concern they can no more be altogether omitted here than the bills acceptances renewals notes of hand and all the other financial apparatus of his printers and publishers can be left out of the story of sir walter scott not many pages will be needed though this brevity will give the reader little idea of the preoccupations with which they beset a not inconsiderable proportion of mr gladstones days a few sentences in a biography many a time mean long chapters in a life and what looked like an incident turns out to be an epoch  sir stephen glynne possessed a small property in staffordshire of something less than a hundred acres of land named the oak farm near stourbridge and under these acres were valuable seams of coal and ironstone for this he refused an offer of fiveandthirty thousand pounds in 1835 and under the advice of an energetic and sanguine agent proceeded to its rapid development on the double marriage in 1839 sir stephen associated his two brothersinlaw with himself to the modest extent of onetenth share each in an enterprise that seemed of high prospective value their interests were acquired through their wives and it is to be presumed that they had no opportunity of making a personal examination of the concern the adventurous agent now managerinchief of the business rapidly extended operations setting up furnaces forges rollingmills and all the machinery for producing tools and hardware for which he foresaw a roaring foreign market the agents confidence and enthusiasm mastered his principal and large capital was raised solely on the security of the hawarden fortune and credit whether oak farm was irrationally inflated or not we cannot say though the impression is that it had the material of a sound property if carefully worked but it was evidently pushed in excess of its realisable capital the whole basis of its credit was the hawarden estate and a forced stoppage of oak farm would be the deathblow to hawarden as early as 1844 clouds rose on the horizon the position of sir stephen glynne had become seriously compromised while under the system of unlimited partnership the liability of his two brothersinlaw extended in proportion in 1845 the three brothersinlaw by agreement retired each retaining an equitable mortgage on the concern two years later one of our historic panics shook the moneymarket and in its course brought down oak farm203 a great accountant reported a meeting was held at freshfields the company was found hopelessly insolvent and it was determined to wind up the court directed a sale in april 1849 at birmingham mr gladstone purchased the concern on behalf of himself and his two brothersinlaw subject to certain existing interests and in may sir stephen glynne resumed legal possession of the wreck of oak farm the burden on hawarden was over £250000 leaving its owner with no margin to live upon  into this farspreading entanglement mr gladstone for several years threw himself with the whole weight of his untiring tenacity and force he plunged into masses of accounts mastered the coil of interests and parties studied legal intricacies did daily battle with human unreason and year after year carried on a voluminous correspondence                                 oak farm  there are a hundred and forty of his letters to mr freshfield on oak farm alone let us note in passing what is i think a not unimportant biographic fact these circumstances brought him into close and responsible contact with a side of the material interests of the country that was new to him at home he had been bred in the atmosphere of commerce at the board of trade in the reform of the tariff in connection with the bank act and in the growth of the railway system he had been well trained in high economics now he came to serve an arduous apprenticeship in the motions and machinery of industrial life the labour was immense prolonged uncongenial but it completed his knowledge of the customs rules maxims and currents of trade and it bore good fruit in future days at the exchequer he manfully and deliberately took up the burden as if the errors had been his own and as if the financial sacrifice that he was called to make both now and later were matter of direct and inexorable obligation these indeed are the things in life that test whether a man be made of gold or clay the weight he writes to his father june 16 1849 of the private demands upon my mind has been such since the oak farm broke down as frequently to disqualify me for my duties in the house of commons the load even tempted him along with the working of other considerations to think of total withdrawal from parliament and public life yet without a trace of the frozen stoicism or cynical apathy that sometimes passes muster for true resignation he kept himself nobly free from vexation murmur repining and complaint here is a moving passage from a letter of the time to mrs gladstone       fasque jan 20 1849do not suppose for a moment that if i      could by waving my hand strike out for ever from my cares and      occupations those which relate to the oak farm and stephens      affairs i would do so i have never felt that have never asked      it and if my language seems to look that way it is the mere      impatience of weakness comforting itself by finding a vent it has      evidently come to me by the ordinance of god and i am rather      frightened to think how light my lot would be were it removed so      light that something else would surely come in its place i do not      confound it with visitations and afflictions it is merely a drain      on strength and a peculiar one because it asks for a kind of      strength and skill and habits which i have not but it falls      altogether short of the category of high trials least of all      suppose that the subject can ever associate itself painfully with      the idea of you no persons who have been in contact with it can be      so absolutely blameless as you and mary nor can our relation      together be rendered in the very smallest degree less or more a      blessing by the addition or the subtraction of worldly wealth i      have abundant comfort now in the thought that at any rate i am      the means of keeping a load off the minds of others and i shall      have much more hereafter when stephen is brought through and once      more firmly planted in the place of his fathers provided i can      conscientiously feel that the restoration of his affairs has at any      rate not been impeded by indolence obstinacy or blunders on my      part nor can anything be more generous than the confidence placed      in me by all concerned indeed i can only regret that it is too      free and absolute                            letter to his son  i may as well now tell the story to the end though in anticipation of remote dates for in truth it held a marked place in mr gladstones whole life and made a standing background amid the vast throng of varying interests and transient commotions of his great career here is his own narrative as told in a letter written to his eldest son for a definite purpose in 1885                          to w h gladstone       hawarden oct 3 1885down to the latter part of that year      1847 your uncle stephen was regarded by all as a wealthy country      gentleman with say £10000 a year or more subject however to his      mothers jointure to spend and great prospects from iron in a      midland estate in the bank crisis of that year the whole truth was      revealed and it came out that his agent at the oak farm and      formerly also at hawarden had involved him to the extent of      £250000 to say nothing of minor blows to your uncle lyttelton and      myself       at a conversation in the library of 13 carlton house terrace it      was considered whether hawarden should be sold every obvious      argument was in favour of it for example the comparison between      the income and the liabilities i have named how was lady glynnes      jointure £2500 to be paid how was sir stephen to be supported      there was no income even less than none oak farm the iron      property was under lease to an insolvent company and could not be      relied on your grandfather who had in some degree surveyed the      state of affairs thought the case was hopeless but the family      were unanimously set upon making any and every effort and sacrifice      to avoid the necessity of sale mr barker their lawyer and mr      burnett the land agent entirely sympathised and it was resolved      to persevere but the first effect was that sir stephen had to      close the house which it was hoped but hoped in vain to let to      give up carriages horses and i think for several years his      personal servant and to take an allowance of £700 a year out of      which i believe he continued to pay the heavy subvention of the      family to the schools of the parish which was certainly counted by      hundreds had the estate been sold it was estimated that he would      have come out a wealthy bachelor possessed of from a hundred to a      hundred and twenty thousands pounds free from all encumbrance but      the jointure       in order to give effect to the nearly hopeless resolution thus      taken at the meeting in london it was determined to clip the      estate by selling £200000 worth of land of this nearly onehalf      was to be taken by your uncle lyttelton and myself in the      proportion of about two parts for me and one for him neither of us      had the power to buy this but my father enabled me and lord      spencer took over his portion the rest of the sales were effected      a number of fortunate secondary incidents occurred and the great      business of recovering and realising from the oak farm was      laboriously set about       considerable relief was obtained by these and other measures by      1852 there was a partial but perceptible improvement in the      position the house was reopened in a very quiet way by      arrangement and the allowance for sir stephens expenditure was      rather more than doubled but there was nothing like ease for him      until the purchase of the reversion was effected by me in 1865 i      paid £57000 for the bulk of the property subject to debts not      exceeding £150000 and after the lives of the two brothers the      table value of which was i think twentytwo and ahalf years      from this time your uncle had an income to spend of i think      £2200 or not more than half what he probably would have had since      1847 had the estate been sold which it would only have been      through the grievous fault of others       the full process of recovery was still incomplete but the means of      carrying it forward were now comparatively simple since the      reversion came in i have as you know forwarded that process but      it has been retarded by agricultural depression and by the      disastrous condition through so many years of coalmining so that      there still remains a considerable work to be done before the end      can be attained which i hope will never be lost sight of namely      that of extinguishing the debt upon the property though for family      purposes the estate may still remain subject to charges in the way      of annuity       the full history of the hawarden estate from 1847 would run to a      volume for some years after 1847 it and the oak farm supplied my      principal employment204 but i was amply repaid by the value of      it a little later on as a home and by the unbroken domestic      happiness there enjoyed what i think you will see as clearly      resulting from this narrative is the high obligation not only to      keep the estate in the family and as i trust in its natural course      of descent but to raise it to the best condition by thrift and      care and to promote by all reasonable means the aim of diminishing      and finally extinguishing its debt       this i found partly on a high estimate of the general duty to      promote the permanence of families having estates in land but very      specially on the sacrifices made through his remaining      twentyseven years of life by your uncle stephen without a      murmur and with the concurrence of us all       before closing i will repair one omission when i concurred in the      decision to struggle for the retention of hawarden i had not the      least idea that my children would have an interest in the      succession in 1847 your uncle stephen was only forty your uncle      henry at thirtyseven was married and had a child almost every      year it was not until 1865 that i had any title to look forward to      your becoming at a future time the proprietorever your      affectionate father                            final settlement  the upshot is this that mr gladstone with his fathers consent and support threw the bulk of his own fortune into the assets of hawarden by this and the wise realisation of everything convertible to advantage including in 1865 the reversion after the lives of sir stephen glynne and his brother he succeeded in making what was left of hawarden solvent his own expenditure from first to last upon the hawarden estate as now existing he noted at £267000 it has been for thirtyfive years he wrote to w h gladstone in 1882 ie since the breakdown in 1847 a great object of my life in conjunction with your mother and your uncle stephen to keep the hawarden estate together or replace what was alienated to keep it in the family and to relieve it from debt with which it was ruinously loaded  in 1867 a settlement was made to which sir stephen glynne and his brother and mr gladstone and his wife were the parties by which the estate was conveyed in trust for one or more of the gladstone children as mr gladstone might appoint205 this was subject to a power of determining the settlement by either of the glynne brothers on repaying with interest the sum paid for the reversion as the transaction touched matters in which he might be supposed liable to bias mr gladstone required that its terms should be referred to two men of perfect competence and probitylord devon and sir robert phillimorefor their judgment and approval phillimore visited hawarden august 1926 1865 to meet lord devon and to confer with him upon sir stephen glynnes affairs here are a couple of entries from his diary       aug 26the whole morning was occupied with the investigation      of s gs affairs by lord devon and myself we examined at some      length the solicitor and the agent lord d and i perfectly agreed      in the opinion expressed in a memorandum signed by us both      gladstone as might have been expected has behaved very well

lytteltongladstone correspondence i showed henry glynne the      letter of which he entirely approved  in 1874 the death of sir stephen glynne following that of his brother two years before made mr gladstone owner in possession of the hawarden estate under the transaction of 1865 with as little delay as possible april 1875 he took the necessary steps to make his eldest son the owner in fee and seven years after that october 1882 he further transferred to the same son his own lands in the county acquired by purchase as we have seen after the crash in 1847 by agreement the possession and control of the castle and its contents remained with mrs gladstone for life as if she were taking a lifeinterest in it under settlement or will                       further letters to his son  although therefore for a few months the legal owner of the whole hawarden estate mr gladstone divested himself of that quality as soon as he could and at no time did he assume to be its master the letters written by him on these matters to his son are both too interesting as the expression of his views on high articles of social policy and too characteristic of his ideas of personal duty for me to omit them here though much out of their strict chronological place the first is written after the death of sir stephen and the falling in of the reversion                         to w h gladstone

     aspects       1 i have given instructions to messrs barker and hignett to      convert your life interest under the hawarden settlement into a fee      simple reflection and experience have brought me to favour this      latter method of holding landed property as on the whole the best      though the arguments may not be all on one side in the present      case they are to my mind entirely conclusive first because i am      able thoroughly to repose in you an entire confidence as to your      use of the estate during your lifetime and your capacity to      provide wisely for its future destination secondly because you      have delivered over to you with the estate the duty and office of      progressively emancipating it from the once ruinous debt and it is      almost necessary towards the satisfactory prosecution of this      purpose which it may still take very many years to complete that      you should be entire master of the property and should feel the      full benefit of the steady care and attention which it ought to      receive from you       2 i hope that with it you will inherit the several conterminous      properties belonging to me and that you will receive these in such      a condition as to enjoy a large proportion of the income they      yield taking the two estates together they form the most      considerable estate in the county and give what may be termed the      first social position there the importance of this position is      enhanced by the large population which inhabits them you will i      hope familiarise your mind with this truth that you can no more      become the proprietor of such a body of property or of the portion      of it now accruing than your brother stephen could become rector      of the parish without recognising the serious moral and social      responsibilities which belong to it they are full of interest and      rich in pleasure but they demand in the absence of special cause      residence on the spot and a good share of time and especially a      free and ungrudging discharge of them nowhere in the world is the      position of the landed proprietor so high as in this country and      this in great part for the reason that nowhere else is the      possession of landed property so closely associated with definite      duty       3 in truth with this and your seat in parliament which i hope      whether whitby supply it or whether you migrate will continue      you will i trust have a wellcharged though not an      overcharged life and will like professional and other      thoroughly employed men have to regard the bulk of your time as      forestalled on behalf of duty while a liberal residue may be      available for your special pursuits and tastes and for      recreations this is really the sound basis of life which never      can be honourable or satisfactory without adequate guarantees      against frittering away even in part the precious gift of time       while touching on the subject i would remind you of an old      recommendation of mine that you should choose some parliamentary      branch or subject to which to give special attention the house of      commons has always heard your voice with pleasure and ought not to      be allowed to forget it i say this the more freely because i      think it is in your case the virtue of a real modesty which      rather too much indisposes you to put yourself forward       yet another word as years gather upon me i naturally look forward      to what is to be after i am gone and although i should indeed be      sorry to do or say anything having a tendency to force the action      of your mind beyond its natural course it will indeed be a great      pleasure to me to see you well settled in life by marriage well      settled i feel confident you will be if settled at all in your      position at hawarden there would then be at once increased ease      and increased attraction in the performance of your duties nor can      i overlook the fact that the life of the unmarried man in this age      particularly is under peculiar and insidious temptations to      selfishness unless his celibacy arise from a very strong and      definite course of selfdevotion to the service of god and his      fellow creatures       the great and sad change of hawarden by the death of sir stephen      which has forced upon us the consideration of so many subjects      gave at the same time an opening for others and it seemed to me to      be best to put together the few remarks i had to make i hope the      announcement with which i began will show that i write in the      spirit of confidence as well as of affection it is on this footing      that we have ever stood and i trust ever shall stand you have      acted towards me at all times up to the standard of all i could      desire may you have the help of the almighty to embrace as justly      and fulfil as cheerfully the whole conception of your duties in      the position to which it has pleased him to call you and which      perhaps has come upon you with somewhat the effect of a surprise      that may however have the healthy influence of a stimulus to      action and a help towards excellence believe me ever my dear      son your affectionate father                          duties of a landowner  in the second letter mr gladstone informed w h gladstone that he had at chester that morning oct 23 1882 along with mrs gladstone executed the deeds that made his son the proprietor of mr gladstones lands in flintshire subject to the payment of annuities specified in the instrument of transfer and he proceeds       i earnestly entreat that you will never under any circumstances      mortgage any of your land i consider that our law has offered to      proprietors of land under a narrow and mistaken notion of      promoting their interests dangerous facilities and inducements to      this practice and that its mischievous consequences have been so      terribly felt the word is strong but hardly too strong in the      case of hawarden that they ought to operate powerfully as a      warning for the future       you are not the son of very wealthy parents but the income of the      estates the hawarden estates and mine jointly with your prudence      and diligence will enable you to go steadily forward in the work i      have had in hand and after a time will in the course of nature      give considerable means for the purpose       i have much confidence in your prudence and intelligence i have      not the smallest fear that the rather unusual step i have taken      will in any way weaken the happy union and harmony of our family      and i am sure you will always bear in mind the duties which attach      to you as the head of those among whom you receive a preference      and as the landlord of a numerous tenantry prepared to give you      their confidence and affection  a third letter on the same topics followed three years after and contains a narrative of the hawarden transactions already given in an earlier page of this chapter                          to w h gladstone       oct 3 1885when you first made known to me that you thought      of retiring from the general election of this year i received the      intimation with mixed feelings the question of money no doubt      deserves under existing circumstances to be kept in view still i      must think twice before regarding this as the conclusive question      i conceive the balance has to be struck mainly between these two      things on the one hand the duty of persons connected with the      proprietorship of considerable estates in land to assume freely      the burden and responsibility of serving in parliament on the      other hand the peculiar position of this combined estate which in      the first place is of a nature to demand from the proprietor an      unusual degree of care and supervision and which in the second      place has been hit severely by recent depressions in corn and coal      which may be termed its two pillars       on the first point it may fairly be taken into view that in serving      for twenty years you have stood four contested elections a number      i think decidedly beyond the average i will assume for the      present that the election has passed without bringing you back to      parliament i should then consider that you had thus relieved      yourself at any rate for a period from a serious call upon your      time and mind mainly with a view to the estate and on this      account and because i have constituted you its legal master i      write this letter in order to place clearly before you some of the      circumstances which invest your relation to it with a rather      peculiar character       i premise a few words of a general nature an enemy to entails      principally though not exclusively on social and domestic grounds      i nevertheless regard it as a very high duty to labour for the      conservation of estates and the permanence of the families in      possession of them as a principal source of our social strength      and as a large part of true conservatism from the time when      aeschylus wrote              greek archaioploutôn despotôn pollê charis206       but if their possession is to be prolonged by conduct not by      factitious arrangements we must recognise this consequence that      conduct becomes subject to fresh demands and liabilities       in condemning laws which tie up the corpus i say nothing      against powers of charge either by marriage settlement or      otherwise for wife and children although questions of degree and      circumstance may always have to be considered but to mortgages i      am greatly opposed whether they ought or ought not to be      restrained by law i do not now inquire but i am confident that      few and rare causes only will warrant them and that as a general      rule they are mischievous and in many cases as to their      consequences antisocial and immoral wherever they exist they      ought to be looked upon as evils which are to be warred upon and      got rid of one of our financial follies has been to give them      encouragement by an excessively low tax and one of the better      effects of the incometax is that it is a fine upon mortgaging  footnotes  203 for an account of the creditors meeting held at birmingham on dec 2 1847 see the times of dec 3 1847  204 to lord lyttelton july 29 1874 i could not devote my entire life to it and after 1852 my attention was only occasional  205 this settlement followed the lines of a will made by sir stephen in 1855 devising the estate to his brother for life with the remainder to his brothers sons in tail male and next to w h gladstone and his sons in tail male and then to w e gladstones other sons and in default of male issue of w e gladstone then to the eldest and other sons of lord lyttelton and so forth in the ordinary form of an entailed estate  206 agam 1043 a great blessing are masters with ancient riches

     blessed a change in our colonial policy was brought about a change      which is full of promise and profit to a country having such claims      on mankind as england but also a change of system in which we      have done no more than make a transition from misfortune and from      evil back to the rules of justice of reason of nature and of      common sensegladstone 1856   the fall of peel and the break up of the conservative party in 1846 led to a long train of public inconveniences when lord john russell was forming his government he saw peel and proposed to include any of his party peel thought such a junction under existing circumstances unadvisable but said he should have no ground of complaint if lord john made offers to any of his friends and he should not attempt to influence them either way207 the action ended in a proposal of office to dalhousie lincoln and sidney herbert nothing came of it and the whigs were left to go on as they best could upon the narrow base of their own party the protectionists gave them to understand that before bentinck and his friends made up their minds to turn peel out they had decided that it would not be fair to put the whigs in merely to punish the betrayer and then to turn round upon them on the contrary fair and candid support was what they intended the conservative government had carried liberal measures the liberal government subsisted on conservative declarations such was this singular situation                     peelites and protectionists  the peelites according to a memorandum of mr gladstones from a number approaching 120 in the corn law crisis of 1846 were reduced at once by the election of 1847 to less than half this number added to the liberal force gave free trade a very large majority added to the protectionists it just turned the balance in their favour so long as sir robert peel lived down to june 1850 the entire body never voted with the protectionists from the first a distinction arose among peels adherents that widened as time went on and led to a long series of doubts perturbations manoeuvres these perplexities lasted down to 1859 and they constitute a vital chapter in mr gladstones political story the distinction was in the nature of political things many of those who had stood by peels side in the day of battle and who still stood by him in the curious morrow that combined victorious policy with personal defeat were in more or less latent sympathy with the severed protectionists in everything except protection208 differing from these says mr gladstone others of the peelites whose opinions were more akin to those of the liberals cherished nevertheless personal sympathies and lingering wishes which made them tardy perhaps unduly tardy in drawing towards that party i think that this description applied in some degree to mr sidney herbert and in the same or a greater degree to myself209  shortly described the peelites were all free trade conservatives drawn by undercurrents according to temperament circumstances and all the other things that turn the balance of mens opinions to antipodean poles of the political compass we have no party mr gladstone tells his father in june 1849 no organisation no whipperin and under these circumstances we cannot exercise any considerable degree of permanent influence as a body the leading sentiment that guided the proceedings of the whole body of peelites alike was a desire to give to protection its final quietus while the younger members of the peel cabinet held that this could only be done in one way namely by forcing the protectionists into office where they must put their professions to the proof peel himself and graham with him took a directly opposite view and adopted as the leading principle of their action the vital necessity of keeping the protectionists out this broad difference led to no diminution of personal intercourse or political attachment       certainly this was not due says mr gladstone to any desire at      least in sir r peels mind for or contemplation of coalition      with the liberal party it sprang entirely from a belief on his      part that the chiefs of the protectionists would on their accession      to power endeavour to establish a policy in accordance with the      designation of their party and would in so doing probably convulse      the country as long as lord george bentinck lived with his iron      will and strong convictions this was a contingency that could not      be overlooked but he died in 1848 and with his death it became a      visionary dream yet i remember well sir robert peel saying to me      when i was endeavouring to stir him up on some great fault as i      thought it in the colonial policy of the ministers i foresee a      tremendous struggle in this country for the restoration of      protection he would sometimes even threaten us with the      possibility of being sent for if a crisis should occur which was      a thing far enough from our limited conceptions we were flatly at      issue with him on this opinion we even considered that as long as      the protectionists had no responsibilities but those of opposition      and as there were two hundred and fifty seats in parliament to be      won by chanting the woes of the land and promising redress there      would be protectionists in plenty to fill the left hand benches on      those terms                          relations with peel  the question what it was that finally converted the country to free trade is not easy to answer not the arguments of cobden for in the summer of 1845 even his buoyant spirit perceived that some precipitating event and not reasoning would decide his appeals had become as disraeli wrote both to nation and parliament a wearisome iteration and he knew it those arguments it is true had laid the foundations of the case in all their solidity and breadth but until the emergency in ireland presented itself and until prosperity had justified the experiment peel was hardly wrong in reckoning on the possibility of a protectionist reaction even the new prosperity and contentment of the country were capable of being explained by the extraordinary employment found in the creation of railways as mr gladstone said to a correspondent in the autumn of 1846 the liberal proceedings of conservative governments and the conservative proceedings of the new liberal administration unite in pointing to the propriety of an abstinence from highpitched opinions this was a euphemism what it really meant was that outside of protection no highpitched opinions on any other subject were available the tenets of party throughout this embarrassed period from 1846 to 1852 were shifting equivocal and fluid nor even in the period that followed did they very rapidly consolidate  mr gladstone writes to his father june 30 1849       i will only add a few words about your desire that i should      withdraw my confidence from peel my feelings of admiration      attachment and gratitude to him i do not expect to lose and i      agree with graham that he has done more and suffered more than      any other living statesman for the good of the people but still i      must confess with sorrow that the present course of events tends to      separate and disorganise the small troop of the late government and      their adherents on the west indian question last year i with      others spoke and voted against peel on the navigation law this      year i was saved from it only by the shipowners and their friends      who would not adopt a plan upon the basis i proposed upon      canadaa vital questioni again spoke and voted against him210      and upon other colonial questions yet most important to the      government i fear even this year the same thing may happen again      however painful then it may be to me to differ from him it is      plain that my conduct is not placed in his hands to govern  we find an illustration of the distractions of this long day of party metamorphosis as well as an example of what was regarded as mr gladstones overingenuity in one among other passing divergences between him and his chief mr disraeli brought forward a motion feb 19 1850 of a very familiar kind on the distress of the agricultural classes and the insecurity of relief of rural burdens bright bluntly denied that there was a case in which the fee of land had been depreciated or rent been permanently lowered graham said the movers policy was simply a transfer of the entire poor rate to the consolidated fund violating the principles of local control and inviting prodigal expenditure fortune then in mr disraelis own language sent him an unexpected champion by whom according to him graham was fairly unhorsed the reader will hardly think so for though the unexpected champion was mr gladstone he found no better reason for supporting the motion than that its adoption would weaken the case for restoring protection as if the landlords and farmers were likely to be satisfied with a small admission of a great claim while all the rest of their claim was to be as bitterly contested as ever with the transfer of a shabby couple of millions from their own shoulders to the consolidated fund when they were clamouring that fourteen millions would hardly be enough peel rose later promptly took this plain point against his ingenious lieutenant and then proceeded to one more of his elaborate defences both of free trade and of his own motives and character for the last time as it was to happen peel declared that for mr gladstone he had the greatest respect and admiration i was associated with him in the preparation and conduct of those measures to the desire of maintaining which he partly attributes the conclusion at which he has arrived i derived from him the most zealous the most effective assistance and it is no small consolation to me to hear from him although in this particular motion we arrive at different conclusions that his confidence in the justice of those principles for which we in common contended remains entirely unshaken211                             on his position  on this particular battle as well as on more general matter a letter from mr gladstone to his wife feb 221850 sheds some light                           to mrs gladstone       indeed you do rise to very daring flights today and suggest many      things that flow from your own deep affection which perhaps      disguises from you some things that are nevertheless real i cannot      form to myself any other conception of my duty in parliament except      the simple one of acting independently without faction and      without subserviency on all questions as they arise to the      formation of a party or even of the nucleus of a party there are      in my circumstances many obstacles i have been talking over these      matters with manning this morning and i found him to be of the      opinion which is deliberately mine namely that it is better that      i should not be the head or leader even of my own contemporaries      that there are others of them whose position is less embarrassed      and more favourable and powerful particularly from birth or wealth      or both three or four years ago before i had much considered the      matter and while we still felt as if peel were our actual chief in      politics i did not think so but perhaps thought or assumed that      as up to the then present time i had discharged some prominent      duties in office and in parliament the first place might naturally      fall to me when the other men were no longer in the van but since      we have become more disorganised and i have had little sense of      union except with the men of my own standing and i have felt      more of the actual state of things and how this or that would work      in the house of commons i have come to be satisfied in my own mind      that if there were a question whether there should be a leader and      who it should be it would be much better that either lincoln or      herbert should assume that post whatever share of the mere work      might fall on me i have viewed the matter very drily and so      perhaps you will think i have written on it      to turn then to what is more amusing the battle of last night     after much consideration and conference with herbert who has had an     attack of bilious fever and could not come down though much better     and soon i hope to be out again but who agreed with me i     determined that i ought to vote last night with disraeli and made     up my mind accordingly which involved saying why at some period of     the night i was anxious to do it early as i knew graham would     speak on the other side and did not wish any conflict even of     reasoning with him but he found i was going to speak and i suppose     may have had some similar wish at any rate he had the opportunity     of following stafford who began the debate as he was to take the     other side then there was an amusing scene between him and peel     both rose and stood in competition for the speakers eye the     speaker had seen graham first and he got it but when he was     speaking i felt i had no choice but to follow him he made so very     able a speech that this was no pleasant prospect but i acquired the     courage that proceeds from fear according to a line from ariosto     chi per virtù chi per paura vale one from valour another from     fear is strong and made my plunge when he sat down but the     speaker was not dreaming of me and called a certain mr scott who     had risen at the same time upon this i sat down again and there     was a great uproar because the house always anticipating more or     less interest when men speak on opposite sides and in succession     who are usually together called for me so i was up again and the     speaker deserted scott and called me and i had to make the best i     could after graham that is the end of the story for there is     nothing else worth saying it was at the dinner hour from 7 to     7¾ and then i went home for a little quiet peel again replied     upon me but i did not hear that part of him and disraeli showed     the marvellous talent that he has for summing up with brilliancy     buoyancy and comprehensiveness at the close of a debate you have     heard me speak of that talent before when i have been wholly against     him but never last night or at any other time would i go to him     for conviction but for the delight of the ear and the fancy what a     long story                           partial withdrawal  during the parliament that sat from 1847 to 1852 mr gladstones political life was in partial abeyance the whole burden of conducting the affairs of the hawarden estate fell upon him for five years he said it constituted my daily and continuing care while parliamentary action was only occasional it supplied in fact my education for the office of finance minister the demands of church matters were anxious and at times absorbing he warmly favoured and spoke copiously for the repeal of the navigation laws he desired however to accept a recent overture from america which offered everything even their vast coasting trade upon a footing of absolute reciprocity i gave notice he says of a motion to that effect but the government declined to accept it i accordingly withdrew it at this the tories were much put about i who had thought of things only and not taken persons into view was surprised at their surprise it did not occur to me that by my public notification i had given to the opposition generally something like a vested interest in my proposal i certainly should have done better never to have given my notice this is one of the cases illustrating the extreme slowness of my political education the sentence about thinking of things only and leaving persons out indicates a turn of mind that partly for great good partly for some evil never wholly disappeared  yet partially withdrawn as he was from active life in the house of commons mr gladstone was far too acute an observer to have any leanings to the delusive selfindulgence of temporary retirements to his intimate friend sir walter james who seems to have nursed some such intention he wrote at this very time feb 13 1847       the way to make parliament profitable is to deal with it as a      calling and if it be a calling it can rarely be advantageous to      suspend the pursuit of it for years together with an uncertainty      too as to its resumption you have not settled in the country nor      got your other vocation open and your line clear before you the      purchase of an estate is a very serious matter which you may not      be able to accomplish to your satisfaction except after the lapse      of years it would be more satisfactory to drop parliament with      another path open to you already than in order to seek about for      one i think with you that the change in the position of the      conservative party makes public life still more painful where it      was painful before and less enjoyable where it was enjoyable but      i do not think it remains less a duty to work through the tornado      and to influence for good according to our means the new forms      into which political combination may be cast  in 1848 northcote speaks of mr gladstone as the patron saint of the coalwhippers who as a manifestation of their gratitude for the act which he had induced parliament to pass for them offered their services to put down the chartist mob both mr gladstone and his brother john served as special constables during the troubled days of april in his diary he records on april 10 on duty from 2 to 3¾ pm                                     ii                        views of colonial government  when mr gladstone became colonial secretary at the end of 1845 he was described as a strong accession to the progressive or theorising section of the cabinetthe men that is to say who applied to the routine of government as they found it critical principles and improved ideals if the church had been the first of mr gladstones commanding interests and free trade the second the turn of the colonies came next he had not held the seals of the colonial department for more than a few months but to any business whatever it might be that happened to kindle his imagination or work on his reflection he never failed to bend his whole strength he had sat upon a committee in 18356 on native affairs at the cape and there he had come into full view of the costly and sanguinary nature of that important side of the colonial question molesworth mentions the prominent and valuable part taken by him in the committee on waste lands 1836 he served on committees upon military expenditure in the colonies and upon colonial accounts he was a member of the important committee of 1840 on the colonisation of new zealand and voted in the minority for the draft report of the chairman containing among other things the principle of the reservation of all unoccupied lands to the crown212 between 1837 and 1841 he spoke frequently on colonial affairs when he was secretary of state in 1846 questions arose upon the legal status of colonial clergy full of knotty points as to which he wrote minutes questions upon education in penal settlements and so forth in which he interested himself not seldom differing from stephen the chief of the staff in the office he composed an argumentative despatch on the commercial relations between canada and the mother country endeavouring to wean the canadian assembly from its economic delusions it was in effect little better than if written in water he made the mistake of sending out despatches in favour of resuming on a limited scale the transportation of convicts to australia a practice effectually condemned by the terrible committee eight years before opinion in australia was divided robert lowe leading the opposition213 and the experiment was vetoed by mr gladstones successor at the colonial office he exposed himself to criticism and abuse by recalling a colonial governor for inefficiency in his post imprudently in the simplicity of his heart he added to the recall a private letter stating rumours against the governors personal character these he had taken on trust from the bishop of the diocese and others the bishop left him in the lurch the recall was one affair the personal rumours were another nimble partizanship confused the two to the disadvantage of the secretary of state the usual clatter that attends any important personage in a trivial scrape ensued mr gladstones explanations simple and veracious as the sunlight in their substance were overskilful in form and half a dozen blunt sound sentences would have stood him in far better stead there was on my part in this matter he says in a fugitive scrap upon it a singular absence of worldly wisdom214 to colonial policy at this stage i discern no particular contribution and the matters that i have named are now well covered with the moss of kindly time  almost from the first he was convinced that some leading maxims of downing street were erroneous he had from his earliest parliamentary days regarded our colonial connection as one of duty rather than as one of advantage when he had only been four years in the house he took a firm stand against pretensions in canada to set their assembly on an equal footing with the imperial parliament at home215 on the other hand while he should always be glad to see parliament inclined to make large sacrifices for the purpose of maintaining the colonies he conceived that nothing could be more ridiculous or more mistaken than to suppose that great britain had anything to gain by maintaining that union in opposition to the deliberate and permanent conviction of the people of the colonies themselves216  he did not at all undervalue what he called the mere political connection but he urged that the root of such a connection lay in the natural affection of the colonies for the land from which they sprang and their spontaneous desire to reproduce its laws and the spirit of its institutions from first to last he always declared the really valuable tie with a colony to be the moral and the social tie217 the master key with him was local freedom and he was never weary of protest against the fallacy of what was called preparing these new communities for freedom teaching a colony like an infant by slow degrees to walk first putting it into long clothes then into short clothes a governing class was reared up for the purposes which the colony ought to fulfil itself and as the climax of the evil a great military expenditure was maintained which became a premium on war our modern colonists he said after quitting the mother country instead of keeping their hereditary liberties go out to australia or new zealand to be deprived of these liberties and then perhaps after fifteen or twenty or thirty years waiting have a portion given back to them with magnificent language about the liberality of parliament in conceding free institutions during the whole of that interval they are condemned to hear all the miserable jargon about fitting them for the privileges thus conferred while in point of fact every year and every month during which they are retained under the administration of a despotic government renders them less fit for free institutions no consideration of money ought to induce parliament to sever the connection between any one of the colonies and the mother country though it was certain that the cost of the existing system was both large and unnecessary but the real mischief was not here he said our error lay in the attempt to hold the colonies by the mere exercise of power218 even for the church in the colonies he rejected the boon of civil preference as being undoubtedly a fatal giftnothing but a source of weakness to the church herself and of discord and difficulty to the colonial communities in the soil of which i am anxious to see the church of england take a strong and healthy root219 he acknowledged how much he had learned from molesworths speeches220 and neither of them sympathised with the opinion expressed by mr disraeli in those days these wretched colonies will all be independent too in a few years and are a millstone round our necks221 nor did mr gladstone share any such sentiments as those of molesworth who in the canadian revolt of the winter of 1837 actually invoked disaster upon the british arms222                            the two schools  in their views of colonial policy mr gladstone was in substantial accord with radicals of the school of cobden hume and molesworth he does not seem to have joined a reforming association founded by these eminent men among others in 1850 but its principles coincided with his ownlocal independence an end of rule from downing street the relief of the mother country from the whole expense of the local government of the colonies save for defence from aggression by a foreign power parliament was as a rule so little moved by colonial concerns that according to mr gladstone in nine cases out of ten it was impossible for the minister to secure parliamentary attention and in the tenth case it was only obtained by the casual operations of party spirit lord glenelgs case showed that colonial secretaries were punished when they got into bad messes and his passion for messes was punished in the language of the journals of the day by the life of a toad under a harrow until he was worried out of office there was however no force in public opinion to prevent the minister from going wrong if he liked still less to prevent him from going right if he liked popular feeling was coloured by no wish to give up the colonies but people doubted whether the sum of three millions sterling a year for colonial defence and half a million more for civil charges was not excessive and they thought the return by no means commensurate with the outlay223 in discussions on bills effecting the enlargement of australian constitutions mr gladstones views came out in clear contrast with the old school spoke 1½ hours on the australian colonies bill he records may 131850 to an indifferent inattentive house but it is necessary to speak these truths of colonial policy even to unwilling ears in the proceedings on the constitution for new zealand he delivered a speech justly described as a pattern of close argument and classic oratory224 lord john russell adverting to the concession of an elective chamber and responsible government said that one by one in this manner all the shields of our authority were thrown away and the monarchy was left exposed in the colonies to the assaults of democracy now i confess said mr gladstone in a counter minute that the nominated council and the independent executive were not shields of authority but sources of weakness disorder disunion and disloyalty225                              his whole view  his whole view he set out at chester226 a little later than the time at which we now stand        experience has proved that if you want to strengthen the      connection between the colonies and this countryif you want to      see british law held in respect and british institutions adopted      and beloved in the colonies never associate with them the hated      name of force and coercion exercised by us at a distance over      their rising fortunes govern them upon a principle of freedom      defend them against aggression from without regulate their foreign      relations these things belong to the colonial connection but of      the duration of that connection let them be the judges and i      predict that if you leave them the freedom of judgment it is hard      to say when the day will come when they will wish to separate from      the great name of england depend upon it they covet a share in      that great name you will find in that feeling of theirs the      greatest security for the connection make the name of england yet      more and more an object of desire to the colonies their natural      disposition is to love and revere the name of england and this      reverence is by far the best security you can have for their      continuing not only to be subjects of the crown not only to      render it allegiance but to render it that allegiance which is the      most precious of allthe allegiance which proceeds from the depths      of the heart of man you have seen various colonies some of them      lying at the antipodes offering to you their contributions to      assist in supporting the wives and families of your soldiers the      heroes that have fallen in the war this i venture to say may be      said without exaggeration to be among the first fruits of that      system upon which within the last twelve or fifteen years you      have founded a rational mode of administering the affairs of your      colonies without gratuitous interference  as i turn over these old minutes memoranda despatches speeches one feels a curious irony in the charge engendered by party heat or malice studiously and scandalously careless of facts that mr gladstones policy aimed at getting rid of the colonies as if any other policy than that which he so ardently enforced could possibly have saved them                                      iii                              a painful incident  in 1849 mr gladstone was concerned in a painful incident that befel one of his nearest friends nobody of humane feeling would now willingly choose either to speak or hear of it but it finds a place in books even to this day it has been often misrepresented and it is so characteristic of mr gladstone and so entirely to his honour that it cannot be wholly passed over fortunately a few sentences will suffice his friends wife had been for some time travelling abroad and rumours by and by reached england of movements that might be no more than indiscreet but might be worse in consequence of these rumours and after anxious consultations between the husband and three or four important members of his circle it was thought best that some one should seek access to the lady and try to induce her to place herself in a position of security the further conclusion reached was that mr gladstone and manning were the two persons best qualified by character and friendship for this critical mission manning was unable to go but mr gladstone at the earnest solicitation of his friend and also of his own wife who had long been much attached to the person missing set off alone for a purpose as he conscientiously believed alike friendly to both parties and in the interests of both i have called the proceeding characteristic for it was in fact exactly like him to be ready at the call of friendship and in the hope of preventing a terrible disaster cheerfully to undertake a duty detestable to anybody and especially detestable to him and again it was like him to regard the affair with an optimistic simplicity that made him hopeful of success where to ninetynine men of a hundred the thought of success would have seemed absurd to no one was it a greater shock than to him when after a journey across half europe he suddenly found himself the discoverer of what it was inevitable that he should report to his friend at home in the course of the subsequent proceedings on the bill for a divorce brought into the house of lords he was called as a witness to show that in this case the person claiming the bill had omitted no means that duty or affection could suggest for averting the calamity with which his hearth was threatened it was quite untrue as he had occasion to tell the house of commons in 1857 that he had anything whatever to do with the collection of evidence or that the evidence given by him was the evidence or any part of it on which the divorce was founded the only thing to be added is the judgment of sir robert peel upon a transaction with all the details of which he was particularly well acquainted                                                     aug 26 1849       my dear gladstonei am deeply concerned to hear the result of      that mission which with unparalleled kindness and generosity you      undertook in the hope of mitigating the affliction of a friend and      conducing possibly to the salvation of a wife and mother your      errand has not been a fruitless one for it affords the conclusive      proof that everything that the forbearance and tender consideration      of a husband and the devotion of a friend could suggest as the      means of averting the necessity for appealing to the law for such      protection as it can afford had been essayed and essayed with the      utmost delicacy this proof is valuable so far as the world and the      worlds opinion is concernedmuch more valuable as it respects the      heart and conscience of those who have been the active agents in a      work of charity i can offer you nothing in return for that which      you undertook with the promptitude of affectionate friendship      under circumstances which few would not have considered a valid      excuse if not a superior obligation but the expression of my      sincere admiration for truly virtuous and generous conductever      my dear gladstone most faithfully yours                                                         robert peel footnotes  207 the halifax papers  208 among them were such men as

the course of thingspaullouis      courier                              lord palmerston  it was now that lord palmerston strode to a front placeone of the two conspicuous statesmen with whom at successive epochs in his career mr gladstone found himself in different degrees of energetic antagonism this was all the stiffer and more deeply rooted for being in both cases as much a moral antagonism as it was political after a long spell of peace earnestness and political economy the nation was for a time in a mood for change and palmerston convinced it that he was the man for its mood he had his full share of shrewd common sense yet was capable of infinite recklessness he was goodtempered and a man of bluff cheerful humour but to lose the game was intolerable and it was noticed that with him the next best thing to success was quick retaliation on a victorious adversarya trait of which he was before long to give the world an example that amused it yet he had no capacity for deep and long resentments like so many of his class he united passion for public business to sympathy with social gaiety and pleasure diplomatists found him firm prompt cleancut but apt to be narrow teasing obstinate a prisoner to his own arguments and wanting in the statesmans first quality of seeing the whole and not merely the half metternich described him as an audacious and passionate marksman ready to make arrows out of any wood he was a sanguine man who always believed what he desired a confident man who was sure that he must be right in whatever he chose to fear on the economic or the moral side of national life in the things that make a nation rich and the things that make it scrupulous and just he had only limited perception and moderate faith where peel was strong and penetrating palmerston was weak and purblind he regarded bright and cobden as displeasing mixtures of the bagman and the preacher in 1840 he had brought us within an ace of war with france disputes about an american frontier were bringing us at the same period within an ace of war with the united states when peel and aberdeen got this quarrel into more promising shape palmerston characteristically taunted them with capitulation lord grey refused help in manufacturing a whig government in december 1845 because he was convinced that at that moment palmerston at the foreign office meant an american war when he was dismissed by lord john russell in 1852 a foreign ruler on an insecure throne observed to an englishman this is a blow to me for so long as lord palmerston remained at the foreign office it was certain that you could not procure a single ally in europe  yet all this policy of high spirits and careless dictatorial temper had its fine side with none of the grandeur of the highest heroes of his schoolof chatham carteret pittwithout a spark of their heroic fire or their brilliant and steadfast glow palmerston represented not always in their best form some of the most generous instincts of his countrymen a follower of canning he was the enemy of tyrants and foreign misrule he had a healthy hatred of the absolutism and reaction that were supreme at vienna in 1815 and if he meddled in many affairs that were no affairs of ours at least he intervened for freedom the action that made him hated at vienna and petersburg won the confidence of his countrymen they saw him in belgium and holland spain italy greece portugal the fearless champion of constitutions and nationality of aberdeen who had been peels foreign minister it was said that at home he was a liberal without being an enthusiast abroad he was a zealot in the sense most opposed to palmerston so of palmerston it could be said that he was conservative at home and revolutionist abroad if such a word can ever be applied to such a thing his patriotism was sometimes not without a tinge of vulgarity but it was always genuine and sincere  this masterful and expert personage was the ruling member of the weak whig government now in office and he made sensible men tremble still said graham to peel it is a choice of dangers and evils and i am disposed to think that palmerston and his foreign policy are less to be dreaded than stanley and a new corn law227 in a debate of extraordinary force and range in the summer of 1850 the two schools of foreign policy found themselves face to face palmerston defended his various proceedings with remarkable amplitude power moderation and sincerity he had arrayed against him besides mr gladstone the greatest men in the housepeel disraeli cobden graham brightbut in his last sentence the undaunted minister struck a note that made triumph in the division lobbies sure for five hours a crowded house hung upon his lips and he then wound up with a fearless challenge of a verdict on the question whether as the roman in days of old held himself free from indignity when he could say civis romanus sum so also a british subject in whatever land he may be shall feel confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of england will protect him against injustice and wrong                               don pacifico  the roman citizen was in this instance a mediterranean jew who chanced to be a british subject his house at athens had for some reason or other been sacked by the mob he presented a demand for compensation absurdly fraudulent on the face of it the greek government refused to pay england despatched the fleet to collect this and some other petty accounts outstanding russia and france proposed their good offices the mediation of france was accepted then a number of greek vessels were peremptorily seized and france in umbrage recalled her ambassador from london well might peel in the last speech ever delivered by him in the house of commons describe such a course of action as consistent neither with the dignity nor the honour of england the debate travelled far beyond don pacifico and it stands to this day as a grand classic exposition in parliament of the contending views as to the temper and the principles on which nations in our modern era should conduct their dealings with one another       it was in the greek debate of 1850 which involved the censure or      acquittal of lord palmerston that i first meddled in speech with      foreign affairs to which i had heretofore paid the slightest      possible attention lord palmerstons speech was a marvel for      physical strength for memory and for lucid and precise exposition      of his policy as a whole a very curious incident on this occasion      evinced the extreme reluctance of sir r peel to appear in any      ostensible relation with disraeli voting with him was disagreeable      enough but this with his strong aversion to the palmerstonian      policy peel could not avoid besides which it was known that lord      palmerston would carry the division disraeli not yet fully      recognised as leader of the protectionists was working hard for      that position and assumed the manners of it with beresford a      kind of whipperin for his righthand man after the palmerston      speech he asked me on the next night whether i would undertake to      answer it i said that i was incompetent to do it from want of      knowledge and otherwise he answered that in that case he must do      it as the debate was not to close that evening this left another      night free for peel when he might speak and not be in disraelis      neighbourhood i told peel what disraeli had arranged he was      very well satisfied but shortly afterwards i received from      disraeli a message through beresford that he had changed his mind      and would not speak until the next and closing night when peel      would have to speak also i had to make known to peel this      alteration he received the tidings with extreme annoyance      thinking i suppose that if the two spoke on the same side and in      the late hours just before the division it would convey the idea of      some concert or cooperation between them which it was evident      that he was most anxious to avoid but he could not help himself      disraelis speech was a very poor one almost like a cross and      peels was prudent but otherwise not one of his best228  mr gladstone had not in 1850 at all acquired such full parliamentary ascendency as belonged to the hardy veteran confronting him still less had he such authority as the dethroned leader who sat by his side yet the house felt that in the image of an ancient critic here was no cistern of carefully collected rainwater but the bounteous flow of a living spring it felt all the noble elevation of an orator who transported them apart from the chicane of diplomatic chanceries above the narrow expediencies of the particular case though of these too he proved himself a thoroughly wellarmed master into a full view of the state system of europe and of the principles and relations on which the fabric is founded now for the first time he made the appeal so often repeated by him to the common sentiment of the civilised world to the general and fixed convictions of mankind to the principles of brotherhood among nations to their sacred independence to the equality in their rights of the weak with the strong such was his language when we are asking for the maintenance of the rights that belong to our fellowsubjects resident in greece he said let us do as we would be done by let us pay all respect to a feeble state and to the infancy of free institutions which we should desire and should exact from others towards their authority and strength mr gladstone had not read history for nothing he was not a christian for nothing he knew the evils that followed in europe the breakdown of the great spiritual poweronce though with so many defects a controlling force over violence anarchy and brute wrong he knew the necessity for some substitute even a substitute so imperfect as the law of nations you may call the rule of nations vague and untrustworthy he exclaimed i find in it on the contrary a great and noble monument of human wisdom founded on the combined dictates of sound experience a precious inheritance bequeathed to us by the generations that have gone before us and a firm foundation on which we must take care to build whatever it may be our part to add to their acquisitions if indeed we wish to promote the peace and welfare of the world                         exalts the law of nations  the government triumphed by a handsome majority and mr gladstone as was his wont consoled himself for present disappointment by hopes for a better future the majority of the house of commons i am convinced he wrote to guizot then in permanent exile from power was with us in heart and in conviction but fear of inconveniences attending the removal of a ministry which there is no regularly organised opposition ready to succeed carried the day beyond all authoritative doubt against the merits of the particular question it remains to hope that the demonstration which has been made may not be without its effect upon the tone of lord palmerstons future proceedings  the conflict thus opened between mr gladstone and lord palmerston in 1850 went on in many changing phases with some curious vicissitudes and inversions they were sometimes frank foes occasionally partners in opposition and for a long while colleagues in office never at any time were they in thought or feeling congenial229  on the afternoon of the day following this debate peel was thrown from his horse and received injuries from which he died three days later july 2 in the sixtythird year of his age and after fortyone years of parliamentary life when the house met the next day hume as one of its oldest members at once moved the adjournment and it fell to mr gladstone to second him he was content with a few words of sorrow and with the quotation of scotts moving lines to the memory of pitt    now is the stately column broke    the beaconlight is quenchd in smoke    the trumpets silver sound is still    the warder silent on the hill  these beautiful words were addressed said mr gladstone to a man great indeed but not greater than sir robert peel  great as he was to the last wrote mr gladstone in one of his notes in 1851 i must consider the closing years of his life as beneath those that had preceded them his enormous energies were in truth so lavishly spent upon the gigantic work of government which he conducted after a fashion quite differenti mean as to the work done in the workshop of his own brainfrom preceding and succeeding prime ministers that their root was enfeebled though in its feebleness it had more strength probably remaining than fell to the lot of any other public man  peel may at least divide with walpole the laurels of our greatest peace minister to that datethe man who presided over beneficent and necessary changes in national polity that in hands less strong and less skilful might easily have opened the sluices of civil confusion and when we think of walpoles closing days and of the melancholy end of most other ruling spirits in our political historyof the mortifications and disappointments in which from chatham and pitt down to canning and oconnell they have quitted the glorious fieldpeel must seem happy in the manner and moment of his death daring and prosperous legislative exploits had marked his path his authority in parliament never stood higher his honour in the country never stood so high his last words had been a commanding appeal for temperance in national action and language a solemn plea for peace as the true aim to set before a powerful people  to his father mr gladstone wrote       july 2 1850i thought sir r peel looked extremely feeble      during the debate last week i mean as compared with what he      usually is i observed that he slept during much of lord      palmerstons speech that he spoke with little physical energy and      next day saturday in the forenoon i thought he looked very ill at      a meeting which in common with him i had to attend this is all      that i know and that is worth telling on a subject which is one of      deep interest to all classes from the queen downwards i was at      the palace last night and she spoke to me with great earnestness      about it as to the division i shall say little it is an      unsatisfactory subject the majority of the government was made up      out of our ranks partly by people staying away and partly by some      twenty who actually voted with the government by far the greater      portion i am sorry to say of both sets of persons were what are      called peelites and not protectionists the fact is that if all      calling themselves liberal be put on one side and all calling      themselves conservatives on the other the house of commons is as      nearly as possible equally divided                           questions of leadership  i have already described how mr gladstone thought it a great mistake in peel to resist any step that might put upon the protectionists the responsibilities of office in a note composed a quarter of a century later 1876 he says this i think was not only a safe experiment after 1848 but a vital necessity i do not therefore think and i did not think that the death of sir r peel at the time when it occurred was a great calamity so far as the chief question of our internal politics was concerned in other respects it was indeed great in some of them it may almost be called immeasurable the moral atmosphere of the house of commons has never since his death been quite the same and is now widely different he had a kind of authority there that was possessed by no one else lord john might in some respects compete with in some even excel him but to him as leader of the liberals the loss of such an opponent was immense it is sad to think what with his high mental force and noble moral sense he might have done for us in after years even the afterthought of knowledge of such a man and of intercourse with him is a high privilege and a precious possession  an interesting word or two upon his own position at this season occur in a letter to his father july 9 1850       the letter in which you expressed a desire to be informed by me so      far as i might be able to speak whether there was anything in the      rumours circulated with regard to my becoming the leader in      parliament of the conservative party did not come to my hands      until yesterday the fact is that there is nothing whatever in      those rumours beyond mere speculation on things supposed probable      or possible and they must pass for what they are worth in that      character only people feel i suppose that sir robert peels life      and continuance in parliament were of themselves powerful obstacles      to the general reorganisation of the conservative party and as      there is great annoyance and dissatisfaction with the present state      of things and a widely spread feeling that it is not conducive to      the public interests there arises in mens minds an expectation      that the party will be in some manner reconstituted i share in the      feeling that it is desirable but i see very great difficulties in      the way and do not at present see how they are to be effectually      overcome the house of commons is almost equally divided indeed      between those professing liberal and those professing conservative      politics but the late division don pacifico showed how ill the      latter could hang together even when all those who had any      prominent station among them in any sense were united  cornewall lewis wroteupon gladstone the death of peel will have the effect of removing a weight from a springhe will come forward more and take more part in discussion the general opinion is that gladstone will renounce his free trade opinions and become leader of the protectionists i expect neither the one event nor the other230 more interesting still is something told by the duke of buccleuch very shortly said the duke in 1851 before sir robert peels death he expressed to me his belief that sidney herbert or gladstone would one day be premier but peel said with sarcasm if the hour comes disraeli must be made governorgeneral

by the state that man can be regenerated and the      terrible woes of this darkened world effectually dealt      withgladstone 1894   the test case of toleration at the moment of the oxford election of 1847 was the admission of the jews to sit in parliament and in the last month of 1847 mr gladstone astonished his father as well as a great host of his political supporters by voting with the government in favour of the removal of jewish disabilities no ordinary degree of moral courage was needed for such a step by the member for such a constituency it is a painful decision to come to he writes in his diary dec 16 but the only substantive doubt it raises is about remaining in parliament and it is truly and only the church which holds me there though she may seem to some to draw me from it pusey wrote to him in rather violent indignation for mr gladstone was the only man of that school who learned or was able to learn what the modern state is or is going to be this was the third phase so gladstone argued of an irresistible movement the tory party had fought first for an anglican parliament second they fought for a protestant parliament and now they were fighting for a christian parliament parliament had ceased to be anglican and it had ceased to be protestant and the considerations that supported these two earlier operations thenceforth condemned the exclusion from full civil rights of those who were not christians to his father he explained december 17 1847 after much consideration prolonged indeed i may say for the last two years and a half i made up my mind to support lord john russells bill for the admission of the jews i spoke to this effect last night it is with reluctance that i give the vote but i am convinced that after the civil privileges we have given them already including the magistracy and the franchise and after the admission we have already conceded to unitarians who refuse the whole of the most vital doctrines of the gospel we cannot compatibly with entire justice and fairness refuse to admit them  his father who was sometimes exacting complained of concealment mr gladstone replied that he regarded the question as one of difficulty and he therefore took as much time as he possibly could for reflection upon it though he never intended to run it as close as it actually came i know he says in a notable sentence it seems strange to you that i should find it necessary to hold my judgment in suspense on a question which seemed to many so plain but suspense is of constant occurrence in public life upon very many kinds of questions and without it errors and inconsistencies would be much more frequent than even they are now this did not satisfy his father i shall certainly read your speech to find some fair apology for your vote good and satisfactory reason i do not expect i cannot doubt you thought you withheld your opinions from me under the undecided state you were in without any intention whatever to annoy me there is however a natural closeness in your disposition with a reserve towards those who may think they may have some claim to your confidence probably increased by official habits which it may perhaps in some cases be worth your inquiring into the sentence above about suspense is a key to many misunderstandings of mr gladstones character his stouthearted friend thomas acland had warned him for the sake of his personal influence to be sure to deal with the jew question on broad grounds without refining and without dragging out some recondite view not seen by common men in short to be as little as possible like maurice and more like the duke of wellington my speech mr gladstone answered was most unsatisfactory in many ways but i do not believe that it mystified or puzzled anybody                          jewish disabilities  the following year he received the honour of a dcl degree at oxford mrs gladstone was there he tells his father and was well satisfied with my reception though it is not to be denied that my vote upon the jew bill is upon the whole unpalatable there and they had been provoked by a paragraph in the globe newspaper stating that i was to have the degree and that this made it quite clear that the minority was not unfavourable to the jew bill       july 5i went off after breakfast to oxford joined the vc      and doctors in the hall at wadham and went in procession to the      divinity schools provided with a white neckcloth by sir r inglis      who seized me at the station in horror and alarm when he saw me      with a black one in due time we were summoned to the theatre where      my degree had been granted with some non placets but with no      scrutiny the scene remarkable to the eye and mind so pictorial      and so national there was great tumult about me the hisses being      obstinate and the fautores also very generous gladstone and      the jew bill came sometimes from the gallery sometimes more      favouring sounds                                     ii  after the whig government was formed in 1846 mr gladstone expressed himself as having little fear that they could do much harm barring church patronage he was soon justified in his own eyes in this limitation of his confidence for the next year dr hampden was made a bishop232 this was a rude blow both to the university which had eleven years before pronounced him heretical and to the bishops who now bitterly and fervidly remonstrated grave points of law were raised but mr gladstone though warmly reprobating the prime ministers recommendation of a divine so sure to raise the hurricane took no leading part in the strife that followed never in my opinion he said to his father feb 2 1848 was a firebrand more wantonly and gratuitously cast it was an indication the more of a determination to substitute a sort of general religion for the doctrines of the church the next really marking incident after the secession of newman was a decision of a court of law known as the gorham judgment this and the preferment of hampden to his bishopric produced the second great tide of secession were we together mr gladstone writes to manning at the end of 1849 december 30 i should wish to converse with you from sunrise to sunset on the gorham case it is a stupendous issue perhaps they will evade it on abstract grounds this would be still more distasteful than a decision of the state against a catholic doctrine but what i feel is that as a body we are not ready yet for the last alternatives more years must elapse from the secession of newman and the group of secessions which following or preceding belonged to it a more composed and settled state of the public mind in regard to our relations with the church of rome must supervene there must be more years of faithful work for the church to point to in argument and to grow into her habits and besides all these very needful conditions of preparation for a crisis i want to see the question more fully answered what will the state of its own free and good will do or allow to be done for the church while yet in alliance with it  the gorham case was this a bishop refused to institute a clergyman to a vicarage in the west of england on the ground of unsound doctrine upon regeneration by baptism the clergyman sought a remedy in the ecclesiastical court of arches the judge decided against him the case then came on appeal before the judicial committee of the privy council and here a majority with the two archbishops as assessors reversed the decision of the court below the bishop one of the most combative of the human race flew to westminster hall tried move upon move in queens bench exchequer common pleas declared that his archbishop had abused his high commission and even actually renounced communion with him but the sons of zeruiah were too hard the religious world in both of its two standing camps was convulsed for if gorham had lost the day it would or might have meant the expulsion from the establishment of calvinists and evangelicals bag and baggage i am old enough said the provost of oriel to remember three baptismal controversies and this is the first in which one party has tried to eject the other from the church on the other hand the sacramental wing found it intolerable that fundamental doctrines of the church should be settled under the veil of royal supremacy by a court possessed of no distinctly church character                               the judgment  the judgment was declared on march 8 1850 and manning is made to tell a vivid story about going to mr gladstones house finding him ill with influenza sitting down by his bedside and telling him what the court had done whereon mr gladstone started up threw out his arms and exclaimed that the church of england was gone unless it relieved itself by some authoritative act a witty judge once observed in regard to the practice of keeping diaries that it was wise to keep diary enough at any rate to prove an alibi according to mr gladstones diary he was not laid up until several days later when he did see various people manning included in his bedroom on the black day of the judgment having dined at the palace the night before and having friends to dine with him on this night he records a busy day including a morning spent after letterwriting in discussion with manning hope and others on the gorham case and its probable consequences this slip of memory in the cardinal is trivial and not worth mentioning but perhaps it tends to impair another vivid scene described on the same authority how thirteen of them met at mr gladstones house agreed to a declaration against the judgment and proceeded to sign how mr gladstone standing with his back to the fire began to demur and when pressed by manning to sign asked him in a low voice whether he thought that as a privy councillor he ought to sign such a protest and finally how manning knowing the pertinacity of his character turned and said we will not press him further233 this graphic relation looks as if mr gladstone were leaving his friends in the lurch none of them ever said so none of them made any signs of thinking so there is no evidence that mr gladstone ever agreed to the resolution at all and there is even evidence that points presumptively the other way that he was taking a line of his own and arguing tenaciously against all the rest for delay234 mr gladstone was often enough in a hurry himself but there never was a man in this world more resolute against being hurried by other people235                    exciting effect of the judgment  we need not however argue probabilities mr gladstone no sooner saw the story than he pronounced it fiction in a letter to the writer of the book on cardinal manning jan 14 1896 he says       i read with surprise mannings statement made first after 35      years that i would not sign the declaration of 1850 because i was      a privy councillor i should not have been more surprised had he      written that i told him i could not sign because my name began with      g i had done stronger things than that when i was not only privy      councillor but official servant of the crown nay i believe      cabinet minister the declaration was liable to many interior      objections seven out of the thirteen who signed did so without i      believe any kind of sequel i wish you to know that i entirely      disavow and disclaim mannings statement as it stands and here i      have to ask you to insert two lines in your second or next edition      with the simple statement that i prepared and published with      promptitude an elaborate argument to show that the judicial      committee was historically unconstitutional as an organ for the      decision of ecclesiastical questions this declaration was      entitled i think a letter to the bishop of london on the      ecclesiastical supremacy if i recollect right while it dealt      little with theology it was a more pregnant production than the      declaration and it went much nearer the mark it has been      repeatedly published and is still on sale at murrays i am glad      to see that sidney herbert a gentleman if ever there was one      also declined to sign it seems to me now that there is      something almost ludicrous in the propounding of such a congeries      of statements by such persons as we were not the more but      certainly not the less because of being privy councillors       it was a terrible time aggravated for me by heavy cares and      responsibilities of a nature quite extraneous and far beyond all      others by the illness and death of a muchloved child with great      anxieties about another my recollections of the conversations      before the declaration are little but a mass of confusion and      bewilderment i stand only upon what i did no one of us i      think understood the actual position not even our lawyers until      baron alderson printed an excellent statement on the points      raised236                                    iii  for long the new situation filled his mind the case of the church of england at this moment he wrote to lord lyttelton is a very dismal one and almost leaves men to choose between a broken heart and no heart at all but at present it is all dark or only twilight which rests upon our future he busily set down thoughts upon the supremacy he studied cawdrys case and he mastered lord cokes view of the law he feels better pleased with the reformation in regard to the supremacy but also much more sensible of the drifting of the church since away from the range of her constitutional securities and more than ever convinced how thoroughly false is the present position as to himself and his own work in life in reply i suppose to something urged by manning he says april 29 1850 i have two characters to fulfilthat of a lay member of the church and that of a member of a sort of wreck of a political party i must not break my understood compact with the last and forswear my profession unless and until the necessity has arisen that necessity will plainly have arisen for me when it shall have become evident that justice cannot ie will not be done by the state to the church with boundless exaltation of spirit he expatiated on the arduous and noble task which it was now laid upon the children of the church of england amid trouble suspense and it might be even agony to perform fully believing that the death of the church of england is among the alternative issues of the gorham case he wrote to a clerical friend april 9 i yet also believe that all christendom and all its history have rarely afforded a nobler opportunity of doing battle for the faith in the church than that now offered to english churchmen that opportunity is a prize far beyond any with which the days of her prosperity in any period can have been adorned he does not think june 1 1850 that a loftier work was ever committed to men such vast interests were at stake such unbounded prospects open before them what they wanted was the divine art to draw from present terrible calamities and appalling future prospects the conquering secret to rise through the struggle into something better than historical anglicanism which essentially depended on conditions that have passed away in my own case he says to manning a little later there is work ready to my hand and much more than enough for its weakness a great mercy and comfort but i think i know what my course would be were there not it would be to set to work upon the holy task or clearing opening and establishing positive truth in the church of england which is an office doubly blessed inasmuch as it is both the business of truth and the laying of firm foundations for future union in christendom if this vision of a dream had ever come to pass perhaps europe might have seen the mightiest christian doctor since bossuet and just as bossuets struggle was called the grandest spectacle of the seventeenth century so to many eyes this might have appeared the greatest of the nineteenth mr gladstone did not see in truth he never saw any more than bossuet saw in his age that the timespirit was shifting the foundations of the controversy however that may be the interesting thing for us in the history of his life is the characteristic blaze of battle that this case now kindled in his breast                     view of the crisis in the church  on the eve of his return from germany in the autumn of 1845 one of his letters to mrs gladstone reveals the pressing intensity of his conviction deepened by his intercourse with the grave and pious circles at munich and at stuttgart of the supreme interest of spiritual things       in my wanderings my thoughts too have had time to travel and i      have had much conversation upon church matters first at munich and      since coming here with mrs craven and some connections of hers      staying with her who are roman catholics of a high school all      that i can see and learn induces me more and more to feel what a      crisis for religion at large is this period of the worlds      historyhow the power of religion and its permanence are bound up      with the churchhow inestimably precious would be the churchs      unity inestimably precious on the one hand and on the other to      human eyes immeasurably remotelastly how loud how solemn is the      call upon all those who hear and who can obey it to labour more      and more in the spirit of these principles to give themselves if      it may be clearly and wholly to that work it is dangerous to put      indefinite thoughts instincts longings into language which is      necessarily determinate i cannot trace the line of my own future      life but i hope and pray it may not always be where it is      ireland ireland that cloud in the west that coming storm the      minister of gods retribution upon cruel and inveterate and but      halfatoned injustice ireland forces upon us those great social      and great religious questionsgod grant that we may have courage      to look them in the face and to work through them were they over      were the path of the church clear before her as a body able to      take her trial before god and the world upon the performance of her      work as his organ for the recovery of our countryhow joyfully      would i retire from the barren exhausting strife of merely      political contention i do not think that you would be very      sorrowful as to ambition in its ordinary sense we are spared the      chief part of its temptations if it has a valuable reward upon      earth over and above a good name it is when a man is enabled to      bequeath to his children a high place in the social system of his      country that cannot be our case the days are gone by when such a      thing might have been possible to leave to willy a title with its      burdens and restraints and disqualifications but without the      material substratum of wealth and the duties and means of good as      well as the general power attending it would not i think be acting      for him in a wise and loving spiritassuming which may be a vain      assumption that the alternative could ever be before us  the fact that in scotland a country in which mr gladstone passed so much time and had such lively interests the members of his own episcopal church were dissenters was well fitted to hasten the progress of his mind in the liberal direction certain it is that in a stronglywritten letter to a scotch bishop at the end of 1851 mr gladstone boldly enlarged upon the doctrine of religious freedom with a directness that kindled both alarm and indignation among some of his warmest friends237 away he cried with the servile doctrine that religion cannot live but by the aid of parliaments when the state has ceased to bear a definite and full religious character it is our interest and our duty alike to maintain a full religious freedom it is this plenary religious freedom that brings out in full vigour the internal energies of each communion of all civil calamities the greatest is the mutilation under the seal of civil authority of the christian religion itself one fine passage in this letter denotes an advance in his political temper as remarkable as the power of the language in which it finds expression       it is a great and noble secret that of constitutional freedom      which has given to us the largest liberties with the steadiest      throne and the most vigorous executive in christendom i confess to      my strong faith in the virtue of this principle i have lived now      for many years in the midst of the hottest and noisiest of its      workshops and have seen that amidst the clatter and the din a      ceaseless labour is going on stubborn matter is reduced to      obedience and the brute powers of society like the fire air      water and mineral of nature are with clamour indeed but also with      might educated and shaped into the most refined and regular forms      of usefulness for man i am deeply convinced that among us all      systems whether religious or political which rest on a principle      of absolutism must of necessity be not indeed tyrannical but      feeble and ineffective systems and that methodically to enlist the      members of a community with due regard to their several      capacities in the performance of its public duties is the way to      make that community powerful and healthful to give a firm seat to      its rulers and to engender a warm and intelligent devotion in      those beneath their sway238                         foundations of liberalism  these were the golden trumpetnotes of a new time when they readied the ears of old dr routh as he sat in wig and cassock among his books and manuscripts at magdalen revolving nearly a hundred years of mortal life he exclaimed that he had heard enough to be quite sure that no man holding such opinions as these could ever be a proper member for the university of oxford a few months later it was seen how the learned man found several hundreds of unlearned to agree with him                                      iv  this chapter naturally closes with what was to mr gladstone one of the dire catastrophies of his life with growing dismay he had seen manning drawing steadily towards the edge of the cataract when he took the ominous step of quitting his charge at lavington mr gladstone wrote to him from naples january 26 1851 without description from you i can too well comprehend what you have suffered such griefs ought to be sacred to all men they must be sacred to me even did they not touch me sharply with a reflected sorrow you can do nothing that does not reach me considering how long you have been a large part both of my actual life and of my hopes and reckonings should you do the act which i pray god with my whole soul you may not do it will not break however it may impair or strain the bonds between us if you go over he says in another letter of the same month i should earnestly pray that you might not be as others who have gone before you but might carry with you a larger heart and mind able to raise and keep you above that slavery to a system that exaggeration of its forms that disposition to rivet every shackle tighter and to stretch every breach wider which makes me mournfully feel that the men who have gone from the church of england after being reared in her and by her are far more keen and i must add far more cruel adversaries to her than were the mass of those whom they joined  in the case of hope there had been for some considerable time a lingering sense of change my affection for him during these later years before his change was i may almost say intense there was hardly anything i think which he could have asked me to do and which i would not have done but as i saw more and more through the dim light what was to happen it became more and more like the affection felt for one departed hope he says was not one of those shallow souls who think that such a relation can continue after its daily bread has been taken away at the end of march he enters in his diary wrote a paper on mannings question and gave it him he smote me to the ground by announcing with suppressed emotion that he is now upon the brink and hope too such terrible blows not only overset and oppress but i fear demoralise me on the same day in april 1851 manning and hope were received together into the roman church political separations though these too have their pangs must have seemed to mr gladstone trivial indeed after the tragic severance of such a fellowship as this had been                       manning and hope go over  they were my two props he wrote in his diary the next day their going may be to me a sign that my work is gone with them one blessing i have total freedom from doubts these dismal events have smitten but not shaken the day after that he made a codicil to his will striking out hope as executor and substituting northcote friendship did not die but only lived as it lives between those who inhabit separate worlds communication was not severed social intercourse was not avoided and both on occasions in life the passing by of which as hopescott said would be a loss to friendship and on smaller opportunities they corresponded in terms of the old affection quis desiderio is mr gladstones docket on one of hopes letters and in another 1858 hope communicates in words of tender feeling the loss of his wife and the consolatory teachings of the faith that she like himself had embraced and he recalls to mr gladstone that the root of their friendship which struck the deepest was fed by a common interest in religion239  in mannings case the wound cut deeper and for many years the estrangement was complete240 to wilberforce the archdeacon mr gladstone wrote april 11 1851       i do indeed feel the loss of manning if and as far as i am capable      of feeling anything it comes to me cumulated and doubled with      that of james hope nothing like it can ever happen to me again      arrived now at middle life i never can form i suppose with any      other two men the habits of communication counsel and dependence      in which i have now for from fifteen to eighteen years lived with      them both my intellect does deliberately reject the grounds on      which manning has proceeded indeed they are such as go far to      destroy my confidence which was once and far too long at the      highest point in the healthiness and soundness of his to show      that at any rate this is not from the mere change he has made i      may add that my conversations with hope have not left any      corresponding impression upon my mind with regard to him  a wider breach was this same year made in his inmost circle in april of the year before a little daughter between four and five years old had died and was buried at fasque the illness was long and painful and mr gladstone bore his part in the nursing and watching he was tenderly fond of his little children and the sorrow had a peculiar bitterness it was the first time that death entered his married home  when he returned to fasque in the autumn he found that his father had taken a decided step nay a stride in old age not having lost any of his interest in politics but grown quite mild the old man was nearing his eightyseventh year the very wreck of his powerful and simple nature is full of grandeur mischief is at work upon his brainthat indefatigable brain which has had to stand all the wear and pressure of his long life in the spring of 1851 he finds him very like a spent cannonball with a great and sometimes almost frightful energy remaining in him though weak in comparison with what he was he hits a very hard knock to those who come across him when december came the veteran was taken seriously ill and the hope disappeared of seeing him even reach his eightyseventh birthday dec 11 on the 7th he died as mr gladstone wrote to phillimore though with little left either of sight or hearing and only able to walk from one room to another or to his brougham for a short drive though his memory was gone his hold upon language even for common purposes imperfect the reasoning power much decayed and even his perception of personality rather indistinct yet so much remained about him as one of the most manful energetic affectionate and simplehearted among human beings that he still filled a great space to the eye mind and heart and a great space is accordingly left void by his withdrawal the death of my father mr gladstone wrote to his brother john is the loss of a great object of love and it is the shattering of a great bond of union among few families of five persons will be found differences of character and opinion to the same aggregate amount as among us we cannot shut our eyes to this fact by opening them i think we may the better strive to prevent such differences from begetting estrangement  footnotes  232 see above p 167  233 purcell manning i pp 52833  234 see

pusey etc met here in the evening i was not with them on the same day mr gladstone had written to the rev w maskell as respects myself i do not intend to pursue the consideration of them with those who meet tonight first because the pressure of other business has become very heavy upon me and secondly and mainly because i do not consider that the time for any enunciation of a character pointing to ultimate issues will have arrived until the gorham judgment shall have taken effect no later meeting is ever mentioned  236 purcell professed to rectify the matter in the fourth edition i p 536 but

an abridged version of lockharts life of scott then hope found that his fatherinlaws own abridgment was unknown and 1871 asks mr gladstones leave to dedicate a reprint of it to him as one among those who think that scott still deserves to be remembered not as an author only but as a noble and vigorous man  240 from 1853 to 1861 they did not correspond nor did they even meet

of the government here naples to      mildness and clemency because it does not put men to death and      confines itself to leaving six or seven thousand state prisoners to      perish in dungeons i am ready to believe that the king of naples      is naturally mild and kindly but he is afraid and the worst of      all tyrannies is the tyranny of cowardstocqueville 1850   in the autumn of 1850 with the object of benefiting the eyesight of one of their daughters the gladstones made a journey to southern italy and an eventful journey it proved for italy it was that now first drew mr gladstone by the native ardour of his humanity unconsciously and involuntarily into that great european stream of liberalism which was destined to carry him so far two deep principles sentiments aspirations forces call them what we will awoke the huge uprisings that shook europe in 1848the principle of liberty the sentiment of nationality mr gladstone slowly and almost blindly heaving off his shoulders the weight of old conservative tradition did not at first go beyond liberty with all that ordered liberty conveys nationality penetrated later and then indeed it penetrated to the hearts core he went to naples with no purposes of political propagandism and his prepossessions were at that time pretty strongly in favour of established governments either at naples or anywhere else the case had doubtless been opened to him by panizzia man as mr gladstone described him of warm large and free nature an accomplished man of letters and a victim of political persecution who came to this country a nearly starving refugee but panizzi had certainly made no great revolutionist of him his opinions as he told lord aberdeen were the involuntary and unexpected result of his sojourn  he had nothing to do with the subterranean forces at work in the kingdom of the two sicilies in the states of the church and in truth all over the peninsula the protracted struggle that had begun after the establishment of austrian domination in the peninsula in 1815 and was at last to end in the construction of an italian kingdomthe most wonderful political transformation of the centuryseemed after the fatal crisis of novara 1849 further than ever from a close now was the morrow of the vast failures and disenchantments of 1848 jesuits and absolutists were once more masters and reaction again

movement of young italy the other the constitutional movement of the italian resurrection the scene presented brutal repression on the one hand on the other a chaos of republicans and monarchists unitarians and federalists frenzied idealists and sedate economists wild ultras and men of the sober middle course in the midst was the pope the august shadow not long before the centre now once again the foe of his countrymens aspirations after freedom and a purer glimpse of the lights of the sun the evolution of this extraordinary historic drama to which passion genius hope contrivance stratagem and force contributed alike the highest and the lowest elements in human nature and the growth of states was to be one of the most sincere of mr gladstones interests for the rest of his life                          spectacle of misrule  as we shall see he was at first and he long remained untouched by the idea of italian unity and italy a nation he met some thirty or more italian gentlemen in society at naples of whom seven or eight only were in any sense liberals and not one of them a republican it was now that he made the acquaintance of lacaita afterwards so valued a friend of his and so well known in many circles in england for his geniality cultivation and enlightenment he was the legal adviser to the british embassy he met mr gladstone constantly they talked politics and literature day and night under the acacias and palms between the fountains and statues of the villa reale looking now to the sea now to the world of fashion in the corso here lacaita first opened the travellers eyes to the condition of things though he was able to say with literal truth that not a single statement of fact was made upon lacaitas credit mr gladstone saw bourbon absolutism no longer in the decorous hues of conventional diplomacy but as the black and execrable thing it really wasthe negation of god erected into a system of government sitting in court for long hours during the trial of poerio he listened with as much patience as he could command to the principal crown witness giving such evidence that the tenth part of what he heard should not only have ended the case but secured condign punishment for perjuryevidence that a prostitute court found good enough to justify the infliction on poerio not long before a minister of the crown of the dreadful penalty of fourandtwenty years in irons mr gladstone accurately informed himself of the condition of those who for unproved political offences were in thousands undergoing degrading and murderous penalties he contrived to visit some of the neapolitan prisons another name for the extreme of filth and horror he saw political prisoners and political prisoners included a large percentage of the liberal opposition chained two and two in double irons to common felons he conversed with poerio himself in the bagno of nisida chained in this way he watched sick prisoners men almost with death in their faces toiling upstairs to see the doctors because the lower regions were too foul and loathsome to allow it to be expected that professional men would enter even these inhuman and revolting scenes stirred him less as it was right they should than the corruptions of the tribunals the vindictive treatment for long periods of time of uncondemned and untried men and all the other proceedings of the government desolating entire classes upon which the life and growth of the nation depend undermining the foundation of all civil rule it was this violation of all law and of the constitution to which king ferdinand had solemnly sworn fidelity only a year or two before that outraged him more than even rigorous sentences and barbarous prison practice even on the severity of these sentences he wrote i would not endeavour to fix attention so much as to draw it off from the great fact of illegality which seems to me to be the foundation of the neapolitan system illegality the fountainhead of cruelty and baseness and every other vice illegality which gives a bad conscience creates fears those fears lead to tyranny that tyranny begets resentment that resentment creates true causes of fear where they were not before and thus fear is quickened and enhanced the original vice multiplies itself with fearful speed and the old crime engenders a necessity for new241  poerio apprehended that his own case had been made worse by the intervention of mr temple the british minister and brother of lord palmerston not in the least as blaming him or considering it officious he adopted the motto to suffer is to do il patire è anche operare for himself he was not only willinghe rejoicedto play the martyrs part       i was particularly desirous wrote mr gladstone in a private      memorandum to have poerios opinion on the expediency of making      some effort in england to draw general attention to these horrors      and dissociate the conservative party from all suppositions of      winking at them because i had had from a sensible man one strong      opinion against such a course i said to him that in my view only      two models could be thought ofthe first amicable remonstrance      through the cabinets the second public notoriety and shame that      had lord aberdeen been in power the first might have been      practicable but that with lord palmerston it would not because of      his position relatively to the other cabinets yes he said lord      palmerston was isolato not because he would be wanting in the      will matters standing thus i saw no way open but that of      exposure and might that possibly exasperate the neapolitan      government and increase their severity his reply was as to us      never mind we can hardly be worse than we are but think of our      country for which we are most willing to be sacrificed exposure      will do it good the present government of naples rely on the      english conservative party consequently we were all in horror when      lord stanley last year carried his motion in the house of lords      let there be a voice from that party showing that whatever      government be in power in england no support will be given to such      proceedings as these it will do much to break them down it will      also strengthen the hands of a better and less obdurate class about      the court even there all are not alike i know it from      observation these ministers are the extremest of extremes there      are others who would willingly see more moderate means adopted on      such grounds as these i do not quote words he strongly      recommended me to act                                       ii                               return to london  mr gladstone reached london on february 26 phillimore met him at the station with lord stanleys letter of which we shall hear in the next chapter pressing him to enter the government i was never more struck says phillimore by the earnestness and simplicity of his character he could speak of nothing so readily as the horrors of the neapolitan government of which i verily believe he thought nearly as much as the prospect of his own accession to one of the highest offices of state he probably thought not only nearly as much but infinitely more of those scenes fitter for hell than earth now many hundred miles away but still vividly burning in the haunted chambers of his wrath and pity after rapidly despatching the proposal to join the new cabinet after making the best he could of the poignant anxieties that were stirred in him by the unmistakeable signs of the approaching secession of hope and manning he sought lord aberdeen march 4 and found him as always satisfactory kind just moderate humane to mrs gladstone march 4 he had come to london with the intention of obtaining if possible aberdeens intervention in preference to any other mode of proceeding242 and they agreed that private representation and remonstrance should be tried in the first instance as less likely than public action by mr gladstone in parliament to rouse international jealousy abroad or to turn the odious tragedy into the narrow channels of party at home mr gladstone at lord aberdeens desire was to submit a statement of the case for his consideration and judgment                        position of lord aberdeen  this statement the first memorable letter to lord aberdeen was ready at the beginning of april the old minister gave it mature consideration for the best part of a month his antecedents made him cautious mr gladstone ten years later admitted that lord aberdeens views of italy did not harmonise with what was his general mode of estimating human action and the worlds affairs and there was a reason for this in his past career in very early youth he had been called upon to deal with the gigantic questions that laid their mighty weight upon european statesmen at the fall of napoleon the natural effect of this close contact with the vast and formidable problems of 18145 was to make him regard the statesystem then founded as a structure on which only reckless or criminal unwisdom would dare to lay a finger the fierce storms of 1848 were not calculated to loosen this fixed idea or to dispose him to any new views of either the relations of austria to italy or of the uncounted mischiefs to the peninsula of which those relations were the nourishing and maintaining cause in a debate in the lords two years before july 20 1849 lord aberdeen had sharply criticised the british government of the day for doing the very thing officially which mr gladstone was now bringing moral compulsion on him to attempt unofficially lord palmerston had called attention at vienna to the crying evils of the government of naples and had boldly said that it was little wonder if men groaning for long years under such grievances and seeing no hope of redress should take up any scheme however wild that held out any chance of relief this and other proceedings indicating unfriendliness to the king of naples and a veiled sympathy with rebellion shocked aberdeen as much as lamartines trenchant saying that the treaties of vienna were effete in attacking palmerstons foreign policy again in 1850 he protested that we had deeply injured austria and had represented her operations in italy in a completely false light in his speech in the pacifico debate he had referred to the neapolitan government without approval but in guarded phrases and had urged as against lord palmerston that the less they admired neapolitan institutions and usages the more careful ought they to be not to impair the application of the sacred principles that govern and harmonise the intercourse between states from which you never can depart without producing mischiefs a thousand fold greater than any promised advantage aberdeen was too upright and deeply humane a man to resist the dreadful evidence that was now forced upon him still that evidence plainly shook down his own case of a few months earlier and this cannot have been pleasing he felt the truth and the enormity of the indictment laid before him he saw the prejudice that would inevitably be done to conservatism both at home and on the european continent by the publication of such an indictment from the lips of such a pleader and he perceived from mr gladstones demeanour that the decorous plausibilities of diplomacy would no more hold him back from resolute exposure than they would put out the fires of vesuvius or etna  on may 2 lord aberdeen wrote to schwarzenberg at vienna saying that for forty years he had been connected with the austrian government and taken a warm interest in the fortunes of the empire that mr gladstone one of the most distinguished members of the cabinet of peel had been so shocked by what he saw at naples that he was resolved to make some public appeal that to avoid the pain and scandal of a conservative statesman taking such a course would not his highness use his powerful influence to get done at naples all that could reasonably be desired the austrian minister replied several weeks after june 30 if he had been invited he said officially to interfere he would have declined as it was he would bring mr gladstones statements to the notice of his sicilian majesty meanwhile at great length he reminded lord aberdeen that a political offender may be the worst of all offenders and argued that the rigour exercised by england herself in the ionian islands in ceylon in respect of irishmen and in the recent case of ernest jones showed how careful she should be in taking up abroad the cause of bad men posing as martyrs in the holy cause of liberty  during all these weeks while aberdeen was maturely considering and while prince schwarzenberg was making his secretaries hunt up recriminatory cases against england mr gladstone was growing impatient lord aberdeen begged him to give the austrian minister a little more time it was nearly four months since mr gladstone landed at dover and every day he thought of poerio settembrini and the rest wearing their double chains subsisting on their foul soup degraded by forced companionship with criminals cut off from the light of heaven and festering in their dungeons the facts that escaped from him in private conversation seemed to himso he tells lacaitato spread like wildfire from man to man exciting the liveliest interest and extending to the highest persons in the land he waited a fortnight more then at the beginning of july he launched his thunderbolt publishing his letter to lord aberdeen followed by a second explanation and enlargement a fortnight later243 he did not obtain formal leave from lord aberdeen for the publication but from their conversation took it for granted                       neapolitan letters published  the sensation was profound and not in england only the letters were translated into various tongues and had a large circulation the society of the friends of italy in london the disciples of mazzini and a highhearted band they were besought him to become a member exiles wrote him letters of gratitude and hope with all the moving accent of revolutionary illusion italian women composed fervid odes in fire and tears to the generoso britanno the magnanimo cor the difensore dun popolo gemente the press in this country took the matter up with the warmth that might have been expected the character and the politics of the accuser added invincible force to his accusations and for the first time in his life mr gladstone found himself vehemently applauded in liberal prints even the contemporary excitement of english public feeling against the roman catholic church fed the flame it was pointed out that the king of naples was the bosom friend of the pope and that the infernal system described by mr gladstone was that which the roman clergy regarded as normal and complete244 mr gladstone had denounced as one of the most detestable books he ever read a certain catechism used in the neapolitan schools why then cried the times does he omit all comment on the church which is the main and direct agent in this atrocious instruction the clergy had either basely accepted from the government doctrines that they were bound to abhor or else these doctrines were their own and so things glided easily round to dr cullen and the irish education question this line was none the less natural from the fact that the editor of the univers the chief catholic organ in france made himself the foremost champion of the neapolitan policy the letters delighted the paris reds they regarded their own epithets as insipid by comparison with the ferocious adjectives of the english conservative on the other hand an english gentleman was blackballed at one of the fashionable clubs in paris for no better reason than that he bore the name of gladstone for european conservatives read the letters with disgust and apprehension people like madame de lieven pronounced mr gladstone the dupe of men less honest than himself and declared that he had injured the good cause and discredited his own fame besides doing lord aberdeen the wrong of setting his name at the head of a detestable libel the illustrious guizot wrote mr gladstone a long letter expressing with much courtesy and kindness his regret at the publication nothing is left in italy said guizot between the terrors of governments attacked in their very existence and the fury of the beaten revolutionists with hopes more alert than ever for destruction and chaos the king of naples on one side mazzini on the other such said guizot is italy between the king of naples and mazzini he for one did not hesitate this was mr gladstones first contact with the european party of order in the middle of the century guizot was a great man but 48 had perverted his generalising intellect and everywhere his jaundiced vision perceived in progress a struggle for life and death with the revolutionary spirit blind chimerical insatiate impracticable he avowed his own failure when he was at the head of the french government to induce the rulers of italy to make reforms and now the answer of schwarzenberg to lord aberdeen as well as the official communications from naples showed that like guizots french policy the austrian remedy was moonshine  perhaps discomposed by the reproaches of reactionary friends abroad lord aberdeen thought he had some reason to complain of the publication it is not easy to see why mr gladstone from the first insisted that if private remonstrance did not work without elusion or delay he would make a public appeal in transmitting the first letter he described in very specific terms his idea that a short time would suffice to show whether the private method could be relied upon245 the attitude of the minister at vienna of fortunato at naples and of castelcicala in london discovered even to aberdeen himself how little reasonable hope there was of anything being done elusion and delay was all that he could expect he was forced to give entire credit to mr gladstones horrible story and was as far as possible from thinking it a detestable libel he never denied the foundation of the case or the actual state of the abominable facts schwarzenberg never consented to comply with his wishes even when writing before the publication how then could aberdeen expect that mr gladstone should abandon the set and avowed purpose with which he had come flaming and resolved to england                           sensation in europe  it was exactly because the party with which mr gladstone was allied had made itself the supporter of established governments throughout europe that in his eyes that party became specially responsible for not passing by in silence any course of conduct even in a foreign country flagrantly at variance with right246 and what was there when at last they arrived in prince schwarzenbergs idle dissertations and recriminations winding up with a still more idle sentence about bringing the charges under the notice of the neapolitan government that should induce mr gladstone to abandon his purpose he had something else to think of than the scandal to the reactionaries of europe i wish it were in your power he writes to lacaita in may to assure any of those directly interested in my name that i am not unfaithful to them and will use every means in my power feeble they are and i lament it but god is strong and is just and good and the issue is in his hands that is what he was thinking of when he talked of the sacred purposes of humanity it was not artificial claptrap in a protocol247  when i consider mr gladstone wrote to lord aberdeen that prince schwarzenberg really knew the state of things at naples well enough independently of me and then ask myself why did he wait seven weeks before acknowledging a letter relating to the intense sufferings of human beings which were going on day by day and hour by hour while his people were concocting all that trash about frost and ernest jones and obrien i cannot say that i think the spirit of the letter was creditable to him or very promising as regards these people the neapolitan government entered the field with a formal reply point by point and mr gladstone met them with a point by point rejoinder the matter did not rest there soon after his arrival at home he had had some conversation with john russell palmerston and other members of the government they were much interested and not at all incredulous lord palmerstons brother kept him too well informed about the state of things there for him to be sceptical gladstone and molesworth wrote palmerston say that they were wrong last year in their attacks on my foreign policy but they did not know the truth248 lord palmerston directed copies of mr gladstones letters to be sent to the british representatives in all the courts of europe with instructions to give a copy to each government the neapolitan envoy in london in his turn requested him also to send fifteen copies of the pamphlet that had been got up on the other side palmerston promptly and in his most characteristic style vindicated mr gladstone against the charges of overstatement and hostile intention warned the neapolitan government of the violent revolution that longcontinued and widespread injustice would assuredly bring upon them hoped that they might have set to work to correct the manifold and grave abuses to which their attention had been drawn and flatly refused to have anything to do with an official pamphlet consisting of a flimsy tissue of bare assertions and reckless denials mixed up with coarse ribaldry and commonplace abuse this was the kind of thing that gave to lord palmerston the best of his power over the people of england                    energetic sympathy of palmerston  in the house of commons he spoke with no less warmth though he had not felt it his duty he said to make representations at naples on a matter relating to internal affairs he thought mr gladstone had done himself great honour instead of seeking amusements diving into volcanoes and exploring excavated cities he had visited prisons descended into dungeons examined cases of the victims of illegality and injustice and had then sought to rouse the public opinion of europe it was because he concurred in this opinion that he had circulated the pamphlet in the hope that the european courts might use their influence249 as lord aberdeen told madame de lieven mr gladstones pamphlet by the extraordinary sensation it had created among men of all parties had given a great practical triumph to palmerston and the foreign office  the immediate effect of mr gladstones appeal was an aggravation of prison rigour panizzi was convinced that the king did not know of all the iniquities exposed by mr gladstone at the close of 1851 he obtained an interview with ferdinand and for twenty minutes spoke of poerio settembrini and the condition of the prisons the king suddenly cut short the interview saying addio terribile panizzi250 faint streaks of light from the outside world pierced the gloom of the dungeons as time went on a lady contrived to smuggle in a few pages of mr gladstones first letter and in 1854 the martyrs heard vaguely of the action of cavour but it was not until 1859 that the tyrant fearing the cry of horror that would go up in europe if poerio should die in chains or worse than death should go mad commuted prison to perpetual exile251 and sixtysix of them were embarked for america at lisbon they were transferred to an american ship the captain either intimidated or bribed put in at queenstown in setting foot on this free soil poerio wrote to mr gladstone from the irish haven march 12 1859 the first need of my heart was to seek news of you communications were speedily opened the italians made their way to bristol where they were received with sympathy and applause by the population the deliverance of their country was close at hand  not now nor for many years to come did mr gladstone grasp the idea of italian unity it was impossible for him to ignore but he did undoubtedly set aside the fact that every shade and section of italian liberalism from farini on the right to mazzini on the furthest left insisted on treating italy as a political integer and placed the independence of italy and the expulsion of austria from italian soil as the first and fundamental article in the creed of reform like most of the english friends of the italian cause at this time except the small but earnest group who rallied round the powerful moral genius of mazzini he thought only of local freedom and local reforms the purely abstract idea of italian nationality said mr gladstone at this time makes little impression and finds limited sympathy among ourselves i am certain he wrote to panizzi june 21 1851 that the italian habit of preaching unity and nationality in preference to showing grievances produces a revulsion here for if there are two things on earth that john bull hates they are an abstract proposition and the pope you need not be afraid i think he told lord aberdeen december 1 1851 of mazzinism from me still less of kossuthism which means the other plus imposture lord palmerston and his nationalities but then in 1854 manin came to england and failed to persuade even lord palmerston that the unity of italy was the only clue to her freedom252 the russian war made it inconvenient to quarrel with austria about italy with mr gladstone he made more way seven to breakfast to meet manin says the diary he too is wild not too wild however to work conversion on his host it was my privilege mr gladstone afterwards wrote to welcome manin in london in 1854 when i had long been anxious for reform in italy and it was from him that in common with some other englishmen i had my first lessons upon italian unity as the indispensable basis of all effectual reform under the peculiar circumstances of that country253 yet the page of dante holds the lesson                                       iii                               the temporal power  on one important element in the complex italian case at this time mr gladstone gained a clear view       some things i have learned in italy he wrote to manning january      26 1851 that i did not know before one in particular the      temporal power of the pope that great wonderful and ancient      erection is gone the problem has been worked outthe ground is      minedthe train is laida foreign force in its nature      transitory alone stays the hand of those who would complete the      process by applying the match this seems rather than is a      digression when that event comes it will bring about a great      shifting of partsmuch superand much subterposition god grant      it may be for good i desire it because i see plainly that justice      requires it not out of malice to the popedom for i cannot at this      moment dare to answer with a confident affirmative the question a      very solemn oneten twenty fifty years hence will there be any      other body in western christendom witnessing for fixed dogmatic      truth with all my heart i wish it well though perhaps not wholly      what the consistory might think agreed with the meaning of the      termit would be to me a joyous day in which i should see it      really doing well  various ideas of this kind set him to work on the large and curious enterprise long since forgotten of translating farinis volumes on the roman state from 1815 down to 1850 according to the entries in his diary he began and finished the translation of a large portion of the book at naples in 1850dictating and writing almost daily three of the four volumes of this english translation were done with extraordinary speed by mr gladstones own hand and the fourth was done under his direction254 his object was without any reference to italian unity to give an illustration of the actual working of the temporal power in its latest history it is easy to understand how the theme fitted in with the widest topics of his life the nature of theocratic government the possibility to borrow cavours famous phrase of a free church in a free state and above allas he says to manning now and said to all the world twenty years later in the day of the vatican decreesthe mischiefs done to the cause of what he took for saving truth by evildoing in the heart and centre of the most powerful of all the churches his translation of farini followed by his article on the same subject in the edinburgh in 1852 was his first blast against the covetous domineering implacable policy represented in the term ultramontanism the winding up higher and higher tighter and tighter of the hierarchical spirit in total disregard of those elements by which it ought to be checked and balanced and an unceasing covert smouldering war against human freedom even in its most modest and retiring forms of private life and of the individual conscience with an energy not unworthy of burke at his fiercest he denounces the fallen and impotent regality of the popes as temporal sovereigns a monarchy sustained by foreign armies smitten with the curse of social barrenness unable to strike root downward or bear fruit upward the sun the air the rain soliciting in vain its sapless and rotten boughssuch a monarchy even were it not a monarchy of priests and tenfold more because it is one stands out a foul blot upon the face of creation an offence to christendom and to mankind255 as we shall soon see he was just as wrathful just as impassioned and as eloquent when in a memorable case in his own country the temporal power bethought itself of a bill for meddling with the rights of a roman voluntary church  footnotes  241 for the two letters to lord aberdeen see gleanings iv  242 there was a slight discrepancy between the two on this point mr gladstone describing the position as above aberdeen believing that it was by his persuasion that mr gladstone dropped his intention of instant publicity probably the latter used such urgent language about an appeal to the public opinion of england and europe that lord aberdeen supposed it to be an immediate and not an ulterior resort aberdeen to castelcicala september 15 1851 and mr gladstone to aberdeen october 3  243 the mere announcement caused such a demand that a second edition was required almost before the first was published  244 wesleyan methodist magazine october 1851 protestant magazine september 1851  245 gladstone to lord aberdeen september 16 1851  246 mr gladstone in an undated draft letter to castelcicala  247 the one point on which lord aberdeen had a right to complain was that mr gladstone did not take his advice as the point revives in lord stanmores excellent life of his father it may be worth while to reproduce two further passages from mr gladstones letter to lord aberdeen of july 7 1851 before publishing the second of the two letters he wrote to lord aberdeen i ought perhaps to have asked your formal permission for the act of publication but i thought that i distinctly inferred it from a recent conversation with you as to the mode of proceedingmr gladstone to lord aberdeen july 7 1851 then he proceeds as to the new supplementary publication if it be disagreeable to you in any manner to be the recipient of such sad communications or if you think it better for any other reason i would put the further matter into another form in answer to this lord aberdeen seems not to have done any more to refuse leave to associate his name with the second letter than he had done to

to maintain them i confess i look      if not with suspicion at least with disapprobation on any one who      is disposed to treat party connections as matters of small      importance my opinion is that party ties closely appertain to      those principles of confidence which we entertain for the house of      commonsgladstone 1852   as we have seen on the morning of his arrival from his italian journey february 26 1851 mr gladstone found that he was urgently required to meet lord stanley mortified by more than one repulse at the opening of the session the whigs had resigned the queen sent for the protectionist leader stanley said that he was not then prepared to form a government but that if other combinations failed he would make the attempt lord john russell was once more summoned to the palace this time along with aberdeen and grahamthe first move in a critical march towards the fated coalition between whigs and peelites the negotiation broke off on the no popery bill lord john was committed to it the other two strongly disapproved the queen next wished aberdeen to undertake the task apparently not without some lingering doubts he declined on the good ground that the house of commons would not stand his attitude on papal aggression256 then according to promise lord stanley tried his hand proceedings were suspended for some days until mr gladstone should be on the ground he no sooner reached carlton gardens than lord lincoln arrived eager to dissuade him from accepting office before the discussion had gone far the tory whip hurried in from stanley begging for an immediate visit       i promised says mr gladstone to go directly after seeing lord      aberdeen but he came back with a fresh message to go at once and      hear what stanley had to say i did not like to stickle and      went he told me his object was that i should take office with      himany office subject to the reservation that the foreign      department was offered to canning but if he declined it was open      to me along with others of which he named the colonial office and      the board of trade nothing was said of the leadership of the house      of commons but his anxiety was evident to have any occupant but      one for the foreign office i told him i should ask no questions      and make no remark on these points as none of them would      constitute a difficulty with me provided no preliminary obstacle      were found to intervene stanley then said that he proposed to      maintain the system of free trade generally but to put a duty of      five or six shillings on corn i heard him pretty much in silence      but with an intense sense of relief feeling that if he had put      protection in abeyance i might have had a most difficult question      to decide whereas now i had no question at all i thought      however it might be well that i should still see lord aberdeen      before giving him an answer and told him i would do so i asked      him also what was his intention with respect to papal aggression      he said that this measure was hasty and intemperate as well as      ineffective and that he thought something much better might result      from a comprehensive and deliberate inquiry i told him i was      utterly against all penal legislation and against the ministerial      bill but that i did not on principle object to inquiry that on      general as well as on personal grounds i wished well to his      undertakings and that i would see lord aberdeen but that what he      had told me about corn constituted i must not conceal from him      an enormous difficulty i used this expression for the purpose of      preparing him to receive the answer it was plain i must give he      told me his persevering would probably depend on me                               declines office  mr gladstone next hastened to lord aberdeen and learned what had been going on during his absence abroad he learned also the clear opinions held by aberdeen and graham against no popery legislation and noticed it as remarkable that so many minds should arrive independently at the same conclusion on a new question and in opposition to the overwhelming majority i then he continues went on to the levee saw lord normanby and others and began to bruit abroad the fame of the neapolitan government immediately after leaving the levee where i also saw canning told him what i meant to do and gathered that he would do the like i changed my clothes and went to give lord stanley my answer at which he did not show the least surprise he said he would still persevere though with little hope i think i told him it seemed to me he ought to do so i was not five minutes with him this second time257  the protectionists having failed and the peelites standing aside the whigs came back most of them well aware that they could not go on for long the events of the late crisis had given mr gladstone the hope that graham would effectively place himself at the head of the peelites and that they would now at length begin to take an independent course of their own but it soon appeared that unconsciously i think more than consciously he is set upon the object of avoiding the responsibility either of taking the government with the peel squadron or of letting in stanley and his friends here was the weak point in a strong and capable character when graham died ten years after this 1861 mr gladstone wrote to a friend on administrative questions for the last twenty years and more i had more spontaneous recourse to him for advice than to all other colleagues together in some of the foundations of character no two men could be more unlike one of his closest allies talks to graham of your sombre temperament my forebodings are always gloomy says graham himself i shudder on the brink of the torrent all accounts agree that he was a good counsellor in cabinet a firstrate manager of business a good if rather pompous speaker admirably loyal and singleminded but halfruined by intense timidity i have heard nobody use warmer language of commendation about him than mr bright but nature had not made him for a post of chief command  it by and by appeared that the duke of newcastle known to us hitherto as lord lincoln coveted the post of leader but mr gladstone thought that on every ground lord aberdeen was the person entitled to hold it i made says mr gladstone my views distinctly known to the duke he took no offence i do not know what communications he may have held with others but the upshot was that lord aberdeen became our leader and this result was obtained without any shock or conflict258                                     ii                   bill against ecclesiastical titles  in the autumn of 1850 the people of this country were frightened out of their senses by a document from the vatican dividing england into dioceses bearing territorial titles and appointing cardinal wiseman to be archbishop of westminster the uproar was tremendous lord john russell cast fuel upon the flame in a perverse letter to the bishop of durham nov 4 1850 in this unhappy document he accepted the description of the aggression of the pope upon our protestantism as insolent and insidious declared his indignation to be greater even than his alarm and even his alarm at the aggressions of a foreign sovereign to be less than at the conduct of unworthy sons of the church of england within her own gates he wound up by declaring that the great mass of the nation looked with contempt upon the mummeries of superstition justified indeed was brights stern rebuke to a prime minister of the queen who thus allowed himself to offend and to indict eight millions of his countrymen recklessly to create fresh discords between the irish and english nations and to perpetuate animosities that the last fiveandtwenty years had done so much to assuage having thus precipitately committed himself the minister was forced to legislate i suspect wrote mr gladstone to his great friend sir walter james john russell has more rocks and breakers ahead than he reckoned upon when he dipped his pen in gall to smite first the pope but most those who not being papists are such traitors and fools as really to mean something when they say i believe in one holy catholic church there was some division of opinion in the cabinet259 but a bill was settled and the temper of the times may be gauged by the fact that leave to introduce it was given by the overwhelming majority of 395 votes to 63  in his own language mr gladstone lamented and disapproved of the popes proceeding extremely and had taken care to say so in parliament two and a half years before when lord john russell if he had chosen could have stopped it but the government and the press were alike silent at that period260 his attitude is succinctly described in a letter to greswell his oxford chairman in 1852 do not let it be asserted without contradiction that i ever felt or counselled indifference in regard to the division of england into romish dioceses so far is this from being the truth that shortly after i was elected when the government were encouraging the pope to proceed and when there was yet time to stop the measure which i deplore sincerely by amicable means i took the opportunity in the house as did sir r inglis i think a little later of trying to draw attention to it but it was nobodys game then and the subject fell to the ground amicable prevention i desired spiritual and ecclesiastical resistance i heartily approved but while i say this i cannot recede from one inch of the ground i took in opposing the bill and i would far rather quit parliament for ever than not have voted against so pernicious a measure  other matters as we have seen brought on a ministerial crisis the bill was stopped and after the crisis was over the measure came to life again with changes making it still more futile for its ends the peelites while like mr bright despising and loathing the language of the vatican and the flaminian gate had all of them without concert taken this outburst of prejudice and passion at its right value and all resolved to resist legislation how they asked could you tolerate the roman catholic religion if you would not tolerate its tenet of the ecclesiastical supremacy of the pope and what sort of toleration of such a tenet would that be which forbade the pope to name ecclesiastics to exercise the spiritual authority exercised in any other voluntary episcopal church scottish colonial or another why was it more of a usurpation for the pope to make a new archbishop of westminster than to administer london by the old form of vicars apostolic was not the action of the pope after all a secondary consideration and the frenzy really and in essence an explosion of popular wrath against the puseyites what was to be thought of a prime minister who at such risk to the public peace tried to turn the ferment to account for the sake of strengthening his tottering government to all this there was no rational reply and even the editor of a powerful newspaper that every morning blew up the coals admitted to greville that he thought the whole thing humbug and a pack of nonsense261                      great speech against the bill  the debate on the second reading was marked by a little brutality and much sanctimony mr gladstone march 25 1851 spoke to a house practically almost solid against him yet his superb resources as an orator his transparent depth of conviction the unmistakeable proofs that his whole heart was in the matter mastered his audience and made the best of them in their hearts ashamed he talked of boniface viii and honorius ix he pursued a long and close historical demonstration of the earnest desire of the lay catholics of this country for diocesan bishops as against vicars apostolic he moved among bulls and rescripts briefs and pastorals and canon law with as much ease as if he had been arguing about taxes and tariffs through it all the house watched and listened in enchantment as to a magnificent tragedian playing a noble part in a foreign tongue they did not apprehend every point nor were they converted but they felt a man with the orators quality of taking fire and kindling fire at a moral idea they felt his command of the whole stock of fact and of principle belonging to his topics as with the air and the power of a heroic master he cleared the way before him towards his purpose along with complete grasp of details went grasp of some of the most important truths in the policy of a modern state he clearly perceived the very relevant fact so often overlooked by advocates of the free church in a free state that there is no religious body in the world where religious offices do not in a certain degree conjoin with temporal incidents but this did not affect the power of his stroke as he insisted on respect for the frontierno scientific frontierbetween temporal and spiritual you speak of the progress of the roman catholic religion and you pretend to meet that progress by a measure false in principle as it is ludicrous in extent you must meet the progress of that spiritual system by the progress of another you can never do it by penal enactments here once for all i enter my most solemn earnest and deliberate protest against all attempts to meet the spiritual dangers of our church by temporal legislation of a penal character the whole speech is in all its elements and aspects one of the great orators three or four most conspicuous masterpieces and the reader would not forgive me if i failed to transcribe its resplendent close he went back to a passage of lord john russells on the maynooth bill of 1845 i never heard said mr gladstone a more impressive passage delivered by any statesman at any time in this house       the noble lord referred to some beautiful and touching lines of      virgil which the house will not regret to hear         scilicet et tempus veniet cum finibus illis         agricola incurvo terram molitus aratro         exesa inveniet scabra rubigine pila         aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanes         grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulcris262       and he said upon those scenes where battles have been fought the      hand of nature effaces the traces of the wrath of man and the      cultivator of the soil in following times finds the rusted arms      and looks upon them with calm and joy as the memorials of      forgotten strife and as quickening his sense of the blessings of      his peaceful occupation the noble lord went on to say in      reference to the powerful opposition then offered to the bill for      the endowment of maynooth that it seems as if upon the questions      of religious freedom our strife is never to cease and our arms      are never to rust would any man who heard the noble lord deliver      these impressive sentiments have believed not only that the strife      with respect to religious liberty was to be revived with a greater      degree of acerbity in the year 1851 but that the noble lord      himself was to be a main agent in its revivalthat his was to be      the head that was to wear the helmet and his the hand that was to      grasp the spear my conviction is that this great subject of      religious freedom is not to be dealt with as one of the ordinary      matters in which you may with safety or with honour do today and      undo tomorrow this great people whom we have the honour to      represent moves slowly in politics and legislation but although      it moves slowly it moves steadily the principle of religious      freedom its adaptation to our modern state and its compatibility      with ancient institutions was a principle which you did not adopt      in haste it was a principle well tried in struggle and conflict      it was a principle which gained the assent of one public man after      another it was a principle which ultimately triumphed after you      had spent upon it half a century of agonising struggle and now      what are you going to do you have arrived at the division of the      century are you going to repeat penelopes process but without      the purpose of penelope are you going to spend the decay and the      dusk of the nineteenth century in undoing the great work which with      so much pain and difficulty your greatest men have been achieving      during its daybreak and its youth surely not oh recollect the      functions you have to perform in the face of the world recollect      that europe and the whole of the civilised world look to england at      this moment not less no but even more than ever they looked to      her before as the mistress and guide of nations in regard to the      great work of civil legislation and what is it they chiefly admire      in england it is not the rapidity with which you form      constitutions and broach abstract theories on the contrary they      know that nothing is so distasteful to you as abstract theories      and that you are proverbial for resisting what is new until you are      well assured by gradual effort by progressive trials and      beneficial tendency but they know that when you make a step      forward you keep it they know that there is reality and honesty      strength and substance about your proceedings they know that you      are not a monarchy today a republic tomorrow and a military      despotism the day after they know that you have been happily      preserved from irrational vicissitudes that have marked the career      of the greatest and noblest among the neighbouring nations your      fathers and yourselves have earned this brilliant character for      england do not forfeit it do not allow it to be tarnished or      impaired show i beseech youhave the courage to show the pope of      rome and his cardinals and his church that england too as well      as rome has her semper eadem and that when she has once adopted      some great principle of legislation which is destined to influence      the national character to draw the dividing lines of her policy      for ages to come and to affect the whole nature of her influence      and her standing among the nations of the worldshow that when she      has done this slowly and done it deliberately she has done it      once for all and that she will then no more retrace her steps than      the river that bathes this giant city can flow back upon its      source the character of england is in our hands let us feel the      responsibility that belongs to us and let us rely on it if today      we make this step backwards it is one which hereafter we shall      have to retrace with pain we cannot change the profound and      resistless tendencies of the age towards religious liberty it is      our business to guide and to control their application do this you      may but to endeavour to turn them backwards is the sport of      children done by the hands of men and every effort you may make      in that direction will recoil upon you in disaster and disgrace      the noble lord appealed to gentlemen who sit behind me in the      names of hampden and pym i have great reverence for these in one      portion at least of their political career because they were men      energetically engaged in resisting oppression but i would rather      have heard hampden and pym quoted on any other subject than one      which relates to the mode of legislation or the policy to be      adopted with our roman catholic fellowcitizens because if there      was one blot on their escutcheon if there was one painfuli would      almost say odiousfeature in the character of the party among whom      they were the most distinguished chiefs it was the bitter and      ferocious intolerance which in them became the more powerful      because it was directed against the roman catholics alone i would      appeal in other names to gentlemen who sit on this side of the      house if hampden and pym were friends of freedom so were      clarendon and newcastle so were the gentlemen who sustained the      principles of loyalty they were not always seeking to tighten      the chains and deepen the brand their disposition was to relax the      severity of the law and attract the affections of their roman      catholic fellowsubjects to the constitution by treating them as      brethren we are a minority insignificant in point of numbers      we are more insignificant still because we are but knots and      groups of two or three we have no power of cohesion no ordinary      bond of union what is it that binds us together against you but      the conviction that we have on our side the principle of      justicethe conviction that we shall soon have on our side the      strength of public opinion oh oh i am sure i have not wished      to say a syllable that would wound the feelings of any man and if      in the warmth of argument such expressions should have escaped me      i wish them unsaid but above all we are sustained by the sense of      justice which we feel belongs to the cause we are defending and we      are i trust well determined to follow that bright star of      justice beaming from the heavens whithersoever it may lead  all this was of no avail just as the same arguments and temper on two other occasions of the same eternal theme in his life263 were to be of no avail disraeli spoke strongly against the line taken by the peelites the second reading was carried by 438 against 95 onethird even of this minority being irish catholics and the rest mainly peelites a limited but accomplished school as disraeli styled them hume asked mr gladstone for his speech for publication to circulate among the dissenters who he said know nothing about religious liberty it was something however to find mr gladstone the greatest living churchman and bright the greatest living nonconformist voting in the same lobby the fight was stiff and was kept up until the end of the summer the weapon that had been forged in this blazing furnace by these clumsy armourers proved blunt and worthless the law was from the first a dead letter and it was struck out of the statute book in 1871 in mr gladstones own administration264                                      iii                        fall of the russell government  in the autumn 1851 a committee of the whig cabinet now reinforced by the admission for the first time of lord granville was named to prepare a reform bill palmerston no friend to reform fell into restive courses that finally upset the coach the cabinet early in november settled that he should not receive kossuth and he complied but he received a public deputation and an address complimenting him for his exertions on kossuths behalf the court at this proceeding took lively offence and the queen requested the prime minister to ascertain the opinion of the cabinet upon it such an appeal by the sovereign from the minister to the cabinet was felt by them to be unconstitutional and though they did not conceal from palmerston their general dissatisfaction they declined to adopt any resolution before the year ended palmerston persisted in taking an unauthorised line of his own upon napoleons coup détat this time for once not on the side of freedom against despotism and lord john closed a correspondence between them by telling him that he could not advise the queen to leave the seals of the foreign department any longer in his hands this dismissal of palmerston introduced a new element of disruption and confusion for the fallen minister had plenty of friends lord lansdowne was very uneasy about reform and talked ominously about preferring to be a supporter rather than a member of the government and whig dissensions though less acute in type threatened a perplexity as sharp in the way of a stable administration as the discords among conservatives  lord john jan 14 1852 next asked his cabinet whether an offer should be made to graham a long discussion followed whether graham alone would do them any good whether the peelites considering themselves as a party might join but would not consent to be absorbed whether an offer to them was to be a persistent attempt in good faith or only a device to mend the parliamentary case if the offer were made and refused two or three of the whig ministers true to the church traditions of the caste made great difficulties about the puseyite notions of newcastle and mr gladstone gladstone writes one of them is a jesuit and more peelite than i believe was peel himself in the end lord john russell and his men met parliament without any new support their tottering life was short and it was an amendment moved by palmerston feb 20 on a clause in a militia bill that slit the thread the hostile majority was only eleven but other perils lay pretty thick in front the ministers resigned and lord stanley who had now become earl of derby had no choice but to give his followers their chance the experiment that seemed so impossible when bentinck first tried it of forming a new third party in the state seemed up to this point to have prospered and the protectionists had a definite existence the ministers were nearly all new to public office and seventeen of them were for the first time sworn of the privy council in a single day one jest was that the cabinet consisted of three men and a halfderby disraeli st leonards and a worthy fractional personage at the admiralty  sending to his wife at hawarden a provisional list feb 23 mr gladstone doubts the way in which the offices were distributedit is not good as compared i mean with what it should have been disraeli could not have been worse placed than at the exchequer henley could not have been worse than at the board of trade t baring who would have been their best chancellor of the exchequer seems to have declined herries would have been much better than disraeli for that particular place i suppose lord malmesbury is temporary foreign secretary to hold the place for s canning what does not appear on the face of the case is who is to lead the house of commons and about that everybody seems to be in the dark                                       iv                          first derby administration  the first derby administration thus formed and covering the year 1852 marks a highly interesting stage in mr gladstones career the key to my position as he afterwards said was that my opinions went one way my lingering sympathies the other his opinions looked towards liberalism his sympathies drew him to his first party it was the peelites who had now been thrown into the case of a dubious third party at the end of february mr gladstone sought lord aberdeen looking to his weight his prudence and his kindliness of disposition as the main anchor of their section his tone has usually been during the last few years that of anxiety to reunite the fragments and reconstruct the conservative party but yesterday particularly at the commencement of our conversation he seemed to lean the other way spoke kindly of lord derby and wished that he could be extricated from the company with which he is associated said that though called a despot all his life he himself had always been and was now friendly to a liberal policy he did not however like the reform question in lord johns hands but he considered i thought and if so he differed from me that on church questions we all might cooperate with him securely mr gladstone on the contrary insisted that their duty plainly was to hold themselves clear and free from whig and derbyite alike so as to be prepared to take whatever of three courses might after the defeat of protectionist proposals seem most honourablewhether conservative reconstruction or liberal conjunction or peelism singlehanded the last he described as their least natural position for he urged they might be liberal in the sense of peel working out a liberal policy through the medium of the conservative party to that procrastinating view mr gladstone stood tenaciously and his course now is one of the multitudinous illustrations of his constant abhorrence of premature committal and the taking of a second step before the first  after aberdeen he approached graham who proceeded to use language that seemed to point to his virtual return to his old friends of the liberal party for the reader will not forget the striking circumstance that the new head of a conservative government and the most trusted of the cabinet colleagues of peel had both of them begun official life in the reform ministry of lord grey graham said he had a very high opinion of lord derbys talents and character and that lord j russell had committed many errors but that looking at the two as they stood he thought that the opinions of lord derby as a whole were more dangerous to the country than those of lord john mr gladstone said it did not appear to him that the question lay between these two but grahams reception of this remark implied a contrary opinion  lincoln now duke of newcastle he found obdurate in another direction speaking with great asperity against lord derby and his party he would make no vows as to junction not even that he would not join disraeli but he thought this government must be opposed and overthrown then those who led the charge against it would reap the reward if the peelites did not place themselves in a prominent position others would they had a further conversation the duke told him that beresford the whip had sent out orders to tory newspapers to run them down that the same worthy had said the peelites let them go to hell mr gladstone replied that beresfords language was not a good test of the feelings of his party and that his violence and that of other people was stimulated by what they imagined or heard of the peelites newcastle persisted in his disbelief in the government during this conversation held on a sofa at the carlton we were rather warm and i said to him it appears to me that you do not believe this party to be composed even of men of honour or of gentlemen he clung to the idea that we were hereafter to form a party of our own containing all the good elements of both parties to which i replied the country cannot be governed by a third or middle party unless it be for a time only and on the whole i thought a liberal policy would be worked out with greater security to the country through the medium of the conservative party and i thought a position like peels on the liberal side of that party preferable comparing all advantages and disadvantages to the conservative side of the liberal party and when he spoke of the tories as the obstructive body i said not all of themfor instance mr pitt mr canning mr huskisson and in some degree lord londonderry and lord liverpool                         four shades of peelites  the upshot of all these discussions was the discovery that there were at least four distinct shades among the peelites newcastle stands nearly alone if not quite in the rather highflown idea that we are to create and lead a great virtuous powerful intelligent party neither the actual conservative nor the actual liberal party but a new one apart from these witcheries graham was ready to take his place in the liberal ranks cardwell fitzroy and oswald would i think have gone with him as f peel and sir c douglas went before him but this section has been arrested not thoroughly amalgamated owing to graham thirdly there are the great bulk of the peelites from goulburn downwards more or less undisguisedly anticipating junction with lord derby and avowing that free trade is their only point of difference lastly myself and i think i am with lord aberdeen and s herbert who have nearly the same desire but feel that the matter is too crude too difficult and important for anticipating any conclusion and that our clear line of duty is independence until the question of protection shall be settled march 28 1852  the personal composition of this section deserves a sentence in 1835 during peels short government the whig phalanx opposed to it in the house of commons consisted of john russell and seven others265 of these eight all were alive in 1851 seven of them in the then existing cabinet six of the eight still in the commons on the other hand peels cabinet began its career thus manned in the commonspeel stanley graham hardinge knatchbull goulburn of these only the last remained in his old position peel and knatchbull were dead stanley in the lords and separated graham isolated hardinge in the lords and by way of having retired nor was the band very large even as recruited of excabinet ministers there were but three commoners goulburn herbert gladstone and of others who had held important offices there were only available clerk cardwell sir j young h corry the lords contributed aberdeen newcastle canning266 st germains and the duke of argyll such as counted off by mr gladstone was the peelite staff  graham in april made his own position definitely liberal or whig and something more in so pronounced a way as to cut him off from the gladstonian subdivision or main body of the peelites mr gladstone read the speech in which this departure was taken with discomfort and surprise he instantly went to read to lord aberdeen some of the more pungent passages one or two consultations were held with newcastle and goulburn and all agreed that grahams words were decisive i mentioned that some of them were coming to 5 carlton gardens in the course of the afternoon april 20 and my first wish was that now lord aberdeen himself would go and tell them how we stood upon grahams speech to this they were all opposed and they seemed to feel that as we had had no meeting yet it would seem ungracious and unkind to an old friend to hold one by way of ovation over his departure it was therefore agreed that i should acquaint young it was their wish that he should tell any one who might come that we who were there present looked upon our political connection with graham as dissolved by the carlisle speech267                          attitude of graham  the temporary parting from graham was conducted with a degree of good feeling that is a pattern for such occasions in politics in writing to mr gladstone mar 29 1852 and speaking of his colleagues in peels government graham says i have always felt that my age and position were different from theirs that the habits and connections of my early political life though broken gave to me a bias which to them was not congenial and since the death of our great master and friend i have always feared that the time might arrive when we must separate you intimate the decision that party connection must no longer subsist between us i submit to your decision with regret but at parting i hope that you will retain towards me some feelings of esteem and regard such as i can never cease to entertain towards you and though political friendships are often shortlived having known each other well we shall continue i trust to maintain kindly relations it is a pleasure to me to remember that we have no cause of complaint against each other i have to thank you mr gladstone replies for the unvarying kindness of many years to acknowledge all the advantages i have derived from communication with you to accept and reecho cordially your expressions of good will and to convey the fervent hope that no act or word of mine may ever tend to impair these sentiments in my own mind or yours  when the others had withdrawn aberdeen told mr gladstone that lord john had been to call upon him the day before for the first time and he believed that the visit had special reference to mr gladstone himself the tenor of his conversation mr gladstone reports was that my opinions were quite as liberal as his that in regard to the colonies i went beyond him that my naples pamphlets could have been called revolutionary if he had written them and in regard to church matters he saw no reason why there should not be joint action for he was cordially disposed to maintain the church of england and so he believed was i lord john however we may be sure was the last man not to know how many another element besides agreement in opinion decides relations of party personal sympathies and antipathies hosts of indirect affinities having apparently little to do with the main trunk of the school or the faction hosts of motives only half disclosed or not disclosed at all even to him in whom they are at workall these intrude in the composition and management of parties whether religious or political  grave discussions turned on new nicknames the tories had greatly gained by calling themselves conservatives after 1832 the name of whig had some associations that were only less unpopular in the country than the name of tory it was pointed out that many people would on no account join the whigs who yet would join a government of which russells greys howards cavendishes villierses were members on the other hand graham declared that paleys maxim about religion was just as true in politicsthat men often change their creed but not so often the name of their sect and as to the suggestion constantly made at all times in our politics for the benefit of waverers of the name of liberalconservative lord john caustically observed that whig has the convenience of expressing in one syllable what liberalconservative expresses in seven and whiggism in two syllables what conservative progress expresses in six                       mr gladstone and his group  connected with all this arose a geographical questionin what quarter of the house were the peelites to sit hitherto the two wings of the broken tory party protectionist and peelite had sat together on the opposition benches the change of administration in 1852 sent the protectionists over to the speakers right and brought the whigs to the natural place of opposition on his left the peelite leaders therefore had no other choice than to take their seats below the gangway but on which side such a question is always graver than to the heedless outsider it may seem and the peelite discussions upon it were both copious and vehement268 graham at once resolved on sharing the front opposition bench with the whigs he repeated that his own case was different from the others because he had once been a whig himself herbert who acted pretty strictly with mr gladstone all this year argued that they only held aloof from the new ministers on one question and therefore that they ought not to sit opposite to them as adversaries but should sit below the gangway on the ministerial side newcastle intimated dissent from both looking to the formation of his virtuous and enlightened third party but where they should sit in the meantime he did not seem to know mr gladstone expressed from the first a decided opinion in favour of going below the gangway on the opposition side what they ought to desire was the promotion of a government conservative in its personal composition and traditions as soon as the crisis of protection should be over taking a seat he said is an external sign and pledge that ought to follow upon full conviction of the thing it was understood to betoken and to sit on the front opposition bench would indicate division from the conservative government as a party while in fact they were not divided from them as a party but only on a single question in the end graham sat above the opposition gangway next to lord john russell and cardwell the peelite body as a whole determined on giving the new government what is called a fair trial mr sidney herbert and i says mr gladstone took pains to bring them together in the recognised modes they sat on the opposition side but below the gangway full or about forty strong and sir james graham i recollect once complimented me on the excellent appearance they had presented to him as he passed them in walking up the house considerable uneasiness was felt among some of them at finding themselves neighbours on the benches to cobden and bright and hume and their friends on the one hand and the irish brass band on the other  it depended entirely on the peelites whether the new government should be permitted to conduct the business of the session subject to conditions or otherwise or whether they should be open to an instant attack as the enemies of free trade the effect of such attack must have been defeat followed by dissolution forthwith and by the ejection of the derby government in june as happened in 1859 instead of in december the tactics of giving the ministers a fair trial prevailed and were faithfully adhered to graham and cardwell taking their own course as the result of this and other conditions for ten months ministers greatly outnumbered were maintained in power by the deliberate and united action of about forty peelites  lord derby had opened his administration with a pledge as the peelites understood to confine himself during the session to business already open and advanced or of an urgent character when mr disraeli gave notice of a bill to dispose of four seats which were vacant this was regarded by them as a manner of opening new and important issues and not within the definition that had been the condition of their provisional support269 lord john russell came and said to me says mr gladstone what will you do i admitted we were bound to act and joining the liberals we threw over the proposal by a large majority this was the only occasion of conflict that arose and it was provoked as we thought by the government itself  footnotes  256 he had told the queen that he thought all the offices might be filled in a respectable manner from among the members of the peel administration on a subsequent day both herbert and cardwell made out from his conversation what i did not clearly catch namely that lord aberdeen himself would have acted on the queens wish and that graham had either suggested the difficulty altogether or at any rate got it put forward into its position gladstone memo april 22 1851  257 memorandum dated fasque april 22 1851  258 memorandum sept 9 1897  259 grey papers  260 to phillimore nov 26 1850  261 greville part ii vol iii p 369  262

que les moeurs cest le contraire qui devait être je vous avoue que jai été de coeur et desprit avec ceux qui comme lord aberdeen et m gladstone se sont opposés au nom de la liberté et du principe même

of george canning  267 graham spoke of himself as a tried reformer and as a member of the liberal party and as glad to find himself the ally of so faithful a liberal and reformer as his fellowcandidate he would not exactly pledge himself to support the ballot but he admitted it was a hard question and said he was not so blind that practical experience might not convince him that he was wrong mar 26 1852  268 the same question greatly exercised mr gladstones mind in 1886 for the same reason that he again hoped for the reunion of a divided party  269 this was a bill to assign the four disfranchised seats for sudbury and st albans to the west riding of yorkshire and the southern division of lancashire mr gladstone carried the order of the day by a majority of 86 against the government                                chapter viii                           end of protection                                1852  it is not too much to ask that now at least after so much waste of public time after ministries overturned and parties disorganised the question of free trade should be placed high and dry on the shore whither the tide of political party strife could no longer reach itgladstone   the parliament was now dissolved july 1 to decide a great question the repeal of the corn law the ultimate equalisation of the sugar duties the repeal of the navigation laws had been the three great free trade measures of the last halfdozen years and the issue before the electors in 1852 was whether this policy was sound or unsound lord derby might have faced it boldly by announcing a moderate protection for corn and for colonial sugar or he might have openly told the country that he had changed his mind as peel had changed his mind about the catholic question and about free trade and as mr disraeli was to change his mind upon franchise in 1867 and mr gladstone upon the irish church in 1868 instead of this all was equivocation the derbyite as was well said was protectionist in a county neutral in a small town free trader in a large one he was for maynooth in ireland and against it in scotland mr disraeli did his best to mystify the agricultural elector by phrases about setoffs and compensations and relief of burdens seeming to loom in the future he rang the changes on mysterious new principles of taxation but what they were to be he did not disclose the great change since 1846 was that the workingclass had become strenuous free traders they had in earlier times never been really convinced when cobden and bright assured them that no fall in wages would follow the promised fall in the price of food it was the experience of six years that convinced them england alone had gone unhurt and unsinged through the fiery furnace of 1848 and nobody doubted that the stability of her institutions and the unity of her people were due to the repeal of bad laws believed to raise the price of bread to the toilers in order to raise rents for territorial idlers                        again elected for oxford  long before the dissolution it was certain that mr gladstone would have to fight for his seat his letter to the scotch bishop see above p 384 his vote for the jews his tenacity and vehemence in resisting the bill against the popethe two last exhibitions in open defiance of solemn resolutions of the university convocation itselfhad alienated some friends and inflamed all his enemies half a score of the heads induced dr marsham the warden of merton to come out in private qualities the warden was one of the most excellent of men and the accident of his opposition to mr gladstone is no reason why we should recall transient electioneering railleries against a forgotten worthy the political addresses of his friends depict him they applaud his sound and manly consistency of principle and his sober attachment to the reformed church of england and they dwell with zest on the goodness of his heart the issue as they put it was simple at a time when the stability of the protestant succession the authority of a protestant queen and even the christianity of the national character have been rudely assailed by rome on one side and on the other by democratic associations directed against the union of the christian church with the british constitutionat such a time it becomes a protestant university from which emanates a continuous stream of instruction on all ecclesiastical and christian questions over the whole empire to manifest the importance which it attaches to protestant truth by the selection of a protestant representative the teaching residents were as always decisively for gladstone and nearly all the fellows of merton voted against their own warden in one respect this was remarkable for mr gladstone had in 1850 july 18 resisted the proposal for that commission of inquiry into the universities which the oxford liberals had much at heart and it would not have been surprising if they had held aloof from a candidate who had told the house of commons that after all science was but a small part of the business of educationa proposition that in one sense may be true but applied to unreformed oxford was the reverse of true the nonresidents were diligently and rather unscrupulously worked upon and they made a formidable set of discordant elements the evangelicals disliked mr gladstone the plain highanddry men distrusted him as what they called a sophist even some of the anglocatholic men began to regard as a bad friend to the holy apostolic church of these realms the author of the new theory of religious liberty in the scotch letter they reproachfully insisted that had he headed a party in the house of commons defending the church not upon latitudinarian theories of religious liberty not upon vague hints of a disaffected movement of the nonjuring sort still less upon romanising principles but on the principles of the constitution royal supremacy included then the church would have escaped the worst that had befallen her since 1846 the minister would never have dared to force hampden into the seat of a bishop the privy council would never have reversed the court of arches in the gorham case the claim of the clergy to meet in convocation would never have been refused the committee of council would have treated education very differently270 all came right in the end however and mr gladstone was reelected july 14 receiving 260 votes fewer than sir robert inglis but 350 more than the warden of merton271 we have to remember that he was not returned as a liberal                                      ii  the leaders of the sections out of office when the general election was over at once fetched forth line and plummet to take their soundings the next few months mr gladstone wrote to lord aberdeen aug 20 are i apprehend the crisis of our fate and will show whether we are equal or unequal to playing out with prudence honour and resolution the drama or trilogy that has been on the stage since 1841 he still regarded the situation as something like a reproduction of the position of the previous march the precise number of the ministerialists could not be ascertained until tested by a motion in the house they had gained rather more than was expected and some put them as high as 320 others as low as 290 what was undoubted was that lord derby was left in a minority and that the support of the peelites might any hour turn it into a majority notwithstanding a loss or two in the recent elections that party still numbered not far short of 40 and mr gladstone was naturally desirous of retaining it in connection with himself most of the group were disposed rather to support a conservative government than not unless such a government were to do or propose something open to strong and definite objection at the same time what he described as the difficulty of keeping peelism for ever so short a space upon its legs was as obvious to him as to everybody else it will be an impossible parliament graham said to mr gladstone july 15 parties will be found too nicely balanced to render a new line of policy practicable without a fresh appeal to the electors before a fresh appeal to the electors took place the impossible parliament had tumbled into a great war                           the new parliament  when the newly chosen members met in november mr disraeli told the house of commons that there was no question in the minds of ministers with respect to the result of that election there was no doubt that there was not only not a preponderating majority in favour of a change in the laws free trade passed in the last few years or even of modifying them in any degree but that on the contrary there was a decisive opinion on the part of the country that that settlement should not be disturbed mr gladstone wrote to lord aberdeen july 30 that he thought the government absolutely chained to mr disraelis next budget and i for one am not prepared to accept him as a financial organ or to be responsible for what he may propose in his present capacity each successive speech made by mr disraeli at aylesbury he found more quackish in its flavour than its predecessor yet action on his own part was unavoidably hampered by oxford were i either of opinion he told lord aberdeen aug 5 that lord john russell ought to succeed lord derby or prepared without any further development of the plans of the government to take my stand as one of the party opposed to them the first step which as a man of honour i ought to adopt should be to resign my seat i do not mean hereby he adds in words that were soon to derive forcible significance from the march of events that i am unconditionally committed against any alliance or fusion but that any such alliance or fusion to be lawful for me must grow out of some failure of the government in carrying on public affairs or a disapproval of its measures when they shall have been proposed he still in spite of all the misdeeds of ministers during the elections could not think so ill of them as did lord aberdeen  protection and religious liberty he wrote to lord aberdeen aug 5are the subjects on which my main complaints would turn shuffling as to the former trading on bigotry as to the latter the shifting and shuffling that i complain of have been due partly to a miserably false position and the giddy prominence of inferior men partly to the surely not unexpected unscrupulousness and second motives of mr disraeli at once the necessity of lord derby and his curse i do not mean that this justifies what has been said and done i only think it brings the case within the common limits of political misconduct as for religious bigotry he continues i condemn the proceedings of the present government yet much less strongly than the unheardof course pursued by lord john russell in 18501 the person to whom i am now invited to transfer my confidence even on the superficial conversion of the derbyites to free trade mr gladstone found a tu quoque against the whigs it is when strictly judged an act of public immorality to form and lead an opposition on a certain plea to succeed and then in office to abandon it but in this view the conduct of the present administration is the counterpart and copy of that of the whigs themselves in 1835 who ran sir robert peel to ground upon the appropriation clause worked it just while it suited them and then cast it to the winds to say nothing of their conduct on the irish assassination bill of 1846  this letter was forwarded by aberdeen to lord john russell lord john had the peculiar temperament that is hard to agitate but easy to nettle so polemical a reading of former whig pranks nettled him considerably why he asked should he not say just as reasonably that mr gladstone held up the whigs to odium in 1841 for stripping the farmer of adequate protection worked the corn law of 1842 as long as it suited him and then turned round and cast the corn law to the winds if he gave credit to mr gladstone for being sincere in 1841 1842 and 1846 why should not mr gladstone give the same credit to him as to the principle of appropriation he and althorp had opposed four of their colleagues in the grey cabinet how could he concede to peel what he had refused to them as for the irish bill on which he had turned peel out it was one of the worst of all coercion bills peel with 117 followers evidently could not carry on the government and what sense could there have been in voting for a bad bill in order to retain in office an impossible ministry this smart apologia of lord johns was hardly even plausible much less did it cover the ground the charge against the whigs is not that they took up appropriation but that having taken it up they dropped it for the sake of office nor was it a charge that they resisted an irish coercion bill but that having supported it on the first reading worst of all coercion bills as it was even in the eyes of men who had passed the reckless act of 1833 they voted against it when they found that both bentinck and the manchester men were going to do the same thus enabling them to turn peel out                            confusions of party  sharp sallies into the past however did not ease the present it was an extraordinary situation only to be described in negatives a majority could not be found to beat the government upon a vote of want of confidence nobody knew who could take their places lord john russell as head of a government was impossible for his maladroit handling of papal aggression had alienated the irish his dealings with palmerston had offended one powerful section of the english whigs the scottish whigs hated him as too much managed by the lights of the free church and the radicals proscribed him as the chief of a patrician clique yet though he was impossible he sometimes used language to the effect that for him to take any place save the first would be a personal degradation that would lower him to the level of sidmouth or goderich lord palmerston represented the moderate centre of the liberal party even now he enjoyed a growing personal favour out of doors not at all impaired by the bad terms on which he was known to be with the court for the court was not at that date so popular an institution as it became by and by among other schemes of ingenious persons at this confused and broken time was a combination under palmerston or lansdowne of aristocratic whigs a great contingent of derbyites and the peelites and before the elections it was true that lord derby had made overtures to these two eminent men a lansdowne combination lingered long in the mind of lord palmerston himself who wished for the restoration of a whig government but resented the idea of serving under its late head some dreamed that palmerston and disraeli might form a government on the basis of resistance to parliamentary reform strange rumours were even afloat that mr gladstones communications with palmerston before he left london at the election had been intimate and frequent i cannot make gladstone out said lord malmesbury he seems to me a dark horse  in the closing days of the autumn september 12 graham interpreted some obscure language of mr gladstones as meaning that if protection were renounced as it might be if palmerston joined derby and the government were reconstructed and if disraeli ceased to be leader then his own relations with the government would be changed gladstone was so uneasy in his present position so nice in the equipoise of his opinions that he wished to be as he said on the liberal side of the conservative party rather than on the conservative side of the liberal party a little earlier than this lord aberdeen and graham agreed in thinking august that disraelis leadership was the great cause of gladstones reluctance to have anything to do with the government  that even if this should be removed it would not be very easy for him to enter into partnership with them mr gladstone himself now and always denied that the lead in the commons or other personal question had anything to do with the balance of his opinions at the present and later moments those who know most of public life are best aware how great is the need in the case of public men for charitable construction of their motives and intent yet it would surely have been straining charity to the point of dishonour if within two years of peels death any of those who had been attached to him as master and as friend either mr gladstone or anybody else could have looked without reprobation and aversion on the idea of cabinet intimacy with the bitterest and least sincere of all peels assailants                                     iii                             opening skirmishes  mr gladstone repaired to london some weeks before the new session and though he was not in a position to open direct relations with the government he expressed to lord hardinge with a view to its communication to lord derby his strong opinion that the house of commons would and should require from ministers a frank and explicit adoption of free trade through the address and secondly the immediate production of their financial measures lord derby told hardinge at windsor that he thought that neither expectation was far wrong when the peelites met at lord aberdeens to discuss tactics they were secretly dissatisfied with the paragraphs about free trade  mr disraeli had laid down at the election the sonorous maxim that no statesman can disregard with impunity the genius of the epoch in which he lives and he now after the election averred that the genius of the age was in favour of free exchange still it was pleasanter to swallow the dose with as little public observation as possible what would have been said cried lord derby in fervid remonstrance if shortly after catholic emancipation and the reform bill had been admitted as settlements their friends had come down and insisted not only that the houses of parliament should consent to act on the new policy they had adopted but should expressly recant their opinion in favour of the policy that had formerly prevailed what would the friends of sir r peel have said in 1835 if when he assumed the government and when the new parliament assembled he had been called upon to declare that the reform bill was wise just and necessary the original free traders were not disposed to connive at derbyite operations any more than were the whigs notice was at once given by mr villiers of a motion virtually assailing the ministers by asserting the doctrine of free trade in terms they could not adopt now says mr gladstone we came to a case in which the liberals did that which had been done by the government in the case of the four seats bill that is to say they raised an issue which placed us against them lord palmerston moved the amendment which defeated the attack but he did this at the express request of s herbert and mine and we carried the amendment to him at his house he did not recommend any particular plan of action and he willingly acquiesced in and adopted ours he said he would convey it to disraeli with whom he said i have had communications from time to time  in the debate nov 26 upon the two rival amendmentsthat of mr villiers which the ministers could not accept and that of palmerston which they couldsidney herbert paid off some old scores in a speech full of fire and jubilation mr gladstone on the other hand was elaborately pacific he earnestly deprecated the language of severity and exasperation or anything that would tend to embitter party warfare his illustrious leader peel he said did indeed look for his revenge but for what revenge did he look assuredly not for stinging speeches assuredly not for motions made in favour of his policy if they carried pain and degradation to the minds of honourable men were they not celebrating the obsequies of an obnoxious policy let them cherish no desire to trample on those who had fought manfully and been defeated fairly rather let them rejoice in the great public good that had been achieved let them take courage from the attainment of that good for the performance of their public duty in future all this was inspired by the strong hope of conservative reunion nervous excitement kept me very wakeful after speaking says mr gladstone the first time for many years diary  villierss motion was rejected by 336 to 256 the peelites and graham voting with ministers in the majority the peelite amendment in moderated terms for which palmerston stood sponsor was then carried against the radicals by 468 to 53 for the moment the government was saved       this evening mr gladstone writes on the next day nov 27 i went      to lady derbys evening party where lord derby took me a little      aside and said he must take the opportunity of thanking me for the      tone of my speech last night which he thought tended to place the      discussion on its right footing it was evident from his manner      and lady derbys too that they were highly pleased with the issue      of it i simply made my acknowledgments in terms of the common      kind upon which he went on to ask me what in my view was to happen      next the great object he said was to get rid of all personal      questions and to consider how all those men who were united in      their general views of government might combine together to carry      on with effect for himself he felt both uncertain and indifferent      he might be able to carry on the government or he might not but      the question lay beyond that by what combination or arrangement of      a satisfactory nature in the event of his displacement the      administration of public affairs could be conducted       to this i replied that it seemed to me that our situation      meaning that of herbert goulburn and others with myself in      relation to his government remained much as it was in march and      april last we have to expect your budget and the production of      that is the next step he replied that he much desired to see      whether there was a possibility of any rapprochement and seemed      to glance at personal considerations as likely perhaps to stand in      the way disraeli presumably i said in reply that no doubt      there were many difficulties of a personal nature to be faced in      conceiving of any ministerial combination when we looked at the      present house of commons many men of power and eminence but great      difficulties arising from various causes present and past      relations incompatibilities peculiar defects of character or      failure in bringing them into harmony i said that as to relations      of parties circumstances were often stronger than the human will      that we must wait for their guiding and follow it he said      rather decidedly that he assented to the truth of this doctrine      he added i think sidney said more last night than he intended      did he not i answered you mean as to one particular expression      or sentence he rejoined yes272 i said i have had no      conversation with him on it but i think it very probable that he      grew warm and went beyond his intention at that point at the same      time i think i ought to observe to you that i am confident that      expression was occasioned by one particular preceding speech in the      debate he gave a significant assent and seemed to express no      surprise                                         iv                             mr disraelis proposals  the respite for ministers was short the long day of shadowy promises and delusive dreams was over and the oracular expounder of mysteries was at last gripped by the hard realities of the taxes whigs and peelites men who had been at the exchequer and men who hoped to be were all ready at last to stalk down their crafty quarry without delay disraeli presented his budget dec 3 as a private member in opposition he had brought forward many financial proposals but it now turned out that none of them was fit for real use with a serene audacity that accounts for some of mr gladstones repulsion he told the house that he had greater subjects to consider than the triumph of obsolete opinions his proposals dazzled for a day and then were seen to be a scheme of illusory compensations and dislocated expedients he took off half of the malttax and half of the hop duty and in stages reduced the tea duty from two shillings and twopence to one shilling more important he broke up the old frame of the incometax by a variation of its rates and as for the housetax he doubled its rate and extended its area in one of his fragmentary notes mr gladstone says       having run away from protection as it was plain from the first      they would do they had little to offer the land but that little      their minority was ready to accept it was a measure essentially      bad to repeal half the malt duty but the flagrantly vicious      element in disraelis budget was his proposal to reduce the      incometax on schedule d to fivepence in the pound leaving the      other schedules at sevenpence this was no compensation to the      land but inasmuch as to exempt one is to tax another it was a      distinct addition to the burdens borne by the holders of visible      property it was on disraelis part a most daring bid for the      support of the liberal majority for we all knew quite well that      the current opinion of the whigs and liberals was in favour of this      scheme which on the other hand was disapproved by sound      financiers the authority of pitt and peel and then my own study      of the subject made me believe that it was impracticable and      probably meant the disruption of the tax with confusion in      finance as an immediate sequitur what angered me was that      disraeli had never examined the question and i afterwards found      that he had not even made known his intentions to the board of      inland revenue the gravity of the question thus raised made me      feel that the day was come to eject the government                            attack on the budget  it was upon the increase of the housetax that the great battle was finally staked mr gladstones letters to his wife at hawarden bring the rapid and excited scenes vividly before us       6 carlton gardens dec 3 1852i write from h of c at 4½      just expecting the budget all seem to look for startling and      dangerous proposals you will read them in the papers of tomorrow      be they what they may if there is anything outrageous we may      protest at once but i do not expect any extended debate      tonight the rush for places in the h of c is immense       monday dec 6on saturday in the early part of the day i had      a return perhaps caused by the damp relaxing weather of the      neuralgic pain in my face and in the afternoon a long sitting at      lord aberdeens about the budget during which strange to say my      pain disappeared but which kept me past the ordinary post hour      these were the causes of your having no letter the said budget      will give rise to serious difficulties it is plain enough that      when its author announced something looming in the distance he did      not mean this plan but something more extensive even his reduced      scheme however includes fundamental faults of principle which it      is impossible to overlook or compound with the first day of      serious debate on it will be friday next and a vote will be taken      either then or on monday       dec 8be sure to read lord derbys speech on monday his      reference to the cause of his quarrel with lord george bentinck was      most striking and is interpreted as a rap at disraeli273 i have      had a long sit with lord aberdeen today talking over      possibilities the government i believe talk confidently about      the decision on the housetax but i should doubt whether they are      right meantime i am convinced that disraelis is the least      conservative budget i have ever known       dec 14i need hardly say the vision of going down tomorrow      has been dissolved it has been arranged that i am not to speak      until the close of the debate and it is considered almost certain      to go on till monday ministers have become much less confident      but i understand that some i know not how many of lord johns men      are not to be relied on whether they win or not i expect the      latter but my opinion is naught they cannot carry this      housetax nor their budget but the mischief of the proposals they      have launched will not die with them       dec 15i write in great haste though it is wednesday i have      been down at the house almost all day to unravel a device of      disraelis about the manner in which the question is to be put by      which he means to catch votes and i think after full      consultation with mahon and wilson patten that this will be      accomplished the debate may close tomorrow night i am sorry to      say i have a long speech fermenting in me and i feel as a loaf      might in the oven the government it is thought are likely to be      beaten       dec 16i have been engaged in the house till close on post      time disraeli trying to wriggle out of the question and get it      put upon words without meaning to enable more to vote as they      please ie his men or those favourably inclined to him but he      is beaten in this point and we have now the right question before      us it is not now quite certain whether we shall divide tonight i      hope we may for it is weary work sitting with a speech fermenting      inside one274       dec 18i have never gone through so exciting a passage of      parliamentary life the intense efforts which we made to obtain      and the government to escape a definite issue were like a fox      chase and prepared us all for excitement i came home at seven      dined read for a quarter of an hour and actually contrived only      think to sleep in the fur cloak for another quarter of an hour      got back to the house at nine disraeli rose at 1020 dec 16      and from that moment of course i was on tenterhooks except when      his superlative acting and brilliant oratory from time to time      absorbed me and made me quite forget that i had to follow him he      spoke until one his speech as a whole was grand i think the most      powerful i ever heard from him at the same time it was disgraced      by shameless personalities and otherwise i had therefore to begin      by attacking him for these there was a question whether it would      not be too late but when i heard his personalities i felt there      was no choice but to go on my great object was to show the      conservative party how their leader was hoodwinking and bewildering      them and this i have the happiness of believing that in some      degree i effected for while among some there was great heat and a      disposition to interrupt me when they could i could see in the      faces and demeanour of others quite other feelings expressed but      it was a most difficult operation and altogether it might have      been better effected the house has not i think been so much      excited for years the power of his speech and the importance of      the issue combined with the lateness of the hour which always      operates were the causes my brain was strung very high and has      not yet quite got back to calm but i slept well last night on      thursday night ie friday morning after two hours of sleep i      awoke and remembered a gross omission i had made which worked      upon me so that i could not rest any more and still of course      the time is an anxious one and i wake with the consciousness of      it but i am very well and really not unquiet when i came home      from the house i thought it would be good for me to be mortified      next morning i opened the times which i thought you would buy      and was mortified when i saw it did not contain my speech but a      mangled abbreviation such is human nature at least mine but in      the times of today you will see a very curious article      descriptive of the last scene of the debate it has evidently been      written by a man who must have seen what occurred or been informed      by those who did see he by no means says too much in praise of      disraelis speech i am told he is much stung by what i said i am      very sorry it fell to me to say it god knows i have no wish to      give him pain and really with my deep sense of his gifts i would      only pray they might be well used                         the two antagonists  the writer in the times to whom the victorious orator here refers describes how like two of sir walter scotts champions these redoubtable antagonists gathered up all their force for the final struggle and encountered each other in midcareer how rather equal than like each side viewed the struggle of their chosen athletes as if to prognosticate from the war of words the fortunes of two parties so nicely balanced and marshalled in apparently equal array mr disraelis speech he says was in every respect worthy of his oratorical reputation the retorts were pointed and bitter the hits telling the sarcasm keen the argument in many places cogent in all ingenious and in some convincing the merits were counterbalanced by no less glaring defects of tone temper and feeling in some passages invective was pushed to the limit of virulence and in others meant no doubt to relieve them by contrast the coarser stimulants to laughter were very freely applied occasionally whole sentences were delivered with an artificial voice and a tone of studied and sardonic bitterness peculiarly painful to the audience and tending greatly to diminish the effect of this great intellectual and physical effort the speech of mr gladstone was in marked contrast it was characterised throughout by the most earnest sincerity it was pitched in a high tone of moral feelingnow rising to indignation now sinking to remonstrancewhich was sustained throughout without flagging and without effort the language was less ambitious less studied but more natural and flowing than that of mr disraeli and though commencing in a tone of stern rebuke it ended in words of almost pathetic expostulation that power of persuasion which seems entirely denied to his antagonist mr gladstone possesses to great perfection and to judge by the countenances of his hearers those powers were very successfully exerted he had besides the immense advantage resulting from the tone of moral superiority which he assumed and successfully maintained and which conciliated to him the goodwill of his audience in a degree never attained by the most brilliant sallies of his adversary and when he concluded the house might well feel proud of him and of themselves  a violent thunderstorm raged during the debate but the excited senators neither noticed the flashes of lightning nor heard a tremendous shock of thunder a little before four oclock in the morning dec 17 the division was taken and ministers were beaten by nineteen 305 to 286 there was an immense crowd says macaulay a deafening cheer when hayter took the right hand of the row of tellers and a still louder cheer when the numbers were read275                           defeat of government  a small incident occurred a few nights later to show that it was indeed high time to abate the passions of these six years and more a politician of secondary rank had been accused of bribery at derby and a band of tory friends thought the moment opportune to give him a banquet at the carlton mr gladstone in another room was harmlessly reading the paper presently in came the revellers began to use insulting language and finally vowed that he ought to be pitched headlong out of the window into the reform mr gladstone made some courteous reply but as the reporter truly says courtesy to gentry in this humour was the casting of pearls before swine eventually they ordered candles in another room and left him to himself276 you will perhaps he wrote to his wife see an account of a row at the carlton in which i have taken no harm the affair indeed was trivial but it illustrates a wellknown and striking reflection of cornewall lewis upon the assault perpetrated on sumner in the senate at washington by brooks that outrage he said is no proof of brutal manners or low morality in americans it is the first blow in a civil war if peel had proposed a law not only reducing rents but annihilating them instead of being attacked by a man of words like disraeli he would have been attacked with physical arguments by some man of blows277  in point of numbers the stroke given to protection was not tremendous but as the history of half a century has shown it was adequate and sufficient and lord derby at once resigned he did not take his defeat well strange to say mr gladstone wrote to his wife lord derby has been making a most petulant and intemperate speech in the house of lords on his resignation such that newcastle was obliged to rise after him and contradict the charge of combination while nothing could be better in temper feeling and judgment than disraelis farewell derby angrily divided the combination that had overthrown him into first various gradations of liberalism from high aristocratic and exclusive whigs down to the extremest radical theorists second irish ultramontanes and lastly a party of some thirty or thirtyfive gentlemen of great personal worth of great eminence and respectability possessing considerable official experience and a large amount of talentwho once professed and i believe do still profess conservative opinions  mr disraeli on the contrary with infinite polish and grace asked pardon for the flying words of debate and drew easy forgiveness from the member whom a few hours before he had mocked as a weird sibyl the other member whom he would not say he greatly respected but whom he greatly regarded and the third member whom he bade learn that petulance is not sarcasm and insolence is not invective lord john russell congratulated him on the ability and the gallantry with which he had conducted the struggle and so the curtain fell the result as the great newspaper put it with journalistic freedom was not merely the victory of a battle but of a war not a reverse but a conquest the vanquished have no principles which they dare to assert no leaders whom they can venture to trust  footnotes  270 charles wordsworth letter to mr gladstone 1852 p 50  271 inglis 1368 gladstone 1108 marsham 758  272 i suppose this refers to a passage about mr disraelifor my part i acquit the chancellor of the exchequer so far as his own convictions are concerned of the charge of having ever been a protectionist i never for one moment thought he believed in the least degree in protection i do not accuse him of having forgotten what he said or what he believed in those years i only accuse him of having forgotten now what he then wished it to appear that he believed the same speech contains a whimsical reason why the jews make no converts which the taste of our more democratic house would certainly not tolerate  273 the only serious misunderstanding i ever had with my noble and lamented friend lord george bentinck which i am happy to say was thoroughly removed before his untimely deathwas upon a full and frank expression of my opinion that nothing could be more unfitting nor more impolitic than to load with terms of vituperation those from whom we are compelled conscientiously to differ dec 6  274 we had a preliminary debate to have the whole resolution put instead of the preamble only which was ultimately agreed to and placed the question more fairly before the public disraeli making the extraordinary declaration that though the proposal was for doubling the housetax nobody was bound by that vote to do so it was an attempt at a shuffle in order to catch votes from his own people and to a certain extent it succeededhalifax papers 1852

knowledge of the      situation that has provoked them forms no inconsiderable element of      historymetternich   england was unconsciously on the eve of a violent break in the peace that had been her fortunate lot for nearly forty years to the situation that preceded this signal event a judicious reader may well give his attention some of the particulars may seem trivial in countries governed by party what those out of the actualities of the fray reckon trivial often count for much and in the life of a man destined to be a conspicuous party leader to pass them by would be to leave out real influences  the first experiment in providing the country with a tory government had failed that alliance between whig and peelite which lord john the year before had been unable to effect had become imperative and at least a second experiment was to be tried the initial question was who should be head of the new government in august lord aberdeen had written to mr gladstone in anticipation of the derbyite defeat if high character and ability only were required you would be the person but i am aware that for the present at least this would not be practicable whether it would be possible for newcastle or me to undertake the concern is more than i can say other good reasons apart it is easy to see that mr gladstones attitude in things ecclesiastical put him out of court and though he had made a conspicuous mark not only as lord aberdeen said by character and ability but by liberality of view especially in the region of colonial reform still he had as yet had no good opportunity for showing an independent capacity for handling great affairs  not any less impossible was lord john shortly before the occasion arose a whig intimate told him plainly that reconstruction on the basis of his old government was out of the question lord johns answer was a frank acceptance of that opinion and he was understood to say that the composition of the next government must be mainly from the ranks of the peelites he evidently looked forward to being a member of it but not the head when various persons were named as possible heads lord aberdeen was distinctly approved graham was distinctly rejected newcastle was mentioned without any distinct opinion expressed we aberdeen and gladstone were both alike at a loss to know whether lord john had changed his mind or had all along since his resignation been acting with this view all his proceedings certainly seem to require an opposite construction and to contemplate his own leadership278  lord palmerston was determined not to serve again under a minister who had with his own hand turned him out of office and of whose unfitness for the first post he was at the moment profoundly convinced he told a peelite friend that lord johns love of popularity would always lead him into scrapes and that his way of suddenly announcing new policies durham letter and edinburgh letter without consulting colleagues could not be acquiesced in besides the hostility of palmerston and his friends any government with the writer of the durham letter at its head must have the hostility of the irishmen to encounter the liberal attitude of the peelites on the still smouldering question of papal aggression gave aberdeen a hold on the irish such as nobody else could have                             a harassed week  another man of great eminence in the whig party might have taken the helm but lord lansdowne was seventytwo and was supposed to have formally retired from office for ever the leader of the peelites visited the patrician whig at lansdowne house and each begged the other to undertake the uncoveted post lord aberdeen gave a slow assent previously understanding from lord john that he would join aberdeen accepted the queens commission to form a government he had a harassed week at first the sun shone lord john consents wrote mr gladstone to his wife at hawarden and has behaved very well palmerston refuses which is a serious blow tomorrow i think we shall get to detailed arrangements about which i do not expect extraordinary difficulty but i suppose palmerston is looking to become the leader of a derby opposition and without him or rather with him between us and the conservatives i cannot but say the game will be a very difficult one to play it is uncertain whether i shall be chancellor of the exchequer or secretary for the colonies one of the two i think certainly and the exchequer will certainly come to graham or me  within a few hours angry squalls all but capsized the boat lord john at first had sought consolation in an orthodox historical parallelthe case of mr fox though at the head of the largest party leading the commons under lord grenville as head of the government why should he then refuse a position that fox had accepted but friends often in his case the most mischievous of advisers reminded him what sort of place he would hold in a cabinet in which the chief posts were filled by men not of his own party lord john himself thought from memories of bishop hampden and other ecclesiastical proceedings that mr gladstone would be his sharpest opponent then as the days passed he found deposition from first place to second more bitter than he had expected historic and literary consolation can seldom be a sure sedative against the stings of political ambition he changed his mind every twelve hours and made infinite difficulties when these were with much travail appeased difficulties were made on behalf of others the sacred caste and their adherents were up in arms and a bitter cry arose that all the good things were going to the peelites only the leavings to the whigs lord john doubtless remembered what fox had said when the ministry of all the talents was madewe are three in a bed disraeli now remarked sardonically the cake is too small to realise the scramble the reader may think of the venerable carp that date from henry iv and sully struggling for bread in the fishponds of the palace of fontainebleau the whigs of this time were men of intellectual refinement they had a genuine regard for good government and a decent faith in reform but when we chide the selfishness of machine politicians hunting office in modern democracy let us console ourselves by recalling the rapacity of our oligarchies it is melancholy muses sir james graham this christmas in his journal to see how little fitness for office is regarded on all sides and how much the public employments are treated as booty to be divided among successful combatants  from that point of view the whig case was strong of 330 members of the house of commons wrote lord john to aberdeen 270 are whig and radical thirty are irish brigade thirty are peelites to this party of thirty you propose to give seven seats in cabinet to the whigs and radicals five to lord palmerston one in the end there were six whigs as many peelites and one radical the case of four important offices out of the cabinet was just as heartrending three were to go to the thirty peelites and one to the two hundred and seventy just persons i am afraid cried lord john that the liberal party will never stand this and that the storm will overwhelm me whig pride was deeply revolted at subjection to a prime minister whom in their drawingrooms they mocked as an old tory in the aberdeen cabinet says mr gladstone it may be thought that the whigs whose party was to supply fivesixths or seveneighths of our supporters had less than their due share of power it should however be borne in mind that they had at this juncture in some degree the character of an used up and so far a discredited party without doubt they were sufferers from their illconceived and mischievous ecclesiastical titles act whereas we the peelites had been for six and a half years out of office and had upon us the gloss of freshness                       chancellor of the exchequer  lord palmerston refused to join the coalition on the honourable ground that for many years he and aberdeen had stood at the antipodes to one another in the momentous department of foreign affairs in fact he looked in another direction if the aberdeenrussell coalition broke down either before they began the journey or very soon after lord derby might come back with a reconstructed team with palmerston leading in the commons a centre party that should include the peelites he was believed to have something of this kind in view when he consented to move the amendment brought to him by gladstone and herbert in november and he was bitterly disappointed at the new alliance of that eminent pair with lord john with the tories he was on excellent terms pall mall was alive with tales of the anger and disgust of the derbyites against mr disraeli who had caused them first to throw over their principles and then to lose their places the county constituencies and many conservative boroughs were truly reported to be sick of the man who had promised marvels as looming in the future and then like a bad jockey had brought the horse upon its knees speculative minds cannot but be tempted to muse upon the difference that the supersession by lord palmerston of this extraordinary genius at that moment might have made both to the career of disraeli himself and to the nation of which he one day became for a space the supreme ruler cobden and bright let it be understood that they were not candidates for office our day has not come yet bright said to graham and the representative of the radicals in the cabinet was sir william molesworth in their newspaper the radicals wrote rather stiffly and jealously in the end lord palmerston changed his mind and joined  it was three days before the post of the exchequer was filled mr gladstone in his daily letter to hawarden writes at headquarters i understand they say mr g destroyed the budget so he ought to make a new one however we are trying to press graham into that service the next day it was settled from osborne a letter had come to lord aberdeen the queen hopes it may be possible to give the chancellorship of the exchequer to mr gladstone and to secure the continuance of lord st leonards as chancellor279 notwithstanding the royal wish we pressed it says mr gladstone on graham but he refused point blank graham as we know was the best economist in the administration of peel and mr gladstones frequent references to him in later times on points of pure finance show the value set upon his capacity in this department his constitutional dislike of high responsibility perhaps intervened mr gladstone himself would cheerfully have returned to the colonial office but the whigs suspected the excesses of his colonial liberalism and felt sure that he would sow the tares of anglicanism in these virgin fields so before christmas day came mr gladstone accepted what was soon in influence the second post in the government280 and became chancellor of the exchequer  say what they would the parliamentary majority was unstable as water his own analysis of the house of commons gave 270 british liberals not very compact and the radical wing of them certain to make occasions of combination against the government especially in finance the only other party avowing themselves general supporters of the government were the forty peelitesfor at that figure he estimated them the ministry therefore were in a minority and a portion even of that minority not always to be depended on the remainder of the house he divided into forty irish brigaders bent on mischief from fifty to eighty conservatives not likely to join in any factious vote and not illdisposed to the government but not to be counted on either for attendance or confidence finally the derby opposition from 200 to 250 ready to follow mr disraeli into any combination for turning out the government it thus appears if we strike out the fifty conservatives faintly favourable that we have a government with 310 supporters liable on occasions which frequently arise to heavy deductions with an opposition of 290 derbyites and brigaders most of them ready to go all lengths such a government cannot be said to possess the confidence of the house of commons in the full constitutional sense                     early position of the ministry  the general course seemed smooth palmerston had gone to the harmless department of home affairs the international airs were still but a cabinet finally composed of six peelites six whigs and a radical was evidently open to countless internal hazards we shall all look strangely at each other one of them said when we first meet in cabinet graham describes them as a powerful team that would need good driving there are some odd tempers and queer ways among them but on the whole they are gentlemen and they have a perfect gentleman at their head who is honest and direct and who will not brook insincerity in others the head of the new government described it to a friend as a great experiment hitherto unattempted and of which the success must be considered doubtful but in the meantime the public had regarded it with singular favour to the king of the belgians aberdeen wrote england will occupy her true position in europe as the constant advocate of moderation and peace and to guizot that the position which we desired so see england occupy among the nations of europe was to act the part of a moderator and by reconciling differences and removing misunderstandings to preserve harmony and peace  i have seen no more concise analysis of the early position of the coalition government than that by one of the ablest and most experienced members of the whig party not himself a candidate for office       it is strong sir francis baring wrote to his son in personal      talent none that i can remember stronger though the head of the      government is untried it is strong in one point of view as to      public feeling the country i believe wanted a moderate liberal      government and a fusion of liberal conservatives and moderate      liberals it is weak in the feelings of the component parts      palmerston is degraded gladstone will struggle for power lord      john cannot be comfortable it is weak in the discordant      antecedents of the cabinet they must all make some sacrifices and      work uncomfortably it is weak in the support i do not mean the      numbers but the class of supporters the peelites are forty they      will have the liberals on the one side and the conservatives on the      other the whigs of the cabinet will be anxious to satisfy the      former the peelites gladstone especially the other they are      weak in their church views the protestants look on those who voted      against the aggression bill with distrust the evangelicals on      gladstone and s herbert with dislike i dont pretend to be a      prophet but it is always well to put down what you expect and to      compare these expectations with results my conjecture is that      gladstone will before long leave the government or that he will      break it up281  long afterwards mr gladstone himself said this of the coalition       i must say of this cabinet of lord aberdeens that in its      deliberations it never exhibited the marks of its dual origin sir      w molesworth its radical member seemed to be practically rather      nearer in colour to the peelites than to the whigs there were some      few idiosyncrasies without doubt lord palmerston who was home      secretary had in him some tendencies which might have been      troublesome but for a long time were not so it is for instance      a complete error to suppose that he asked the cabinet to treat the      occupation of the principalities as a casus belli lord russell      shook the position of lord aberdeen by action most capricious and      unhappy but with the general course of affairs this had no      connection and even in the complex and tortuous movements of the      eastern negotiations the cabinet never fell into two camps that      question and the war were fatal to it in itself i hardly ever saw      a cabinet with greater promise of endurance                                      ii                           opposition at oxford  acceptance of office vacated the oxford seat and the day after christmas a thunderbolt fell upon the new chancellor of the exchequer from his friend the militant archdeacon of taunton i wish to use few words denison wrote where every word i write is so bitterly distressing to me and must be little less so i cannot doubt to yourself and to many others whom i respect and love i have to state to you as one of your constituents that from this time i can place no confidence in you as representative of the university of oxford or as a public man mr gladstones protestations that church patronage would be as safe in lord aberdeens hands as in lord derbys that his own past history dispensed with the necessity of producing other assurances of his own fidelity that his assumption of office could not shake itall these were vain in face of the staring and flagrant fact that he would henceforth be the intimate and partner in council of lord john russell the latitudinarian the erastian the appropriationist the despoiler and worse still of molesworth sometimes denounced as a socinian sometimes as editor of the atheist hobbes but in either case no fit person to dispense the church patronage of the duchy of lancaster only a degree less shocking was the thought of the power of filling bishoprics and deaneries by a prime minister himself a presbyterian no guarantee that the member for oxford might have taken against aggression upon the church or for the concession of her just claims was worth a feather when weighed against the mere act of a coalition so deadly as this  it was an awkward fact for mr gladstones canvassers that lord derby had stated that his defeat was the result of a concert or combination between the peelites and other political parties mr gladstone himself saw no reason why this should cause much soreness among his oxford supporters no doubt he said they will remember that i avowed before and during the last election a wish to find the policy and measures of the government such as would justify me in giving them my support that wish i sincerely entertained but the main question was whether the concert or combination alleged to have taken place for the purpose of ejecting lord derbys government from office was fact or fiction i have not the slightest hesitation in stating to you that it is a fiction evidence for the only presumption in its favour was thisthat we voted against the budget of mr disraeli in strict conformity with every principle of finance we had professed through our political lives and with the policy of former finance ministers from the time of mr pitt against the new principles and new policies which mr disraeli declared at aylesbury his intention to submit to the house of commonsa pledge which i admit that he completely redeemed282  all this was true enough but what people saw was that the first fruits of the victory were a coalition with the whigs who by voting with villiers had from the first shown their predetermination against ministers as northcote humorously said mary stuart could never get over the presumption which her marriage with bothwell immediately raised as to the nature of her previous connection with him it is hard to deny that as the world goes the oxford tories clerical and lay might think they had a case lord derby was the tory minister and mr gladstone had been a chief instrument in turning him out that was the one salient fact and the political flock is often apt to see a thing with a more single eye than their shepherds  a candidate was found in mr perceval son of the tory prime minister who had met a tragic death forty years before the country clergy were plied with instigations and solicitations public and private no absurdity was too monstrous to set afloat mr gladstone had seceded to the episcopal church of scotland he had long ceased to be a communicant he was on close and intimate terms with cardinal wiseman he had incited the pope to persecute protestants at florence in this vein a flight of angry articles and circulars descended on every parsonage where there was an oxford master of arts with his name still on the university books at the beginning the enemy by a rush were in a majority but they were speedily beaten out of it at the end of six days in spite of frenzied efforts no more than 1330 votes out of a constituency of 3600 had been recorded still the indomitable men insisted on the legal right of keeping the poll open for fifteen days and learned persons even gloomily hinted that the time might be extended to forty days in the end jan 20 mr gladstone had 1022 votes against percevals 898 or a narrow majority of 124 the tory press justly consoled themselves by calculating that such a majority was only six per cent of the votes polled but they were very angry with the failure of the protestant electors in doing their patriotic duty against the proromanist candidate the organ of the peelites on the other hand was delighted at the first verdict thus gained from the most influential constituency in great britain in favour of the new experiment of conservativeliberalism and wise and rational progress graham said and truly that though gladstones defeat at that precise juncture would have been a misfortune yet for his own sake hereafter emancipation from the thraldom of that constituency would be a blessing it is a millstone under which even peel would have sunk  was mr gladstone right in his early notion of himself as a slow moving mind would it be true to say that compared with pitt for instance he ripened slowly or can we accurately describe him as having in any department of life thought knowledge feeling been precocious perhaps not to speak of slowness in a man of such magical rapidity of intellectual apprehension would be indeed a paradox but we have seen already how when he is walking in the middle path of his years there is a sense in which he was slow in character and motion slowness explains some qualities in his literary and oratorical form which was often and especially up to our present period vague ambiguous and obscure the careless and the uncharitable set all down to sophistry better observers perceived that his seeming mystifications were in fact the result of a really embarrassed judgment they pointed out that where the way was clear as in free trade colonial government dissenters chapels jewish disabilities catholic bishoprics nobody could run more straight at higher speed or with more powerful stride they began to say that in spite of russells palmerstons grahams mr gladstone after all was the least unlikely of them to turn out a thoroughgoing man of the people these anticipations of democracy there is no sign that mr gladstone himself in the smallest degree shared the newspapers meanwhile were all but unanimous in declaring that if experience talent industry and virtue are the attributes required for the government of this empire then the coalition government would be one of the best that england had ever seen                                     iii  mr gladstones dislike and distrust of the intrusion not only of the rude secular arm but of anything temporal into the sphere of spiritual things had been marked enough in the old days of battle at oxford between the tractarians and the heads though it was less manifest in the gorham case in 1853 he found occasion for an honourable exhibition of the same strong feeling maurice had got into trouble with the authorities at kings college by essays in which he was taken to hold that the eternity of the future torment of the wicked is a superstition not warranted by the thirtynine articles a movement followed in the council of the college to oust maurice from his professorial chair mr gladstone took great pains to avert the stroke and here is the story as he told it to his brotherinlaw lord lyttelton                             to lord lyttelton       oct 29 1853i remained in town last thursday in order to      attend the council of kc and as far as i could to see fair      play i was afraid of a very precipitous proceeding and i regret      to say my fears have been verified the motion carried was the      bishop of londons but i am bound to say he was quite willing to      have waived it for another course and the proceeding is due to a      body of laymen chiefly lords the motion carried is to the effect      that the statements on certain points contained in maurices last      essay are of a dangerous character and that his connection with      the theology of the school ought not to continue i moved as an      amendment that the bishop be requested to appoint competent      theologians who should personally examine how far the statements      of mr maurice were conformable to or at variance with the three      creeds and the formularies of the church of england and should      make a report upon them and that the bishop should be requested to      communicate with the council for myself i find in different parts      of what maurice has written things that i cannot and i am quite      certain the council had not been able to reconcile this      consideration alone seemed to me to show that they were not in a      condition to proceed with a definite judgment i do not feel      sufficiently certain what his view as a whole may be even if i      were otherwise competent to judge whether it is within or beyond      the latitude allowed by the church in this matter and      independently of all this i thought that even decency demanded of      the council acting perforce in a judicial capacity that they      should let the accused person know in the most distinct terms for      what he was dismissed and should show that they had dismissed      him if at all only after using greater pains to ascertain that      his opinions were in real contrariety to some article of the faith      i also cherished the hope founded on certain parts of what he has      said that his friends might be able in the meantime to arrange      some formula concordiæ which might avert the scandal and mischief      of the dismissal sir j patteson sir b brodie and mr green      supported the amendment but the majority went the other way and      much was i grieved at it i am not inclined to abate the dogmatic      profession of the churchon the contrary nothing would induce me      to surrender the smallest fraction of it but while jealous of its      infraction in any particular i am not less jealous of the      obtrusion of any private or local opinion into the region of dogma      and above all i hold that there should be as much rigour in a trial      of this kind irrespective of the high character and distinguished      powers of the person charged in this particular case as if he were      indicted for murder283                             defence of maurice  long afterwards when the alleged heretic was dead mr gladstone wrote of him to mr macmillan april 11 1884 maurice is indeed a spiritual splendour to borrow the phrase of dante about st dominic his intellectual constitution had long been and still is to me a good deal of an enigma when i remember what is said and thought of him and by whom i feel that this must be greatly my own fault some years after the affair at kings college maurice was appointed to vere street and the attack upon him was renewed mr gladstone was one of those who signed an address of recognition and congratulation  footnotes  278 memo by mr gladstone of a conversation with aberdeen  279 the practical impossibility of retaining this learned man the derbyite chancellor upon the coalition woolsack is an illustration of the tenacity of the modern party system  280 it was not until the rise of mr gladstone that a chancellor of the exchequer not being prime minister stood at this high level  281 from the baring papers for which i am indebted to the kindness of lord northbrook  282 times december 23 1852  283 see life of maurice ii p 195 life of

           1853       we have not sought to evade the difficulties of our position we      have not attempted to counteract them by narrow or flimsy      expedients we have proposed plans which will go some way      towards closing up many vexed financial questions while we have      sought to do justice to intelligence and skill as compared with      propertywhile we have sought to do justice to the great labouring      community by further extending their relief from indirect taxation      we have not been guided by any desire to set one class against      anothergladstone 1853   mr gladstone began this year so important both to himself and to the country with what he described as a short but active and pleasant visit to oxford he stayed at christ church with dr jacobson of whom it was observed that he always looked as if on the point of saying something extremely piercing and shrewd only it never came he paid many calls dined at oriel had a luncheon and made a speech in the hall at balliol passed busy days and brisk evenings and filled up whatever spare moments he could find or manufacture with treasury papers books on taxation consolidated annuities and public accounts alternating with dips into lamennaisthe bold and passionate french mystic fallen angel of his church most moving of all the spiritual tragedies of that day of heroic idealists  on february 3 he moved into the house of the chancellor of the exchequer in that best known of all streets which is not a street where he was destined to pass some two and twenty of the fortyone years of the public life that lay before him he had a correspondence with mr disraeli his predecessor on the valuation of the furniture in the official house there was question also of the robe that passes down under some law of exchange from one chancellor to another on an apparently unsettled footing the tone on this high concern was not wholly amicable mr gladstone notes especially in his diary that he wrote a draft of one of his letters on a sunday as being i suppose the day most favourable to selfcontrol while mr disraeli at last suggests that mr gladstone should really consult sir charles wood who is at least a man of the world such are the angers of celestial minds  at an early cabinet feb 5 he began the battle that lasted in various shapes all the rest of his life it was on a question of reducing the force in the pacific lord aberdeen granville molesworth and i were for it we failed what was the case for this particular retrenchment i do not know nor does it matter fiercer engagements and many of them were to follow meanwhile he bent all the energies of his mind to the other front of financial questionsto raising money rather than expending it and with unwearied industry applied himself to solve the problem of redistributing the burdens and improving the machinery of taxation  for many years circumstances had given to finance a lively and commanding place in popular interest the protracted discussion on the corn law conducted not only in senate and cabinet but in country marketplaces and thronged exchanges in the farmers ordinary and at huge gatherings in all the large towns in the kingdom had agitated every class in the community the battle between free trade and protection ending in a revolution of our commercial system had awakened men to the enormous truth as to which they are always so soon ready to relapse into slumber that budgets are not merely affairs of arithmetic but in a thousand ways go to the root of the prosperity of individuals the relations of classes and the strength of kingdoms the finance of the whigs in the years after the reform bill had not only bewildered parliament but had filled merchants bankers shipowners manufacturers shopkeepers and the whole array of general taxpayers with perplexity and dismay peel recovered a financial equilibrium and restored public confidence but peel was gone the whigs who followed him after 1846 had once more laboured under an unlucky star in this vital sphere of national affairs they performed the unexampled feat of bringing forward four budgets in a single year the first of them introduced by lord john russell himself as prime minister by 1851 floundering had reached a climax finance had thus discredited one historical party it had broken up the other it was finance that overthrew weak governments and hindered the possibility of a strong one                             fiscal confusion  mr disraeli the most unsparing of all the assailants of peel tried his own hand in 1852 to have the genius and the patience of a great partisan chief is one gift and this he had to grasp the complex material interests of a vast diversified society like the united kingdom demands powers of a different order the defeat of mr disraelis budget at the end of 1852 seemed to complete the circle of fiscal confusion every source of public income was the object of assault every indirect tax was to be reduced or swept away and yet no two men appeared to agree upon the principles of the direct taxes that were to take their place the window duty the paper duty the tax on advertisements the malttax the stamp on marine insurances were all to vanish but even the most zealous reformers were powerless to fill the void the orderbook of the house of commons was loaded with motions about the incometax and an important committee sat in 1851 to consider all the questions connected with the possibility of its readjustment and amendment they could not even frame a report the belief that it was essentially unjust to impose the tax at one and the same rate upon permanent and temporary incomes prevailed in the great mass especially of the liberal party discussions arose all through this period descending not only to the elementary principles of taxation but as mr gladstone said almost to the first principles of civilised society itself party distraction ministerial embarrassment adjournment after adjournment of a decision upon fundamental maxims of national taxationsuch was the bewildered scene at last a statesman appeared a financier almost by accident for as we have seen it was by no special choice of his own that mr gladstone went to the exchequer but a financier endowed with a practical imagination of the highest class with a combination of the spirit of vigorous analysis and the spirit of vigorous system with the habit of unflagging toil and above all with the gift of indomitable courage if anybody suggested the reappointment of humes committee the idea was wisely dismissed it was evidently as graham said the duty of the executive government to lead the way and to guide public opinion in a matter of this crucial importance it seemed impossible and unworthy to avoid a frank declaration about the incometax he was strongly of opinion march 15 that a larger measure would be carried with greater certainty and ease than simple renewal and that a combination of incometax gradually diminishing to a fixed term of extinction with reduction of the interest of debt and a review of the probate and legacy duties afforded the best ground for a financial arrangement both successful and creditable it was strong ideas of this kind that encouraged mr gladstone to build on a broad foundation  the nature of his proceedings he set out in one of the most interesting of his political memoranda       the liberals were to all appearance pledged to the reconstruction      of the tax by their opinions and the tories by their party      following the small fraction of peelites could probably be relied      upon the other way and some few individuals with financial      knowledge and experience the mission of the new government was      described by lord aberdeen in the house of lords as a financial      mission and the stress of it thus lay upon a person very      illprepared my opinions were with peel but under such      circumstances it was my duty to make a close and searching      investigation into the whole nature of the tax and make up my mind      whether there was any means of accepting or compounding with the      existing state of opinion i went to work and laboured very hard      when i had entered gravely upon my financial studies i one day had      occasioni know not whatto go into the city and to call upon      mr samuel gurney to whom experience and character had given a      high position there he asked me with interest about my      preparations for my budget and he said one thing i will venture      to urge whatever your plan islet it be simple i was a man      much disposed to defer to authority and i attached weight to this      advice but as i went further and further into my subject i became      more and more convinced that as an honest steward i had no option      but to propose the renewal of the tax in its uniform shape i      constructed much elaborate argument in support of my proposition      which i knew it would be difficult to answer but i also knew that      no amount of unassisted argument would suffice to overcome the      obstacles in my way and that this could only be done by large      compensations in my accompanying propositions so i was led      legitimately on and on until i had framed the most complicated      scheme ever submitted to parliament                            the fabric planned  truly has it been said that there is something repulsive to human nature in the simple reproduction of defunct budgets certainly if anything can be more odious than a living tax it is a dead one it is as much as is consonant to biography to give an outline of the plan that was gradually wrought out in mr gladstones mind during the first three laborious months of 1853 and to mark the extraordinarily farreaching and comprehensive character of the earliest of his thirteen budgets its initial boldness lay in the adoption of the unusual course of estimating the national income roughly for a long period of seven years and assuming that expenditure would remain tolerably steady for the whole of that period just as no provident man in private life settles his establishment on the basis of one year or two years only so mr gladstone abandoned handtomouth and took long views i ought no doubt he said afterwards to have pointed out explicitly that a great disturbance and increase of our expenditure would baffle my reckonings meanwhile the fabric was planned on strong foundations and admirable lines the simplification of the tariff of duties of customs begun by peel eleven years before was carried forward almost to completion nearly one hundred and forty duties were extinguished and nearly one hundred and fifty were lowered the tea duty was to be reduced in stages extending over three years from over two shillings to one shilling in the department of excise the high and injurious duty on soap which brought into the exchequer over eleven hundred thousand pounds annually was swept entirely away in the same department by raising the duties on spirits manufactured in ireland nearer to the level of england and scotland a step was taken towards identity of taxation in the three kingdomsby no means an unequivocal good miscellaneous provisions and minor aspects of the scheme need not detain us but a great reform of rate and scale in the system of the assessed taxes the reduction of the duty on the beneficent practice of life insurance from halfacrown to sixpence on the hundred pounds and the substitution of a uniform receipt stamp were no contemptible contributions to the comfort and wellbeing of the community advertisements in newspapers became free of duty284                         keystone of the budget  the keystone of the budget in mr gladstones conception was the position to be assigned in it to the incometax this he determined to renew for a period of seven yearsfor two years at sevenpence in the pound for two years more at sixpence and for the last three at fivepence by that time he hoped that parliament would be able to dispense with it meanwhile it was to be extended to ireland in compensation for the remission of a debt owed by ireland to the british treasury of between four and five millions it was to be extended also at a reduced rate of fivepence to incomes between a hundred and fifty and a hundred poundsthe former having hitherto been the line of total exemption from the retention of the incometax as a portion of the permanent and ordinary finance of the country the chancellor of the exchequer was wholly and strongly averse and so he remained for more than twenty years to come in order however to meet a common and a just objection that under this impost intelligence enterprise and skill paid too much and property paid too little he resolved upon a bold step he proposed that the legacy duty hitherto confined to personal property passing on death either by will or by inheritance and not by settlement should henceforth be extended to real property and to both descriptions of property passing by settlement whether real or personal in a word the legacy duty was to extend to all successions whatever this was the proposal that in many senses cut deepest it was the first rudimentary breach in the ramparts of the territorial system unless indeed we count as first the abolition of the corn law285 mr gladstone eagerly disclaimed any intention of accelerating by the pressure of fiscal enactment changes in the tenure of landed property and the letters which the reader has already seen pp 3459 show the high social value that he invariably set upon the maintenance of the old landed order the succession duty as we shall find for the time disappointed his expectations for he counted on two millions and in fact it yielded little more than half of one but it secured for its author the lasting resentment of a powerful class  such was the scheme that mr gladstone now worked out in many weeks of toil that would have been slavish were it not that toil is never slavish when illuminated by a strenuous purpose when by and by the result had made him the hero of a glorious hour he wrote to lord aberdeen april 19 i had the deepest anxiety with regard to you as our chief lest by faults of my own i should aggravate the cares and difficulties into which i had at least helped to bring you and the novelty of our political relations with many of our colleagues together with the fact that i had been myself slow and even reluctant to the formation of a new connection filled me with an almost feverish desire to do no injustice to that connection now that it was formed and to redeem the pledge you generously gave on my behalf that there would be no want of cordiality and zeal in the discharge of any duties which it might fall to me to perform on behalf of such a government as was then in your contemplation  thirteen fourteen fifteen hours a day he toiled at his desk treasury officials and trade experts soap deputations and posthorse deputations representatives of tobacco and representatives of the west india interest flocked to downing street day by day all through march if he went into the city to dine with the lord mayor the lamentable hole thus made in his evening was repaired by working till four in the morning upon customs reform australian mints budget plans of all kinds it is characteristic that even this mountain load of concentrated and exacting labour did not prevent him from giving a latin lesson every day to his second boy                                     ii  some days before the day appointed for my statement says mr gladstone i recited the leading particulars to my able and intelligent friend cardwell not in the cabinet but then holding office as president of the board of trade he was so bewildered and astounded at the bigness of the scheme that i began to ask myself have i a right to ask my colleagues to follow me amidst all these rocks and shoals in consequence i performed a drastic operation upon the plan and next day i carried to lord aberdeen a reduced and mutilated scheme which might be deemed by some politicians to be weaker but safer i put to lord aberdeen the question i had put to myself and stated my readiness if he should think it called for to make this sacrifice to the probable inclinations of my colleagues but he boldly and wisely said i take it upon myself to ask you to bring your original and whole plan before the cabinet i thought this an ample warrant                          the budget in cabinet  at last after mr gladstone had spent an hour at the palace in explaining his scheme to the prince consort the budget was opened to the cabinet april 9 in a speech of three hoursan achievement i should suppose unparalleled in that line for a cabinet consists of men each with pretty absorbing preoccupations of his own the exposition was as ingenious lord aberdeen told prince albert as clear and for the most part as convincing as anything i have ever heard gladstone said lord aberdeen later 1856 does not weigh well against one another different arguments each of which has a real foundation but he is unrivalled in his power of proving that a specious argument has no real foundation on the succession bill the whole cabinet was against him he delivered to us much the same speech as he made in the house of commons at its close we were all convinced286  differences that might easily become serious speedily arose upon details in the minds of two or three of them and for some days the prime minister regarded the undertaking as not only difficult but perilous sir charles wood in cabinet april 11 strongly disapproved of the extension of incometax to ireland and to the lowering of the exemption line on ireland the plan would lay more than half a million of new taxation whereas much of the relief such as soap and assessed taxes would not touch her287 palmerston thought it a great plan perfectly just and admirably put together only it opened too many points of attack and it could never be carried disraeli was on the watch the irish would join him so would the radicals while the succession duty to which palmerston individually had great objection would estrange many conservatives lord john russell perceived difficulties but he did not see an alternative graham then fell in disliked the twofold extension of the incometax and thought they should only take away half the soaptax lord lansdowne a great irish landlord agreed with him mr gladstone told them that he was willing to propose whatever the cabinet might decide on except one thing namely the breaking up of the basis of the incometax that he could not be a party to he should regard it as a high political offence with this reservation he should follow their judgment but he strongly adhered to his whole plan lord aberdeen said you must take care your proposals are not unpopular ones mr gladstone replied that it was after applying the test of popularity that he was convinced the budget would be damaged beforehand by some of the small changes that had been suggested  at the end of a long and interesting discussion there stood for the whole budget lord john newcastle clarendon molesworth gladstone with argyll and aberdeen more or less favourable for dropping the two extensions of incometax and keeping half the soap duty lansdowne graham wood more or less leaning towards them palmerston and granville they agreed to meet again the next day april 12 when they got into the open sea wood stuck to his text lansdowne suggested that an increased spirit duty and an incometax for ireland together would be something like a breach of faith palmerston thought they would be beaten but he would accept the budget provided they were not to be bound to dissolve or resign upon such a point as to the two extensions of the incometax lord john said that if they were beaten on differentiating the tax they would have to dissolve palmerston expressed his individual opinion in favour of a distinction for precarious incomes and would act in that sense if he were out of the government as it was he assented argyll created a diversion by suggesting the abandonment of the irish spirit duty mr gladstone admitted that he thought the spirit duty the weakest point of the plan though warrantable and tenable on the whole at last after further patient and searching discussion the cabinet finding that the suggested amendments cut against one another were for adopting the entire budget the dissentients being lansdowne graham wood and herbert graham was full of ill auguries but said he would assent and assist wood looked grave and murmured that he must take time                             cabinet misgivings  in the course of these preliminaries lord john russell had gone to graham very uneasy about the incometax graham though habitually desponding bade him be of good cheer their opponents he said were in numbers strong but the budget would be excellent to dissolve upon and lord john admitted that they would gain forty seats  they agreed however in grahams language that it would never do to play their trump card until the state of the game actually required it lord john confessed that he was no judge of figuressomewhat of a weakness in a critic of a budgetand graham comforted him by the reply that he was at any rate the best judge living of house of commons tactics  the position of the government in the house of commons was notoriously weak the majority that had brought them into existence was excessively narrow it had been well known from the first that if any of the accidents of a session should happen to draw the tories the irish and the radicals into one lobby ministers would find themselves in a minority small defeats occurred the budget was only four days off mr gladstone enters in his diary spoke against gibson beaten by 200169 our third time this week very stiff work this ellice said dissolution would be the end of it we agreed in the house to a cabinet tomorrow herbert and cardwell to whom i spoke inclined to dissolve next day april 15 the cabinet met in a flutter for the same tactics might well be repeated whenever mr disraeli should think the chances good  lord john adverted to the hostility of the radicals as exhibited in the tone of the debate and hinted the opinion that they must take in a reef or two mr gladstone doubted whether the budget could live in that house whatever form it might assume but even with such perils he should look upon the whole budget as less unsafe than a partial contraction graham took the same view of the disposition of parliament keen opposition lukewarm support the necessity of a greater party sympathy and connection to enable them to surmount the difficulties of a most unusual and hazardous operation but he did not appear to lean to dissolution and the older members of the cabinet generally declared themselves against it in the end we went back to the position that we must have a budget on monday but clarendon herbert and palmerston joined the chorus of those who said the measure was too sharp upon ireland the idea was then started whether we should go the length of the entire remission of the consolidated annuities288 and impose the incometax at sevenpence with the augmented spirit duty this view found favour generally and i felt that some excess in the mere sacrifice of money was no great matter compared with the advantage of so great an approximation to equal taxation then speaking with great deference gladstone repeated his belief once more that the entire budget was safer than a contracted one both for the house and the country and his conviction that if they proposed it the name and fame of the government at any rate would stand well wood seemed still to hang back but the rest of the cabinet now appeared well satisfied and we parted each resolved and certainly more likely to stand or fall by the budget as a whole than we seemed to be on wednesday                                     iii  the decisive cabinet was on saturday april 16 it was finally settled that the budget should be proposed as it stood with its essential features unaltered on sunday the chancellor of the exchequer went as usual twice to church and read the paradiso but i was obliged he says with an accent of contrition to give several hours to my figures monday brought the critical moment april 18 wrote minutes read shakespeare at night this day was devoted to working up my papers and figures for the evening then drove and walked with c mrs gladstone went at 4½ to the house spoke 4¾ hours in detailing the financial measures and my strength stood out well thank god many kind congratulations afterwards herberts and wortleys came home with us and had soup and negus                        laid before parliament  the proceeding that figures here so simply was in fact one of the great parliamentary performances of the century lord aberdeen wrote to prince albert that the display of power was wonderful it was agreed in all quarters that there had been nothing like the speech for many years and that under the impression of his commanding eloquence the reception of the budget had been most favourable lord john told the queen the speech was one of the ablest ever made in the house of commons mr pitt in the days of his glory might have been more imposing but he could not have been more persuasive lord aberdeen heard from windsor the next day the queen must write a line to lord aberdeen to say how delighted she is at the great success of mr gladstones speech last night we have every reason to be sanguine now which is a great relief to the queen prince albert used the same language to mr gladstone i cannot resist writing you a line in order to congratulate you on the success of your speech of yesterday i have just completed a close and careful perusal of it and should certainly have cheered had i a seat in the house i hear from all sides that the budget has been well received trusting that your christian humility will not allow you to be dangerously elated i cannot help sending for your perusal the report which lord john russell sent to the queen feeling sure that it will give you pleasure such approbation being the best reward a public man can have  on the cardinal question of the fortunes of the ministry its effect was decisive the prime minister wrote to mr gladstone himself april 19 while everybody is congratulating me on the wonderful impression produced in the house of commons last night it seems only reasonable that i should have a word of congratulation for you you will believe how much more sincerely i rejoice on your account than on my own although most assuredly if the existence of my government shall be prolonged it will be your work to madame de lieven aberdeen said that gladstone had given a strength and lustre to the administration which it could not have derived from anything else no testimony was more agreeable to mr gladstone than a letter from lady peel i know the recollections he replied with which you must have written and therefore i will not scruple to say that as i was inspired by the thought of treading however unequally in the steps of my great teacher and master in public affairs so it was one of my keenest anxieties not to do dishonour to his memory or injustice to the patriotic policy with which his name is forever associated289                       power of the performance  greville makes a true point when he says that the budget speech has raised gladstone to a great political elevation and what is of far greater consequence than the measure itself has given the country assurance of a man equal to great political necessities and fit to lead parties and direct governments290 mr gladstone had made many speeches that were in a high degree interesting ingenious attractive forcible he now showed that besides and apart from all this he was the possessor of qualities without which no amount of rhetoricians glitter commands the house of commons for a single hour after the fireworks have ceased to blaze he showed that he had precise perception positive and constructive purpose and a powerful will in 1851 he had on two occasions exhibited the highest competency as a critic of the budget of sir charles wood on the memorable night in the previous december when he had torn mr disraelis budget to pieces he had proved how terrifying he could be in exposure and assault he now triumphantly met the test that he had triumphantly applied to his predecessor and presented a command of even more imposing resources in the task of responsible construction than he had displayed in irresponsible criticism the speech was saturated with fact the horizons were large and the opening of each in the long series of topics from mr pitt and the great war down to the unsuspected connection between the repeal of the soaptax and the extinction of the slave trade in africa was exalted and spacious the arguments throughout were close persuasive exhaustive the moral appeal was in the only tone worthy of a great minister addressing a governing assemblya masculine invocation of their intellectual and political courage this is the intrepid way in which a strong parliament and a strong nation like to see public difficulties handled and they now welcomed the appearance of a new minister who rejected what he called narrow and flimsy expedients of which so much had been seen in the last half dozen years who was not afraid to make a stand against heedless men with hearts apparently set on drying up one source of revenue after another who did not shrink from sconcing the powerful landed phalanx like other people and who at the same time boldly used and manfully defended the most unpopular of all the public imposts in politics the spectacle of sheer courage is often quite as good in its influence and effect as the best of logic it was so here while proposing that the incometax should come to an end in seven years he yet produced the most comprehensive analysis and the boldest vindication of the structure of the tax as it stood his manner was plain often almost conversational but his elaborate examination of the principles of an incometax remains to this day a master example of accurate reasoning thrown into delightful form he admitted all the objections to it the inquisition that it entailed the frauds to which it led the sense in the public mind of its injustice in laying the same rate upon the holder of idle and secured public funds upon the industrious trader upon the precarious earnings of the professional man it was these disadvantages that made him plan the extinction of the tax at the end of a definite period when the salutary remissions of other burdens now proposed would have had time to bring forth their fruits as was said by a later chancellor of the exchequer this speech not only won universal applause from his audience at the time but changed the convictions of a large part of the nation and turned at least for several years a current of popular opinion which had seemed too powerful for any minister to resist291  the succession duty brought mr gladstone into the first conflict of his life with the house of lords that land should be made to pay like other forms of property was a proposition denounced as essentially impracticable oppressive unjust cowardly and absurd it was called ex post facto legislation it was one of the most obnoxious detestable and odious measures ever proposed its author was a vulture soaring over society waiting for the rich harvest that death would pour into his treasury lord derby invoked him as a phoenix chancellor in whom mr pitt rose from his ashes with double lustre for mr gladstone had ventured where pitt had failed he admitted that nothing short of the chancellors extraordinary skill and dexterity could have carried proposals so evil through the house of commons292 meanwhile the public counted up their gains a remission on tea good for twenty shillings a year in an ordinary household a fall in the washing bill a boon of a couple of pounds for the man who insured his life for five hundred an easy saving of ten pounds a year in the assessed taxes and so forththe whole performance ending with a dissolving view of the decline and fall of the hated incometax                      succession duty and redemption  the financial proceedings of this year included a proposal for the redemption of south sea stock and an attempted operation on the national debt by the creation of new stocks bearing a lower rate of interest two options of conversion being given to the holders of old stock the idea of the creation of a twoandhalfpercent stock said mr gladstone in later years though in those days novel was very favourably received293       i produced my plan disraeli offered it a malignant opposition he      made a demand for time the one demand that ought not to have been      made in proposals of this kind it is allowed to be altogether      improper in 1844 mr goulburn was permitted i think to carry      through with great expedition his plan for a large reduction of      interest when mr goschen produced his still larger and much more      important measure we the opposition did our best to expedite      the decision there are no complications requiring time on such an      occasion it is a matter of aye or no but when time is allowed the      chapter of accidents allows an opponent to hope that a situation      known to be unusually happy will deteriorate of this contingency      disraeli took his chance time as it happened was in his favour it      was no question of the substance of the plan but a moderate change      in the political barometer which reduced to two or three millions      a subscription which at the right moment would probably have been      twenty or thirty294  in a letter to w r farquhar march 8 1861 he makes further remarks which are introspective and autobiographic       looking back now upon those of my proceedings in 1853 which related      to interest upon exchequer bills and to the reduction of interest      on the public debt i think that there was nothing in the proposals      themselves which might not have taken full and quick effect if      they had been made at a time which i may best describe as the time      that precedes highwater with respect to abundance of money and      security of the market as respects exchequer bills i am decidedly      of opinion that the rates of premium current for some years before      53 were wholly incompatible with a sound state of things and the      fluctuations then were even greater than since still i think that      i committed an error from want of sufficient quickness in      discerning the signs of the times for we were upon the very eve of      an altered state of things and any alteration of a kind at all      serious was enough to make the period unfit for those grave      operations it is far from being the first or only time when i have      had reason to lament my own deficiency in the faculty of rapid and      comprehensive observation i failed to see that highwater was just      past and that although the tide had not perceptibly fallen yet it      was going to fall the truth likewise is this to go a step further      in my confessions that almost all my experience in money affairs      had been of a most difficult and trying kind under circumstances      which admitted of no choice but obliged me to sail always very      near the wind and this induced a habit of more daring navigation      than i could now altogether approve nor will i excuse myself by      saying that others were deceived like me for none of them were in      a condition to have precisely my responsibility  another note contributes a further point of explanation i have always imagined that this fault was due to my experience in the affairs of the hawarden and oak farm estates where it was an incessant course of sailing near the wind and there was really no other hope                                 incometax  seven years later mr gladstone once more chancellor of the exchequer again produced a budget semiironic cheers met his semiironic expression of an expectation that he would be asked the question what had become of the calculations of 1853 the succession duty proved a woeful disappointment and instead of producing two million pounds produced only six hundred thousand a similar but greater disappointment we must recollect owing mainly to a singular miscalculation as to the incometax had marked peels memorable budget of 1842 which landed him in a deficiency of nearly two and a quarter millions instead of a surplus of half a million295 of the disappointment in his own case mr gladstone when the time came propounded an explanation only moderately conclusive i need not discuss it for as everybody knows the effective reason why the incometax could not be removed was the heavy charge created by the crimean war what is more to the point in estimating the finance of 1853 is its effect in enabling us to meet the strain of the war it was this finance that continuing the work begun by peel made the country in 1859 richer by more than sixteen per cent than it had been in 1853 it was this finance that by clinching the open questions that enveloped the incometax and setting it upon a defensible foundation while it lasted bore us through the struggle unluckily in demonstrating the perils of meddling with the structure of the tax in showing its power and simplicity the chancellor was at the same time providing the easiest means if not also the most direct incentive to that policy of expenditureit rose from fifty to seventy millions between 1853 and 1859which was one of the most fatal obstacles to the foremost aims of his political life it was twenty years from now as my readers will see before the effort now foreshadowed to exclude the incometax from the ordinary sources of national revenue reached its dramatic close  footnotes  284 a curious parliamentary incident occurred the original proposal was to reduce the duty from eighteenpence to sixpence a motion to repeal it altogether was rejected by ten then a motion was made to substitute zero for sixpence in the clause the speaker ruled that this reversal of the previous vote was not out of order and it was carried by nine  285 some may place first the act of 1833 making real estate liable for simple contract debts  286 mrs simpsons many memories p 237  287 for paper on irish incometax see appendix  288 loans made

circumstances of real difficulty i have found your kindness inexhaustible and your aid invaluable so that i really can ill tell on which of the two i look back with the greater pleasure the memory of the succession duty bill is to me something like what inkermann may be to a private of the guards you were the sergeant from whom i got my drill and whose hand and voice carried me through  293 the city articles of the time justify this statement  294 gladstone memo 1897 see also appendix  295 it may be said however that peel was right about the yield of the incometax and only overlooked the fact that it would not all be collected within the year                                 chapter iii                             the crimean war                              18531854       he burke maintained that the attempt to bring the turkish empire      into the consideration of the balance of power in europe was      extremely new and contrary to all former political systems he      pointed out in strong terms the danger and impolity of our      espousing the ottoman causeburke 1791   after the session mr gladstone had gone on a visit to dunrobin and there he was laid up with illness for many days it was the end of september before he was able to travel south at dingwall they presented him sept 27 with the freedom of that ancient burgh he spoke of himself as having completed the twentyfirst year of his political life and as being almost the youngest of those veteran statesmen who occupied the chief places in the counsels of the queen at inverness the same evening he told them that in commercial legislation he had reaped where others had sown that he had enjoyed the privilege of taking a humble but laborious part in realising those principles of free trade which in the near future would bring in the train of increased intercourse and augmented wealth that closer social and moral union of the nations of the earth which men all so fervently desire and which must in the fulness of time lessen the frequency of strife and war yet even while the hopeful words were falling from the speakers lips he might have heard not in far distance but close at hand the trumpets and drums the heavy rumbling of the cannon and all the clangour of a world in arms                                      ii                           ottomans and the west  one of the central and perennial interests of mr gladstones life was that shifting intractable and interwoven tangle of conflicting interests rival peoples and antagonistic faiths that is veiled under the easy name of the eastern question the root of the eastern question as everybody almost too well knows is the presence of the ottoman turks in europe their possession of constantinoplethat incomparable centre of imperial power standing in europe but facing asiaand their sovereignty as mahometan masters over christian races in one of the few picturesque passages of his eloquence mr gladstone once described the position of these races they were like a shelving beach that restrained the ocean that beach it is true is beaten by the waves it is laid desolate it produces nothing it becomes perhaps nothing save a mass of shingle of rock of almost useless seaweed but it is a fence behind which the cultivated earth can spread and escape the incoming tide and such was the resistance of bulgarians of servians and of greeks it was that resistance which left europe to claim the enjoyment of her own religion and to develop her institutions and her laws this secular strife between ottoman and christian gradually became a struggle among christian powers of northern and western europe to turn tormenting questions in the east to the advantage of rival ambitions of their own at a certain epoch in the eighteenth century russia first seized her place among the powers by the end of the century she had pushed her force into the west by the dismemberment of poland she had made her way to the southern shores of the black sea and while still the most barbaric of all the states she had made good a vague claim to exercise the guardianship of civilisation on behalf of the christian races and the orthodox church this claim it was that led at varying intervals of time and with many diversities of place plea and colour to crisis after crisis springing up within the turkish empire but henceforth all of them apt to spread with dangerous contagion to governments beyond ottoman limits  england unlike france had no systematic tradition upon this complicated struggle when war began between russia and the porte in 1771 we supported russia and helped her to obtain an establishment in the black sea towards the end of 1782 when catherine by a sort of royal syllogism as fox called it took the crimea into her own hands the whig cabinet of the hour did not think it necessary to lend turkey their support though france and spain proposed a combination to resist then came pitt the statesman whose qualities of greatness so profoundly impressed his contemporaries has usually been praised as a minister devoted to peace and only driven by the french revolution into the long war his preparations in 1791 for a war with russia on behalf of the turk are a serious deduction from this estimate happily the alarms of the baltic trade and the vigorous reasoning of fox produced such an effect upon opinion that pitt was driven on peril of the overthrow of his government to find the best expedient he could to bring the business to an end without extremities in 1853 the country was less fortunate than it had been in 1791  a russian diplomatist made a homely comparison of the eastern question to the gout now its attack is in the foot now in the hand but all is safe if only it does not fly to a vital part in 1852 the eastern question showed signs of flying to the heart and a catastrophe was sure a dispute between greek and latin religious as to the custody of the holy places at jerusalem followed by the diplomatic rivalries of their respective patrons russia and france produced a crisis that was at first of no extraordinary pattern the quarrel between two packs of monks about a key and a silver star was a trivial symbol of the vast rivalry of centuries between powerful churches between great states between heterogeneous races the dispute about the holy places was adjusted but was immediately followed by a claim from the czar for recognition by treaty of his rights as protector of the sultans christian subjects this claim the sultan with encouragement from the british ambassador rejected and the czar marched troops into the danubian provinces to hold them in pledge until the required concession should be made to his high protective claims this issue was no good cause for a general conflagration unfortunately many combustibles happened to lie about the world at that time and craft misunderstanding dupery autocratic pride democratic hurry combined to spread the blaze                          diplomatic rivalries  the story is still fresh with the detailed history of the diplomacy that preceded the outbreak of war between england france and turkey on the one part and russia on the other we have here happily only the smallest concern the large question as it presented itself to mr gladstones mind in later years and as it presents itself now to the historic student had hardly then emerged to the view of the statesmen of the western powers would the success of russian designs at that day mean anything better than the transfer of the miserable christian races to the yoke of a new master296 or was the repulse of these designs necessary to secure to the christian raceswho by the by were not particularly good friends to one anotherthe power of governing themselves without any master either russian or turk to this question so decisive as it is in judging the policy of the crimean war it is not quite easy even now for the historianwho has many other things to think of than has the contemporary politicianto give a confident answer  nicholas was not without advisers who warned him that the breakup of turkey by force of russian arms might be to the deliverer a loss and not a gain brunnow then russian ambassador at st jamess said to his sovereign the war in its results would cause to spring out of the ruins of turkey all kinds of new states as ungrateful to us as greece has been as troublesome as the danubian principalities have been and an order of things where our influence will be more sharply combated resisted restrained by the rivalries of france england austria than it has ever been under the ottoman war cannot turn to our direct advantage we shall shed our blood and spend our treasure in order that king otho may gain thessaly that the english may take more islands at their own convenience that the french too may get their share and that the ottoman empire may be transformed into independent states which for us will only become either burdensome clients or hostile neighbours if this forecast was right then to resist russia was at once to prevent her from embarrassing and weakening herself and to lock up the christians in their cruel prisonhouse for a quarter of a century longer if sagacious calculation in such a vein as this were the mainspring of the world history would be stripped of many a crimson page but farsighted calculation can no longer be ascribed to the actors in this tragedy of errorsto nicholas or napoleon to aberdeen or palmerston or to any other of them excepting cavour and the turk  in england both people and ministers have been wont to change their minds upon the eastern question in the war between russia and turkey in 1828 during the last stage of the struggle for greek independence russia as greek champion against the turk had the english populace on her side palmerston was warmly with her regarding even her advance to constantinople with indifference and aberdeen was reproached as a turkish sympathiser now we shall see the parts invertedengland and palmerston ardent turks and aberdeen falling into disgrace unjustly enough as russian before we have done with mr gladstone the popular wheel will be found to make another and yet another revolution                                      iii                             the british cabinet  when kinglakes first two volumes of his history of the crimean war appeared 1863 mr gladstone wrote to a friend may 14 kinglake is fit to be a brilliant popular author but quite unfit to be a historian his book is too bad to live and too good to die as to the matter most directly within my cognisance he is not only not too true but so entirely void of resemblance to the truth that one asks what was really the original of his picture297 a little earlier he had written to sir john acton i was not the important person in the negotiation before the war that mr kinglake seems to suppose and with him every supposition becomes an axiom and a dogma all the papers from various sources to which i have had access show that mr gladstone as he has just said had no special share in the various resolutions taken in the decisive period that ended with the abandonment of the vienna note in the early autumn of 1853 he has himself told us that through the whole of this critical stage lord clarendon then in charge of foreign affairs was the centre of a distinct set of communications first with the prime minister next with lord john russell as leader in the commons and third with lord palmerston whose long and active career at the foreign office had given him special weight in that department the cabinet as a body was a machine incapable of being worked by anything like daily and sometimes hourly consultations of this kind the upshot of which would only become known on the more important occasions to the ministers at large especially to those among them charged with the most laborious departments298 this was not at all said by way of exculpating mr gladstone from his full share of responsibility for the war for of that he never at any time showed the least wish or intention to clear himself but rather the contrary as matter of fact it was the four statesmen just named who were in effective control of proceedings until the breakdown of the vienna note and the despatch of the british and french squadrons through the dardanelles in october opened the second stage of the diplomatic campaign and led directly if not rapidly to its fatal climax  we have little more than a few glimpses of mr gladstones participation in the counsels of the eventful months that preceded the outbreak of the war to mrs gladstone he writes october 4 i can hardly at this moment write about anything else than the turkish declaration of war this is a most serious event and at once raises the question are we to go into it the cabinet meets on friday and you must not be surprised at anything that may happen the weather may be smooth it also may be very rough first the smooth weather came october 7 we have had our cabinet three hours and a half all there but graham and molesworth299 who would both have been strongly for peace we shall have another tomorrow to look over our results in writing some startling things were said and proposed but i think that as far as government is concerned all will probably keep straight at this juncture and as to war i hope we shall not be involved in it even if it goes on between russia and turkey which is not quite certain aberdeen himself thought the aspect of this cabinet of the 7th on the whole very good gladstone arguing strongly against a proposal of palmerstons that england should enter into an engagement with turkey to furnish her with naval assistance most of the cabinet were for peace lord john was warlike but subdued in tone palmerston urged his views perseveringly but not disagreeably the final instruction was a compromise bringing the fleet to constantinople but limiting its employment to operations of a strictly defensive character this was one of those peculiar compromises that in their sequel contain surrender the step soon showed how critical it was well indeed might lord aberdeen tell the queen that it would obviously every day become more and more difficult to draw the line between defensive and offensive between an auxiliary and a principal so much simpler is a distinction in words than in things still he was able to assure her that though grounds of difference existed the discussions of the cabinet of the 8th were carried on amicably and in good humour with straightforward common sense the queen pressed the prime minister for his own deliberate counsel on the spirit and ultimate tendency of the policy that he would recommend her to approve in fact lord aberdeen had no deliberate counsel to proffer speedily the weather roughened                           speech at manchester  four days later october 12 the minister repeated that while elements of wide difference existed still the appearance of that day was more favourable and tended to mutual agreement at this cabinet mr gladstone was not present having gone on an expedition to manchester the first of the many triumphal visits of his life to the great industrial centres of the nation nothing he wrote to lord aberdeen could have gone off better yesterday october 11 i had to make a visit to the exchange which was crammed and most cordial this morning we had first the inauguration of the peel statue in the presence of an enormous audiencemisnamed so inasmuch as but a portion of them could hear and then a meeting in the town hall where there were addresses and speeches made to which i had to reply i found the feeling of the assemblage so friendly that i said more on the war question than i had intended but i sincerely hope i did not transgress the limits you would think it wise for me to observe the existence of a peace and a war party was evident from alternate manifestations but i think the former feeling was decidedly the stronger and at any rate i should say without the smallest doubt that the feeling of the whole meeting as a mass was unequivocally favourable to the course that the government have pursued  your manchester speech lord aberdeen wrote to him in reply has produced a great and i hope a very beneficial effect upon the public mind and it has much promoted the cause of peace this result was extremely doubtful the language of the manchester speech is cloudy but what it comes to is this it recognises the duty of maintaining the integrity and independence of the ottoman empire independence however in this case says mr gladstone designates a sovereignty full of anomaly of misery of difficulty and it has been subject every few years since we were born to european discussion and interference we cannot forget the political solecism of mahometans exercising despotic rule over twelve millions of our fellow christians into the questions growing out of this political solecism we are not now entering what we see today is something different it is the necessity for regulating the distribution of power in europe the absorption of power by one of the great potentates of europe which would follow the fall of the ottoman rule would be dangerous to the peace of the world and it is the duty of england at whatever cost to set itself against such a result  this was mr gladstones first public entry upon one of the most passionate of all the objects of his concern for forty years to come he hears the desolate cry then but faint for the succour of the oppressed christians he looks to european interference to terminate the hateful solecism he resists the interference singlehanded of the northern invader it was intolerable that russia should be allowed to work her will upon turkey as an outlawed state300 in other words the partition of turkey was not to follow the partition of poland what we shortly call the crimean war was to mr gladstone the vindication of the public law of europe against a wanton disturber this was a characteristic example of his insistent search for a broad sentiment and a comprehensive moral principle the principle in its present application had not really much life in it the formula was narrow as other invasions of public law within the next dozen years were to show but the clearcut issues of history only disclose themselves in the long result of time it was the diplomatic labyrinth of the passing hour through which the statesmen of the coalition had to thread their way the disastrous end was what mr disraeli christened the coalition war  the first year of the coalition government lord aberdeen wrote to mr gladstone was eminently prosperous and this was chiefly owing to your own personal exertions and to the boldness ability and success of your financial measures our second year if not specially brilliant might still have proved greatly advantageous to the country had we possessed the courage to resist popular clamour and to avoid war but this calamity aggravated all other causes of disunion and led to our dissolution301                                      iv                           england slowly drawn in  on november 4 clarendon wrote to lord aberdeen that they were now in an anomalous and painful position and he had arrived at the conviction that it might have been avoided by firm language and a more decided course five months ago russia would then as she is now have been ready to come to terms and we should have exercised a control over the turks that is now not to be obtained nobody i suppose doubts today that if firmer language had been used in june to sultan and czar alike the catastrophe of war would probably have been avoided as lord clarendon here remorsefully reflects however that may have been this pregnant and ominous avowal disclosed the truth that the british cabinet were no longer their own masters that they had in a great degree even at this early time lost all that freedom of action which they constantly proclaimed it the rule of their policy to maintain and which for a few months longer some of them at least strove very hard but all in vain to recover  the turks were driving at war whilst we were labouring for peace and both by diplomatic action and by sending the fleet to protect turkish territory against russian attack we had become auxiliaries and turned the weaker of the two contending powers into the stronger a few months afterwards mr gladstone found a classic parallel for the turkish alliance when aeneas escaped from the flames of troy he had an ally that ally was his father anchises and the part which aeneas performed in the alliance was to carry his ally upon his back but the discovery came too late nor was the turk the only ally against the remonstrances of our ambassador the sultan declared war upon russia and proceeded to acts of war well knowing that england and france in what they believed to be interests of their own would see him through it if the sultan and his ulemas and his pashas were one intractable factor the french emperor was another we have just as much to apprehend graham wrote oct 27 from the active intervention of our ally as from the open hostility of our enemy behind the decorous curtain of european concert napoleon iii was busily weaving scheme after scheme of his own to fix his unsteady diadem upon his brow to plant his dynasty among the great thrones of western europe and to pay off some old scores of personal indignity put upon him by the czar  the czar fell into all the mistakes that a man could emperor by divine right he had done his best to sting the selfesteem of the revolutionary emperor in paris by his language to the british ambassador about dividing the inheritance of the sick man he had quickened the suspicions of the english cabinet it is true the sick man will die said lord john russell but it may not be for twenty fifty or a hundred years to come when william iii and louis xiv signed their treaty for the partition of the spanish monarchy they first made sure that the death of the king was close at hand then the choice as agent at constantinople of the arrogant and unskilful menschikoff proved a dire misfortune finally the czar was fatally misled by his own ambassador in london brunnow reported that all the english liberals and economists were convinced that the notion of turkish reform was absurd that aberdeen had told him in accents of contempt and anger i hate the turks and that english views generally as to russian aggression and turkish interests had been sensibly modified all this was not untrue but it was not true enough to bear the inference that was drawn from it at st petersburg the deception was disastrous and brunnow was never forgiven for it302                       lord stratford de redcliffe  another obstacle to a pacific solution perhaps most formidable of them all was lord stratford de redcliffe the british ambassador at constantinople animated by a vehement antipathy to russia possessing almost sovereign ascendency at the porte believing that the turk might never meet a happier chance of having the battle out with his adversary once for all and justly confident that a policy of war would find hearty backers in the london cabinetin him the government had an agent who while seeming to follow instructions in the narrow letter baffled them in their spirit in the autumn of 1853 lord aberdeen wrote to graham i fear i must renounce the sanguine view i have hitherto taken of the eastern question for nothing can be more alarming than the present prospect i thought that we should have been able to conquer stratford but i begin to fear that the reverse will be the case and that he will succeed in defeating us although at our wits end clarendon and i are still labouring in the cause of peace but really to contend at once with the pride of the emperor the fanaticism of the turks and the dishonesty of stratford is almost a hopeless attempt303 this description when he saw it nearly forty years later seems to have struck mr gladstone as harsh though he agreed that the passage could hardly be omitted he confessed his surprise that lord aberdeen should have applied the word dishonesty to lord stratford he suggested the addition of a note that should recognise the general character of lord stratford and should point out that prejudice and passion by their blinding powers often produce in the mind effects like those proper to dishonesty304 perhaps we may find this a hard saying doubtless when he comes to praise and blame the political historian must make due allowance for his actors and charity is the grandest of illuminants still hard truth stands first and amiable analysis of the psychology of a diplomatic agent who lets loose a flood of mischief on mankind is by no means what interests us most about him why not call things by their right names305  in his private letters november stratford boldly exhibited his desire for war and declared that the war to be successful must be a very comprehensive war on the part of england and france well might the queen say to the prime minister that it had become a serious question whether they were justified in allowing lord stratford any longer to remain in a situation that enabled him to frustrate all the efforts of his government for peace yet here as many another time in these devious manoeuvres that fearful dilemma interposedinseparable in its many forms from all collective action whether in cabinet or party so fit to test to the very uttermost all the moral fortitude all the wisdom of a minister his sense of proportion his strength of will his prudent pliancy of judgment his power of balance his sure perception of the ruling fact the dilemma here is patent to recall lord stratford would be to lose lord palmerston and lord john to lose them would be to break up the government to break up the government would be to sunder the slender thread on which the chances of peace were hanging306 the thought in short of the highminded aberdeen striving against hope to play a steadfast and pacific part in a scene so sinister among actors of such equivocal or crooked purpose recalls nothing so much as the memorable picture long ago of maria theresa beset and baffled by her kaunitzes and thuguts catherines josephs great fredericks grand turks and wringing her hands over the consummation of an iniquitous policy to which the perversity of man and circumstance had driven her  as the proceedings in the cabinet dragged on through the winter new projects were mooted the ground was shifted to what lord stratford had called a comprehensive war upon russia some of the cabinet began to aim at a transformation of the policy it was suggested that the moment should be seized to obtain not merely the observance by russia of her treaty obligations to turkey but a revision and modification of the treaties in turkish interests this is the wellknown way in which ever since the world called civilised began the area of conflict is widened if one plea is eluded or is satisfied another is found and so the peacemakers are at each step checkmated by the warmakers the powers of central europe were immovable with motives interests designs each of their own austria had reasons of irresistible force for keeping peace with russia a single victory of russia in austrian poland would enable her to march direct upon vienna austria had no secure alliance with prussia on the contrary her german rival opposed her on this question and was incessantly canvassing the smaller states against her in respect to it the french emperor was said to be revolving a plan for bribing austria out of northern italy by the gift of moldavia and wallachia all was intricate and tortuous the view in downing street soon expanded to this that it would be a shame to england and to france unless the czar were made not only to abandon his demands and to evacuate the principalities but also to renounce some of the stipulations in former treaties on which his present arrogant pretensions had been formed in the future the guarantees for the christian races should be sought in a treaty not between sultan and czar but between the sultan and the five powers                             british opinion  men in the cabinet and men out of it some with ardour others with acquiescence approved of war for different reasons interchangeable in controversial value and cumulative in effect some believed and more pretended to believe that turkey abounded in the elements and energies of selfreform and insisted that she should have the chance others were moved by vague general sympathy with a weak power assailed by a strong one and that one moreover the same tyrannous strength that held an iron heel on the neck of prostrate poland that only a few years before had despatched her legions to help austria against the rising for freedom and national right in hungary that urged intolerable demands upon the sultan for the surrender of the hungarian refugees others again counted the power of russia already exorbitant and saw in its extension peril to europe and mischief to the interests of england russia on the danube they said means russia on the indus russia at constantinople would mean a complete revolution in the balance of power in the mediterranean and to an alarmed vision a russia that had only crossed the pruth was as menacing as if her cossacks were already encamped in permanence upon the shores of the bosphorus  along with the anxieties of the eastern question ministers were divided upon the subject of parliamentary reform some including the prime minister went with lord john russell in desiring to push a reform bill others especially palmerston were strongly adverse mr gladstone mainly followed the head of the government but he was still a conservative and still member for a tory constituency and he followed his leader rather mechanically and without enthusiasm lord palmerston was suspected by some of his colleagues of raising the warcry in hopes of drowning the demand for reform in the middle of december 1853 he resigned upon reform307 but nine days later he withdrew his resignation and returned in the interval news of the russian attack on the turkish fleet at sinope november 30 had arrivedan attack justified by precedent and the rule of war but public feeling in england had risen to fever the french emperor in exacting and peremptory language had declared that if england did not take joint action with him in the black sea he would either act alone or else bring his fleet home the british cabinet yielded and came to the cardinal decision dec 22 to enter the black sea i was rather stunned gladstone wrote to sidney herbert next day by yesterdays cabinet i have scarcely got my breath again i told lord aberdeen that i had had wishes that palmerston were back again on account of the eastern question  here is a glimpse of this time        nov 23 53cabinet reform discussed largely amicably and      satisfactorily on the whole dec 16hawarden off at 9 am      astounded by a note from a gordon palmerston had resigned the      day before after dinner went to the admiralty 10½1½ where lord      aberdeen newcastle graham and i went over the late events and      went over the course for tomorrows cabinet dec 21called on

promoted to sit by the queen at dinner she was most      gracious and above all so thoroughly natural                       the decision of december 22  on the decision of dec 22 sir charles wood says       we had then a long discussion on the question of occupying the      black sea as proposed by france and it seemed to me to be such a      tissue of confusions that i advocated the simple course of doing      so gladstone could not be persuaded to agree to this in spite of      a strong argument of newcastles gladstones objection being to      our being hampered by any engagement his scheme was that our      occupying the black sea was to be made dependent in the first      place on the turks having acceded to the vienna proposals or at      any rate to their agreeing to be bound by any basis of peace on      which the english and french governments agreed newcastle and i      said we thought this would bind us much more to the turks than if      we occupied the black sea as part of our own measures adopted for      our own purposes and without any engagement to the turks under      which we should be if they accepted our conditions gladstone said      he could be no party to unconditional occupation so it ended in      our telling france that we would occupy the black sea that is      prevent the passage of any ships or munitions of war by the      russians but that we trusted she would join us in enforcing the      above condition on the turks if they agreed then we were to      occupy the black sea if they did not we were to reconsider the      question and then determine what to do clarendon saw walewski      who was quite satisfied  by the middle of february war was certain mr gladstone wrote an account of a conversation that he had at this time with lord aberdeen       feb 22lord aberdeen sent for me today and informed me that      lord palmerston had been with him to say that he had made up his      mind to vote for putting off without entering into the question of      its merits the consideration of the reform bill for the present      year conversation on reform308       he then asked me whether i did not think that he might himself      withdraw from office when we came to the declaration of war all      along he had been acting against his feelings but still      defensively he did not think that he could regard the offensive in      the same light and was disposed to retire i said that a      defensive war might involve offensive operations and that a      declaration of war placed the case on no new ground of principle      it did not make the quarrel but merely announced it notifying to      the world of itself justifiable a certain state of facts which      would have arrived he said all wars were called or pretended to be      defensive i said that if the war was untruly so called then our      position was false but that the war did not become less defensive      from our declaring it or from our entering upon offensive      operations to retire therefore upon such a declaration would be      to retire upon no ground warrantable and conceivable by reason it      would not be standing on a principle whereas any man would require      a distinct principle to justify him in giving up at this moment the      service of the crown he asked how could he bring himself to fight      for the turks i said we were not fighting for the turks but we      were warning russia off the forbidden ground that if indeed we      undertook to put down the christians under turkish rule by force      then we should be fighting for the turks but to this i for one      could be no party he said if i saw a way for him to get out he      hoped i would mention it to him i replied that my own views of war      so much agreed with his and i felt such a horror of bloodshed      that i had thought the matter over incessantly for myself we      stand i said upon the ground that the emperor has invaded      countries not his own inflicted wrong on turkey and what i feel      much more most cruel wrong on the wretched inhabitants of the      principalities that war had ensued and was raging with all its      horrors that we had procured for the emperor an offer of      honourable terms of peace which he had refused that we were not      going to extend the conflagration but i had to correct myself as      to the baltic but to apply more power for its extinction and      this i hoped in conjunction with all the great powers of europe      that i for one could not shoulder the musket against the      christian subjects of the sultan and must there take my stand      not even i had already told him if he agreed to such a course      could i bind myself to follow him in it he said granville and      wood had spoken to him in the same sense i added that s herbert      and graham probably would adhere perhaps argyll and molesworth      and even others might be added                         lord aberdeens misgivings       ellice had been with him and told him that j russell and      palmerston were preparing to contend for his place ellice himself      deprecating lord aberdeens retirement anticipated that if it took      place lord palmerston would get the best of it and drive lord john      out of the field by means of his war popularity though lord john      had made the speech of friday to put himself up in this point of      view with the country       in consequence of what i had said to him about newcastle he      aberdeen had watched him and had told the queen to look to him      as her minister at some period or other which though afraid of      him as well as of me about church matters she was prepared to      do i said i had not changed my opinion of newcastle as he had done      of lord john russell but i had been disappointed and pained at the      recent course of his opinions about the matter of the war at my      house last wednesday he newcastle declared openly for putting      down by force the christians of european turkey yes lord aberdeen      replied but he thought him the description of man who would      discharge well the duties of that office in this i agree309  a few days later march 3 lord john russell by way of appeasing aberdeens incessant selfreproach told him that the only course that could have prevented war would have been to counsel the turks to acquiesce and not to allow the british fleet to quit malta but that was a course lord john continued to which lansdowne palmerston clarendon newcastle and i would not have consented so that you would only have broken up your government if you had insisted upon it then the speaker added his belief that the czar even after the turks acquiescence and submission if we could have secured so much would have given the sultan six months respite and no more none of these arguments ever eased the mind of lord aberdeen even in his last interview with the departing ambassador of the czar he told him how bitterly he regretted first the original despatch of the fleet from malta to besika bay july 1853 and second that he had not sent lord granville to st petersburg immediately on the failure of menschikoff at constantinople may 1853 in order to carry on personal negotiations with the emperor310  an ultimatum demanding the evacuation of the principalities was despatched to st petersburg by england and france the czar kept a haughty silence and at the end of march war was declared in the event the principalities were evacuated a couple of months later but the state of war continued on september 14 english french and turkish troops disembarked on the shores of the crimea and on the 20th of the month was fought the battle of the alma i cannot help repeating to you mr gladstone wrote to lord palmerston oct 4 1854 which i hope you will forgive the thanks i offered at an earlier period for the manner in which you urgedwhen we were amidst many temptations to far more embarrassing and less effective proceedingsthe duty of concentrating our strokes upon the heart and centre of the war at sebastopol311 in the same month bright wrote the solid wise and noble letter that brought him so much obloquy then and stands as one of the memorials of his fame now312 mr gladstone wrote to his brother robertson upon it       nov 7 1854i thought brights letter both an able and a manly      one and though i cannot go his lengths i respect and sympathise      with the spirit in which it originated i think he should draw a      distinction between petty meddlings of our own or interferences      for selfish purposes and an operation like this which really is in      support of the public law of europe i agree with him in some of      the retrospective part of his letter  then came the dark days of the crimean winter                          did the cabinet drift  in his very deliberate vindication of the policy of the crimean war composed in 1887 mr gladstone warmly denies either that the ship of state drifted instead of being steered or that the cabinet was in continual conflict with itself at successive stages of the negotiation313 he had witnessed he declares much more of sharp or warm argument in every other of the seven cabinets to which he belonged314 in 1881 he said to the present writer as a member of the aberdeen cabinet i never can admit that divided opinions in that cabinet led to hesitating action or brought on the war i do not mean that all were always and on all points of the same mind but i have known much sharper divisions in a cabinet that has worked a great question honourably and energetically and i should confidently say whether the negotiations were well or ill conducted that considering their great difficulty they were worked with little and not much conflict it must be borne in mind that lord aberdeen subsequently developed opinions that were widely severed from those that had guided us but these never appeared in the cabinet or at the time still he admits that this practical harmony could much less truly be affirmed of the four ministers especially concerned with foreign affairs315 that is to say of the only ministers whose discussions mattered it is certainly impossible to contend that aberdeen was not in pretty continual conflict strong and marked though not heated with these three main coadjutors whether it be true to say that the cabinet drifted depends on the precise meaning of a word it is undoubtedly true that it steered a course bringing the ship into waters that the captain most eagerly wished to avoid and each tack carried it farther away from the expected haven winds and waves were too many for them we may perhaps agree with mr gladstone that as it was feeling rather than argument that raised the crimean war into popularity so it is feeling and not argument that has plunged it into the abyss of odium when we come to a period twenty years after this war was over we shall see that mr gladstone found out how little had time changed the public temper how little had events taught their lesson  footnotes  296 in 1772 burke had said that he did not wish well to turkey for any people but the turks situated as they are would have been cultivated in three hundred years yet they grow more gross in the very native soil of civility and refinement but he did not expect to live to

if having undertaken this task and      claiming credit for fulfilling it they leave it unfulfilledj      s mill   the last waves of the tide of reform that had been flowing for a score of years now at length reached the two ancient universities the tractarian revival with all its intense preoccupations had given the antique oxford a respite but the hour struck and the final effort of the expiring whigs in their closing days of power was the summons to oxford and cambridge to set their houses in order oxford had been turned into the battlefield on which contending parties in the church had at her expense fought for mastery the result was curious the nature of the theological struggle by quickening mind within the university had roused new forces the antagonism between anglocatholic and puritan helped as it had done two centuries before to breed the latitudinarian a rising school in the sphere of thought and criticism rapidly made themselves an active party in the sphere of affairs and mr gladstone found himself forced to do the work of the very liberalism which his own theological leaders and allies had first organised themselves to beat down and extinguish                      first oxford commission  in 1850 lord john russell worked upon by a persevering minority in oxford startled the house of commons delighted the liberals and angered and dismayed the authorities of the powerful corporations thus impugned by the announcement of a commission under the crown to inquire into their discipline state and revenues and to report whether any action by crown and parliament could further promote the interests of religion and sound learning in these venerable shrines this was the first step in a long journey towards the nationalisation of the universities and the disestablishment of the church of england in what seemed the best fortified of all her strongholds  after elaborate correspondence with both liberal and tory sections in oxford mr gladstone rose in his place and denounced the proposed commission as probably against the law and certainly odious in the eye of the constitution he undertook to tear in tatters the various modern precedents advanced by the government for their purpose scouted the alleged visitorial power of the crown insisted that it would blight future munificence argued that defective instruction with freedom and selfgovernment would in the choice of evils be better than the most perfect mechanism secured by parliamentary interference admitted that what the universities had done for learning was perhaps less than it might have been but they had done as much as answered the circumstances and exigencies of the country when we looked at the lawyers the divines the statesmen of england even if some might judge them inferior in mere scholastic and technical acquirements why need we be ashamed of the cradles in which they were mainly nurtured he closed with a triumphant and moving reference to peel dead a fortnight before the most distinguished son of oxford in the present century and beyond all other men the high representative and the true type of the genius of the british house of commons316 in truth no worse case was ever more strongly argued and fortunately the speech is to be recorded as the last manifesto on a high theme and on a broad scale of that toryism from which this wonderful pilgrim had started on his shining progress it is just to add that the party in oxford who resisted the commission was also the party most opposed to mr gladstone and further that the view of the crown having no right to issue such a commission in invitos was shared with him by sir robert peel317 of this debate arthur stanley a strong supporter of the measure tells us the ministerial speeches were very feeble gladstones was very powerful he said in the most effective manner anything which could be said against the commission his allusion to peel was very touching and the house responded to it by profound and sympathetic silence heywoods closing speech was happily drowned in the roar of divide so that nothing could be heard save the name of cardinal wolsey thrice repeated318 the final division was taken on the question of the adjournment when the government had a majority of 22 july 18 1850                                      ii                           report of the commission  in oxford the party of organised torpor did not yield without a struggle they were clamorous on the sanctity of property contemptuous of the doctrine of the rights of parliament over national domains and protestant collegians subsisting on ancient roman catholic endowments edified the world on the iniquity of setting aside the pious founder they submitted an elaborate case to the most eminent counsel of the day and counsel advised that the commission was not constitutional not legal and not such as the members of the university were bound to obey the question of duty apart from legal obligation the lawyers did not answer but they suggested that a petition might be addressed to the crown praying that the instrument might be cancelled the petition was duly prepared and duly made no difference many of the academic authorities were recalcitrant but this made no difference either nor did the bishop of exeters hot declaration that the proceeding had no parallel since the fatal attempt of king james ii to subject the colleges to his unhallowed control the commissioners of whom tait and jeune seem to have been the leading spirits with stanley and mr goldwin smith for secretaries conducted their operations with tact good sense and zeal at the end of two years april 1852 the inquiry was completed and the report made publicone of the high landmarks in the history of our modern english life and growth when you consider stanley said to jowett the den of lions through which the raw material had to be dragged much will be excused in fact the great work was to finish it at all there is a harsh unfriendly tone about the whole which ought under better circumstances to have been avoided but which may perhaps have the advantage of propitiating the radicals319  mr gladstone thought it one of the ablest productions submitted in his recollection to parliament but the proposals of change too manifold and complicated the evidence he found more moderate and less sweeping in tone than the report but it only deepened his conviction of the necessity of important and above all early changes he did not cease urging his friends at oxford to make use of this golden opportunity for reforming the university from within and warning them that delay would be dearly purchased320 gladstones connection with oxford said sir george lewis is now exercising a singular influence upon the politics of the university most of his high church supporters stick to him and insomuch as it is difficult to struggle against the current he is liberalising them instead of their torifying him he is giving them a push forwards instead of their giving him a pull backwards321  the originators of the commission were no longer in office but things had gone too far for their successors to burke what had been done322 the derby government put into the queens speech in november 1852 a paragraph informing parliament that the universities had been invited to examine the recommendations of the report after a years time had been given them to consider it became the duty of the aberdeen government to frame a bill the charge fell upon mr gladstone as member for oxford and in the late autumn of 1853 he set to work in none of the enterprises of his life was he more industrious or energetic before the middle of december he forwarded to lord john russell what he called a rude draft but the rude draft contained the kernel of the plan that was ultimately carried with a suggestion even of the names of the commissioners to whom operations were to be confided it is marvellous to me wrote dr jeune to him dec 21 1853 how you can give attention so minute to university affairs at such a crisis do great things become to great men from the force of habit what their ordinary cares are to ordinary persons as he began so he advanced listening to everybody arguing with everybody flexible persistent clear practical fervid unconquerable i fear lord john russell wrote to him march 27 my mind is exclusively occupied with the war and the reform bill and yours with university reform perhaps unluckily for the country this was true my whole heart is in the oxford bill mr gladstone writes march 29 it is my consolation under the pain with which i view the character my office the exchequer is assuming under the circumstances of war gladstone has been surprising everybody here writes a conspicuous high churchman from oxford by the ubiquity of his correspondence threefourths of the colleges have been in communication with him on various parts of the bill more or less affecting themselves he answers everybody by return of post fully and at length quite entering into their case and showing the greatest acquaintance with it323 as one of your burgesses he told them i stand upon the line that divides oxford from the outer world and as a sentinel i cry out to tell what i see from that position what he saw was that if this bill were thrown out no other half so favourable would ever again be brought in                             the bill framed  the scheme accepted by the cabinet was in essentials mr gladstones own jowett at the earliest stage sent him a comprehensive plan and soon after saw lord john jan 6 i must own writes the latter to gladstone i was much struck by the clearness and completeness of his views the difference between jowetts plan and mr gladstones was on the highly important point of machinery jowett who all his life had a weakness for getting and keeping authority into his own hands or the hands of those whom he could influence contended that after parliament had settled principles oxford itself could be trusted to settle details far better than a little body of great personages from outside unacquainted with special wants and special interests mr gladstone on the other hand invented the idea of an executive commission with statutory powers the two plans were printed and circulated and the balance of opinion in the cabinet went decisively for mr gladstones scheme the discussion between him and jowett ranging over the whole field of the bill was maintained until its actual production in many interviews and much correspondence in drawing the clauses mr gladstone received the help of bethell the solicitorgeneral at whose suggestion phillimore and thring were called in for further aid in what was undoubtedly a task of exceptional difficulty the process brought into clearer light the truth discerned by mr gladstone from the first that the enormous number of diverse institutions that had grown up in oxford made resort to what he called sublegislation inevitable that is to say they were too complex for parliament and could only be dealt with by delegation to executive act  it is untrue to say that oxford as a place of education had no influence on the mind of the country it had immense influence but that influence was exactly what it ought not to have been instead of stimulating it checked instead of expanding it stereotyped even for the church it had failed to bring unity for it was from oxford that the opinions had sprung that seemed to be rending the church in twain the regeneration introduced by this momentous measure has been overlaid by the strata of subsequent reforms enough to say that the objects obtained were the deposition of the fossils and drones and a renovated constitution on the representative principle for the governing body the wakening of a huge mass of sleeping endowments the bestowal of college emoluments only on excellence tested by competition and associated with active duties the reorganisation or recreation of professorial teaching the removal of local preferences and restrictions beyond these aspects of reform mr gladstone was eager for the proposed right to establish private halls as a change calculated to extend the numbers and strength of the university and as settling the much disputed question whether the scale of living could not be reduced and university education brought within reach of classes of moderate means these hopes proved to be exaggerated but they illustrate his constant and lifelong interest in the widest possible diffusion of all good things in the world from university training down to a cooks tour  mr gladstone seems to have pressed his draftsmen hard as he sometimes did bethell returning to him the disjecta membra of this unfortunate bill tells him that he is too deeply attached to him to care for a few marks of impatience and adds write a few kind words to phillimore for he really loves you and feels this matter deeply oxford scene of so many agitations for a score of years past was once more seized with consternation stupefaction enthusiasm a few private copies of the draft were sent down from london for criticism on the vicechancellor it left an impression of sorrow and sad anticipations it opened deplorable prospects for the university for the church for religion for righteousness the dean of christ church thought it not merely inexpedient but unjust and tyrannical jowett on the other hand was convinced that it must satisfy all reasonable reformers and added emphatically in writing to mr gladstone it is to yourself and lord john that the university will be indebted for the greatest boon that it has ever received after the introduction of the bill by lord john russell the obscurantists made a final effort to call down one of their old pelting hailstorms a petition against the bill was submitted to convocation happily it passed by a majority of no more than two                             second reading  at length the blessed day of the second reading came the ever zealous arthur stanley was present a superb speech from gladstone he records in which for the first time all the arguments from our report were worked up in the most effective manner he vainly endeavoured to reconcile his present with his former position but with this exception i listened to his speech with the greatest delight to behold ones old enemies slaughtered before ones face with the most irresistible weapons was quite intoxicating one great charm of his speaking is its exceeding goodhumour there is great vehemence but no bitterness324 an excellent criticism of many perhaps most of his speeches  it must ever be borne in mind mr gladstone wrote to lord john at the outset with respect to our old universities that history law and usage with them form such a manifold diversified and complex mass that it is not one subject but a world of subjects that we have to deal with in approaching them and he pointed out that if any clever lawyer such as butt or cairns were employed to oppose the bill systematically debate would run to such lengths as to make it hopeless this was a point of view that mr gladstones more exacting and abstract critics now and many another time forgot they forgot that whatever else you may say of a bill after all it is a thing that is to be carried through parliament everybody had views of his own a characteristic illustration of mr gladstones temper in the arduous work of practical legislation to which so much of the energies of his life was devoted is worth giving here from a letter of this date to burgon of oriel nobody answers better to the rare combination in bacons words of a glorious nature that doth put life into business with a solid and sober nature that hath as much of the ballast as of the sail       sometimes it may be necessary in dealing with a very ancient      institution to make terms as it were between such an institution      and the actual spirit of the age this may be in certain      circumstances a necessary but it can never be a satisfactory      process it is driving a bargain and somewhat of a wretched      bargain but i really do not find or feel that this is the case now      before us in that case my view right or wrong is this that      oxford is far behind her duties or capabilities not because her      working men work so little but because so large a proportion of      her children do not work at all so large a proportion of her      resources remains practically dormant and her present constitution      is so illadapted to developing her real but latent powers what i      therefore anticipate is not the weakening of her distinctive      principles not the diminution of her labour already great that      she discharges for the church and for the land but a great      expansion a great invigoration a great increase of her numbers a      still greater increase of her moral force and of her hold upon the      heart and mind of the country                          admission of dissenters  pusey seems to have talked of the university as ruined and overthrown by a parricidal hand oxford would be lost to the church she would have to take refuge in colleges away from the university oxford had now received its deathblow from mr gladstone and the government to which he belonged and he could no longer support at election times the worker of such evil and must return to that inactivity in things political from which only love and confidence for mr gladstone had roused him personally the good man adds i must always love you to pusey and to all who poured reproach upon him from this side mr gladstone replied with inexhaustible patience he never denied that parliamentary intervention was an evil but he submitted to it in order to avert greater evil if the church of england has not strength enough to keep upright this will soon appear in the troubles of emancipated oxford if she has it will come out to the joy of us all in the immensely augmented energy and power of the university for good if germanism and arnoldism are now to carry the day at oxford i mean supposing the bill is carried into law they will carry it fairly let them win and wear her god forbid however but if she has a heart true to the faith her hand will be stronger ten times over than it has been heretofore in doing battle nor am i saddened by the pamphlet of a certain mr  which i have been reading today it has more violence than venom and also much more violence than strength i often feel how hard it is on divines to be accused of treachery and baseness because they do not like us get it every day and so become casehardened against it  in parliament the craft laboured heavily in crossseas i have never known says its pilot a measure so foolishly discussed in committee nor was oil cast upon the waters by its friends by the end of may mr gladstone and lord john saw that they must take in canvas at this point a new storm broke it was impossible that a measure on such a subject could fail to awaken the ever ready quarrel between the two camps into which the english establishment for so many generations has so unhappily divided the life of the nation from the first the protestant dissenters had been extremely sore at the absence from the bill of any provision for their admission to the remodelled university bright the most illustrious of them told the house of commons that he did not care whether so pusillanimous and tinkering an affair as this was passed or not dissenters he said with scorn are expected always to manifest too much of those inestimable qualities which are spoken of in the epistle to the corinthians to hope all things to believe all things and to endure all things  more discredit than he deserved fell upon mr gladstone for this obnoxious defect in announcing the commission of inquiry four years before lord john as prime minister had expressly said that the improvement of the universities should be treated as a subject by itself and that the admission of dissenters ought to be reserved for future and separate consideration writing to mr gladstone jan 1854 he said i do not want to stir the question in this bill but he would support a proposal in a separate bill by which the halls might be the means of admitting dissenters mr gladstone himself professed to take no strong line either way but in a parliamentary case of this kind to take no line is not materially different from a line in effect unfriendly arthur stanley pressed him as hard as he could justice to the university said mr gladstone in reply demands that it should be allowed to consider the question for itself indeed while i believe that the admission of dissenters without the breaking up of the religious teaching and the government of the university would be a great good i am also of opinion that to give effect to that measure by forcible intervention of parliament would be a great evil whether it is an evil that must some day or other be encountered the time has not yet i think arrived for determining the letter concludes with a remark of curious bearing upon the temper of that age the very words he says to stanley which you have let fall upon your paperroman catholicsused in this connection were enough to burn it through and through considering we have a parliament which were the measure of 1829 not law at this moment would i think probably refuse to make it law there is no reason to think this an erroneous view perhaps it would not be extravagant even today  what mr gladstone called the evil of parliamentary interference did not tarry and on the report stage of the bill a clause removing the theological test at matriculation was carried june 22 against the government by ninetyone the size of the majority and the diversified material of which it was composed left the government no option but to yield parliament having now unhappily determined to legislate upon the subject mr gladstone writes to the provost of oriel it seems to me i may add it seems to my colleagues best for the interests of the university that we should now make some endeavour to settle the whole question and so preclude if we can any pretext for renewed agitation the basis of that settlement he went on in a formula which he tenaciously reiterated to all his correspondents and which is a landmark in the long history of his dealing with the question should be that the whole teaching and governing function in the university and in the colleges halls and private halls should be retained as now in the church of england but that everything outside the governing and teaching functions whether in the way of degrees honours or emoluments should be left open the new clause he described as one of those incomplete arrangements that seem to suit the practical habits of this country and which by taking the edge off a matter of complaint are often found virtually to dispose of it for a length of time in the end the church of england test was removed not only on admission to the university but from the bachelors degree tests in other forms remained as we shall in good time perceive we have proceeded mr gladstone wrote in the full belief that the means of applying a church test to fellowships in colleges are clear and ample so they were and so remained until seventeen years later in the life of an administration of his own the obnoxious fetter was struck off                         mr disraeli on the bill  the debates did not close without at least one characteristic masterpiece from mr disraeli he had not taken a division on the second reading but he executed with entire gravity all the regulation manoeuvres of opposition and his appearance on the page of hansard relieves a dull discussion if government he asked could defer a reform of the constitution referring to the withdrawal of lord johns bill why should they hurry to reform the universities the talk about the erudite professors of germany as so superior to oxford was nonsense the great men of germany became professors only because they could not become members of parliament we on the contrary are a nation of action and you may depend upon it that though you may give an oxford professor two thousand a year instead of two hundred still ambition in england will look to public life and to the house of commons and not to professors chairs the moment the revolution of 1848 gave the german professors a chance see how they rushed into political conventions and grasped administrative offices again the principle of the bill was the laying of an unhallowed hand upon the ark of the universities and wore in effect the hideous aspect of the nevertobeforgotten appropriation clause if he were asked whether he would rather have oxford free with all its imperfections or an oxford without imperfections but under the control of the government he would reply give me oxford free and independent with all its anomalies and imperfections an excellently worded but amusingly irrelevant passage about voltaire and rousseau and the land that was enlightened by the one and inflamed by the other brought the curious performance to a solemn close high fantastic trifling of this sort though it may divert a later generation to whose legislative bills it can do no harm helps to explain the deep disfavour with which disraeli was regarded by his severe and strenuous opponent  the admiration of posterity dr jeune wrote to mr gladstone would be greatly increased if men hereafter could know what wisdom what firmness what temper what labour your success has required more than this it was notorious that mr gladstone was bravely risking his seat this side of the matter jeune made plain to him had i foreseen in 1847 replied mr gladstone broadstairs aug 26 1854 that church controversies which i then hoped were on the decline were really about to assume a fiercer glare and a wider range than they had done before i should not have been presumptuous enough to face the contingencies of such a seat at such a time as things stood he was bound to hold on with dauntless confidence that never failed him he was convinced that no long time would suffice to scatter the bugbears and the bill would be nothing but a source of strength to any one standing in reputed connection with it to dr jeune when the battle was over he expresses his warm sense of the great encouragement and solid advantage which at every stage he had derived from his singularly ready and able help to jowett and goldwin smith he acknowledged a hardly lower degree of obligation the last twenty years wrote a shrewd and expert sage in 1866 have seen more improvement in the temper and teaching of oxford than the three centuries since the reformation this has undoubtedly been vastly promoted by the reform bill of 1854 or at least by one enactment in it the abolition of close fellowships which has done more for us than all the other enactments of the measure put together325 the indirect effects says the same writer in words of pregnant praise in stimulating the spirit of improvement among us have been no less important than the specific reforms enacted by it326                                     iii                         another farreaching change  another of the most farreaching changes of this era of reform affected the civil service j s mill then himself an official at the india house did not hesitate to hail the plan of throwing open the civil service to competition as one of the greatest improvements in public affairs ever proposed by a government on the system then reigning civil employment under the crown was in all the offices the result of patronage though in some and those not the more important of them nominees were partially tested by qualifying examination and periods of probation the eminent men who held what were called the staff appointments in the servicethe merivales taylors farrerswere introduced from without with the obvious implication that either the civil service trained up within its own ranks a poor breed or else that the meritorious men were discouraged and kept back by the sight of prizes falling to outsiders mr gladstone was not slow to point out that the existing system if it brought eminent men in had driven men like manning and spedding out what patronage meant is forcibly described in a private memorandum of a leading reformer preserved by mr gladstone among his papers on this subject the existing corps of civil servants says the writer do not like the new plan because the introduction of welleducated active men will force them to bestir themselves and because they cannot hope to get their own illeducated sons appointed under the new system the old established political families habitually batten on the public patronagetheir sons legitimate and illegitimate their relatives and dependents of every degree are provided for by the score besides the adventuring disreputable class of members of parliament who make god knows what use of the patronage a large number of borough members are mainly dependent upon it for their seats what for instance are the members to do who have been sent down by the patronage secretary to contest boroughs in the interest of the government and who are pledged twenty deep to their constituents  the foreign office had undergone some years before a thorough reconstruction by lord palmerston who though very cool to constitutional reform was assiduous and exacting in the forms of public business not least so in the vital matter of a strong plain bold handwriting revision had been attempted in various departments before mr gladstone went to the exchequer and a spirit of improvement was in the air lowe beginning his official career as one of the secretaries of the board of control had procured the insertion in the india bill of 1853 of a provision throwing open the great service of india to competition for all britishborn subjects and he was a vigorous advocate of a general extension of the principle327 it was the conditions common to all the public establishments that called for revision and the foundations for reform were laid in a report by northcote and sir charles trevelyan november 1853 prepared for mr gladstone at his request recommending two propositions so familiarised to us today as to seem like primordial elements of the british constitution one was that access to the public service should be through the door of a competitive examination the other that for conducting these examinations a central board should be constituted the effect of such a change has been enormous not only on the efficiency of the service but on the education of the country and by a thousand indirect influences raising and strengthening the social feeling for the immortal maxim that the career should be open to the talents the lazy doctrine that men are much of a muchness gave way to a higher respect for merit and to more effectual standards of competency                           old system and new  the reform was not achieved without a battle the whole case was argued by mr gladstone in a letter to lord john russell of incomparable trenchancy and force one of the best specimens of the writer at his best and only not worth reproducing here because the case has long been finished328 lord john jan 20 wrote to him curtly in reply i hope no change will be made and i certainly must protest against it in reply to even a second assault he remained quite unconvinced at present he said the queen appointed the ministers and the ministers the subordinates in future the board of examiners would be in the place of the queen our institutions would be as nearly republican as possible and the new spirit of the public offices would not be loyalty but republicanism as one of lord johns kindred spirits declared the more the civil service is recruited from the lower classes the less will it be sought after by the higher until at last the aristocracy will be altogether dissociated from the permanent civil service of the country how could the country go on with a democratic civil service by the side of an aristocratic legislature329 this was just the spirit that mr gladstone loathed to graham he wrote jan 3 1854 i do not want any pledges as to details what i seek is your countenance and favour in an endeavour to introduce to the cabinet a proposal that we should give our sanction to the principle that in every case where a satisfactory test of a defined and palpable nature can be furnished the public service shall be laid open to personal merit this is my contribution to parliamentary reform on january 26 1854 the cabinet was chiefly occupied by mr gladstones proposition and after a long discussion his plan was adopted when reformers more ardent than accurate insisted in later years that it was the aristocracy who kept patronage mr gladstone reminded the house no cabinet could have been more aristocratically composed than that over which lord aberdeen presided i myself was the only one of fifteen noblemen and gentlemen who composed it who could not fairly be said to belong to that class yet it was this cabinet that conceived and matured a plan for the surrender of all its patronage there for the moment in spite of all his vigour and resolution the reform was arrested time did not change him in november he wrote to trevelyan my own opinions are more and more in favour of the plan of competition i do not mean that they can be more in its favour as a principle than they were when i invited you and northcote to write the report which has lit up the flame but more and more do the incidental evils seem curable and the difficulties removable as the crimean war went on the usual cry for administrative reform was raised and mr gladstone never made a more terse pithy and incontrovertible speech than his defence for an open civil service in the summer of 1855330  for this branch of reform too the inspiration had proceeded from oxford two of the foremost champions of the change had been templeafterwards archbishop of canterburyand jowett the latter was described by mr gladstone to graham as being as handy a workman as you shall readily find and in the beginning of 1855 he proposed to these two reformers that they should take the salaried office of examiners under the civil service scheme much of his confident expectation of good he told them was built upon their cooperation in all his proceedings on this subject mr gladstone showed in strong light in how unique a degree he combined a profound democratic instinct with the spirit of good government the instinct of popular equality along with the scientific spirit of the enlightened bureaucrat  footnotes  316 july 18 1850  317 letter to bishop davidson june 11 1891  318 life i p 420  319 life of

the      almighty to impose upon the ambition and lust of conquest that are      inherent in so many nations there is pomp and circumstance there      is glory and excitement about war which notwithstanding the      miseries it entails invests it with charms in the eyes of the      community and tends to blind men to those evils to a fearful and      dangerous degree the necessity of meeting from year to year the      expenditure which it entails is a salutary and wholesome check      making them feel what they are about and making them measure the      cost of the benefit upon which they may calculategladstone   the finance of 1854 offered nothing more original or ingenious than bluntly doubling the income tax from seven pence to fourteen pence and raising the duties on spirits sugar and malt the draught was administered in two doses first in a provisional budget for half a year march 6 next in a completed scheme two months later during the interval the chancellor of the exchequer was exposed to much criticism alike from city experts and plain men the plans of 1853 had in the main proved a remarkable success but they were not without weak points reductions in the duties of customs excise and stamps had all been followed by increase in their proceeds but the succession duty brought in no more than a fraction of the estimated sumthe only time mr gladstone observes in which he knew the excellent department concerned to have fallen into such an error the proposal for conversion proved under circumstances already described to have no attraction for the fundholder the operation on the south sea stock was worse than a failure for it made the exchequer in order to pay off eight millions at par raise a larger sum at three and a half per cent and at three per cent in a stock standing at 87331 all this brought loudish complaints from the money market the men at the clubs talked of the discredit into which gladstone had fallen as a financier and even persons not unfriendly to him spoke of him as rash obstinate and injudicious he was declared to have destroyed his prestige and overthrown his authority332                         powerful selfdefence  this roused all the slumbering warrior in him and when the time came may 8 in a speech three and a half hours long he threw his detractors into a depth of confusion that might have satisfied the psalmist himself peremptorily he brushed aside the apology of his assailants for not challenging him by a direct vote of want of confidence that such a vote would be awkward in a time of war on the contrary he said a case so momentous as the case of war is the very reason why you should show boldly whether you have confidence in our management of your finances or not if you disapprove the sooner i know it the better then he dashed into a close and elaborate defence in detail under all the heads of attackhis manner of dealing with the unfunded debt his abortive scheme of conversion his mode of charging deficiency bills this astonishing mass of dry and difficult matter was impressed in full significance upon the house not only by the orators own buoyant and energetic interest in the performance but by the sense which he awoke in his hearers that to exercise their attention and judgment upon the case before them was a binding debt imperatively due to themselves and to the country by men owning the high responsibility of their station this was the way in which he at all times strove to stir the selfrespect of the house of commons not sparing his critics a point or an argument he drove his case clean home with a vigour that made it seem as if the study of augustine and dante and the fathers were after all the best training for an intimate and triumphant mastery of the proper amount of gold to be kept at the bank the right interest on an exchequer bond and an exchequer bill and all the arcana of the public accounts333 even where their case had something in it he showed that they had taken the wrong points nor did he leave out the spice of the sarcasm that the house loves a peer had reproached him for the amount of his deficiency bills this peer had once himself for four years been chancellor of the exchequer my deficiency bills cried mr gladstone reached three millions and a half how much were the bills of the chancellor whom this figure shocks in his first year they were four millions and a half in the second almost the same in the third more than five and a quarter in the fourth nearly five millions and a half disraeli and others pretended that they had foreseen the failure of the conversion mr gladstone proved that as matter of recorded fact they had done nothing of the sort this is the way in which mythical history arises an event happens without attracting much notice subsequently it excites interest then people look back upon the time now passed and see things not as they are or were but through the haze of distancethey see them as they wish them to have been and what they wish them to have been they believe that they were  for this budget no genius only courage was needed but mr gladstone advanced in connection with it a doctrine that raised great questions moral political and economic and again illustrated that characteristic of his mind which always made some broad general principle a necessity of action all through 1854 and in a sense very often since parliament was agitated by mr gladstones bold proposition that the cost of war should be met by taxation at the time and not by loans to be paid back by another generation he did not advance his abstract doctrine without qualification this in truth mr gladstone hardly ever did and it was one of the reasons why he acquired a bad name for sophistry and worse men fastened on the general principle set out in all its breadth and with much emphasis they overlooked the lurking qualification and then were furiously provoked at having been taken in i do not know he wrote some years later to northcote where you find that i laid down any general maxim that all war supplies were to be raised by taxes i said in my speech of may 8 revised for hansard it was the duty and policy of the country to make in the first instance a great effort from its own resources the discussions of the time however seem to have turned on the unqualified construction while professing his veneration and respect for the memory of pitt he opened in all its breadth the question raised by pitts policy of loan loan loan the economic answer is open to more dispute than he then appeared to suppose but it was the political and moral reasons for meeting the demands of war by tax and not by loan that coloured his economic view the passage in which he set forth the grounds for his opinion has become a classic place in parliamentary discussion but it is only too likely for a long time to come to bear reproducing and i have taken it as a motto for this chapter his condemnation of loans absolutely if not relatively was emphatic the system of raising funds necessary for wars by loan practises wholesale systematic and continual deception upon the people the people do not really know what they are doing the consequences are adjourned into a far future i may as well here complete or correct this language by a further quotation from the letter to northcote to which i have already referred he is writing in 1862 on northcotes book on twenty years of finance i cannot refrain he says from paying you a sincere compliment first on the skill with which you have composed an eminently readable work on a dry subject and secondly on the tact founded in good feeling and the love of truth with which you have handled your materials throughout he then remarks on various points in the book and among the rest on this                           letters to northcote        allow me also to say that i think in your comparison of the effect      of taxes and loans you have looked p 262 too much to the effect      on labour at the moment capital and labour are in permanent      competition for the division of the fruits of production when in      years of war say twenty millions annually are provided by loan say      for three five or ten years then two consequences follow       1 an immense factitious stimulus is given to labour at the      timeand thus much more labour is brought into the market       2 when that stimulus is withdrawn an augmented quantity of labour      is left to compete in the market with a greatly diminished quantity      of capital       here is the story of the misery of great masses of the english      people after 1815 or at the least a material part of that story       i hold by the doctrine that war loans are in many ways a great      evil but i admit their necessity and in fact the budget of 1855      was handed over by me to sir george lewis and underwent in his      hands little alteration unless such as with the growing demands of      the war i should myself have had to make in it ie some not      very considerable enlargement  writing a second letter to northcote a few days later august 11 1862 he goes a little deeper into the subject       the general question of loans v taxes for war purposes is one of      the utmost interest but one that i have never seen worked out in      print but assuming as data the established principles of our      financial system and by no means denying the necessity of loans i      have not the least doubt that it is for the interest of labour as      opposed to capital that as large a share as possible of war      expenditure should be defrayed from taxes when war breaks out the      wages of labour on the whole have a tendency to rise and the      labour of the country is well able to bear some augmentation of      taxes the sums added to the public expenditure are likely at the      outset and for some time to be larger than the sums withdrawn      from commerce when war ends on the contrary a great mass of      persons are dismissed from public employment and flooding the      labour market reduce the rate of wages but again when war comes      it is quite certain that a large share of the war taxes will be      laid upon property and that in war property will bear a larger      share of our total taxation than in peace from this it seems to      follow at once that up to the point at which endurance is      practicable payment by wartaxes rather than by taxes in peace is      for the interest of the people at large i am not one of those who      think that our system of taxation taken as a whole is an      overliberal one towards them these observations are mere      contributions to a discussion and by no means pretend to dispose      of the question                                       ii                            dispute with the bank  in the autumn he had a sharp tussle with the bank of england and displayed a toughness stiffness and sustained anger that greatly astonished threadneedle street in the spring he had introduced a change in the mode of issuing deficiency bills limiting the quarterly amount to such a sum as would cover the maximum of dividends payable as known by long experience to be called for the bank held this to be illegal claimed the whole amount required along with balances actually in hand to cover the entire amount payable and asked him to take the opinion of the law officers the lawyers backed the chancellor of the exchequer then the bank took an opinion of their own their counsel kelly and palmer advised that the attorney and solicitor were wrong and recommended the bank to bring their grievance before the prime minister mr gladstone was righteously incensed at this refusal to abide by an opinion invited by the bank itself and by which if it had been adverse he would himself have been bound and then said bethell urging mr gladstone to stand to his guns its counsel call the bank a trustee for the public proh pudor what stuff lawyers will talk but tis their vocation mr gladstones letters were often prolix but nobody could be more terse and direct when occasion moved him and the proceedings of the lawyers with their high bank views and the equivocal faith of the directors in bringing fresh lawyers into the case at all provoked more than one stern and brief epistle the governor who was his private friend winced i do not study diplomacy in letters of this kind mr gladstone replied and there is no sort of doubt that i am very angry about the matter of the opinion but affected and sarcastic politeness is an instrument which in writing to you i should think it the worst taste and the worst feeling to employ i admire the old fashion according to which in english pugilism which however i do not admire the combatants shook hands before they fought only i think much time ought not to be spent upon such salutations when there is other work to do  in a letter to his wife seven years later mr gladstone says of this dispute mr arbuthnot told me today an observation of sir george lewiss when at the exchequer here speaking of my controversy with the bank in 1854 he said it is a pity gladstone puts so much heat so much irritability into business now i am as cool as a fish the worst of being as cool as a fish is that you never get great things done you effect no improvements and you carry no reforms against the lethargy or selfishness of men and the tyranny of old custom334  now also his attention was engaged by the controversies on currency that thrive so lustily in the atmosphere of the bank charter act and after much discussion with authorities both in lombard street and at the treasury without committal he sketched out at least one shadow of a project of his own he knew however that any great measure must be undertaken by a finance minister with a clear position and strong hands and he told graham that even if he saw his way distinctly to a plan he did not feel individually strong enough for the attempt nor was there time to reconstitute the savings bank finance to place the chancery and some other accounts on a right basis and to readjust the banking relations properly socalled between the bank and the state would be even more than a fair share of financial work for the session before the year was over he passed a bill for which he had laid before the cabinet elaborate argumentative supports removing a number of objections to the then existing system of dealing with the funds drawn from savings banks335  the year closed with an incident that created a considerable stir and might by misadventure have become memorable what has been truly called a warm and prolonged dispute336 arose out of mr gladstones removal of a certain official from his post in the department of woods and forests as lord aberdeen told the queen that he could not easily make the case intelligible it is not likely that i should succeed any better and we may as well leave the thick dust undisturbed enough to say that lord john russell thought the dismissal harsh that mr gladstone stood his ground against either the reversal of what he had done or any proceedings in parliament that might look like contrition but was willing to submit the points to the decision of colleagues that lord john would submit no point to colleagues affecting his personal honourto such degrees of heat can the quicksilver mount even in a cabinet thermometer if such quarrels of the great are painful there is some compensation in the firmness patience and benignity with which a man like lord aberdeen strove to appease them some of his colleagues actually thought that lord john would make this paltry affair a plea for resigning while others suspected that he might find a better excuse in the revival of convocation as it happened a graver occasion offered itself  footnotes  331 northcote financial policy p 242 buxton mr

parliament assembled on january 23 1855 mr roebuck on the first night of the session gave notice of a motion for a committee of inquiry lord john russell attended to the formal business and when the house was up went home accompanied by sir charles wood nothing of consequence passed between the two colleagues and no word was said to wood in the direction of withdrawal the same evening as the prime minister was sitting in his drawingroom a red box was brought in to him by his son containing lord john russells resignation he was as much amazed as lord newcastle smoking his evening pipe of tobacco in his coach was amazed by the news that the battle of marston moor had begun nothing has come to light since to set aside the severe judgment pronounced upon this proceeding by the universal opinion of contemporaries including lord johns own closest political allies that a minister should run away from a hostile motion upon affairs for which responsibility was collective and this without a word of consultation with a single colleague is a transaction happily without a precedent in the history of modern english cabinets339 it opened an intricate and unexpected chapter of affairs  the ministerial crisis of 1855 was unusually prolonged it was interesting as a drama of character and motive it marked a decisive stage in the evolution of party and it was one of the turning points in the career of the subject of this biography fortunately for us mr gladstone has told in his own way the whole story of what he calls this sharp and difficult passage in public affairs and he might have added that it was a sharp passage in his own life his narrative with the omission of some details now dead and indifferent and of a certain number of repetitions is the basis of this chapter                                      i                          lord johns resignation  on the day following lord johns letter the cabinet met and the prime minister told them that at first he thought it meant the breakup of the government but on further consideration he thought they should hold on if it could be done with honour and utility newcastle suggested his own resignation and the substitution of lord palmerston in his place palmerston agreed that the country rightly or wrongly wished to see him at the war office but he was ready to do whatever his colleagues thought best the whigs thought resignation necessary mr gladstone thought otherwise and scouted the suggestion that as newcastle was willing to resign lord john might come back lord john himself actually sent a sort of message to know whether he should attend the cabinet in the end lord aberdeen carried all their resignations to the queen these she declined to accept and she urged with the greatest eagerness that the decision should be reconsidered it is hard at this distance of time to understand how any cabinet under national circumstances of such gravity could have thought of the ignominy of taking to flight from a motion of censure whatever a single colleague like lord john russell might deem honourable on pressure from the queen the whigs in the government lord john notwithstanding agreed to stand fire mr gladstone proceeds       lord johns explanation which was very untrue in its general      effect though i believe kindly conceived in feeling as well as      tempered with some grains of policy and a contemplation of another      possible premiership carried the house with him as herbert      observed while he was speaking palmerstons reply to him was      wretched it produced in the house that is in so much of the      house as would otherwise have been favourable a flatness and      deadness of spirit towards the government which was indescribable      and charles wood with a marked expression of face said while it was      going on and this is to be our leader i was myself so painfully      full of the scene that when palmerston himself sat down i was on      the very point of saying to him unconsciously can anything more      be said but no one would rise in the adverse sense and therefore      there was no opening for a minister palmerston now become leader      in the commons had written to ask me to follow lord john on      account of his being a party but it was justly thought in the      cabinet that there were good reasons against my taking this part      upon me and so the arrangement was changed  roebuck brought forward his motion mr gladstone resisted it on behalf of the government with immense argumentative force and he put the point against lord john which explains the word untrue in the passage just quoted namely that though he desired in november the substitution of palmerston for newcastle as war minister he had given it up in december and yet this vital fact was omitted340 it was not for the government he said either to attempt to make terms with the house by reconstruction of a cabinet or to shrink from any judgment of the house upon their acts if they had so shrunk he exclaimed this is the sort of epitaph that he would expect to have written over their remains here lie the dishonoured ashes of a ministry that found england in peace and left in it war that was content to enjoy the emoluments of office and to wield the sceptre of power so long as no man had the courage to question their existence they saw the storm gathering over the country they heard the agonising accounts that were almost daily received of the sick and wounded in the east these things did not move them but so soon as a member of opposition raised his hand to point the thunderbolt they became consciencestricken into a sense of guilt and hoping to escape punishment they ran away from duty such would be their epitaph of the proposed inquiry itselfan inquiry into the conduct of generals and troops actually in the field and fighting by the side of and in concert with foreign allies he observedyour inquiry will never take place as a real inquiry or if it did it would lead to nothing but confusion and disturbance increased disasters shame at home and weakness abroad it would convey no consolation to those whom you seek to aid but it would carry malignant joy to the hearts of the enemies of england and for my part i shall ever rejoice if this motion is carried tonight that my own last words as a member of the cabinet of the earl of aberdeen have been words of solemn and earnest protest against a proceeding which has no foundation either in the constitution or in the practice of preceding parliaments which is useless and mischievous for the purpose which it appears to contemplate and which in my judgment is full of danger to the power dignity and usefulness of the commons of england a journalistic observer while deploring the speakers adherence to the dark dogmatisms of medieval religionists admits that he had never heard so fine a speech the language he says was devoid of redundance the attitude was calm mr gladstone seemed to feel that he rested upon the magnitude of the argument and had no need of the assistance of bodily vehemence of manner his voice was clear distinct and flexible without monotony it was minute dissection without bitterness or illhumoured innuendo he sat down amid immense applause from hearers admiring but unconvinced mr gladstone himself records of this speech hard and heavy work especially as to the cases of three persons lord john russell duke of newcastle and lord raglan ministers were beaten january 29 by 325 to 148 and they resigned       jan 30 1855cabinet 12 we exchanged friendly adieus dined      with the herberts this was a day of personal lightheartedness      but the problem for the nation is no small one                          end of the coalition  the queen sent for lord derby and he made an attempt to form a government without aid from the conservative wing of the fallen ministry there was no hope and his first step jan 31 was to call on lord palmerston with an earnest request for his support and with a hope that he would persuade mr gladstone and sidney herbert to rejoin their old political connection with the intimation moreover that mr disraeli with a selfabnegation that did him the highest credit was willing to waive in lord palmerstons favour his own claim to the leadership of the house of commons palmerston was to be president of the council and ellenborough minister of war in this conversation lord palmerston made no objection on any political grounds or on account of any contemplated measures he found no fault with the position intended for himself or for others with whom he would be associated lord derby supposed that all would depend on the concurrence of mr gladstone and herbert he left cambridge house at halfpast two in the afternoon and at halfpast nine in the evening he received a note from lord palmerston declining three hours later he heard from mr gladstone who declined also the proceedings of this eventful day between two in the afternoon and midnight whatever may have been the play of motive and calculation in the innermost minds of all or any of the actors were practically to go a long way though by no means the whole way as we shall see towards making mr gladstones severance from the conservative party definitive       jan 31lord palmerston came to see me between three and four      with a proposal from lord derby that he and i with s herbert      should take office under him palmerston to be president of the      council and lead the house of commons not finding me when he      called before he had gone to s herbert who seemed to be      disinclined i inquired 1 whether derby mentioned graham 2      whether he had told lord palmerston if his persevering with the      commission he had received would depend on the answer to this      proposal 3 how he was himself inclined he answered the two      first questions in the negative and said as to the third though      not keenly that he felt disinclined but that if he refused it      would be attributed to his contemplating another result which      other result he considered would be agreeable to the country i      then argued strongly with him that though he might form a      government and though if he formed it he would certainly start it      amidst immense clapping of hands yet he could not have any      reasonable prospect of stable parliamentary support on the one      hand would stand derby with his phalanx on the other lord j      russell of necessity a centre and nucleus of discontent and      between these two there would and could be no room for a      parliamentary majority such as would uphold his government he      argued only rather faintly the other way and seemed rather to come      to my way of thinking       i said that even if the proposition were entertained there would      be much to consider that i thought it clear whatever else was      doubtful that we could not join without him for in his absence      the wound would not heal kindly again that i could not act without      lord aberdeens approval nor should i willingly separate myself      from graham that if we joined we must join in force but i was      disposed to wish that if all details could be arranged we should      join in that manner rather than that derby should give up the      commission though i thought the best thing of all would be derby      forming a ministry of his own men provided only he could get a      good or fair foreign secretary instead of clarendon who in any      case would be an immense loss       i went off to speak to lord aberdeen and palmerston went to speak      to clarendon with respect to whom he had told derby that he could      hardly enter any government which had not clarendon at the foreign      office when we reassembled i asked lord palmerston whether he had      made up his mind for himself independently of us inasmuch as i      thought that if he had that was enough to close the whole      question he answered yes that he should tell derby he did not      think he could render him useful service in his administration he      then left it was perhaps 630 herbert and i sat down to write      but thought it well to send off nothing till after dinner and we      went to grillions where we had a small but merry party herbert      even beyond himself amusing at night we went to lord aberdeens      and grahams and so my letter came through some slight emendations      to the form in which it went341 i had doubts in my mind whether      derby had even intended to propose to herbert and me except in      conjunction with palmerston though i had no doubt that without      palmerston it would not do and i framed my letter so as not to      assume that i had an independent proposal but to make my refusal a      part of his       feb 2i yesterday also called on lord palmerston and read him      my letter to lord derby he said nothing can be better                         lord derbys proposals  lord derby knew that though he had the country gentlemen behind him his own political friends with the notable and only halfwelcome exception of mr disraeli were too far below mediocrity in either capacity or experience to face so angry and dangerous a crisis accordingly he gave up the task many years after mr gladstone recorded his opinion that here lord derby missed his one real chance of playing a high historic part to a derby government he said now that the party had been drubbed out of protection i did not in principle object for old ties were with me more operatively strong than new opinions and i think that lord derbys error in not forming an administration was palpable and even gross such it has appeared was the opinion of disraeli342 lord derby had many fine qualities but strong parliamentary courage was not among them when lord palmerston probably with a sagacious discernment of the immediate future declined he made no separate offer to the peelites had lord derby gone on he would have been supported by the country then absorbed in the consideration of the war none of the three occasions when he took office offered him so fine an opportunity as this but he missed it  on the previous day mr gladstone records saw mr disraeli in the house of lords and put out my hand which was very kindly accepted to nobody was the hour fraught with more bitter mortification than to mr disraeli who beheld a golden chance of bringing a consolidated party into the possession of real power flung away                                       ii                        error of refusing lord lansdowne  next at the queens request soundings in the whig and peelite waters were undertaken by lord lansdowne and he sent for mr gladstone with a result that to the latter was ever after matter of regret       feb 2in consequence of a communication from lord lansdowne i      went to him in the forenoon and found him just returned from      windsor he trusted i should not mind speaking freely to him and i      engaged to do it only premising that in so crude and dark a state      of facts it was impossible to go beyond first impressions we then      conversed on various combinations as 1 lord j russell premier      2 lord palmerston 3 lord clarendon 4 lord lansdowne      himself of the first i doubted whether in the present state of      feeling he could get a ministry on its legs in answer to a      question from him i added that i thought viewing my relations to      lord aberdeen and to newcastle and his to them also the public      feeling would be offended and it would not be for the public      interest if i were to form part of his government ie      russells of the second i said that it appeared to me lord      palmerston could not obtain a party majority aloof from him would      stand on the one hand derby and his party on the other lord j      russell who i took it for granted would never serve under him      whatever the impression made by russells recent conduct yet his      high personal character and station forty years career onehalf      of it in the leadership of his party and the close connection of      his name with all the great legislative changes of the period must      ever render him a power in the state and render it impossible for      a government depending on the liberal party to live independently      of him i also hinted at injurious effects which the substitution      of palmerston for lord aberdeen would produce on foreign powers at      this critical moment but dwelt chiefly on the impossibility of his      having a majority in this lord lansdowne seemed to agree       lastly i said that if lord lansdowne himself could venture to risk      his health and strength by taking the government this would be the      best arrangement my opinion was that at this crisis derby if he      could have formed an administration would have had advantages with      regard to the absorbing questions of the war and of a peace to      follow it such as no other combination could possess failing      this i wished for a homogeneous whig government the best form of      it would be under him he said he might dare it provisionally if      he could see his way to a permanent arrangement at the end of a      short term but he could see nothing of the sort at present       an autobiographic note of 1897 gives a further detail of      momenthe asked whether i would continue to hold my office as      chancellor of the exchequer in the event of his persevering he      said that if i gave an affirmative reply he would persevere with      the commission and i think intimated that except on this condition      he would not i said that the working of the coalition since its      formation in december 1852 had been to me entirely satisfactory      but that i was not prepared to cooperate in its continuation under      any other head than lord aberdeen i think that though perfectly      satisfied to be in a peelite government which had whigs or radicals      in it i was not ready to be in a whig government which had      peelites in it it took a long time with my slowmoving and      tenacious character for the ethiopian to change his skin  in the paper that i have already mentioned as recording what when all was near an end he took to be some of the errors of his life mr gladstone names as one of those errors this refusal in 1855 to join lord lansdowne i can hardly suppose he says more than forty years after that time that the eventual failure of the queens overture to lord lansdowne was due to my refusal but that refusal undoubtedly constituted one of his difficulties and helped to bring about the result i have always looked back upon it with pain as a serious and even gross error of judgment it was i think injurious to the public if it contributed to the substitution as prime minister of lord palmerston for lord lansdownea personage of greater dignity and i think a higher level of political principle there was no defect in lord lansdowne sufficient to warrant my refusal he would not have been a strong or very active prime minister but the question of the day was the conduct of the war and i had no right to take exception to him as a head in connection with this subject his attitude in domestic policy was the same as palmerstons but i think he had a more unprejudiced and liberal mind though less of motive force in certain directions                                      iii                           fruitless negotiations  the next day mr gladstone called on lord aberdeen who for the first time let drop a sort of opinion as to their duties in the crisis on one point hithertofore he had restrained himself he said certainly the most natural thing under the circumstances if it could have been brought about in a satisfactory form would have been that you should have joined derby on returning home mr gladstone received an important visitor and a fruitless visit       at halfpast two today lord john russell was announced and sat      till threehis hat shaking in his hand a communication had      reached him late last night from the queen charging him with the      formation of a government and he had thought it his duty to make      the endeavour i repeated to him what i had urged on lord      lansdowne that a coalition with advantages has also weaknesses of      its own that the late coalition was i thought fully justified by      the circumstances under which it took place but at this juncture      it had broken down this being so i thought what is called a      homogeneous government would be best for the public and most      likely to command approval that derby if he could get a good      foreign minister would have had immense advantages with respect to      the great questions of war and peace lord john agreed as to derby      thought that every one must have supported him and that he ought      to have persevered       i held to my point adding that i did not think lord aberdeen and      lord palmerston represented opposite principles but rather      different forms of the same principles connected with different      habits and temperaments he said that lord palmerston had agreed to      lead the house of commons for him he going as first minister to      the lords but he did not mention any other alteration upon the      whole his tone was low and doubtful he asked whether my answer was      to be considered as given or whether i would take time but i said      as there was no probability that my ideas would be modified by      reflection it would not be fair to him to ask any delay  with the single exception of lord palmerston none of his colleagues would have anything to do with lord john some even declining to go to see him wood came to mr gladstone evidently in the sense of the palmerston premiership he declared that aberdeen was impossible to which says mr gladstone i greatly demurred                                     iv  thus the two regular party leaders had failed lord aberdeen the coalition leader was almost universally known to be out of the question the public was loudly clamouring for lord palmerston a palmerston ministry was now seen to be inevitable were the peelites then having refused lord derby having refused lord john having told lord lansdowne that he had better form a system of homogeneous whigs now finally to refuse lord palmerston on no better ground than that they could not have lord aberdeen whom nobody save themselves would consent on any terms to have to propound such a question was to answer it lord aberdeen himself with admirable freedom from egotism pressed the point that in addition to the argument of public necessity they owed much to their late whig colleagues who behaved so nobly and so generously towards us after lord johns resignation  i have heard club talk and society talk wrote an adherent to mr gladstone late one night february 4 and i am sure that in the main any government containing good names in the cabinet provided lord john is not in it will obtain general support lord clarendon is universally or nearly so looked on as essential next to him i think you are considered of vital importance in your present office after all rightly or wrongly lord palmerston is master of the situation in the country he is looked upon as the man if the country sees you and sidney herbert holding aloof from him it will be said the peelites are selfish intriguers the same evening another correspondent said to mr gladstone two or three people have come in since eleven oclock with the news of brookss and the reform exultation prevails there and the certainty of palmerstons success tomorrow there is a sort of rumour prevalent that lord palmerston may seek lord j russells aid this would of course negative all idea of your joining in the concern otherwise a refusal would be set down as sheer impracticability or else the selfish ambition of a clique which could not stand alone and should no longer attempt to do so if the refusal to join palmerston is to be a going over to the other side and a definite junction within a brief space that is clear and intelligible but a refusal to join lord palmerston and yet holding out to him a promise of support is a halfmeasure which no one will understand and which i own i cannot see the grounds to defend                       palmerston forms a ministry  we shall now find how after long and strenuous dubitation the peelite leaders refused to join on the fifth of february and then on the sixth they joined unpromising from the very first cabinet the junction was destined to a swift and sudden end here is the story told by one of the two leading actors       sunday feb 4herbert came to me soon after i left him and      told me palmerston had at last got the commission he considered      that this disposed of lord lansdowne and seemed himself to be      disposed to join he said we must take care what we were about      and that we should be looked upon by the country as too nice if we      declined to join palmerston who he believed and in this i      inclined to agree would probably form a government he argued      that lord aberdeen was out of the question that the vote of monday      night was against him that the country would not stand him       no new coalition ought to be formed i said without a prospect of      stability and joining lord palmerstons cabinet would be a new      coalition he said he rather applied that phrase to a junction with      derby i quite agreed we could not join derby except under      conditions which might not be realised but if we did it it      would be a reunion not a coalition in coalition the separate      existence is retained i referred to the great instances of change      of party in our time palmerston himself and stanley with graham      but these took place when parties were divided by great questions      of principle there were none such now and no one could say that      the two sides of the house were divided by anything more than this      that one was rather more stationary the other more movable he      said true the differences are on the back benches       i said i had now for two years been holding my mind in suspense      upon the question i used to debate with newcastle who used to      argue that we should grow into the natural leaders of the liberal      party i said it is now plain this will not be we get on very      well with the independent liberals but the whigs stand as an      opaque body between us and them and moreover there they will      stand and ought to stand       lord palmerston came a little after two and remained perhaps an      hour lord lansdowne had promised to join him if he formed an      administration on a basis sufficiently broad he wished me to      retain my office and dwelt on the satisfactory nature of my      relations with the liberal party he argued that lord aberdeen was      excluded by the vote on monday night and that there was now no      other government in view my argument was adverse though without      going to a positive conclusion i referred to my conversation of      wednesday jan 31 in favour of a homogeneous government at this      juncture       at halfpast eleven i went to lord aberdeens and stayed about an      hour his being in the palmerston cabinet which had been proposed      was he said out of the question but his velleities seemed to      lean rather to our joining which surprised me he was afraid of      the position we should occupy in the public eye if we declined       feb 5the most irksome and painful of the days beginning with      many hours of anxious consultation to the best of our power and      ending amidst a storm of disapproval almost unanimous not only      from the generality but from our own immediate political friends       at 1030 i went to sir james graham who is still in bed and told      him the point to which by hard struggles i had come the case with      me was briefly this i was ready to make the sacrifice of personal      feeling ready to see him lord aberdeen expelled from the      premiership by a censure equally applicable to myself and yet to      remain in my office ready to overlook not merely the inferior      fitness but the real and manifest unfitness of palmerston for      that office ready to enter upon a new venture with him although      in my opinion without any reasonable prospect of parliamentary      support such as is absolutely necessary for the credit and      stability of a governmentupon the one sole and allembracing      ground that the prosecution of the war with vigour and the      prosecution of it to and for peace was now the question of the day      to which every other must give way but then it was absolutely      necessary that if we joined a cabinet after our overlooking all      this and more it should be a cabinet in which confidence should be      placed with reference to war and peace was the aberdeen cabinet      without lord aberdeen one in which i could place confidence i      answer no he was vital to it his love of peace was necessary to      its right and steady pursuit of that great end if then he      could belong to a palmerston cabinet i might but without him i      could not       in all this sir j graham concurred herbert came full of doubts      and fears but on the whole adopted the same conclusion lord      aberdeen sent to say he would not come but i wrote to beg him and      he appeared on hearing how we stood he said his remaining in the      cabinet was quite out of the question and that he had told      palmerston so yesterday when he glanced at it but he thought we      should incur great blame if we did not which indeed was plainly      beyond all dispute                              the peelites join       at length when i had written and read aloud the rough draft of an      answer lord aberdeen said he must strongly advise our joining i      said to him lord aberdeen when we have joined the palmerston      cabinet you standing aloof from it will you rise in your place in      the house of lords and say that you give that cabinet your      confidence with regard to the question of war and peace he      replied i will express my hope that it will do right but not my      confidence which is a different thing certainly i answered      and that which you have now said is my justification the      unswerving honesty of your mind has saved us ninetynine men out      of a hundred in your position at the moment would have said oh      yes i shall express my confidence but you would not deviate an      inch to the right or to the left       herbert and i went to my house and despatched our answers now      began the storm granville met us driving to newcastle sorry      beyond expression he almost looked displeased which for him is      much newcastle i incline to think you are wrong canning my      impression is you are wrong various letters streaming in all      portending condemnation and disaster herbert became more and more      uneasy       feb 6the last day i hope of these tangled records in which      we have seen to say nothing of the lesser sacrifice one more      noble victim struck down and we are set to feast over the remains      the thing is bad and the mode worse       arthur gordon came early in the day with a most urgent letter from      lord aberdeen addressed virtually to us and urging us to join he      had seen both palmerston and clarendon and derived much      satisfaction from what they said we met at the admiralty at      twelve where graham lay much knocked up with the fatigue and      anxiety of yesterday i read to him and lord aberdeen palmerstons      letter of today to me herbert came in and made arguments in his      sense i told him i was at the point of yesterday and was      immovable by considerations of the class he urged the only      security worth having lies in men the man is lord aberdeen moral      union and association with him must continue and must be publicly      known to continue i therefore repeated my question to lord      aberdeen whether he would in his place as a peer declare if we      joined the cabinet that it had his confidence with reference to      war and peace he said much moved that he felt the weight of the      responsibility but that after the explanation and assurances he      had received he would he was even more moved when graham said      that though the leaning of his judgment was adverse he would place      himself absolutely in the hands of lord aberdeen to herbert of      course it was a simple release from a difficulty palmerston had      told cardwell gladstone feels a difficulty first infused into him      by graham argyll and herbert have made up their minds to do what      gladstone does newcastle joined us and was in herberts sense i      repeated again that lord aberdeens declaration of confidence      enabled me to see my way to joining       i went to lord aberdeen in his official room after his return from      palmerston it was only when i left that room today that i began      to realise the pang of parting there he stood struck down from      his eminence by a vote that did not dare to avow its own purpose      and for his wisdom and virtue there he stood endeavouring to cure      the ill consequences to the public of the wrong inflicted upon      himself and as to the point immediately within reach successful in      the endeavour i ventured however to tell him that i hoped our      conduct and reliance on him would tend to his eminence and honour      and said you are not to be of the cabinet but you are to be its      tutelary deity       i had a message from palmerston that he would answer me but at      night i went up to him                                      v                           the committee revived  the rush of events was now somewhat slackened lord john called on graham and complained of the peelites for having selfishly sought too many offices alluding to what canning had done and imputing the same to cardwell he also thought they had made a great mistake in joining palmerston he seemed sore about mr gladstone and told graham that christopher a stout tory had said that if gladstone joined derby a hundred of the party would withdraw their allegiance at the party meeting on feb 21 lord derby was received with loud cries of no puseyites no papists and was much reprehended for asking gladstone and graham to join  i ought to have mentioned before mr gladstone writes here that during our conferences at the admiralty lord aberdeen expressed great compunction for having allowed the country to be dragged without adequate cause into the war so long as he lived he said with his own depth and force it would be a weight upon his conscience he had held similar language to me lately at argyll house but when i asked him at what point after the fleet went to besika bay it would have been possible to stop short he alluded to the sommation which we were encouraged however as he added by austria to send and thought this was the false step yet he did not seem quite firm in the opinion  then came the first cabinet feb 10 it did not relieve the gloom of mr gladstones impressions he found it more acephalous than ever less order less unity of purpose the question of the roebuck committee was raised on which he said he thought the house would give it up if government would promise an investigation under the authority of the crown the fatal subject came up again three days later palmerston said it was plain from the feeling in the house the night before that they were set upon it if they could secure a fair committee he was disposed to let the inquiry go forward on this rock the ship struck one minister said they could not resign in consequence of the appointment of the committee because it stood affirmed by a large majority when they took office in the reconstructed cabinet mr gladstone says he argued with vehemence upon the breach of duty which it would involve on our part towards those holding responsible commands in the crimea if we without ourselves condemning them were to allow them to be brought before another tribunal like a select committee  dining the same evening at the palace mr gladstone had a conversation on the subject both with the queen and prince albert the latter compared this appointment of a committee to the proceedings of the convention of france but still seemed to wish that the government should submit rather than retire the queen spoke openly in that sense and trusted that she should not be given over into the hands of those who are the least fit to govern without any positive and final declaration i intimated to each that i did not think i could bring my mind to acquiesce in the proposition for an inquiry by a select committee into the state of the army in the crimea  time did not remove difficulties mr gladstone and graham fought with extreme tenacity and the first of them with an ingenuity for which the situation gave boundless scope to the argument that they accepted office on reconstruction with the decision of the house for a committee staring them in the face he replied before we were out we were in why did we go out because of that very decision by the house of commons our language was the appointment of such a committee is incompatible with the functions of the executive therefore it is a censure on the executive therefore we resign but it is not a whit more compatible with the functions of the executive now than it was then therefore it is not one whit less a censure and the question arises 1 whether any government ought to allow its now principal duty to be delegated to a committee or other body especially to one not under the control of the crown 2 whether that government ought to allow it the members of which except one have already resigned rather than allow it in what way can the first resignation be justified on grounds which do not require a second he dwelt mainly on these two pointsthat the proposed transfer of the functions of the executive to a select committee of the house of commons with respect to an army in the face of the enemy and operating by the side of our french allies and the recognition of this transfer by the executive government was an evil greater than any that could arise from a total or partial resignation second that it was clear that they did not as things stood possess the confidence of a majority of the house i said that the committee was itself a censure on the government they had a right to believe that parliament would not inflict this committee on a government which had its confidence i also he says recited my having ascertained from palmerston upon this recital we were agreed on the 6th before our decision was declared his intention to oppose the committee                           peelites resign  graham did not feel disposed to govern without the confidence of the house of commons or to be responsible for the granting of a committee which the cabinet had unanimously felt to be unprecedented unconstitutional and dangerous lord palmerston met all this by a strong practical clincher he said that the house of commons was becoming unruly from the doubts that had gone abroad as to the intentions of the government with respect to the committee that the house was determined to have it that if they opposed it they should be beaten by an overwhelming majority to dissolve upon it would be ruinous to resign a fortnight after taking office would make them the laughingstock of the country  mr gladstone herbert and graham then resigned of the peelite group the duke of argyll and canning remained       feb 22after considering various sites we determined to ask      the manchester school to yield us at any rate for tomorrow the      old place devoted to exministers343 sir j graham expressed his      wish to begin the affair on the proposal of the first name of the      committee       cardwell came at 4 to inform me that he had declined to be my      successor and showed me his letter which gave as his reason      disinclination to step into the cabinet over the bodies of his      friends it seems that palmerston and lord lansdowne who assists      him sent canning to lord aberdeen to invoke his aid with cardwell      and prevail on him to retract but lord aberdeen though he told      canning that he disapproved at variance here with what graham and      i considered to be his tone on monday but agreeing with a note he      wrote in obscure terms the next morning said he could not make      such a request to cardwell or again play the peculiar part he had      acted a fortnight ago the cabinet on receiving cardwells refusal      were at a deadlock application was to be made or had been made      to sir francis baring but it seems that he is reluctant he is      however the best card they have to play       feb 28on sunday sir george lewis called on me and said my      office had been offered him this was after being refused by      cardwell and baring he asked my advice as to accepting it this i      told him i could not give he asked if i would assist him with      information in case of his accepting i answered that he might      command me precisely as if instead of resigning i had only removed      to another department i then went over some of the matters needful      to be made known on tuesday he came again acquainted me with his      acceptance and told me he had been mainly influenced by my      promise344       this day at a quarter to three i attended at the palace to resign      the seals and had an audience of about twenty minutes the queen      in taking them over was pleased to say that she received them with      great pain i answered that the decision which had required me to      surrender them had been the most painful effort of my public life      the queen said she was afraid on saturday night feb 17 when he      had dined at the palace from the language i then used that this      was about to happen i answered that we had then already had a      discussion in the cabinet which pointed to this result and that i      spoke as i did because i thought that to have no reserve whatever      with h m was the first duty of all those who had the honour and      happiness of being her servants i trusted h m would believe that      we had all been governed by no other desire than to do what was      best for the interests of the crown and the country h m expressed      her confidence of this and at no time throughout the conversation      did she in any manner indicate an opinion that our decision had      been wrong she spoke of the difficulty of making arrangements for      carrying on the government in the present state of things and i      frankly gave my opinion to h m that she would have little peace or      comfort in these matters until parliament should have returned to      its old organisation in two political parties that at present we      were in a false position and that both sides of the house were      demoralisedthe ministerial side overcharged with an excess of      official men and the way stopped up against expectants which led      to subdivision jealousy and intrigue the opposition so weak in      persons having experience of affairs as to be scarcely within the      chances of office and consequently made reckless by acting without      keeping it in view yet at the same time the party continued and      must continue to exist for it embodied one of the great      fundamental elements of english society the experiment of      coalition had been tried with remarkable advantage under a man of      the remarkable wisdom and powers of conciliation possessed by lord      aberdeen one in entire possession too of h ms confidence they      intimated that there were peculiar disadvantages too evidently      meaning lord j russell i named him in my answer and said i      thought that even if he had been steady yet the divisions of the      ministerial party would a little later have brought about our      overthrow345 h m seeming to agree in my main position as did      the prince asked me but when will parliament return to that      state i replied i grieved to say that i perceived neither the time      when nor the manner how that result is to come about but until      it is reached i fear that y m will pass through a period of      instability and weakness as respects the executive she observed      that the prospect is not agreeable i said true madam but it is      a great consolation that all these troubles are upon the surface      and that the throne has for a long time been gaining and not losing      stability from year to year i could see but one danger to the      throne and that was from encroachments by the house of commons no      other body in the country was strong enough to encroach this was      the consideration which had led my resigning colleagues with myself      to abandon office that we might make our stand against what we      thought a formidable invasion i thought the effect of the      resistance was traceable in the good conduct of the house of      commons last night when another attempt at encroachment was      proposed and firmly repelled i expressed my comfort at finding      that our motives were so graciously appreciated by h m and      withdrew                                public outcry  loud was the public outcry all the censure that had been foretold in case they should refuse to join fell with double force upon them for first joining and then seceding lord clarendon pronounced their conduct to be actually worse and more unpatriotic than lord johns the delight at brookss club was uproarious for to the whigs the peelites had always been odious and they had been extremely sorry when palmerston asked them to join his government346 for a time mr gladstone was only a degree less unpopular in the country than cobden and bright themselves the newspapers declared that gladstones epitaph over the aberdeen administration might be applied with peculiar force to his own fate the short truth seems to be that graham gladstone and palmerston were none of them emphatic or explicit enough beforehand on the refusal of the committee when the government was formed though the intention to refuse was no doubt both stated and understood graham admitted afterwards that this omission was a mistake the world would be astonished if it knew how often in the pressure of great affairs mens sight proves short after the language used by mr gladstone about the inquiry we cannot wonder that he should have been slow to acquiesce the result in time entirely justified his description of the sebastopol committee347 but right as was his judgment on the merits yet the case was hardly urgent enough to make withdrawal politic or wise idle gossip long prevailed that graham could not forgive palmerston for not having as he thought helped to defend him in the matter of opening mazzinis letters that from the first he was bent on overthrowing the new minister that he worked on gladstone and that the alleged reason why they left was not the real one all the evidence is the other way that graham could not resist the obvious want of the confidence of parliament and that gladstone could not bear a futile and perilous inquiry that they both regretted that they had yielded to overpersuasion in joining against their own feelings and judgment is certain graham even wrote to mr gladstone in the following summer that his assent to joining palmerston was perhaps the greatest mistake of his public life in mr gladstones case the transaction gave a rude and protracted shock to his public influence                         lord palmerstons reign  lord palmerston meanwhile sat tight in his saddle when the crisis first began roebuck in energetic language had urged him to sweep the peelites from his path and at any rate he now very steadily went on without them everybody took for granted that his administration would be temporary mr gladstone himself gave it a twelvemonth at most as it happened lord palmerston was in fact with one brief interruption installed for a decade he was seventyone he had been nearly forty years in office he had worked at the admiralty war department foreign office home office he had served under ten prime ministersportland perceval liverpool canning goderich wellington grey melbourne russell aberdeen he was not more than loosely attached to the whigs and he had none of the strength of that aristocratic tradition and its organ the bedford sect the landed interest was not with him the manchester men detested him the church in all its denominations was on terms of cool and reciprocated indifference with one who was above all else the man of this world the press he knew how to manage in every art of parliamentary sleight of hand he was an expert and he suited the temper of the times while old maxims of government and policy were tardily expiring and the forces of a new era were in their season gathering to a head  footnotes  337 on butes plan of superseding party by prerogative in the

ever didgreville iii i p 232  341 at lord aberdeens the question seems to have been discussed on the assumption that the offer to mr gladstone and herbert was meant to be independent of palmerstons acceptance or refusal and the impression there was that mr gladstone had been not wholly disinclined to consider the offer  342 malmesburys memoirs of an exminister i pp 8 37  343 on feb 23 he writes

the exchequer sir charles wood succeeded graham at the admiralty lord john then on his way to vienna agreed to come hack to the cabinet and took the colonial office which sir george grey had left for the home office where he succeeded palmerston  345 this seems to contradict the proposition in the article on greville in the eng hist rev of 1887  346 greville iii i p 246  347 mr gladstone projected and partly executed some public letters on all this to be addressed like the neapolitan letters to lord aberdeen                                 chapter vii                           political

are invincibly slow to learn the lesson put by thucydides long centuries ago into the mouth of the athenian envoys at sparta and often repeated in the same immortal pages that war defies all calculations and if it be protracted comes to be little more than mere matter of chance over which the combatants have no control a thousand times since has history proved this to be true policy is mastered by events unforeseen sequels develop novel pretexts or grow into startling and hateful necessities the minister finds that he is fastened to an inexorable chain                           new views of the war  mr gladstone now had this fatal law of mundane things brought home to him as time went on he by rapid intuition gained a truer insight into the leading facts he realised that mahometan institutions in the ottoman empire were decrepit that the youthful and vigorous elements in european turkey were crushed under antiquated and wornout forms and forces unfit for rule he awoke to the disquieting reflection how the occupation of the principalities had been discussed day after day and month after month entirely as a question of the payment of forty thousand pounds a year to turkey or as a violation of her rights as suzerain but never in reference to the wellbeing happiness freedom or peace of the inhabitants he still held that the war in its origin was just for it had been absolutely necessary he said to cut the meshes of the net in which russia had entangled turkey he persisted in condemning the whole tone and policy of russia in 1854 by the end of 1854 in mr gladstones eyes this aggressive spirit had been extinguished the czar promising an almost unreserved acceptance of the very points that he had in the previous august angrily rejected the essential objects of the war were the abolition of russian rights in the principalities and the destruction of russian claims upon greek christians under ottoman sway these objects mr gladstone insisted were attained in january 1855 when russia agreed to three out of the four pointsso the bases of agreement were namedand only demurred upon the plan for carrying out a portion of the fourth the special object was to cancel the preponderance of russia in the black sea no fewer than seven different plans were simultaneously or in turn propounded they were every one of them admitted to be dubious inefficient and imperfect i will spare the reader the mysteries of limitation of counterpoise of counterpoise and limitation mixed russia preferred counterpoise the allies were for limitation was this preference between two degrees of the imperfect the deficient and the ineffective a good ground for prolonging a war that was costing the allies a hundred million pounds a year and involved to all the parties concerned the loss of a thousand lives a day yet for saying no to this question mr gladstone was called a traitor even by men who in 1853 had been willing to content themselves with the vienna note and in 1854 had been anxious to make peace on the basis of the four points in face of pleas so wretched for a prolongation of a war to which he had assented on other grounds was he bound to silence would it not on the contrary he exclaimed have been the most contemptible effeminacy of character if a man in my position who feels that he has been instrumental in bringing his country into this struggle were to hesitate a single moment when he was firmly convinced in his own mind that the time had arrived when we might with honour escape from it  the prospect of reducing russia to some abstract level of strength so as to uphold an arbitrary standard of the balance of powerthis he regarded as mischief and chimera rightly he dreaded the peril of alliances shifting from day to day like quicksands and seashoalsaustria moved by a hundred strong and varying currents france drawing by unforeseen affinities towards russia every war with alliances he once said should be short sharp decisive348  as was to be expected the colleagues from whom he had parted insisted that every one of his arguments told just as logically against the war in all its stages against the first as legitimately as the last in fact we can never say a plain sure aye or no to questions of peace and war after the sword has once left the scabbard they are all matter of judgment on the balance of policy between one course and another and a very slight thing may incline the balance either way even though mighty affairs should hang on the turn of the scale meanwhile as the months went on sebastopol still stood untaken excitement grew people forgot the starting point they ceased to argue and sheer blatancy at all times a power in wartime is supreme mr gladstones trenchant dialectic had no more chance than brights glowing appeals shrewd and not unfriendly onlookers thought that graham and gladstone were grievously mistaken in making common cause with the peace party immediately after quitting a war government and quitting it besides not on the issues of the war herbert was vehement in his remonstrances the whole advantage of cooperation with the manchester men he cried would be derived by them and all the disrepute reaped by us for the purposes of peace they were the very men we ought to avoid as advocates for ending the war they were out of court for they were against beginning it349 if gladstone and graham had gone slower their friends said they might have preached moderation to ministers and given reasonable advice to people out of doors as it was they threw the game into the hands of lord palmerston they were stamped as doctrinaires and what was worse doctrinaires suspected of a spice of personal animus against old friends herbert insisted that the manchester school forgot that the people have flesh and blood and propounded theories to men swayed by national feeling as a matter of fact this was wholly untrue cobden and bright as everybody nowadays admits had a far truer perception of the underlying realities of the eastern question in 1854 than either the aberdeen or the palmerston cabinet or both of them put together what was undeniable was that the public with its habits of rough and ready judgment did not understand and could not be expected to understand the new union of the peelites with a peace party in direct opposition to whose strongest views and gravest warnings they had originally begun the war in gladstone cornewall lewis said people ascribe to faction or ambition or vanity conduct which i believe to be the result of a conscientious scrupulous ingenuous undecided mind always looking on each side of a question and magnifying the objections which belong to almost every course of action350                         advocates of peace  a foreign envoy then resident in england was struck by the general ignorance of facts even among leading politicians of the friends of peace he says only lord grey and gladstone seemed to have mastered the vienna protocols the rest were quite astonished when the extent of the russian concessions was pointed out to them the envoy dined with mr gladstone at the table of the queen and they talked of milner gibsons motion censuring ministers for losing the opportunity of the vienna conferences to make a sound and satisfactory peace mr gladstone said to him that he should undertake the grave responsibility of supporting this motion because in his opinion the concessions promised by russia contain sufficient guarantees those very concessions will tear to pieces all the ancient treaties which gave an excuse to russia for interfering in the internal affairs of turkey351  at all times stimulated rather than checked by a difficult situation mr gladstone argued the case for peace to the house during the session of 1855 in two speeches of extraordinary power of every kind his position was perfectly tenable and he defended it with unsurpassed force for the hour unfortunately his influence was gone great newspapers thought themselves safe in describing one of these performances as something between the rant of the fanatic and the trick of the stage actor a mixture of pious grimace and vindictive howl of savage curses and dolorous forebodings the most unpatriotic speech ever heard within the walls of parliament in sober fact it was one of the three or four most masterly deliverances evoked by the crimean war at the very same time lord john russell was still sitting in the cabinet though he had held the opinion that at the beginning of may the austrian proposal ought to have ended the war and led to an honourable peace the scandal of a minister remaining in a government that persisted in a war condemned by him as unnecessary was intolerable and lord john resigned july 16  the hopes of the speedy fall of sebastopol brightened in the summer of 1855 but this brought new alarms to lord palmerston our danger he said in remarkable words will then begina danger of peace and not a danger of war to drive the russians out of the crimea was to be no more than a preliminary england would go on by herself if conditions deemed by her essential were not secured the british nation is unanimous for i cannot reckon cobden bright and co for anything352 his account of the public mind was indubitably true well might aberdeen recall to his friends that with a single exception every treaty concluded at the termination of our great wars had been stigmatised as humiliating and degrading ignominious hollow and unsafe he cited the peace of utrecht in 1713 the peace of aixlachapelle in 1748 the peace of paris in 1763 the peace of versailles in 1783 and the peace of amiens in 1801 the single exception was the peace of paris in 1814 it would have been difficult in this case he said for patriotism or faction to discover humiliation in a treaty dictated at the head of a victorious army in the capital of the enemy                             at penmaenmawr  while the storm was raging mr gladstone made his way with his family to penmaenmawr whence he writes to lord aberdeen aug 9 it was a charitable act on your part to write to me it is hardly possible to believe one is not the greatest scoundrel on earth when one is assured of it from all sides on such excellent authority i am busy reading homer about the sebastopol of old time and all manner of other fine fellows in another letter of the same time written to sir walter james one of the most closely attached of all his friends he strikes a deeper note       sept 17if i say i care little for such an attack you will      perhaps think i make little of sympathy like yours and lord      hardinges but such i beg you and him to believe is not the      case public life is full of snares and dangers and i think it a      fearful thing for a christian to look forward to closing his life      in the midst of its to me at least essentially fevered activity      it has however some excellent characteristics in regard to mental      and even spiritual discipline and among these in particular it      absolutely requires the habits of resisting temper and of      suppressing pain i never allow myself in regard to my public      life to realise ie to dwell upon the fact that a thing is      painful indeed life has no time for such broodings neither in      session nor recess is the year the day or the hour long enough      for what it brings with it nor was there ever a case in which it      was so little difficult to pass over and make little of a personal      matter for if indeed it be true as i fear it is that we have      been committing grave errors that those errors have cost many      thousands of lives and millions of money and that no glare of      success can effectually hide the gloom of thickening complications      the man who can be capable of weighing his own fate and prospects      in the midst of such contingencies has need to take a lesson from      the private soldier who gives his life to his country at a shilling      a day  we are on our way back he writes at the end of september after a month of seabathing and touring among the welsh mountains most of my time is taken up with homer and homeric literature in which i am immersed with great delight up to my ears perhaps i should say out of my depth mr gladstone was one of the men whom the agitations of politics can never submerge political interests were what they ought to be a very serious part of life but they took their place with other things and were never suffered as in narrower natures sometimes happens to blot out stars and orbs of sun and moon from the spacious firmament above us he now found a shelter from the intensity of the times in the systematic production of his book on homer a striking piece of literature that became the most definite of his pursuits for two years or more his children observed that he never lounged or strolled upon the shore but when the mornings labour was overand nothing was ever allowed to break or mutilate the daily spell of serious workhe would stride forth staff in hand and vigorously breast the steepest bluffs and hills that he could find this was only emblematic of a temperament to which the putting forth of power was both necessity and delight the only rest he ever knew was change of effort  while he was on the welsh coast sebastopol fell after a siege of three hundred and fifty days negotiations for peace were opened tolerably soon afterwards ending after many checks and diplomatic difficulties in the treaty of paris march 30 1856 as to which i need only remind the reader with a view to a future incident in mr gladstones history that the black sea was neutralised and all warships of every nation excluded from its waters three hundred thousand men had perished countless treasure had been flung into the abyss the nation that had won its last victory at waterloo did not now enhance the glory of its arms nor the power of its diplomacy nor the strength of any of its material interests it was our french ally who profited the integrity of turkey was so ill confirmed that even at the congress of paris the question of the danubian principalities was raised in a form that in a couple of years reduced turkish rule over six millions of her subjects to the shadow of smoke of the confidently promised reform of mahometan dominion there was never a beginning nor a sign the vindication of the standing european order proved so ineffectual that the crimean war was only the sanguinary prelude to a vast subversion of the whole system of european states                                    ii                              work on homer  other interests now came foremost in mr gladstones mind the old ground so constantly travelled over since the death of peel was for three years to come traversed again with fatiguing iteration in the spring of 1856 lord derby repeated the overtures that he had made in specific form in 1851 and in 1855 the government was weak as mr gladstone had predicted that it would be lord derby told sir william heathcote through whom he and mr gladstone communicated that as almost any day it might be overturned and he might be sent for by the queen he was bound to see what strength he might rely upon and he was anxious to know what were mr gladstones views on the possibility of cooperation what was the nature of his relations with other members of the peel government who had also been in the cabinet of lord aberdeen did they systematically communicate were they a party did they intend to hold and to act together these questions were soon answered       on the first point mr gladstone said you cannot better describe      my views for present purposes than by saying that they are much      like lord derbys own as i understand themthere was nothing in      them to prevent a further consideration of the subject if public      affairs should assume such a shape as to recommend it on the      second i said graham herbert cardwell and i communicated      together habitually and confidentially that we did not seek to      act but rather eschewed acting as a party that our habits of      communication were founded upon long political association general      agreement and personal friendship that they were not however a      covenant for the future but a natural growth and result of the      past  then he proceeds to tell with a new and rather startling conclusion the old story of the peelite responsibility for the broken and disorganised state of the house of commons       we the friends of lord aberdeen were a main cause of disunion and      weakness in the executive government and must be so from      whichever side the government were formed so long as we were not      absolutely incorporated into one or the other of the two great      parties for though we had few positively and regularly following      us yet we had indirect relations with others on both sides of the      house which tended to relax and so far disable party      connections and our existence as a section encouraged the      formation of other sections all working with similar effects i      carried my feeling individually so far upon the subject as even to      be ready if i had to act alone to surrender my seat in      parliament rather than continue a cause of disturbance to any      government to which i might generally wish well353                         relations with lord derby  this exchange of views with lord derby he fully reported to graham herbert and cardwell whom lord aberdeen at his request had summoned for the purpose herbert doubted the expediency of such communications and graham went straight to what was a real point he observed that the question was of the most vital consequence who should lead the house of commons this he thought must come to me and could not be with disraeli i had said and repeated that i thought we could not bargain disraeli out of the saddle that it must rest with him so far as we were concerned to hold the lead if he pleased that besides my looking to it with doubt and dread i felt he had this right and that i took it as one of the data in the case before us upon which we might have to consider the question of political junction and which might be seriously affected by it of these approaches in the spring of 1856 nothing came the struggle in mr gladstones mind went on with growing urgency he always protested that he never at any time contemplated an isolated return to the conservative ranks but reunion of a body with a body  besides his sense of the vital importance of the reconstruction of the party system he had two other high related aims the commanding position that had first been held in the objects of his activity by the church then for a considerable space by the colonies was now filled by finance as he put it in a letter to his sympathetic brother robertson he saw two cardinal subjects for the present moment in public affairs a rational and pacific foreign policy and second the due reduction in our establishments economy in administration and finance to correspond in 1853 he had as he believed given financial pledges to the country these pledges were by the present ministers in danger of being forgotten they were incompatible with palmerstons spirit of foreign policy his duty then was to oppose that policy and to labour as hard as he could for the redemption of his pledges yet isolated as he was he had little power over either one of these aims or the other the liberal party was determined to support the reigning foreign policy and this made financial improvement desperate of lord derbys friends he was not hopeful but they were not committed to so dangerous a leader354 as he put it to elwin the editor of the quarterly there is a policy going a begging the general policy that sir robert peel in 1841 took office to supportthe policy of peace abroad of economy of financial equilibrium of steady resistance to abuses and promotion of practical improvements at home with a disinclination to questions of reform gratuitously raised355  his whole mind beset possessed and on fire with ideals of this kind and with sanguine visions of the road by which they might be realisedit was not in the temperament of this born warrior to count the lions in his path he was only too much in the right as his tribulations of a later date so amply proved in his perception that neither palmerston nor palmerstonian liberals would take up the broken clue of peel the importunate presence of mr disraeli was not any sharper obstacle to a definite junction with conservatives than was the personality of lord palmerston to a junction with liberals as he had said to graham in november 1856 the pain and strain of public duty is multiplied tenfold by the want of a clear and firm ground from which visibly to act in rougher phrase a man must have a platform and work with a party this indeed is for sensible men one of the rudiments of practical politics  of a certain kind of cant about public life and office mr gladstone was always accustomed to make short work the repudiation of desire for official power he at this time and always roundly denounced as sentimental and maudlin one of the not too many things that he admired in lord palmerston was the manly frankness of his habitual declarations that office is the natural and proper sphere of a public mans ambition as that in which he can most freely use his powers for the common advantage of his country the desire for office said mr gladstone is the desire of ardent minds for a larger space and scope within which to serve the country and for access to the command of that powerful machinery for information and practice which the public departments supply he must be a very bad minister indeed who does not do ten times the good to the country that he would do when out of office because he has helps and opportunities which multiply twenty fold as by a system of wheels and pulleys his power for doing it it is true as the smallest of men may seeand the smaller the man the more will he make of itthat this sterling good sense may set many a snare for the politician but then even the consecrated affectations of our public life have their snares too  the world was not in the secret of the communications with lord derby but the intrinsic probabilities of a case often give to the public a trick of divination in the middle of december 1856 articles actually appeared in the prints of the day announcing that mr gladstone would at the opening of the next session figure at the head of the opposition the tories they said wanted a leader mr gladstone wanted a party they were credulous he was ingenious the minority in a party must yield to a majority and he stood almost by himself he would be a returned prodigal in the conservative household for unlike sir james graham he had never merged himself in the ordinary ruck of liberalism a tory peer writes to assure him that there never was such a chance for the reunion of the party even the nobleman who had moved mr gladstones expulsion from the carlton said that he supposed reunion must pretty soon come off a few perhaps under a score made a great noise but if lord derby would only form a government the noisy ones would be as glad as the rest trueand here the writer came nearer to the central difficultydisraeli ought at first to lead the commons because he had been leader before second he had the greater number of followers third because on public grounds he must desire to see mr gladstone at the exchequer and to transfer to him both the great subject of finance and the great prize of leadership would be impossible so easy do flat impossibilities ever seem to sanguine simpletons in pall mall another correspondent has been staying at a grand countryhouse full of tory company and the state of parties was much discussedthere was one unanimous opinion he tells mr gladstone that nothing could save the conservative party except electing you for their leader the same talk was reported from the clubs the difficulty was disraeli not so much for any damage that his hostility could do the party as because lord derby had contracted relations with him which it would perhaps be impossible for him to disown  meanwhile the sagacious man in the tents of the tories whose course was so neatly chalked out for him by sulky followers not relishing his lead was we may be sure entirely wideawake watching currents gales and puffs of wind without haste without rest disraeli made a bold stroke for party consolidation by inviting to his official dinner at the opening of the session of 1857 general peel the favourite brother of the great minister and his best accredited representative peel consulted mr gladstone on the reply to disraelis invitation and found him strongly adverse the public said mr gladstone views with much jealousy every change of political position not founded on previous parliamentary cooperation for some national object mr gladstone might have put it on the narrower ground that attendance at the dinner would be an explicit condonation of disraelis misdeeds ten years before and a direct acceptance of his leadership henceforth  elwin believed that he had the direct sanction of lord derby for a message from him to mr gladstone suggesting communication after much ruminating and consulting mr gladstone wrote dec 13 1856 in sufficiently circuitous language to elwin that though he should not be justified in communicating with lord derby considered simply as a political leader with whom he was not in relations of party yet he proceeds remembering that i was once his colleague and placing entire reliance on his honour i am ready to speak to him in confidence and without reserve on the subject of public affairs should it be his desire his three friends graham aberdeen and herbert still viewed the proceeding with entire disfavour and no counsels were ever dictated by sincerer affection and solicitude your financial scheme says graham is conceived in the very spirit of peel it would be most conducive to national welfare you alone and in high office can carry it but it must be grafted on a pacific policy and on a moderate scale of public expenditure it is not under palmerston that such blessings are to be anticipated but then are they more probable under derby and disraeli lord aberdeen took another line insisting that to make any sort of approach to lord derby after joining palmerston only the previous year would be unjustifiable the bare apprehension of a vicious policy would be no intelligible ground for changing sides more tangible reasons would be needed and they were only too likely soon to arrive from palmerstons foreign policy then a reasonable chance might come herbert in his turn told mr gladstone that though he might infuse vigour and respectability into a party that stood much in need of both yet he would always be in a false position your opinions are essentially progressive and when the measures of any government mast be liberal and progressive the country will prefer the men whose antecedents and mottoes are liberal while the conservatives will always prefer a leader whose prejudices are with themselves as graham put it to him if you were to join the tory party tomorrow you would have neither their confidence nor their real good will and they would openly break with you in less than a year it all reminds one of the chorus in greek plays sagely expostulating with a hero bent on some dread deed of fate                                      iii                                 meditations  in the autumn of 1856 ecclesiastical questions held a strong place in mr gladstones interests the condemnation of archdeacon denison for heresy roused him to lively indignation he had long interviews with the archdeacon drafted answers for him and flung his whole soul into the case though he was made angry by denisons oscillations and general tone gladstone tells me said aberdeen that he cannot sleep for it and writes to me volumes upon volumes he thinks that denison ought to have been allowed to show that his doctrine whether in accordance or not with the articles is in accordance with scripture and he thinks the decision ought to have been in his case as it was in gorhams that the articles are comprehensive that they admit denisons view of the eucharist as well as that of his opponents356  his closing entry for the year 1856 depicts an inner mood       it appears to me that there are few persons who are so much as i am      enclosed in the invisible net of pendent steel i have never known      what tedium was have always found time full of calls and duties      life charged with every kind of interest but now when i look      calmly around me i see that these interests are for ever growing      and grown too many and powerful and that were it to please god to      call me i might answer with reluctance see how i stand into      politics i am drawn deeper every year in the growing anxieties and      struggles of the church i have no less interest than i have      heretofore literature has of late acquired a new and powerful hold      upon me the fortunes of my wifes family which have had with all      their dry detail all the most exciting and arduous interest of      romance for me now during nine years and more seven children      growing up around us and each day the object of deeper thoughts      and feelings and of higher hopes to catherine and mewhat a

next and launch upon it to try in the manner our      best judgment may suggest our strength and skillgladstone   in spite of wise counsels of circumspection mr gladstone clung to the chances that might come from personal communication between himself and lord derby under pressure from his friends he agreed with lord derby to put off an interview until after the debate on the address then after parliament met they took the plunge we are now at the beginning of february       this afternoon at three i called on lord derby and remained with      him above three hours in prosecution of the correspondence which      had passed between us       i told him that i deliberately disapproved of the government of      lord palmerston and was prepared and desirous to aid in any proper      measures which might lead to its displacement that so strong were      my objections that i was content to act thus without inquiring who      was to follow for i was convinced that any one who might follow      would govern with less prejudice to the public interests that in      the existing state of public affairs i did not pretend to see far      but thus far i saw clearly i also told him that i felt the      isolated position in which i stood and indeed in which we who are      called peelites all stand to be a great evil as tending to prolong      and aggravate that parliamentary disorganisation which so much      clogs and weakens the working of our government and i denounced      myself as a public nuisance adding that it would be an advantage      if my doctor sent me abroad for the session                             peelites and tories       he concurred in the general sentiments which i had expressed but      said it was material for him as he had friends with and for whom      to act and as i had alluded to the possibility in the event of a      change of his being invited by the queen to form a government to      consider beforehand on what strength he could rely he said he      believed his friends were stronger than any other single section      but that they were a minority in both houses weak in 1852 he was      weaker now for it was natural that four years of exclusion from      office should thin the ranks of a party and such had been his      case he described the state of feeling among his friends and      adverted to the offer he had made in 1851 and in 1855 the fact of      an overture made and not accepted had led to much bitterness or      anger towards us among a portion of his adherents he considered      that in 1855 lord palmerston had behaved far from well either to      herbert and me or to him357  other interviews followed resolutions were discussed amendments forms of words they met at discreet dinners nobody lord derby tells him except disraeli knows the length to which our communications have gone nobody that is to say excepting also mr gladstones three personal allies them he kept accurately informed of all that passed at every stage on february 13 the government presented their budget in introducing his plan cornewall lewis rashly quoted and adopted as his own the terrible heresy of arthur young that to multiply the number of taxes is a step towards equality of burden and that a good system of taxation is one that bears lightly on an infinite number of points the reader will believe how speedily an impious opinion of this sort kindled volcanic flame in mr gladstones breast he thought moreover that he espied in the ministerial plan a prospective deficiency a year ahead to maintain a steady surplus of income over expenditure he reflected to lower indirect taxes when excessive in amount for the relief of the people and bearing in mind the reproductive power inherent in such operations to simplify our fiscal system by concentrating its pressure on a few well chosen articles of extended consumption and to conciliate support to the incometax by marking its temporary character and by associating it with beneficial changes in the tariff these aims have been for fifteen years the labour of our life by this budget he found them in principle utterly reversed he told his friends that the shade of peel would appear to him if he did not oppose such plans with his whole strength when the time came feb 3 the government was fired into from all quarters disraeli in front gladstone on flank john russell in rear disraeli and gladstone rose at same time speaker called the former both spoke very well it was a night of triumph for gladstone358  there is another note of the proceedings on lewiss budget       saturday feb 14i was engaged to meet graham herbert and      cardwell at lord aberdeens and i knew from lord derby that he was      to see his friends at noon so i went to him on my way first to      point out the deficit of between five and six millions for 18589      which is created by this budget with the augmentations of it in      subsequent years and secondly to say that in my opinion it was      hopeless to attack the scheme in detail and that it must be      resisted on the ground of deficit as a whole to give a hope of      success i said that if among the opposition there still lingered a      desire to revive and extend indirect taxation i must allow that      the government had bid high for support from those who entertained      it that it was the worst proposition i had ever heard from a      minister of finance at lord aberdeens we examined the figures of      the case and drafted two resolutions which expressed our opinions       the more serious point however was that they all wished me to      insist upon taking the motion into my own hands and announcing      this to lord j russell as well as to lord derby as to the second      i had no difficulty could i have acceded to the first but i did      not doubt that disraeli would still keep hold of so much of his      notice of feb 3 as had not been set aside by the budget i said      that from motives which i could neither describe nor conquer i was      quite unable to undertake to enter into any squabble or competition      with him for the possession of a post of prominence we had much      conversation on political prospects graham wishing to see me lead      the commons under lord john as prime minister in the lords      admitting that the same thing would do under lord derby but for      disraeli who could not be thrown away like a sucked orange and i      vehemently deploring our position which i said and they admitted      was generally condemned by the country      i again went to derby as he had requested at five and he told me     that he had had with him malmesbury hardwicke disraeli pakington     walpole lytton they had all agreed that the best motion would be a     resolution from disraeli on monday before the speaker left the     chair which would virtually rest the question on deficit i made     two verbal suggestions on the resolution to improve its form                       cooperation with mr disraeli  late in the evening lord derby writes enclosing a note received at dinner from disraeli i hope i may take it for granted that there is now a complete understanding between us as to the move on monday night my dear lord runs the note i like the resolution as amended it is improved yours ever d when monday came the move was duly made and gladstone and disraeli again fought side by side as twin champions of the cause of reduced expenditure time had incensed mr gladstone still further and he conducted a terrific fusillade he recounted how between 1842 and 1853 two and twenty millions of taxation had been taken off without costing a farthing a man may be glad and thankful to have been an englishman and a member of the british parliament during these years bearing his part in so blessed a work but if it be a blessed work what are we to say of him who begins the undoing of it the proposal of the government showed a gross a glaring an increasing deficiency a deficiency unparalleled in the financial history of a quarter of a century it was deluding the people and trifling with national interests it is certain that no financier before or since ever in cromwellian phrase made such a conscience of the matter or ever found the task more thankless359 great as was the effect of the close and searching argument that accompanied all this invective even mr gladstones friends thought it too impassioned and too severe upon lewis in whose favour there was consequently a reaction the cool minister contented himself with quoting horaces lines upon the artist skilled in reproducing in his bronze fierce nails or flowing hair yet who fails because he lacks the art to seize the whole360  at the end of february 1857 at a party meeting of 160 members lord derby told his men that the course taken by mr disraeli upon the budget had been concerted with him and had his entire approval spoke with admiration of mr gladstone justified political union when produced by men finding themselves drawn to the same lobby by identity of sentiment and advised them not to decline such accession of strength as would place their party in a position to undertake the government of the country the newspapers cried out that the longexpected coalition had at length really taken place in their hearts the conservative managers were not sure that mr gladstones adhesion would not cost them too dearly he would only benefit us by his talents says lord malmesbury for we should lose many of our supporters the duke of beaufort one of our staunchest adherents told me at longleat that if we coalesced with the peelites he would leave the party and i remember in 1855 when lord derby attempted to form a government and offered places to gladstone and herbert that no less than eighty members of the house of commons threatened to leave him361 all these schemes and calculations were destined to be rudely interrupted                                     ii                          speech on the china war  while he was acting with lord derby on the one hand mr gladstone sought counsel from cobden on the other having great confidence in his firmness and integrity of purpose and hoping for support from him in face of a fainthearted disposition to regard lord palmerston as a magician against whom it was vain to struggle events were speedily to show that lord palmerston had more magic at his disposal than his valiant foe believed the agent of the british government in the china seashimself by the way a philosophic radicalhad forced a war upon the chinese the cabinet supported him on the motion of cobden the house censured the proceeding mr gladstone whose hatred of highhanded iniquities in china had been stirred in early days362 as the reader may recall made the most powerful speech in a remarkable debate gladstone rose at halfpast nine phillimore says mar 3 and delivered for nearly two hours an oration which enthralled the house and which for argument dignity eloquence and effect is unsurpassed by any of his former achievements it won several votes nobody denies that his speech was the finest delivered in the memory of man in the house of commons apart from a rigorous examination of circumstance and fact in the special case as in the famous precedent of don pacifico seven years before he raised the dispute to higher planes and in most striking language he examined it both by municipal and international law and on the higher ground of natural justicethat justice which binds man to man which is older than christianity because it was in the world before christianity which is broader than christianity because it extends to the world beyond christianity and which underlies christianity for christianity itself appeals to it war taken at the best is a frightful scourge upon the human race but because it is so the wisdom of ages has surrounded it with strict laws and usages and has required formalities to be observed which shall act as a curb upon the wild passions of man you have dispensed with all these precautions you have turned a consul into a diplomatist and that metamorphosed consul is forsooth to be at liberty to direct the whole might of england against the lives of a defenceless people disraeli in turn denounced proceedings which began in outrage and ended in ruin mocked at no reform new taxes canton blazing persia invaded as the programme of the party of progress and civilisation and reprobated a prime minister who had professed almost every principle and connected himself with almost every party palmerston replied by a stout piece of close argument spiced by taunts about coalitions combinations and eloquent flourishes but this time in parliament his slender majority failed him       march 3 57spoke on cobdens resolutions and voted in      263247a division doing more honour to the house of commons than      any i ever remember home with c and read lord ellesmeres      faust being excited which is rare with me diary                       lord palmerstons triumph  the repulse was transient the minister appealed to the constituencies and won a striking triumph nearly all the manchester politicians with bright and cobden at their head were ruthlessly dismissed and the election was a glorious ratification not only of the little war among the chinese junks but of the great war against the czar of russia and of much besides this said mr gladstone was not an election like that of 1784 when pitt appealed on the question whether the crown should be the slave of an oligarchic faction nor like that of 1831 when grey sought a judgment on reform nor like that of 1852 when the issue was the expiring controversy of protection the country was to decide not upon the canton river but whether it would or would not have lord palmerston for prime minister the insolent barbarian wielding authority at canton who had violated the british flag was indeed made to play his part but the mainspring of the electoral victory was to be sought in the profound public weariness of the party dispersions of the last eleven years in the determination that the country should be governed by men of intelligible opinions and definite views in the resolution that the intermediate tints should disappear in the conviction that palmerston was the helmsman for the hour the result was justly compared to the plebiscite taken in france four or five years earlier whether they would have louis napoleon for emperor or not it was computed that no fewer than onesixth or at best oneseventh of the most conspicuous men in the former house of commons were thrust out the derbyites were sure that the report of the coalition with the peelites had done them irreparable harm though their electioneering was independent at oxford mr gladstone was returned without opposition on the other hand his gallant attempt to save the seat of his brotherinlaw in flintshire failed his many speeches met much rough interruption and to his extreme mortification sir stephen glynne was thrown out  the moral of the general election was undoubtedly a heavy shock to mr gladstone and he was fully conscious of the new awkwardness of his public position painful change seemed imminent even in his intimate relations with cherished friends sidney herbert had written to him that as for gladstone graham and himself they were not only broken up as a party but the country intended to break them up and would resent any attempt at resuscitation they ought on no account to reappear as a triumvirate on their old bench mr gladstones reply discloses in some of its phrases a peculiar warmth of sensibility of which he was not often wont to make much display                            to sidney herbert       march 22 1857i did not reply to your letter when it arrived      because it touches principally upon subjects with respect to which      i feel that my mind has been wrought into a state of sensitiveness      which is excessive and morbid for the last eleven years with the      exception of only two among them the pains of political strife      have not for us found their usual and proper compensation in the      genial and extended sympathies of a great body of comrades while      suspicion mistrust and criticism have flanked us on both sides      and in unusual measure our one comfort has been a concurrence of      opinion which has been upon the whole remarkably close and which      has been cemented by the closer bonds of feeling and of friendship      the loss of this one comfort i have no strength to face contrary      to your supposition i have nothing with which to replace it but      the attachments which began with political infancy and which      have lived through so many storms and so many subtler vicissitudes      will never be replaced you will never be able to get away from me      as long as i can cling to you and if at length urged by your      conscience and deliberate judgment you effect the operation the      result will not be to throw me into the staff of lord derby i      shall seek my duty as well as consult my inclination first by      absconding from what may be termed general politics and secondly      by appearing wherever i must appear only in the ranks       i can neither give even the most qualified adhesion to the ministry      of lord palmerston nor follow the liberal party in the abandonment      of the very principles and pledges which were original and      principal bonds of union with it so on the other hand i never      have had any hope of conservative reconstruction except and that      slender and remote such as presupposed the cooperationi am now      speaking for the house of commons onlyof yourself and graham in      particular by adopting reform as a watchword of present political      action he has certainly inserted a certain amount of gap between      himself and me which may come to be practically material or may      not if you make a gap upon this opportunity i believe it will be      a novelty in political history it will be the first case on record      of separation between two men all of whose views upon every public      question political administrative or financial are i believe in      as exact accordance as under the laws of the human mind is      possible  his leaning towards the conservative party seemed to become more decided rather than less lord aberdeen had written to him as if the amalgamation of peels friends with the liberal party had practically taken place if that be true mr gladstone replies april 4 1857 then i have been deceiving both the world and my constituents and the deception has reached its climax within the last fortnight during which i have been chosen without opposition to represent oxford under a belief directly contrary in the minds of the majority of my constituents he saw nothing but evil in lord palmerstons supremacy that was his unending refrain he tells one of his constituents the state of things is likely to end in much political confusion if it is not stopped by the failure of lord palmerstons physical force the only way of stopping it which i could view with regret for i admire the pluck with which he fights against the infirmities of age though in political and moral courage i have never seen a minister so deficient cobden asked him in the course of the first session of the new parliament to take up some position adverse to the ministers i should not knowingly mr gladstone replies june 16 1857 allow any disgust with the state of public affairs to restrain me from the discharge of a public duty but i arrived some time ago at the conclusion which has guided my conduct since the dissolution that the house of commons would sooner and more healthily return to a sense of its own dignity and of its proper functions if let alone by a person who had so thoroughly worried both it and the country as myself                                    iii                               divorce bill  this stern resolve to hold aloof did not last towards the end of the session a subject was brought before parliament that stirred him to the very depths of heart and conscience it marked one more stage of the history of english laws in that immense process of the secularisation of the state against which in his book of 1888 mr gladstone had drawn up with so much weight of reading and thought a case so wholly unavailing the legal doctrine of marriage had been established against the theological doctrine by lord hardwickes famous act of 1753 for that measure made the observance of certain requirements then set up by law essential to a good marriage a further fundamental change had begun with the legislation of civil marriage in 1836 the conception of marriage underlying such a change obviously removed it from sacrament or anything like a sacrament to the bleak and frigid zone of civil contract it was antagonistic therefore to the whole ecclesiastical theory of divorce363  a royal commission issued a report in 1853 setting forth the case against the existing system of dissolving marriage and recommending radical changes in the following year the cabinet of which mr gladstone was a member framed and introduced a bill substantially conforming to these recommendations for one reason or another it did not become law nor did a bill of similar scope in 1856 in the interval of leisure that followed mr gladstone was pressed perhaps by bishop wilberforce thoroughly to consider the matter with his prepossessions there could be little doubt that he would incline to that view of marriage and the terms and legal effects of loosening the marriage tie that the council of trent had succeeded in making the general marriage law of catholic europe the subject was one peculiarly calculated to interest and excite him religion and the church were involved it raised at our own hearths the eternal question of rendering to cæsar what is cæsars and to the church what belongs to the church it was wrapped up with topics of history and of learning it could not be discussed without that admixture of legality and ethics which delights a casuistic intellect above all it went to the root both of that deepest of human relations and of that particular branch of morals in which mr gladstone always felt the vividest concern so in short being once called upon for a practical purpose to consider divorce and the many connected questions of remarriage he was inevitably roused to a fervour on one side not any less heated and intense than the fervour of the mighty milton on the other side two centuries before he began operations by an elaborate article in the quarterly review364 here he flings himself upon the wellworn texts in the bible familiar to the readers of tetrachordonif indeed tetrachordon have any readerswith a dialectical acuteness and force that only make one wonder the more how a mind so powerful as mr gladstones could dream that at that age of the world men would suffer one of the most farreaching of all our social problems whatever be the right or wrong social solution to be in the slightest degree affected by a greek word or two of utterly disputable and unfixed significance                       interest in law of divorce  i may note in passing that in another department of supposed levitical prohibitionthe case of the wifes sisterhe had in 1849 strongly argued against relaxation mainly on the ground that it would involve an alteration of the law and doctrines of the church of england and therefore of the law of christianity365 experience and time revolutionised his point of view and in 1869 in supporting a bill legalising these marriages he took the secular and utilitarian line and said that twelve or fourteen years earlier about the time on which we are now engaged he formed the opinion that it was the mass of the community to which we must look in dealing with such a question and that the fairest course would be to legalise the marriage contracts in question and legitimise their issue leaving to each religious community the question of attaching to such marriages a religious character366  the divorce bill of 1857 was introduced in the lords and passed by them without effective resistance it was supported by the archbishop of canterbury and nine other prelates authorities no less exalted than bishop wilberforce were violently hostile even at one stage carrying amendments ultimately rejected not only for prohibiting the intermarriage of the guilty parties but actually imposing a fine or imprisonment on either of them this i fancy is the highwater mark of the ecclesiastical theory in the century367 lord mahon in a letter to mr gladstone at this date pictures macaulays new zealander being taken to the house of lords and hearing learned lords and reverend prelates lay down the canon that marriage is indissoluble by the law of england and by the law of the church but who he might have asked are those two gentlemen listening so intently oh these are two gentlemen whose marriages were dissolved last year and that other man oh he was divorced last week and those three ladies oh their marriages may in all probability be dissolved in another year or two still this view of the absurdity of existing practice did not make a convert  as soon as the bill came down to the house of commons mr gladstone hastened up to london in the dogdays a companion in the railway carriage he wrote to mrs gladstone more genial than congenial offered me his times and then brandy this was followed by a proposal to smoke so that he had disabled me from objecting on personal grounds tobacco brandy at odd hours and the newspaper made a triple abomination in a single dose for none of the three was ever a favourite article of his consumption in london he found the counsels of his friends by no means encouraging for the great fight on which he was intent they deprecated anything that would bring him into direct collision with lord palmerston they urged that violent opposition now would be contrasted with his past silence and with his own cabinet responsibility for the very same proposal nothing would be intelligible to the public lord aberdeen said beyond a carefully moderated course but a carefully moderated course was the very last thing possible to mr gladstone when the flame was once kindled and he fought the bill with a holy wrath as vehement as the more worldly fury with which henry fox from very different motives had fought the marriage bill of 1753 the thought that stirred him was indicated in a phrase or two to his wife at hawarden july 31parliamentary affairs are very black the poor church gets deeper and deeper into the mire i am to speak tonight it will do no good and the fear grows upon me from year to year that when i finally leave parliament i shall not leave the great question of state and church better but perhaps even worse than i found it                         vehement opposition  the discussion of the bill in the commons occupied no fewer than eighteen sittings more than one of them according to the standard of those primitive times inordinately long in the hundred encounters between mr gladstone and bethell polished phrase barely hid unchristian desire to retaliate and provoke bethell boldly taunted mr gladstone with insincerity mr gladstone with a vivacity very like downright anger reproached bethell with being a mere hewer of wood and drawer of water to the cabinet who forced the bill into his charge with being disorderly and abusing the privileges of speech by accusations of insincerity which have not only proceeded from his mouth but gleamed from those eloquent eyes of his which have been continuously turned on me for the last ten minutes instead of being addressed to the chair on every division those who affirmed the principle of the bill were at least two to one all we can do mr gladstone wrote to his wife is to put shoulder to shoulder and this please god we will do graham is with us much to my delight and much too let me add to my surprise i am as thankful to be in parliament for this almost as i was for the china vote yesterday ten and ahalf hours rather angry today with pacification but still tough and prolonged an unfriendly but not wholly unveracious chronicler says of this ten hours sitting august 14 on a single clause including questions explanations and interlocutory suggestions mr gladstone made nineandtwenty speeches some of them of considerable length sometimes he was argumentative frequently ingenious and critical often personal and not less often indignant at the alleged personality of others  he made no pretence of thinking the principle of divorce a vinculo anything but an immense evil but he still held himself free if that view were repudiated to consider the legislative question of dissolubility and its conditions he resorted abundantly to what palmerston called the old standard setup form of objecting to any improvement to say that it does not carry out all the improvements of which the matter in hand is susceptible one of the complaints of which he made most was the inequality in the bill between the respective rights of husband and wife it is the special and peculiar doctrines of the gospel he said respecting the personal relation of every christian whether man or woman to the person of christ that form the firm the broad the indestructible basis of the equality of the sexes under the christian law again in the vast majority of instances where the woman falls into sin she does so from motives less impure and ignoble than those of the man he attacks with just vigour the limitation of legal cruelty in this case to the cruelty of mere force importing danger to life limb or health though he was shocked in after years as well he might be at the grotesque excess to which the doctrine of mental cruelty has been carried in some states of the american union in this branch of the great controversy at any rate he speaks in a nobler and humaner temper than milton who writes with a tyrannical jewish belief in the inferiority of women to men and wives to husbands that was in mr gladstones middle life slowly beginning to melt away in english public opinion his second complaint and in his eyes much the more urgent of the two was the right conferred by the government bill upon divorced persons to claim marriage by a clergyman in a church and still more bitterly did he resent the obligation imposed by the bill upon clergymen to perform such marriages here the fight was not wholly unsuccessful and modifications were secured as the fruit of his efforts narrowing and abating though not removing his grounds of objection368                                     iv                         death of lady lyttelton  before the battle was over he was torn away from the scene by a painful bereavement mrs gladstone was at hagley nursing her beloved sister lady lyttelton he wrote to his wife in the fiercest hours of the fight 11 carlton house terrace aug 15 i read too plainly in your letter of yesterday that your heart is heavy and mine too is heavy along with yours i have been in many minds about my duty today and i am all but ready to break the bands even of the high obligations that have kept me here with reference to the marriage bill you have only to speak the word by telegraph or otherwise showing that i can help to give any of the support you need and i come to you as matters stand i am wanted in the house today and am wanted for the divorce bill again on monday before monday came lady lyttelton was no more four days after her death mr gladstone wrote to mr arthur gordon from hagley       the loss suffered here is a dreadful one but it is borne in the      way which robs death and all evil of its sting my deceased      sisterinlaw was so united with my wife they so drew from their      very earliest years and not less since marriage than before it      their breath so to speak in common that the relation i bore to her      conveys little even of what i have lost but that again is little      compared to my wifes bereavement and far above all to that of      lyttelton who now stands lonely among his twelve children but the      retrospect from first to last is singularly bright and pure she      seemed to be one of those rare spirits who do not need affliction      to draw them to their lord and from first to last there was scarce      a shade of it in her life when she was told she was to die her      pulse did not change the last communion appeared wholly to sever      her from the world but she smiled upon her husband within a minute      of the time when the spirit fled  footnotes  357 see above pp 5258  358 phillimores

exaction of damages comes to the same thing  368 in republishing in 1878 his article from the quarterly gleanings vi p 106 he says his arguments have been too sadly illustrated by the mischievous effects of the measure the judicial statistics however hardly support this view that petitions for divorce were constantly increasing and at an accelerating rate of progression in england the proportion of divorce petitions to marriages and the proportion of divorce decrees to population are both of them lower than they were a few years ago mr gladstone used to desire the prohibition of publicity in these proceedings until he learned the strong view of the president of the court that the hideous glare of this publicity acts probably as no inconsiderable deterrent                                  chapter ix                       the second derby government                                 1858       extravagance and exaggeration of ideas are not the essential      characteristic of either political party in this country both of      them are composed in the main of men with english hearts and      english feelings each of them comprises within itself far greater      diversities of political principles and tendencies than can be      noted as dividing the more moderate portion of the one from the      more moderate portion of the other but while the great english      parties differ no more in their general outlines than by a somewhat      varied distribution of the same elements in each they are liable      to be favourably or unfavourably affected and their essential      characteristics unduly exaggerated by circumstances of the order      that would be termed accidentalgladstone   the turn of the political wheel is constantly producing strange results but none has ever been more strikingly dramatic than when on february 20 bright and milner gibson who had been ignominiously thrown out at manchester the year before had the satisfaction of walking to the table of the house of commons as victorious tellers in the division on the conspiracy to murder bill that overthrew lord palmerston a plot to slay the french emperor had been organised by a band of italian refugees in london the bombs were manufactured in england orsinis design miscarried but feeling in france was greatly excited and the french government formally drew attention at st jamess to the fact that bodies of assassins abused our right of asylum they hinted further that the amity of the crown called for stronger law palmerston very sensibly did not answer the french despatch but introduced a bill with new powers against conspiracy he in an instant became the most unpopular man in the country and the idol of the year before was now hooted in the park                        lord palmerston defeated  mr gladstone was at first doubtful but soon made up his mind to mrs gladstone he writes feb 17       as respects the conspiracy bill you may depend upon our having      plenty of fight the result is doubtful but if the bill gets into      the house of lords it will pass lord aberdeen is strong against      it from him i went today to lord lyndhurst and i found lord      brougham with him a most interesting conversation followed with      these two wonderful old men at 80 and 86 coming next birthday      respectively both in the fullest possession of their faculties      brougham vehement impulsive full of gesticulation and not a      little rambling the other calm and clear as a deep pool upon rock      lord lyndhurst is decidedly against the bill brougham somewhat      inclines to it being as lord lyndhurst says half a frenchman      lord lyndhurst expounded the matter in a most luminous way from      his point of view brougham went into raptures and used these      words i tell you what lyndhurst i wish i could make an exchange      with you i would give you some of my walking power and you should      give me some of your brains i have often told the story with this      brief commentary that the compliment was the highest i have ever      known to be paid by one human being to another369  the debate showed a curious inversion of the parts usually played by eminent men palmerston vainly explained that he was doing no more than international comity required and doing no worse than placing the foreign refugee on the same footing in respect of certain offences as the british subject mr gladstone feb 19 on the other hand as one who has perhaps too often made it his business to call attention to the failings of his countrymen contended that if national honour was not henceforth to be a shadow and a name it was the paramount absolute and imperative duty of her majestys ministers to protest against the imputation upon us of favour for assassination a plant which is congenial neither to our soil nor to the climate in which we live370 one of the truest things said in the debate was disraelis incidental observation that the house should remember that in ninetynine cases out of a hundred when there is a quarrel between two states it is generally occasioned by some blunder of a ministry mr disraeli perhaps consoled himself by the pithy saying of baron brunnow that if no one made any blunders there would be no politics the blood of the civis romanus however was up and palmerston defeated by a majority of nineteen at once resigned                      correspondence with lord derby  lord derby whose heart had failed him three years earlier now formed his second administration and made one more attempt to bring mr gladstone over to the conservative ranks lord lansdowne had told the queen that no other government was possible and an hour after he had kissed hands the new prime minister applied to mr gladstone the decisions taken by him in answer to this and another application three months later mark one more of the curious turning points in his career and in the fate of his party       feb 20 1858dined at herberts with graham we sat till 12½      but did not talk quite through the crisis palmerston has resigned      he is down i must now cease to denounce him 21st jamess      morning and holy communion westminster abbey in evening when i      sat by sir george grey from st jamess i went to lord aberdeens      there derbys letter reached me we sent for herbert and i wrote an      answer graham arrived and heard it with slight modifications it      went the case though grave was not doubtful made two copies and      went off before 6 with s herbert we separated for the evening      with the fervent wish that in public life we might never part  two or three letters exhibit the situation                       lord derby to mr gladstone       st jamess square feb 21 1858in consequence of the adverse      vote of the other night in which you took so prominent and      distinguished a part the government as you know has resigned      and i have been entrusted by the queen with the difficult task      which i have felt it my duty not to decline of forming an      administration in doing so i am very desirous if possible of      obtaining the cooperation of men of eminence who are not at this      moment fettered by other ties and whose principles are not      incompatible with my own believing that you stand in this      position it would afford me very great satisfaction if i could      obtain your valuable aid in forming my proposed cabinet and if i      should be so fortunate as to do so i am sure there would be on all      hands a sincere desire to consult your wishes as far as possible      as to the distribution of offices i would willingly include sidney      herbert in this offer but i fear he is too intimately associated      with john russell to make it possible for him to accept                       mr gladstone to lord derby       10 great george street feb 21 1851i am very sensible of the      importance of the vote taken on friday and i should deeply lament      to see the house of commons trampled on in consequence of that      vote the honour of the house is materially involved in giving it      full effect it would therefore be my first wish to aid if      possible in such a task and remembering the years when we were      colleagues i may be permitted to say that there is nothing in the      fact of your being the head of a ministry which would avail to      deter me from forming part of it       among the first questions i have had to put to myself in      consequence of the offer which you have conveyed in such friendly      and flattering terms has been the question whether it would be in      my power by accepting it either alone or in concert with others      to render you material service after the long years during which      we have been separated there would be various matters of public      interest requiring to be noticed between us but the question i      have mentioned is a needful preliminary upon the best      consideration which the moment allows i think it plain that alone      as i must be i could not render you service worth your having the      dissolution of last year excluded from parliament men with whom i      had sympathies and it in some degree affected the position of      those political friends with whom i have now for many years been      united through evil and much more rarely through good report      those who lament the rupture of old traditions may well desire the      reconstitution of a party but the reconstitution of a party can      only be effected if at all by the return of the old influences to      their places and not by the junction of an isolated person the      difficulty is even enhanced in my case by the fact that in your      party reduced as it is at the present moment in numbers there is      a small but active and not unimportant section who avowedly regard      me as the representative of the most dangerous ideas i should      thus unfortunately be to you a source of weakness in the heart of      your own adherents while i should bring you no party or group of      friends to make up for their defection or discontent       for the reasons which i have thus stated or glanced at my reply to      your letter must be in the negative       i must however add that a government formed by you at this time      will in my opinion have strong claims upon me and upon any one      situated as i am for favourable presumptions and in the absence      of conscientious difference on important questions for support i      have had an opportunity of seeing lord aberdeen and sidney herbert      and they fully concur in the sentiments i have just expressed                           letter from mr bright  mr gladstone had no close personal or political ties with the manchester men at this moment but we may well believe that a sagacious letter from mr bright made its mark upon his meditations                       mr bright to mr gladstone       reform club feb 21 58coming down park lane just now i met      a leading lawyer of lord derbys party who will doubtless be in      office with him if he succeeds in forming a government he told me      that lord derby and his friends were expecting to be able to induce      you to join them       will you forgive me if i write to you on this matter i say nothing      but in the most friendly spirit and i have some confidence that      you will not misinterpret what i am doing lord derby has only      about onethird of the house of commons with himand it is      impossible by any management or by any dissolution to convert      this minority into a majority his minority in the house is greater      and more powerful than it is in the countryand any appeal to the      country now or hereafter must i think leave him in no better      position than that in which he now finds himself the whole liberal      party in the country dislike him and they dislike his former      leader in the commons and notoriously his own party in the      country and in the house have not much confidence in him there      is no party in the country to rally round him as peel was      supported in 1841 a derby government can only exist upon      forbearance and will only last till it is convenient for us and      the whigs to overthrow it lord palmerston may give it his support      for a time but he can give it little more than his own vote and      speeches for the liberal constituencies will not forgive their      members if they support it if you join lord derby you link your      fortunes with a constant minority and with a party in the country      which is every day lessening in numbers and in power if you remain      on our side of the house you are with the majority and no      government can be formed without you you have many friends there      and some who would grieve much to see you leave themand i know      nothing that can prevent your being prime minister before you      approach the age of every other member of the house who has or can      have any claim to that high office       if you agree rather with the men opposite than with those among      whom you have been sitting of late i have nothing to say i am      sure you will follow where the right leads if you only discover      it and i am not hoping or wishing to keep you from the right i      think i am not mistaken in the opinion i have formed of the      direction in which your views have for some years been tending you      know well enough the direction in which the opinions of the country      are tending the minority which invites you to join it if honest      must go or wish to go in an opposite direction and it cannot      therefore govern the country will you unite yourself with what      must be from the beginning an inevitable failure       dont be offended if by writing this i seem to believe you will      join lord derby i dont believe itbut i can imagine your seeing      the matter from a point of view very different to mineand i feel      a strong wish just to say to you what is passing in my mind you      will not be the less able to decide on your proper course if i      thought this letter would annoy you i would not send it i think      you will take it in the spirit in which it is written no one knows      that i am writing it and i write it from no idea of personal      advantage to myself but with a view to yours and to the interests      of the country i may be mistaken but think i am not dont think      it necessary to reply to this i only ask you to read it and to      forgive me the intrusion upon youand further to believe that i am      yours with much respect                       mr gladstone to mr bright       10 great george street feb 22 58your letter can only bear      one construction that of an act of peculiar kindness which ought      not to be readily forgotten for any one in whom i might be      interested i should earnestly desire upon his entering public      life that if possible he might with a good conscience end in the      party where he began or else that he might have broad and definite      grounds for quitting it when neither of these advantages appears      to be certainly within command there remains a strong and      paramount consolation in seeking as we best can the truth and the      public interests and i think it a marked instance of liberality      that you should give me credit for keeping this object in my view       my seeking however has not on the present occasion been very      difficult the opinions such as they are that i hold on many      questions of government and administration are strongly held and      although i set a value and a high value upon the power which      office gives i earnestly hope never to be tempted by its exterior      allurements unless they are accompanied with the reasonable      prospect of giving effect to some at least of those opinions and      with some adequate opening for public good on the present      occasion i have not seen such a prospect and before i received      your letter yesterday afternoon i had made my choice  this ended the first scene of the short fifth act the new government was wholly conservative                                      ii                            uneasiness of friends  throughout the whole of this period mr gladstones political friends were uneasy about him he writes and says and does too much graham had told lord aberdeen dec 1856 and a year and a half later the same correspondent notices a restless anxiety for a change of position though at gladstones age and with his abilities he could not wonder at it mr gladstone was now approaching fifty graham was nearer seventy than sixty and aberdeen drawing on to seventyfive one of the most eminent of his friends confessed that he was amazed at a man of gladstones high moral sense of feeling being able to bear with dizzy i can only account for it on the supposition which i suppose to be the true one that personal dislike and distrust of palmerston is the one absorbing feeling with him i see no good ground for the violent personal prejudice which is the sole ruling motive of gladstones and grahams courseespecially when the alternative is such a man as dizzy then comes some angry language about that enigmatic personage which at this cooling distance of time need not here be transcribed at the end of 1856 lord aberdeen told mr gladstone that his position in the house was very peculiar with an admitted superiority of character and intellectual power above any other member i fear that you do not really possess the sympathy of the house at large while you have incurred the strong dislike of a considerable portion of lord derbys followers  things grew worse rather than better even friendly journalists in the spring of 1858 wrote of him as the most signal example that the present time affords of the man of speculation misplaced and lost in the labyrinth of practical politics they call him the chief orator and the weakest man in the house of commons he has exhibited at every stage traces of an unhappy incoherence which is making him a mere bedouin of parliament a noble being full of spirit and power but not to be tamed into the ordinary ways of civil life his sympathies hover in hopeless inconsistency between love for righteous national action good government freedom social and commercial reform and a hankering after a strong unassailable executive in the old obstructive tory sense he protests against unfair dealing with the popular voice in the principalities on the danube but when the popular voice on the thames demands higher honours for general havelock he resists it with the doctrine that the executive should be wholly free to distribute honours as it pleases he is loudly indignant against the supersession of parliament by diplomacy but when a motion is made directly pointing to the rightful influence of the house over foreign affairs he neither speaks nor votes is it not clear beyond dispute that his cannot be the will to direct nor the wisdom to guide the party of progress out of which the materials for the government of this country will have to be chosen371  in organs supposed to be inspired by disraeli mr gladstones fate is pronounced in different terms but with equal decision in phrases that must surely have fallen from the very lips of the oracle itself the public was told that cerebral natures men of mere intellect without moral passion are quite unsuited for governing mankind the days of the mere dialectician are over and the rulers of christendom are no longer selected from the serfs of aristotle without the emotions that soar and thrill and enkindle no man can attain a grand moral vision when mr gladstone aims at philosophy he only reaches casuistry he reasons like one of the sons of ignatius loyola what their society is to the jesuit his own individualism is to mr gladstone he supports his own interests as much from intellectual zeal as from selflove a shrewd observer is quoted looking on mr gladstone and mr sidney herbert sitting side by side the former with his rather saturnine face and straight black hair and the latter eminently handsome with his bright cold smile and subtlety of aspect i have often thought that i was beholding the jesuit of the closet really devout and the jesuit of the world ambitious artful and always on the watch for making his rapier thrusts mr gladstone in a word is extremely eminent but strangely eccentric a simeon stylites among the statesmen of his time372                      renewed proposal of office  in may an important vacancy occurred in the ministerial ranks by lord ellenboroughs resignation of the presidency of the board of control this became the occasion of a renewed proposal to mr gladstone he tells the story in a memorandum prepared may 22 for submission to aberdeen and graham whom lord derby urged him to consult       memorandum by mr gladstone submitted to lord aberdeen and sir      james graham may 22 58       secretlast week after mr cardwells notice but before the      debate began mr walpole after previously sounding sir william      heathcote to a similar effect called me aside in the lobby of the      house of commons and inquired whether i could be induced to take      office i replied that i thought that question put by him of his      own motionas he had described itwas one that i could hardly      answer it seemed plain i said that the actual situation was one      so entirely belonging to the government as it stood that they must      plainly work through it unchanged that the head of the government      was the only person who could make a proposal or put a question      about taking office in it i added however that my general views      were the same as in february       this morning i had a note from walpole asking for an appointment      and he called on me at four oclock accordingly he stated that he      came by authority of lord derby to offer me the board of control      or if i preferred it the colonial office that he had told lord      derby i should he thought be likely to raise difficulties on two      points first the separation from those who have been my friends      in public life secondly the leadership of the house of commons i      here interrupted him to say it must be in his option to speak or to      be silent on the latter of these subjects it was one which had      never been entertained or opened by me in connection with this      subject since the former of the two points had offered an absolute      preliminary bar to the acceptance of office he however explained      himself as follows that mr disraeli had stated his willingness to      surrender the leadership to sir james graham if he were disposed      to join the government but that the expressions he had used in his      speech of thursday373 apparently those with respect to parties      in the house and to office seemed to put it beyond the right of      the government to make any proposal to him he at the same time      spoke in the highest terms not only of the speech but of the      position in which he thought it placed sir james graham and he      left me to infer that there would have been but for the cause      named a desire to obtain his cooperation as leader of the house      of commons with respect to the proposal as one the acceptance of      which would separate me from my friends he hoped it was not so it      was one made to me alone the immediate vacancy being a single one      but the spirit in which it was made was a desire that it should be      taken to signify the wish of the government progressively to extend      its basis as far as it could be effected compatibly with      consistency in its opinions he added that judging from the past he      hoped he might assume that there was no active opposition to the      government on the part of my friends naming lord aberdeen sir      james graham and the duke of newcastle       i told him with respect to the leadership that i thought it      handsome on the part of mr disraeli to offer to waive it on behalf      of sir james graham that it was a subject which did not enter into      my decision for the reason i had stated and i hinted also that it      was one on which i could never negotiate or make stipulations it      was true i said i had no broad differences of principle from the      party opposite on the whole perhaps i differed more from lord      palmerston than from almost any one and this was more on account      of his temper and views of public conduct than of any political      opinions nay more it would be hard to show broad differences of      public principle between the government and the bench opposite                          renewed proposal of office       i said however that in my view the proposal which he had made to      me could not be entertained i felt the personal misfortune and      public inconvenience of being thrown out of party connection but a      man at the bottom of the well must not try to get out however      disagreeable his position until a rope or a ladder is put down to      him in this case my clear opinion was that by joining the      government i should shock the public sentiment and should make no      essential no important change in their position       i expressed much regret that accidental causes had kept back from      my view at the critical moment the real extent of lord derbys      proposals in february that i answered him then as an individual      with respect to myself individually i could not separate from      those with whom i had been acting all my life long in concert with      whom all the habits of my mind and my views of public affairs had      been formed to go into what might justly be called a cabinet of      strangers since it contained no man to whom i had ever been a      colleague with the single exception of lord derby and that twelve      or fourteen years ago       while i did not conceive that public feeling would or ought to      approve this separation on the other hand i felt that my      individual junction would and could draw no material accession of      strength to the cabinet he made the marked admission that if my      acceptance must be without the approval of friends that must      undoubtedly be an element of great weight in the case this showed      clearly that lord derby was looking to me in the first place and      then to others beyond me he did not however found upon this any      request and he took my answer as an absolute refusal his tone      was i need not say very cordial and i think i have stated all      that was material in the conversation except that he signified      they were under the belief that herbert entertained strong personal      feelings towards disraeli       returning home however at seven this evening i found a note from      walpole expressing lord derbys wish in the following words that      before you finally decide on refusing to accept the offer he has      made either of the colonies or of the india board he wishes you      would consult sir james graham and lord aberdeen in order to meet      this wish i have put down the foregoing statement  lord aberdeen agreed with mr gladstone that on the whole the balance inclined to no  graham in an admirable letter truly worthy of a wise affectionate and faithful friend said my judgment is on this occasion balanced like your own he ran through the catalogue of mr gladstones most intimate political friends the result was that he stood alone fixed party ties and active official duties would conduce to his present happiness and his future fame he might form an intimate alliance with lord derby with perfect honour his natural affinities were strong and his honest liberal tendencies would soon leaven the whole lump and bring it into conformity with the shape and body of the times as for the leadership in the commons graham had once thought that for gladstone to sit on the treasury bench with disraeli for his leader would be humiliation and dishonour later events had qualified this opinion of course the abdication of disraeli could not be made a condition precedent but the concession would somehow be made and in the commons preeminence would be gladstones be the conditions what they might in fine time was wearing fast away gladstone had reached the utmost vigour of his powers and present opportunities were not to be neglected in vain expectation of better                                     iii                          letter from mr disraeli  before this letter of grahams arrived an unexpected thing happened and mr disraeli himself advanced to the front of the stage his communication which opens and closes without the usual epistolary forms just as it is reproduced here marks a curious episode and sheds a strange light on that perplexing figure                          mr disraeli to mr gladstone  confidential       i think it of such paramount importance to the public interests      that you should assume at this time a commanding position in the      administration of affairs that i feel it a solemn duty to lay      before you some facts that you may not decide under a      misapprehension       our mutual relations have formed the great difficulty in      accomplishing a result which i have always anxiously desired       listen without prejudice to this brief narrative       in 1850 when the balanced state of parties in the house of commons      indicated the future i endeavoured through the medium of the late      lord londonderry and for some time not without hope to induce sir      james graham to accept the post of leader of the conservative      party which i thought would remove all difficulties       when he finally declined this office i endeavoured to throw the      game into your hands and your conduct then however unintentional      assisted me in my views       the precipitate ministry of 1852 baffled all this could we have      postponed it another year all might have been right       nevertheless notwithstanding my having been forced publicly into      the chief place in the commons and all that occurred in      consequence i was still constant to my purpose and in 1855      suggested that the leadership of the house should be offered to      lord palmerston entirely with the view of consulting your feelings      and facilitating your position       some short time back when the power of dissolution was certain      and the consequences of it such as in my opinion would be highly      favourable to the conservative party i again confidentially sought      sir james graham and implored him to avail himself of the      favourable conjuncture accept the post of leader in the h of c      and allow both of us to serve under him       he was more than kind to me and fully entered into the state of      affairs but he told me his course was run and that he had not      strength or spirit for such an enterprise       thus you see for more than eight years instead of thrusting      myself into the foremost place i have been at all times actively      prepared to make every sacrifice of self for the public good      which i have ever thought identical with your accepting office in      a conservative government       dont you think the time has come when you might deign to be      magnanimous       mr canning was superior to lord castlereagh in capacity in      acquirements in eloquence but he joined lord c when lord c was      lord liverpools lieutenant when the state of the tory party      rendered it necessary that was an enduring and on the whole not      an unsatisfactory connection and it certainly terminated very      gloriously for mr canning       i may be removed from the scene or i may wish to be removed from      the scene       every man performs his office and there is a power greater than      ourselves that disposes of all this       the conjuncture is very critical and if prudently yet boldly      managed may rally this country to be inactive now is on your      part a great responsibility if you join lord derbys cabinet you      will meet there some warm personal friends all its members are      your admirers you may place me in neither category but in that i      assure you you have ever been sadly mistaken the vacant post is      at this season the most commanding in the commonwealth if it were      not whatever office you filled your shining qualities would      always render you supreme and if party necessities retain me      formally in the chief post the sincere and delicate respect which      i should always offer you and the unbounded confidence which on      my part if you choose you could command would prevent your      feeling my position as anything but a form       think of all this in a kindly spirit these are hurried lines but      they are heartfelt i was in the country yesterday and must return      there today for a county dinner my direction is langley park      slough but on wednesday evening i shall be in townb disraeli      grosvenor gate may 25 1858  none of us i believe were ever able to persuade mr gladstone to do justice to disraelis novelsthe spirit of whim in them the ironic solemnity the historical paradoxes the fantastic glitter of dubious gems the grace of high comedy all in union with a social vision that often pierced deep below the surface in the comparative stiffness of mr gladstones reply on this occasion i seem to hear the same accents of guarded reprobation                        mr gladstone to mr disraeli       11 carlton house terrace may 25 58my dear sirthe      letter you have been so kind as to address to me will enable me i      trust to remove from your mind some impressions with which you      will not be sorry to part       you have given me a narrative of your conduct since 1850 with      reference to your position as leader of your party but i have      never thought your retention of that office matter of reproach to      you and on saturday last i acknowledged to mr walpole the      handsomeness of your conduct in offering to resign it to sir james      graham       you consider that the relations between yourself and me have proved      the main difficulty in the way of certain political arrangements      will you allow me to assure you that i have never in my life taken      a decision which turned upon those relations       you assure me that i have ever been mistaken in failing to place      you among my friends or admirers again i pray you to let me say      that i have never known you penurious in admiration towards any one      who had the slightest claim to it and that at no period of my      life not even during the limited one when we were in sharp      political conflict have i either felt any enmity towards you or      believed that you felt any towards me       at the present moment i am awaiting counsel which at lord derbys      wish i have sought but the difficulties which he wishes me to find      means of overcoming are broader than you may have supposed were i      at this time to join any government i could not do it in virtue of      party connections i must consider then what are the conditions      which make harmonious and effective cooperation in cabinet      possiblehow largely old habits enter into themwhat connections      can be formed with public approvaland what change would be      requisite in the constitution of the present government in order      to make any change worth a trial       i state these points fearlessly and without reserve for you have      yourself well reminded me that there is a power beyond us that      disposes of what we are and do and i find the limits of choice in      public life to be very narrowi remain etc                         the second derby government  the next day mr gladstone received grahams letter already described the interpretation that he put upon it was that although graham appeared to lean in favour of acceptance yet the counsel was indecisive on ordinary construction though the counsellor said that this was a case in which only the man himself could decide yet he also said that acceptance would be for the public good your affirmative advice had it even been more positive was not approval nor was lord aberdeens on the contrary it would have been like the orders to balaam that he should go with the messengers of balak when notwithstanding the command the act was recorded against him we may be quite sure that when a man draws all these distinctions between affirmative advice positive advice approval he is going to act without any advice at all as mr gladstone was in so grave a case bound to do he declined to join                         mr gladstone to lord derby       private        11 ch terrace may 26 58i have this morning received      sir james grahams reply and i have seen lord aberdeen before and      since their counsel has been given in no narrow or unfriendly      spirit it is however indecisive and leaves upon me the      responsibility which they would have been glad if it had been in      their power to remove i must therefore adhere to the reply which i      gave to mr walpole on saturday for i have not seen and i do not      see a prospect of public advantage or of material accession to      your strength from my entering your government singlehanded       had it been in your power to raise fully the question whether those      who were formerly your colleagues could again be brought into      political relation with you i should individually have thought it      to be for the public good that under the present circumstances of      the country such a scheme should be considered deliberately and in      a favourable spirit but i neither know that this is in your power      nor can i feel very sanguine hopes that the obstacles in the way of      this proposal on the part of those whom it would embrace could be      surmounted lord aberdeen is the person who could best give a      dispassionate and weighty opinion on that subject for me the      question confined as it is to myself is a narrow one and i am      bound to say that i arrive without doubt at the result                                    refusal  i hope and trust said graham when he knew what mr gladstone had done that you have decided rightly my judgment inclined the other way i should be sorry if your letter to lord derby led him to make any more extended proposal it could not possibly succeed as matters now stand and the abortive attempt would be injurious to him the reconstruction of the fossil remains of the old peel party is a hopeless task no human power can now reanimate it with the breath of life it is decomposed into atoms and will be remembered only as a happy accident while it lasted374                                       iv                                  suez canal  in one remarkable debate of this summer the solitary statesman descended from his pillar now was the time of the memorable scheme for the construction of the suez canal that first emanated from the french group of saint simonian visionaries in the earlier half of the century their dream had taken shape in the fertile and persevering genius of lesseps and was at this time the battleground of engineers statesmen and diplomatists in every country in europe for fifteen years the british government had used all their influence at constantinople to prevent the sultan from sanctioning the project in june a motion of protest was made in the house of commons lord palmerston persisted that the scheme was the greatest bubble that ever was imposed upon the credulity and simplicity of the people of this country the public meetings on its behalf were got up by a pack of foreign projectors traffic by the railway would always beat traffic by steamer through the canal it would be a step towards the dismemberment of the turkish empire it would tend to dismember our own empire by opening a passage between the mediterranean and the indian ocean which would be at the command of other nations and not at ours away then with such a sacrifice of the interest of great britain to philanthropic schemes and philosophic reveries so much for the sound practical man mr gladstone followed dont let us he said have governments and exgovernments coming down to instruct us here on bubble schemes as a commercial project let the suez canal stand or fall upon commercial grounds with close reasoning he argued against the proposition that the canal would tend to sever turkey from egypt as to possible danger to our own interests was it not a canal that would fall within the control of the strongest maritime power in europe and what could that power be but ourselves finally what could be more unwise than to present ourselves to the world as the opponents of a scheme on the face of it beneficial to mankind on no better ground than remote and contingent danger to interests of our own with the alleged interest of turkey merely thrust hypocritically in for the purpose of justifying a policy purely narrowminded and wholly selfish the majority against the motion was large as it was in the case of the seven cardinals against galileo still the canal was made with some very considerable consequences that were not foreseen either by those who favoured it or those who mocked it as a bubble m de lesseps wrote to mr gladstone from constantinople that the clearness of his speech had enabled him to use it with good effect in his negotiations with the porte your eloquent words the authority of your name and the consideration that attaches to your character have already contributed much and will contribute more still to hinder the darkening and complication of a question of itself perfectly clear and simple and to avoid the troubling of the relations between two countries of which it is the natural mission to hold aloft together the flag of modern civilisation  mr gladstone took an active interest in the various measuressome of them extremely singularproposed by mr disraeli for the transfer of the government of india from the company to the crown writing early in the year to sir james graham he argued that their object should be steadily and vigorously to resist all attempts at creating a monster military and civil patronage and to insist upon a real check on the indian minister he had much conversation with mr brightnot then an intimate acquaintanceon the difficulty of the problem to govern a people by a people the two agreed strongly as to one prominent possibility of mischief they both distrusted the discretion confided to the indian minister in the use of the indian army mr gladstone set a mark upon the bill by carrying a clause to provide that the indian army should not be employed beyond the frontiers of india without the permission of parliament this clause he privately hoped would afford a standingground from which a control might be exercised on future palmerstons  footnotes  369 the portion within brackets is from a letter of mr gladstones to lady lyndhurst aug 31 1883 and he continues i have often compared lord lyndhurst in my own mind with the five other lord chancellors who since his time have been my colleagues in cabinet much to the disadvantage in certain respects of some of them once i remember in the peel cabinet the conversation happened to touch some man there are such who was too fond of making difficulties peel said to your husband that is not your way lyndhurst of all the intellects i have ever known his i think worked with the least friction  370 happily for the reputation of the house but unhappily for the ministry the debate assumed once more with gladstones eloquence a statesmanlike character the foremost speaker of the house

islands                              18581859       the world is now taking an immense interest in greek affairs and      does not seem to know why but there are very good reasons for it      greece is a centre of life and the only possible centre for the      archipelago and its immediate neighbourhood but it is vain to      think of it as a centre from which light and warmth can proceed      until it has attained to a tolerable organisation political and      economical i believe in the capacity of the people to receive the      boongladstone 1862                              proposal from bulwer  at the beginning of october while on a visit to lord aberdeen at haddo mr gladstone was amazed by a letter from the secretary of state for the coloniesone of the two famous writers of romance then in lord derbys cabinetwhich opened to him the question of undertaking a special mission to the ionian islands this said bulwer lytton would be to render to the crown a service that no other could do so well and that might not inharmoniously blend with his general fame as scholar and statesman to reconcile a race that speaks the greek language to the science of practical liberty seemed to me a task that might be a noble episode in your career the origin of an invitation so singular is explained by phillimore       november 2nd 1858lord carnarvon then undersecretary at the      colonial office sent an earnest letter to me to come to the co      and advise with rogers and himself as to drawing the commission i      met bulwer lytton there overflowing with civility the offer to      gladstone had arisen as i expected from lord c and he had told b      l the conversation which he c and i had together in the summer      in which i told lord c that i thought gladstone would accept a      mission extraordinary to naples i risked without authority      from g this communication lord c bore it in mind and from this      suggestion of mine sprang in fact this offer so lord c said to      me  lord malmesbury very sensibly observed that to send mr gladstone to naples was out of the question in view of his famous letters to lord aberdeen to the new proposal mr gladstone replied that his first impulse on any call from a minister of the crown to see him on public business would be to place himself at the ministers disposal the interview did not occur for a week or two papers were sent from the colonial office to hawarden long letters followed from the secretary of state and mr gladstone took time to consider the constitution of the ionian islands had long been working uneasily and what the colonial secretary invited him to undertake was an inquiry on the spot into our relations there and into longstanding embarrassments that seemed to be rapidly coming to a head sir john young then lord high commissioner of the ionian islands had been with him at eton and at oxford besides being a peelite colleague in parliament and mr gladstone was not inclined to be the instrument of indicating disparagement of his friend then moreover he was in favour of a very liberal policy in regard to the ionian islands and possibly the cabinet did not agree to a very liberal policy as for personal interest and convenience he was not disposed to raise any difficulty in such a case  the peelite colleagues whose advice he sought were all with the single exception of the duke of newcastle more or less unconditionally adverse lord aberdeen october 8 admitted that mr gladstones name acquirements and conciliatory character might operate powerfully on the ionians still many of them were false and artful and the best of them little better than children it is clear he said that bulwer has sought to allure you with vague declarations and the attractions of homeric propensities i doubt if homer will be a cheval de bataille sufficiently strong to carry you safely through the intricacies of this enterprise the sagacious graham also warned him that little credit would be gained by success while failure would be attended by serious inconveniences in any case to quell a storm in a teapot was no occupation worthy of his powers and position sidney herbert was strong that governments were getting more and more into the bad habit of delegating their own business to other people he doubted success and expressed his hearty wish that we could be quit of the protectorate altogether and could hand the islands bodily over to greece to which by blood language religion and geography they belonged  i have said that these adverse views were almost unqualified and such qualification as existed was rather remarkable the only part of the affair i should regard with real pleasure wrote lord aberdeen would be the means it might afford you of drawing closer to the government and of naturally establishing yourself in a more suitable position for in spite of homer and ulysses your ionian work will by no means be tanti in itself graham took the same point an approximation to the government may be fairly sought or admitted by you but this should take place on higher grounds thus though he was now in fact unconsciously on the eve of his formal entry into a liberal cabinet expectations still survived that he might rejoin his old party  as might have been expected the wanderings of ulysses and the geography of homer prevailed in mr gladstones mind over the counsels of parliamentary nestors besides the ancient heroes there was the fascination of the orthodox church so peculiar and so irresistible for the anglican school to which mr gladstone belonged nor must we leave out of account the passion for public business so often allied with the students temperament the desire of the politician out of work for something definite to do mr gladstones keen relish at all times for any foreign travel that came in his way finally and perhaps strongest of all the fact that his wifes health had been much shaken by the death of her sister lady lyttelton and the doctors were advising change of scene novel interests and a southern climate his decision was very early a foregone conclusion so his doubting friends could only wish him good fortune graham said if your hand be destined to lay the foundation of a greek empire on the ruins of the ottoman no hand can be more worthy no work more glorious recidiva manu posuissem pergama was a noble aspiration375 with you it may be realised                              mission accepted  he hastened to enlist the services as secretary to his commission of mr lacaita whose friendship he had first made seven years before as we have seen amid the sinister tribunals and squalid dungeons of naples for dealings with the grecoitalian population of the islands he seemed the very man as regards greek mr gladstone wrote to him you are one of the few persons to whom one gives credit for knowing everything and i assumed on this ground that you had a knowledge of ancient greek such as would enable you easily to acquire the kind of acquaintance with the modern form such as is i presume desirable that is my own predicament with the additional disadvantage of our barbarous english pronunciation accompanied by mrs gladstone and their eldest daughter and with mr arthur gordon the son of lord aberdeen and now after long service to the state known as lord stanmore for private secretary mr gladstone left england on november 8 1858 and he returned to it on the 8th of march 1859                                    ii                            the ionian case  the ionian case was this by a treaty made at paris in november 1815 between great britain russia austria and prussia the seven islandsscattered along the coast from epiros to the extreme south of the moreawere constituted into a single free and independent state under the name of the united states of the ionian islands and this state was placed under the immediate and exclusive protection of great britain the powers only thought of keeping the islands out of more dubious hands and cared little or not at all about conferring any advantage upon either us or the ionians the states were to regulate their own internal organisation and great britain was to employ a particular solicitude with regard to the legislation and general administration of those states and was to appoint a lord high commissioner to reside there with all necessary powers and authorities the duke of wellington foretold that it would prove a tough and unprofitable job and so in truth it did a constitutional charter in 1817 formed a system of government that soon became despotic enough to satisfy metternich himself the scheme has been justly described as a singularly clever piece of work appearing to give much while in fact giving nothing at all it contained a decorous collection of chapters sections and articles imposing enough in their outer aspect but in actual operation the whole of them reducible to a single clause enabling the high commissioner to do whatever he pleased  this rough but not illnatured despotism lasted for little more than thirty years and then in 1849 under the influence of the great upheaval of 1848 it was changed into a system of more popular and democratic build the old venetians when for a couple of centuries they were masters in this region laid it down that the islanders must be kept with their teeth drawn and their claws clipped bread and the stick said father paul that is what they want this view prevailed at the colonial office and maxims of father paul sarpis sort incongruously combined with a paper constitution worked as ill as possible mr gladstone always applied to the new system of 1849 charles bullers figure of first lighting the fire and then stopping up the chimney the stick may be wholesome and local selfgovernment may be wholesome but in combination or rapid alternation they are apt to work nothing but mischief either in ionian or any other islands sir charles napierthe napier of scindewho had been resident in cephalonia thirty years before in byrons closing days describes the richer classes as lively and agreeable the women as having both beauty and wit but of little education the poor as hardy industrious and intelligentall full of pleasant humour and vivacity with a striking resemblance says napier to his countrymen the irish the upper class was mainly italian in origin and willingly threw all the responsibility for affairs on the british government the official class more numerous in proportion to population than in any country in europe scrambled for the petty salaries of paltry posts allotted by popular election since 1849 they had increased by twentyfive per cent and were now one in a hundred of the inhabitants the clergy in a passive way took part with the demagogues men of ability and sense were not wanting but being unorganised discouraged and saturated with distrust they made no effort to stem the jobbery corruption waste going on around them roads piers aqueducts and other monuments of the british protectorate reared before 1849 were falling to pieces taxes were indifferently collected transgressors of local law went unpunished in ten years the deficit in the revenue had amounted to nearly £100000 or twothirds of a years income the cultivators of the soil figured in official reports as naturally well affected and only wishing to grow their currants and their olives in peace and quietness but they were extremely poor and they were ignorant and superstitious and being all these things it was inevitable that they should nurse discontent with their government whoever wanted their votes knew that the way to get them was to denounce the englishman as greek heterodoxos kai xenos heretic alien and tyrant there was a senate of six members chosen by the high commissioner from the assembly the fortytwo members of the assembly met below galleries that held a thousand persons and nothing made their seats and salaries so safe as round declamations from the floor to the audience above on the greatness of the hellenic race and the need for union with the greek kingdom the municipal officer in charge of education used to set as a copy for the children a prayer that panhellenic concord might drive the turks out of greece and the english out of the seven islands  cephalonia exceeded the rest of the group both in population and in vehemence of character while zante came first of all in the industry and liveliness of its people376 these two islands were the main scene and source of difficulty in cephalonia nine years before the date with which we are now dealing an agrarian rising had occurred more like a bad whiteboy outrage than a national rebellion and it was suppressed with cruel rigour by the high commissioner of the day twentytwo people had been hanged three hundred or more had been flogged most of them without any species of judicial investigation the fireraisings and destruction of houses and vineyards were of a fierce brutality to match these ionian atrocities were the proceedings with which prince schwarzenberg had taunted lord aberdeen by way of rejoinder to mr gladstones letters on barbarous misgovernment in naples and the feelings that they had roused were still smouldering half a dozen newspapers existed all of them vehemently and irreconcilably unionist though all controlled by members of the legislative assembly who had taken an oath at the beginning of each parliament to respect and maintain the constitutional rights of the protecting sovereign the liberty of unlicensed printing however had been subject to a pretty stringent check by virtue of what was styled a power of high police the lord high commissioner was able at his own will and pleasure to tear away from home occupation and livelihood anybody that he chose and the high police found its commonest objects in the editors of newspapers an obnoxious leading article was not infrequently followed by deportation to some small and barren rock inhabited by a handful of fishermen not cherubim and seraphim said mr gladstone could work such a system a british corporal with all the patronage in his hands said another observer would get on better than the greatest and wisest statesman since pericles if he had not the patronage it was little wonder that a distracted lord high commissioner to adopt the similes of the florid secretary of state should one day send home a picture like salvators massacre of the innocents or michel angelos last judgment and the next day recall the swains of albano at repose in the landscapes of claude should one day advise his chiefs to wash their hands of the ionians and on the morrow should hint that perhaps the best thing would be by a bold coup détat to sweep away the constitution377                                     iii                            the stolen despatch  immediately after mr gladstone had started what the secretary of state described as the most serious misfortune conceivable happened a despatch was stolen from the pigeonholes of the colonial office and a morning paper printed it it had been written home some eighteen months before by sir john young and in it he advised his government with the assent of the contracting powers to hand over either the whole of the seven islands to greece or else at least the five southern islands while transforming corfu and its little satellite of paxo into a british colony it was true that a few days later he had written a private letter wholly withdrawing this advice and substituting for it the exact opposite the suppression namely of such freedom as the islanders possessed this second fact the public did not know nor would the knowledge of it have made any difference the published despatch stood on record and say what they would the startling impression could not be effaced well might lytton call it an inconceivable misfortune it made austria uneasy it perturbed france and it irritated russia all of them seeing in mr gladstones mission a first step towards the policy recommended in the despatch in the breasts of the islanders it kindled intense excitement and diversified a chronic disorder by a sharp access of fever it made youngs position desperate though he was slow to see it and practically it brought the business of the high commissioner extraordinary to nought before it had even begun  he learned the disaster for disaster it was at vienna and appears to have faced it with the same rigorous firmness and selfcommand that some of us have beheld at untoward moments long after the ambassador told him that he ought to see the austrian minister with count buol he had a long interview accordingly and assured him that his mission had no concern with any question of ionian annexation whether partial or total count buol on his part disclaimed all aggressive tendencies in respect of turkey and stated emphatically that the views and conduct of austria in her eastern policy were in the strictest sense conservative  embarking at trieste on the warship terrible nov 21 and after a delightful voyage down the adriatic five days after leaving vienna nov 24th mr gladstone found himself at corfuthe famous island of which he had read such memorable things in thucydides and xenophon the harbour where the athenians had fitted out the expedition to syracuse so disastrous to greek democracy where the young octavian had rallied his fleet before the battle of actium so critical for the foundation of the empire of the cæsars and whence don john had sallied forth for the victory of lepanto so fatal to the conquering might of the ottoman turks it was from corfu that the brothers bandiera had started on their tragic enterprise for the deliverance of italy fourteen years before mr gladstone landed under a salute of seventeen guns and was received with all ceremony and honour by the lord high commissioner and his officers                           arrival at corfu  he was not long in discovering what mischief the stolen despatch had done and may well have suspected from the first in his inner mind that his efforts to undo it would bear little fruit the morning after his arrival the ten members for corfu came to him in a body with a petition to the queen denouncing the plan of making their island a british colony and praying for union with greece the municipality followed suit in the evening the whole sequel was in keeping mr gladstone with youngs approval made a speech to the senate in which he threw over the despatch severed his mission wholly from any purpose or object in the way of annexation and dwelt much upon a circular addressed by the foreign office in london to all its ministers abroad disclaiming any designs of that kind he held levees he called upon the archbishop he received senators and representatives and everywhere he held the same emphatic language he soon saw enough to convince him of the harm done to british credit and influence by the severities in cephalonia by the small regard and frequent contempt shown by many englishmen for the religion of the people for whose government they were responsible by the diatribes in the london press against the ionians as brigands pirates and barbarians and by the absence in high commissioners and others of tact good sense and good feeling in the sense in which it is least common in england the sense namely in which it includes a disposition to enter into and up to a certain point sympathise with those who differ with us in race language and creed perhaps his penetrating eye early discovered to him that forty years of bad rule had so embittered feeling that even without the stolen despatch he had little chance  he made a cruise round the islands his visit shook him a good deal with respect to two of the pointscorfu and ithacaon which it has been customary to dwell as proving homers precise local knowledge the rain poured in torrents for most of the time but it cleared up for a space to reveal the loveliness of ithaca in the island of ulysses and penelope he danced at a ball given in his honour in cephalonia he was received by a tumultuous mob of a thousand persons whom neither the drenching rains nor the unexpected manner of his approach across the hills could baffle they greeted him with incessant cries for union with greece thrust disaffected papers into his carriage and here and there indulged in cries of greek katô ê prostasia down with the protectorate down with the tyranny of fifty years this exceptional disrespect he ascribed to what he leniently called the history of cephalonia meaning the savage dose of martial law nine years before he justly took it for a marked symbol of the state of excitement at which under various influences the popular mind had arrived age and infirmity prevented the archbishop from coming to offer his respects so after his levee mr gladstone with his suite repaired to the archbishop we found him says mr gordon seated on a sofa dressed in his most gorgeous robes of gold and purple over which flowed down a long white beard behind him stood a little court of blackrobed blackbearded blackcapped darkfaced priests he is eightysix years old and his manners and appearance were dignified in the extreme speaking slowly and distinctly he began to tell gladstone that the sole wish of cephalonia was to be united to greece and there was something very exciting and affecting in the tremulous tones of the old man saying over and over again questa infelice isola questa isola infelice as the tears streamed down his cheeks and long silvery beard it was like a scene in a play  at zante dec 15 the surface was smoother a concourse of several thousands awaited him greek flags were flying on all sides in the strong morning seabreeze the town bands played greek national tunes the bells were all ringing the harbour was covered with boats full of gaily dressed people and the air resounded with loud shouts greek zêtô ho philellên gladstôn zêtô hê henôsis meta tês hellados long live gladstone the philhellene hurrah for union with greece       every room and passage in the residency mr gordon writes to lord      aberdeen was already thronged upstairs the excitement was      great and as soon as gladstone had taken his place in swept      gerasimus the bishop followed by scores of swarthy priests in      their picturesque black robes and tendered to him the petition for      union but before he could deliver it gladstone stopped him and      addressed to him and to the assembly a speech in excellent italian      never did i hear his beautiful voice ring out more clear or more      thrillingly than when he said ecco l inganno it was a      scene not to be forgotten the priests with eye and hand and      gesture expressed in lively pantomime to each other the effect      produced by each sentence in what we should think a most      exaggerated way like a chorus on the stage but the effect was      most picturesque                              visits athens  he attended a banquet one night went to the theatre the next where he was greeted with lusty zetos and at midnight embarked on the terrible on his way to athens his stay in the immortal city only lasted for three or four days and i find no record of his impressions they were probably those of most travellers educated enough to feel the spell of the violet crown illusions as to the eternal summer with which poets have blessed the isles of greece vanished as they found deep snow in the streets icicles on the acropolis and snowballing in the parthenon he had a reception only a shade less cordial than if he were demosthenes come back he dined with king otho and went to a te deum in honour of the queens birthday finlay the learned man who had more of the true spirit of history than most historians then alive took him to a meeting of the legislature he beheld some of the survivors of the war of independence and made friends with one valiant lover of freedom the veteran general church though thanks to the generosity of an englishman they had a university of their own at corfu the ionians preferred to send their sons to athens and the athenian students immediately presented a memorial to mr gladstone with the usual prayer for union with the hellenic kingdom on the special object of his visit he came away from athens with the impression that opinion in greece was much divided on the question of immediate union with the ionian islands in truth his position had been a false one everybody was profoundly deferential but nobody was quite sure whether he had come to pave the way for union or to invite the athenian government to check it and when rangabé the foreign minister found him without credentials or instructions and staved off all discussion mr gladstone must have felt that though he had seen one of the two or three most wondrous historic sites on the globe that was all                                 in albania  of a jaunt to wilder scenes a letter of mr arthur gordons gives a pleasant glimpse       you will like an account of an expedition the whole party made      yesterday to albania to pay a visit to an old lady a great      proprietress who lives in a large ruinous castle at a place called      filates she is about the greatest personage in these regions and      it was thought that the lord high commissioner should pay her a      visit if he wished to see albania it was a lovely morning and      breakfast was laid on the balcony of the private apartments looking      over the garden and commanding the loveliest of views across the      strait gladstone was in the highest spirits full of talk and      romping boyishly after breakfast the lhcs barge and the      cutters of the terrible conveyed us on board the pretty little      gunboat       we reached sayada in about two hours and were received on landing      by the governor of the province who had ridden down from filates      to meet us we went to the house of the english viceconsul whilst      the long train of horses was preparing to start but after a few      minutes stay there gladstone became irrepressibly restless and      insisted on setting off to walki of course walked too the old      steward also went with us and a guard of eight whitekilted      palikari on foot the rest of the party rode and from a slight      hill which we soon reached it was very pretty to look back at the      long procession starting from sayada and proceeding along the      narrow causeway running parallel to our path the figures      silhouetted against the sea filates is about 12 miles from sayada      perhaps more the path is rugged and mountainous and commands some      fine views our palikari guards fired off their long afghanlooking      guns in every direction greatly to gladstones annoyance but      there was no stopping them       scouts on the hills gave warning of our approach and at the      entrance to filates we were met by the whole population first the      validehs retainers then the elders then the moolahs in their      great green turbans the christian community and finally on the      top of the hill the validehs little grandson gorgeously dressed      and attended by his tutor and a number of black slaves the little      boy salaamed to gladstone with much grace and selfpossession and      then conducted us to the castle in front of which all the      townsfolk who were not engaged in receiving us were congregated in      picturesque groups on the smooth grassy lawns and under the great      plane trees the castle is a large ruinous enclosure of walls and      towers with buildings of all sorts and ages within the valideh      herself attired in green silk and a fur pelisse her train held by      two negro female slaves received us at the head of the stairs and      ushered us into a large room with a divan round three sides of it      sweetmeats and water and pipes and coffee were brought as usual      some of the cups and their filigree stands very handsome we went      out to see the town preceded by a tall black slave in a gorgeous      blue velvet jacket with a great silver stick in his hand under      his guidance we visited the khans the bazaar and the mosque not      only were we allowed to enter the mosque with our shoes on but on      gladstone expressing a wish to hear the call to prayer the muezzin      was sent up to the top of the minaret to call the azan two hours      before the proper time the sight of the greenturbaned imam crying      the azan for a frank was most singular and the endless variety of      costume displayed by the crowds who thronged the verandahs which      surround the mosque was most picturesque the gateway of the castle      too was a picturesque scene retainers and guards slaves and      soldiers and even women were lounging about and a beautiful tame      little pet roedeer played with the pretty children in bright      coloured dresses clustering under the cavernous archway       we had dinner in another large room i counted thirtytwo dishes      or i may say courses for each dish at a turkish dinner is brought      in separately and it is rude not to eat of all the most      picturesque part of the dinner and most unusual was the way the      room was lighted eight tall grand albanians stood like statues      behind us each holding a candle it reminded me of the      torchbearers who won the laird his bet in the legend of      montrose       after dinner there was a long and somewhat tedious interval of      smoking and storytelling in the dark and we called upon lacaita      to recite italian poetry which he did with much effect pouring      out sonnet after sonnet of petrarch including that which my father      thinks the most beautiful in the italian language that which has      in it the campeggiar del angelico riso this showed me how easy      it was to fall into the habits of a country gladstone is as      unoriental as any man well can be yet his calling on lacaita to      recite was really just the same thing that every pasha does after      dinner when he orders his taleteller to repeat a story the      ladies meanwhile were packed off to the harem for the night lady      bowen acting as their interpreter my lhc his two      secretaries his three aidedecamps captains blomfield and      clanricarde and the viceconsul all slept in the same room and      that not a large one and we were packed tight on the floor under      quilts of brusa silk and gold tucked up round us by gorgeous      albanians gladstone amused himself with speculating whether or no      we were in contravention of the provisions of lord shaftesburys      lodginghouse act       after a month of cloudless sunshine it took it into its head to      rain this night of all nights in the year and rain as it only does      in these regions gladstone and i walked down again despite of      wind rain and mud and our palikari guardto keep up their      spirits i supposechanted wild choruses all the way we nearly      got stuck altogether in the muddy flat near sayada and got on      board the osprey wet through my hands so chilled i could hardly      steer the boat of course we had far outwalked the riding party so      we had to wait what a breakfast we ate that is those of us who      could eat for the passage was rough and gladstone and the ladies      flat on their backs and very sorry for themselves  mr gladstones comment in his diary is brief the whole impression is saddening it is all indolence decay stagnation the image of god seems as if it were nowhere but there is much of wild and picturesque the english in the island both civil and military adopted the tone of unfriendly journals in london and the garrison went so far as not even to invite mr gladstone to mess a compliment never omitted before the ionians on the other hand like people in most other badly governed countries did not show in the noblest colours there were petitions letters memorials as to which mr gladstone mildly notes that he has to lament a spirit of exaggeration and obvious errors of fact there was a stream of demands from hosts of spiridiones christodulos euphrosunes for government employ and the memorial survives attested by bishop and clergy of a man with a daughter to marry who being too poor to find a dowry had decided on reverting to your excellencys wellknown philhellenism and with tears in his eyes besought that your excellency et cetera                       correspondence with bulwer  one incident was much disliked at home as having the fearsome flavour of the puseyite it had been customary at levees for the lord high commissioner to bow to everybody but also to shake hands with the bishops and sundry other high persons mr gladstone stooped and actually kissed the bishops hand sir edward lytton inquired if the story were true as a question might be asked in parliament it is true said mr gladstone february 7 but i hope sir e l will not in his consideration for me entangle himself in such a matter but as he knows nothing now will continue to know nothing and will say that the subject did not enter into his instructions and that he presumes i shall be at home in two or three more weeks to answer for all my misdeeds378  the secretary of state and his potent emissarythe radical who had turned tory and the tory who was on the verge of formally turning liberalgot on excellently together though he was not exact in business the ministers despatches and letters show shrewdness good sense and right feeling with a copious garnish of flummery demagogy he says to mr gladstone will continue to be a trade and the most fascinating of all trades because animated by personal vanity and its venality disguised even to the demagogue himself by the love of country by which it may be really accompanied the ionian constitution should certainly be mended for my convictions tell me that there is nothing so impracticable as the unreal he comforts his commissioner by the reminder that a population after all has one great human heart and a great human heart is that which chiefly exalts the man of genius over the mere man of talent so that when a man of genius with practical experience of the principles of sound government comes face to face with a people whose interest it is to be governed well the chances are that they will understand each other                                   iv  mr gladstone applied himself with the utmost gravity to the affairs of a pygmy state with a total population under 250000 his imagination did its work while you seem he said most truly to be dealing only with a few specks scarcely visible on the map of europe you are engaged in solving a problem as delicate and difficult as if it arose on a far more conspicuous stage the people he found to be eminently gifted by nature with that subtlety which is apt to degenerate into sophistry and prone to be both rather lightminded and extremely suspicious the permanent officials in downing street with less polite analysis had been accustomed to regard the islanders more bluntly as a pack of scamps this was what had done the mischief the material condition of the cultivators was in some respects not bad but mr gladstone laid down a profound and solid principle when he said that no method of dealing with a civilised community can be satisfactory which does not make provision for its political action as well as its social state379 the idea of political reform had for a time made head against the idea of union with the greek kingdom but for some years past the whole stream of popular tendency and feeling set strongly towards union and disdained contentment with anything else mankind turn naturally to the solutions that seem the simplest mr gladstone condemned the existing system as bad for us and bad for them circumstances made it impossible for him to suggest amendment by throwing the burden bodily off our shoulders and at that time he undoubtedly regarded union with greece as in itself undesirable for the ionians circumstances and his own love of freedom made it equally impossible to recommend the violent suppression of the constitution the only course left open was to turn the mockery of free government into a reality and this operation he proposed to carry out with a bold hand the details of this enlargement of popular rights and privileges and the accompanying financial purgation do not now concern us whether the case either demanded or permitted originality in the way of construction i need not discuss the manufacture of a constitution is always the easiest thing in the world the question is whether the people concerned will work it and in spite of that buoyant optimism which never in any circumstances deserted him in respect of whatever business he might have in hand mr gladstone must have doubted whether his islanders would ever pretend to accept what they did not seek as a substitute for what they did seek but were not allowed to have before anybody knew the scope of his plan the six newspapers flew to arms with a vivacity that whether it was italian or was greek was in either case a fatal sign of the public temper what they cried did the treaty of 1815 mean by describing the ionian state as free and independent what was a protectorate and what the rights of the protector was there no difference between a protector and a sovereign what could be more arrogant and absurd than that the protector who was not sovereign should talk about conceding reforms to a free and independent state all these questions were in themselves not very easy to answer but what was a more serious obstacle than the argumentative puzzles of partisans was a want of moral and political courage was the sycophancy of one class and the greediness of others380                        constitutional reform  closely connected with the recommendations of constitutional reform was the question by whom the necessary communications with the assembly were to be conducted sir john young was obviously impossible though he was not at once brought to face the fact mr gladstone upon this made to the colonial secretary december 27 an offer that if he had already determined on youngs recall and if he thought reform would stand a better chance if introduced by mr gladstone himself he was willing to serve as lord high commissioner for the very limited time that might be necessary we may be sure that the government lost not an hour in making up their minds on a plan that went still further both in the way of bringing mr gladstone into still closer connection with them and towards relieving themselves of a responsibility which they never from the first had any business to devolve upon mr gladstone or anybody else the answer came by telegraph january 11 the queen accepts your commission is being made out  all other embarrassments were now infinitely aggravated by the sudden discovery from the lawyers that acceptance of the new office not only vacated the seat in parliament but also rendered mr gladstone incapable of election until he had ceased to hold the office this i must confess he told sir edward is a great blow the difficulty and the detriment are serious january 17 if some enemy on the meeting of the house in february should choose to move the writ for the vacant seat at oxford the election would necessarily take place at a date too early for the completion of the business at corfu and mr gladstone still at work as high commissioner would still therefore be ineligible nobody was ever by constitution more averse than mr gladstone to turning backward and in this case he felt himself especially bound to go forward not only by the logic of the ionian situation at the moment but for the reason which was also characteristic of him that the queen in approving his appointment january 7 had described his conduct as both patriotic and most opportune and therefore he thought there would be unspeakable shabbiness in turning round upon her by a hurried withdrawal the oxford entanglement thus became almost desperate resolved not to disturb the settled order of proceeding with his assembly mr gladstone with a thoroughly characteristic union of ingenuity and tenacity tried various ways of extrication to complete the mortifications of the position the telegraph broke down                     question of the oxford seat  the scrape was nearly as harassing to his friends at home as to himself politicians above all men can never safely count on the charity that thinketh no evil lord john russell told lord aberdeen that it was clear that gladstone was staying away to avoid a discussion on the coming reform bill there was a violent attack upon him in the times january 13 as having supplanted young the writers of leading articles looked up greek history from the days of the visit of ulysses to alcinous downwards and they mocked his respect for the countrymen of miltiades and his reverence for the church of chrysostom and athanasius the satirists of the cleverest journal of the day admitted his greatness the brilliance and originality of his finance the incomparable splendour of his eloquence and a courage equal to any undertaking that quailed before no opposition and suffered no abatement in defeat and they only marvelled the more that a statesman of the first rank should accept at the hands of an insidious rival a fifthrate missioninsidious rival not named but easy to identify the fact that mr gladstone had hired a house at corfu was the foundation of a transcendent story that mr disraeli wished to make him the king of the ionian islands i hardly think it needful to assure you mr gladstone told lytton that i have never attached the smallest weight to any of the insinuations which it seems people have thought worth while to launch at some member or members of your government with respect to my mission though mr gladstone was never by any means unconscious of the hum and buzz of paltriness and malice that often surrounds conspicuous public men nobody was ever more regally indifferent graham predicted that though gladstone would always be the first man in the house of commons he would not again be what he was before the ionian business they all thought that he would be attacked on his return ah said aberdeen but he is terrible in the rebound  after much perplexity and running to and fro in london it was arranged between the secretary of state and mr gladstones friends including phillimore principally and then northcote and m bernard that a course of proceeding should be followed which mr gladstone when he knew it thought unfortunate a new commission naming a successor was issued and mr gladstone then became ipso facto liberated sir henry storks was the officer chosen and as soon as his commission was formally received by him he was to execute a warrant under which he deputed all powers to mr gladstone until his arrival whether mr gladstone was lord high commissioner when he came to propose his reform is a moot point so intricate was the puzzle that the undersecretary addressed a letter to mr gladstone by his name and not by the style of his official dignity because he could not be at all sure what that official dignity really was what is certain is that mr gladstone though it was never his way to quarrel with other peoples action taken in good faith on his behalf did not perceive the necessity for proceeding so rapidly to the appointment of his successor and thought it decidedly injurious to such chances as his reforms might have possessed381  the assembly that had been convoked by sir john young for an extraordinary session january 25 at once showed that its labours would bear no fruit mr gladstone as lord high commissioner opened the session with a message that they had met to consider proposals for reform which he desired to lay before them as soon as possible the game began with the passing of a resolution that it was the single and unanimous will greek thelêsis of the ionian people that the seven islands should be united to greece mr gladstone fought like a lion for scholars authority to treat the word as only meaning wish or disposition and he took for touchstone the question whether men could speak of the greek thelêsis of the almighty the word in the lords prayer was found to be greek thelêma as finlay truly says it would have been much more to the point to accept the word as it was meant by those who used it as to that no mistake was possible some say that he ought plainly to have told them they had violated the constitution to have dissolved them and above all to have stopped their pay instead of this he informed them that they must put their wishes into the shape of a petition to the queen the idea was seized with alacrity january 29 oligarchs and demagogues were equally pleased to fall in with it the former because they hoped it would throw their rivals into deeper discredit with their common master the latter because they knew it would endear them to their constituents                     opening of the ionian session  the corfiotes received the declaration of the assembly and the address to the queen with enthusiasm great crowds followed the members to their homes with joyous acclamations all the bells of the town were set ringing there was a grand illumination for two nights and the archbishop ordered a te deum neither tedeums nor prayers melted the heart of the british cabinet aware of the truth impressed at the time on mr gladstone by lytton that neither the english public nor the english parliament likes any policy that gives anything up the queen was advised to reply that she could neither consent to abandon the obligations she had undertaken nor could permit any application from the islands to other powers in furtherance of any similar design  then at last came the grand plan for constitutional reconstruction mr gladstone after first stating the reply of the queen read an eloquent address to the assembly february 4 in italian adjuring them to reject all attempts to evade by any indirect devices the duty of pronouncing a clear and intelligible judgment on the propositions now laid before them his appeal was useless and it was received exactly as plans for assimilating irish administration to english used to be the nationalists knew that reform would be a difficulty the more in the way of separation the retrogrades knew it would be a spoke in the wheel of their own jobbery mr gladstone professed extreme and truly characteristic astonishment in respect of the address to the queen that they should regard the permission to ask as identical with the promise to grant and the right to petition as equivalent to the right to demand if the affair had been less practically vexatious we can imagine the socratic satisfaction with which mr gladstone would have revelled in pressing all these and many other distinctions on those who boasted of being socrates fellowcountrymen  from day to day anxiously did mr gladstone watch what he called the dodges of the assembly abundant reason as there was to complain of the conduct of the ionians in all these proceedings it is well to record the existence of a number of sincere patriots and enlightened men like the two brothers themistocles napoleon zambelli and sir peter braila afterwards greek minister in london this small band of royal adherents gave mr gladstone all the help they could in preparing his scheme of reform and after the scheme was launched they strained every nerve to induce the assembly to assent to it in spite of the pressure from the people their efforts were necessarily unavailing the great majority composed as usual of the friends of england who trembled for their own jobs joining hands with the demagogues was hostile to the changes proposed and only flinched from a peremptory vote from doubt as to its reception among the people promptitude and force were not to be expected in either way from men in such a frame of mind on a preliminary debate mr gladstone wrote mournfully to phillimore without any motion whatever one man has spoken for nearly the whole of two days strong language about the proposals as cheating and fraudulent was freely used but nothing that in mr gladstones view justified one of those highhanded prorogations after the manner of the stuarts that had been the usual expedient in quarrels between the high commissioner and a recalcitrant assembly these doings had brought english rule over the islands to a level in the opinion of southern europe with austrian rule at venice and the reign of the cardinals in the pontifical states                         proceedings in assembly  sir henry storks arrived on the 16th of february and the same day the assembly which before had been working for delay in a great hurry gave a vote against the proposals which though in form preliminary was in substance decisive there were only seven dissentients mr gladstone sums up the case in a private letter to sidney herbert       corfu 17th feb 1859this decision is not convenient for me      personally nor for the government at home but as a whole i cannot      regret it so far as england is concerned i think the proposals      give here almost for the first time a perfectly honourable and      tenable position in the face of the islands the first set of      manoeuvres was directed to preventing them from being made and that      made me really uneasy the only point of real importance was to get      them out do not hamper yourself in this affair with me let me      sink or swim i have been labouring for truth and justice and am      sufficiently happy in the consciousness of it to be little      distressed either with the prospect of blame or with the more      serious question whether i acted rightly or wrongly in putting      myself in the place of lhc to propose these reformsa step      which has of course been much damaged by the early nomination of      sir h storks done out of mere consideration for me in another      point of view lyttons conduct throughout has been such that i      could have expected no more from the oldest and most confiding      friend  to lytton himself he writes feb 7 1859       i sincerely wish that i could have repaid your generous confidence      and admirable support with recommendations suited to the immediate      convenience of your government but in sending me you grappled      with a difficulty which you might have postponed and i could not      but do the same whether it was right that i should come i do not      feel very certain yet stolen despatch and all i do not regret      it for my feelings are those you have so admirably described and      i really do not know for what it is that political life is worth      the living if it be not for an opportunity of endeavouring to      redeem in the face of the world the character of our country      wherever it matters not on how small a scale that character has      been compromised  language like this as sincere as it was lofty supplies the true test by which to judge mr gladstones conduct both in the ionian transaction and many another from the point of personal and selfish interest any simpleton might see that he made a mistake but measured by his own standard of public virtue how is he to be blamed how is he not to be applauded for undertaking a mission that but for an unforeseen accident might have redounded to the honour and the credit of the british power                                     v  on february 19 he quitted the scene of so many anxieties and such strenuous effort as we have seen the terrible fell into a strong northeaster in the adriatic and took thirtysix hours to pola there they sought shelter and got across with a smooth sea to venice on the 23rd he saw the austrian archduke whom he found kind intelligent earnest pleasing at turin a few days later march 23 he had an interview with cavour for whom at that moment the crowning scenes of his great career were just opening at vicenza the diary records feb 28 we had cavalry and artillery at the station about to march more cavalry on the road with a van and pickets some with drawn swords at verona regiments in review at milan pickets in the streets as i write i hear the tread of horse patrolling the streets dark omens the war with austria was close at hand  i may as well in a few sentences finally close the ionian chapter though the consummation was not immediate mr gladstone while he was for the moment bitten by the notion of ceding the southern islands to greece was no more touched by the nationalist aspirations of the ionians than he had been by nationalism and unification in italy in 1851 just as in italy he clung to constitutional reforms in the particular provinces and states as the key to regeneration so here he leaned upon the moderates who while professing strong nationalist feeling did not believe that the time for its realisation had arrived a debate was raised in the house of commons in the spring of 1861 by an irish member the irish catholics twitted mr gladstone with flying the flag of nationality in italy and trampling on it in the ionian islands he in reply twitted them with crying up nationality for the greeks and running it down when it told against the pope in the italian case lord john russell had 1860 set up the broad doctrine that a people are the only true judges who should be their rulersa proposition that was at once seized and much used by the dandolos lombardos cavalieratos and the rest at corfu scarcely anybody pretended that england had any separate or selfish interest of her own it is in my view said mr gladstone entirely a matter of that kind of interest only which is in one sense the highest interest of allnamely the interest which is inherent in her character and duty and her exact and regular fulfilment of obligations which she has contracted with europe382                      later fortunes of the islands  but he held the opinion that it would be nothing less than a crime against the safety of europe as connected with the state and course of the eastern question if england were at this moment to surrender the protectorate for if you should surrender the protectorate what were you to say to candia thessaly albania and other communities of greek stock still under turkish rule then there was a military question large sums of british money had been flung away on fortifications383 and people talked of corfu as they talked in later years about cyprus as a needed supplement to the strength of gibraltar and malta and indispensable to our mediterranean power people listened agape to demonstrations that the ionian islands were midway between england and the persian gulf that they were twothirds of the way to the red sea that they blocked up the mouth of the adriatic constantinople smyrna alexandria naples formed a belt of great towns around them they were central to asia europe and africa and so forth in the alarmists wellworn currency  lord palmerston in 1850 had declared in his highest style that corfu was a very important position for mediterranean interests in the event of a war and it would be great folly to give it up a year later he repeated that though he should not object to the annexation of the southern islands to greece corfu was too important a military and naval post ever to be abandoned by us384 as lord palmerston changed so did mr gladstone change without a good head for greece i should not like to see the ionian protectorate surrendered with it i should be well pleased for one to be responsible for giving it up among many other wonderful suggestions was one that he should himself become that good head the first mention he wrote to a correspondent in parliament jan 21 1863 of my candidature in greece some time ago made me laugh very heartily for though i do love the country and never laughed at anything else in connection with it before yet the seeing my own name which in my person was never meant to carry a title of any kind placed in juxtaposition with that particular idea made me give way  meanwhile it is safe to conjecture for the period with which in this chapter we are immediately concerned that in conceiving and drawing up his ionian scheme close contact with liberal doctrines as to free institutions and popular government must have quickened mr gladstones progress in liberal doctrines in our own affairs at home in 1863385 lord palmerston himself in spite of that national aversion to anything like giving up of which he was himself the most formidable representative cheerfully handed the ionians over to their kinsfolk if kinsfolk they truly were upon the mainland386  footnotes  375 virg aen iv 344  376 see sir c napiers

attention from that body may without scandalum magnatum be doubted nor do the reports appear to have been laid before parliament the italian war was then creating an agitation in europe upon nationality as to which the people of the ionian islands were sensitively alive and the reports would have supplied a good deal of fuel there was a separate fourth report upon the suppression of

                        junction with the liberals                                 1859       conviction in spite of early associations and longcherished      preposessionsstrong conviction and an overpowering sense of the      public interests operating for many many years before full effect      was given to it placed me in the ranks of the liberal      partygladstone ormskirk 1867   when mr gladstone returned to england in march 1859 he found the conservatives with much ineffectual industry some misplaced ingenuity and many misgivings and divisions trying their hands at parliamentary reform their infringement of what passed for a liberal patent was not turning out well convulsions in the cabinet murmurs in the lobbies resistance from the opposite benches all showed that a ministry existing on sufferance would not at that stage be allowed to settle the question in this contest mr gladstone did not actively join speaking from the ministerial side of the house he made a fervid defence of nomination boroughs as the nurseries of statesmen but he voted with ministers against a whig amendment his desire he said was to settle the question as soon as possible always however on the foundation of trust in the people that sound and satisfactory basis on which for several years past legislation had been proceeding the hostile amendment was carried against ministers by statesmen irreconcilably at variance with one another alike in principle and object the majority of thirtynine was very large for those days and it was decisive though the parliament was little more than a couple of years old yet in face of the desperate confusion among leaders parties and groups and upon the plea that reform had not been formally submitted as an issue to the country lord derby felt justified in dissolving mr gladstone held the oxford seat without opposition the constituencies displayed an extension of the same essentially conservative feeling that had given lord palmerston the victory two years before once more the real question lay not so much between measures as men not so much between democratic change and conservative moderation as between palmerston and russell on the one hand and derby and disraeli on the other the government at the election improved their position by some thirty votes this was not enough to outnumber the phalanx of their various opponents combined but was it possible that the phalanx should combine mr gladstone who spoke of the dissolution as being a most improper as well as a most important measure alike in domestic and in foreign bearings told acland that he would not be surprised if the government were to attempt some reconstruction on a broad basis before the new parliament met this course was not adopted                            critical moments  the chances of turning out the government were matters of infinite computation among the leaders the liberal whip after the election gave his own party a majority of fifteen but the treasury whip on the other hand was equally confident of a majority of ten still all was admittedly uncertain the prime perplexity was whether if a new administration could be formed lord palmerston or lord john should be at its head everybody agreed that it would be both impossible and wrong to depose the tories until it was certain that the liberals were united enough to mount into their seat and no government could last unless it comprehended both the old prime ministers could not one of them carry the prize of the premiership into the lords and leave to the other the consolation stake of leadership in the commons lord palmerston who took the crisis with a veterans goodhumoured coolness told his intimates that he at any rate would not go up to the lords for he could not trust john russell in the other house with a view however to ministerial efficiency he was anxious to keep russell in the commons as with him and gladstone they would make a strong treasury bench but was it certain that gladstone would join on this there was endless gossip one story ran that mrs gladstone had told somebody that her husband wished bygones to be bygones was all for a strong government and was ready to join in forming one then the personage to whom this was said upset the inference by declaring there was nothing in the conversation incompatible with a derby junction sir charles wood says in his journal       may 22saw mrs gladstone who did not seem to contemplate a      junction with palmerston but rather that he should join derby i      stated the impossibility of that and that the strongest government      possible under present circumstances would be by such a union as      took place under aberdeen to effect this all people must pull the      same and not different ways as of late years i said that i blamed      her husband for quitting and ever since he quitted palmerstons      government in 1855 as well as lord john that in the quarrel      between lord john and gladstone the former had behaved ill and the      latter well       may 27gladstone dined here he would vote a condemnation of      the dissolution and is afraid of the foreign affairs at so      critical a moment being left in the hands of malmesbury says that      we the opposition are not only justified but called upon by the      challenge in the queens speech on the dissolution to test the      strength of parties but that he is himself in a different      position that he would vote a condemnation of the dissolution but      hesitates as to no confidence  sir robert phillimore387 gives us other glimpses during this month       may 18long interview with gladstone he entered most fully and      without any reserve into his views on the state of political      parties and on the duties of a statesman at this juncture thought      the only chance of a strong government was an engrafting of      palmerston upon lord derby dethroning disraeli from the leadership      of the house of commons arranging for a moderate reform bill      placing the foreign office in other hands but not in disraelis      he dwelt much upon this foreign politics seemed to have the chief      place in his mind       may 31gladstone has seen palmerston and said he will not vote      against lord derby in support of lord johns supposed motion the      government gladstone thinks desirable is a fusion of palmerston and      his followers with lord derby which implies of course weeding      out half at least of the present cabinet gladstone will have to      vote with government and speak against the cabinet and violently      he will be abused       june 1dined with gladstone he is much harassed and distressed      at his position relative to the government and opposition spoke      strongly against lord malmesbury said if the proposal is to      censure the dissolution he must agree with it but he will vote      against a want of confidence  one important personage was quite confident that gladstone would vote the government out another thought that he would be sure to join a liberal administration palmerston believed this too even though he might not vote for a motion of want of confidence clarendon expected gladstone to join though he would rather see him at the foreign office than at the exchequer at a dinner party at lord carlisles where palmerston lord john granville clarendon lewis argyll and delane were present sir charles wood in a conversation with mrs gladstone found her much less inclined to keep the derby government in in the last week of may a party feast was planned by lord palmerston and the whip but lord john russell declined to join the dinner it was decided to call a meeting of the party a confidential visitor was talking of it at cambridge house when the brougham came to the door to take palmerston down to pembroke lodge he was going he said to ask lord john what they should say if they were asked at the meeting whether they had come to an agreement the interview was not unsatisfactory four days later june 6 a wellattended meeting of the party was held at williss rooms the two protagonists declared themselves ready to aid in forming a government on a broad basis and it was understood that either would serve under the other it would be for the sovereign to decide mr bright spoke in what the whigs pronounced to be a highly reasonable vein and they all broke up in great spirits the whip pored over his lists and made out that they could not beat the government by less than seven this was but a slender margin for a vote of no confidence but it was felt that mere numbers though a majority might be an indispensable incident were in this case not the only test of the conditions required for a solid government lord hartington the representative of the great house of cavendish was put up to move a vote of no confidence388                      fall of the derby government  after three days debate ministers were defeated june 11 by the narrow figure of thirteen in a house of six hundred and thirtyseven mr gladstone did not speak but he answered the riddle that had for long so much harassed the wirepullers by going into the lobby with disraeli and his flock the general sense of the majority was probably best expressed by mr bright since the fall of the government of sir robert peel he said there had been no good handling of the liberal party in the house the cabinet had been exclusive the policy had been sometimes wholly wrong and generally feeble and paltering if in the new government there should be found men adequately representing these reconciled sections acting with some measure of boldness and power grappling with the abuses that were admitted to exist and relying upon the moral sense and honest feeling of the house and the general sympathy of the people of england for improvement in our legislation he was bold to hope that the new government would have a longer tenure of office than any government that had existed for many years past  the queen in the embarrassment of a choice between the two whig veterans induced lord granville whose cabinet life as yet was only some five years to try to form a government this step palmerston explained by her german sympathies which made her adverse alike to lord john and himself lord granville first applied to palmerston who said that the queen ought to have sent for himself first still he agreed to serve lord john would only serve under granville on condition of being leader in the house of commons if he joinedso he arguedand if palmerston were leader in the commons this would make himself third instead of second on that point his answer was final so lord granville threw up a commission that never had life in it the queen handed the task over to palmerston and in a few days the new administration was installed june 17 1859                                      ii  mr gladstone went back to the office that he had quitted four years and a half before and undertook the department of finance the appointment did not pass without considerable remark the real scandal he wrote to his oxford chairman is among the extreme men on the liberal side they naturally say this man has done all he could on behalf of lord derby why is he here to keep out one of us even some among mr gladstones private friends wondered how he could bring himself to join a minister of whom he had for three or four years used such unsparing language as had been common on his lips about lord palmerston the plain man was puzzled by a vote in favour of keeping a tory government in followed by a junction with the men who had thrown that government out cobden as we know declined to join389 i am exceedingly sorry wrote mr gladstone to his brother robertson july 2 to find that cobden does not take office it was in his person that there seemed to be the best chance of a favourable trial of the experiment of connecting his friends with the practical administration of the government of this country i am very glad we have gibson but cobden would especially as an addition to the former have made a great difference in point of weight390                         again at the exchequer  mr gladstone with no special anxiety to defend himself was clear about his own course never he says had i an easier question to determine than when i was asked to join the government i can hardly now think how i could have looked any one in the face had i refused my aid such as it is at such a time and under such circumstances at a moment he wrote to the warden of all souls when war is raging in europe when the english government is the only instrument through which there is any hope humanly speaking of any safe and early settlement and when all parties agree that the government of the queen ought to be strengthened i have joined the only administration that could be formed in concert with all the friends setting aside those whom age excludes with whom i joined and acted in the government of lord aberdeen  to the provost of oriel he addressed a rather elaborate explanation391 but it only expands what he says more briefly in a letter june 16 to sir william heathcote an excellent and honourable man his colleague in the representation of oxford       i am so little sensible of having had any very doubtful point to      consider that i feel confident that given the antecedents of the      problem as they clearly stood before me you would have decided in      the way that i have done for thirteen years the middle space of      life i have been cast out of party connection severed from my old      party and loath irrecoverably to join a new one so long have i      adhered to the vague hope of a reconstruction that i have been      left alone by every political friend in association with whom i had      grown up my votes too and such support as i could give have      practically been given to lord derbys government in such a manner      as undoubtedly to divest me of all claims whatever on the liberal      party and the incoming government under these circumstances i am      asked to take office the two leading points which must determine      immediate action are those of reform and foreign policy on the      first i think that lord derby had by dissolution lost all chance of      settling it and as i desire to see it settled it seems my duty      to assist those who perhaps may settle it upon the second i am in      real and close harmony of sentiment with the new premier and the      new foreign secretary how could i under these circumstances say      i will have nothing to do with you and be the one remaining      ishmael in the house of commons  writing to sir john acton in 1864 mr gladstone said       when i took my present office in 1859 i had several negative and      several positive reasons for accepting it of the first there were      these there had been differences and collisions but there were no      resentments i felt myself to be mischievous in an isolated      position outside the regular party organisation of parliament and      i was aware of no differences of opinion or tendency likely to      disturb the new government then on the positive side i felt sure      that in finance there was still much useful work to be done i was      desirous to cooperate in settling the question of the franchise      and failed to anticipate the disaster that it was to undergo my      friends were enlisted or i knew would enlist sir james graham      indeed declining office but taking his position in the party and      the overwhelming interest and weight of the italian question and      of our foreign policy in connection with it joined to my entire      mistrust of the former government in relation to it led me to      decide without one moments hesitation                            contest at oxford  on the day on which mr gladstone kissed hands june 18 disturbing news came from oxford not only was his reelection to be opposed but the enemy had secured the most formidable candidate that he had yet encountered in the person of lord chandos the eldest son of the duke of buckingham his old chairman became chairman for his new antagonist and stafford northcote who with phillimore and bernard had hitherto fought every election on his behalf now refused to serve on his committee while even sir john coleridge was alarmed at some reported wavering on the question of a deceased wifes sister gladstone angry harassed sore phillimore records as well he might be the provost of oriel explains to him that men asked whether his very last vote had not been a vote of confidence in a derby government and of want of confidence in a palmerston government yet he had joined the government in which he declared by anticipation that he had no confidence after all the root of the anger against him was simply that the tories were out and the liberals in with himself as their strongest confederate a question was raised whether he ought not to go down and address convocation in person the dean of christ church however thought it very doubtful whether he would get a hearing those he told mr gladstone who remember sir robert peels election testify that there never was a more unreasonable and ferocious mob than convocation was at that time if you were heard it is doubtful whether you would gain any votes at that last moment while it is believed you would lose some you would be questioned as to the ecclesiastical policy of the cabinet either you would not be able to answer fully or you would answer in such terms as to alienate one or other of the two numerous classes who will now give you many votes  the usual waterspout began to pour the newspapers asserted that mr gladstone meant to cut down naval estimates and this moved the country clergy to angry apprehension that he was for peace at any price the candidate was obliged to spend thankless hours on letters to reassure them the two assertions of fact respecting me are wholly unfounded i mean these two1 that as chancellor of the exchequer i starved the crimean war that is to say limited the expenditure upon it there is not a shadow of truth in this statement 2 that as soon as the war was over i caused the government to reduce their estimates diminish the army disband two fleets and break faith with our seamen when the war was over that is in the year 1856 i did not take objection at all to the establishment or expenditure of the year in the next year 1857 i considered that they ought to have been further reduced but neither a man nor a shilling was taken from them in consequence of my endeavours other correspondents were uneasy about his soundness on rifle corps and rifle clubs how he replied can any uncertainty exist as to the intentions in regard to defence in a government with lord palmerston at its head he was warned that cobden bright and gibson were odious in oxford and he was suspected of being their accomplice the clamour against puseyism had died down and the hostility of the evangelicals was no longer keen otherwise it was the old story goldwin smith tells him win or lose you will have the vote of every one of heart and brain in the university and really connected with it young oxford is all with you every year more men obtain the reward of their industry through your legislation but old oxford takes a long time in dying in the end july 1 he won the battle by a majority of 191gladstone 1050 chandos 859  my conscience is light and clear he wrote to heathcote in the course of the contest the interests that have weighed with me are in some degree peculiar and i daresay it is a fault in me especially as member for oxford that i cannot merge the man in the representative while they have had much reason to complain i have not had an overgood bargain in the estimate of mere pleasure and pain the representation of the university is not worth my having for though the account is long on both sides the latter is the heavier and sharper in the true estimates of good and evil i can look back upon the last twelve years with some satisfaction first because i feel that as far as i am capable of labouring for anything i have laboured for oxford and secondly because in this respect at least i have been happy that the times afforded me in various ways a field and even as to the contemptible summing up between suffering and enjoyment my belief is that the latter will endure while the former will pass away the balance struck in this last sentence is a characteristic fragment of mr gladstones philosophy of public life it lightened and dispelled the inevitable hours of disappointment and chagrin that in natures of less lofty fortitude than his are apt to slacken the nerve and rust the sword                                     iii                   party severance not changed principles  it seems a mistake to treat the acceptance of office under lord palmerston as a chief landmark in mr gladstones protracted journey from tory to liberal the dilemma between joining derby and joining palmerston was no vital choice between two political creeds the new prime minister and his chancellor of the exchequer had both of them started with canning for their common master but there was a generation between them and mr gladstone had travelled along a road of his own perhaps not even now perceiving its goal as we have seen he told mr walpole in may 1858 p 584 that there were no broad and palpable differences of opinion on public questions of principle that separated himself from the derbyite tories392 palmerston on the other hand was so much of a derbyite tory that his government which mr gladstone was now entering owed its long spell of office and power to the countenance of derby and his men mr bright had contemplated p 579 the possibility of a reverse processa derbyite government favoured by palmerstons men in either case the political identity of the two leaders was recognised to join the new administration then marked a party severance but no changed principles i am far from denying the enormous significance of the party wrench but it was not a conversion mr gladstone was at this time in his politics a liberal reformer of turgots type a born lover of good government of just practical laws of wise improvement of public business well handled of a state that should emancipate and serve the individual the necessity of summoning new driving force and amending the machinery of the constitution had not yet disclosed itself to him this was soon discovered by events meanwhile he may well have thought that he saw as good a chance of great work with palmerston as with disraeli or far better for the election had shown that bright was not wrong when he warned him that a derby government could only exist upon forbearance  brights own words already referred to p 625 sufficiently describe mr gladstones point of view the need for a ministry with men in it acting with some measure of boldness and power grappling with abuses and relying upon the moral sense and honest feeling of the house and the general sympathy of the people of england for improvement with such purposes an alliance with liberals of lord palmerstons temper implied no wonderful dislodgment the really great dislodgment in his life had occurred long before it was the fates that befell his book it was the maynooth grant and the gorham case that swept away the foundations on which he had first built in writing to manning in 1845 april 25 after his retirement on the question of maynooth mr gladstone says to him newman sent me a letter giving his own explanation of my position it was admirably done newman in his letter told him that various persons had asked how he understood mr gladstones present position so he put down what he conceived it to be and he expresses the great interest that he feels in the tone of thought then engaging the statesmans mind                              letter from newman       i say then writes newman addressing an imaginary interlocutor      mr gladstone has said the state ought to have a conscience but      it has not a conscience can he give it a conscience is he to      impose his own conscience on the state he would be very glad to do      so if it thereby would become the states conscience but that is      absurd he must deal with facts it has a thousand consciences as      being in its legislative and executive capacities the aggregate of      a hundred minds that is it has no conscience       you will say well the obvious thing would be if the state has      not a conscience that he shall cease to be answerable for it so      he hashe has retired from the ministry while he thought he could      believe it had a consciencetill he was forced to give up what it      was his duty to cherish as long as ever he could the notion that      the british empire was a subject and servant of the kingdom of      christhe served the state now that he finds this to be a mere      dream much as it ought to be otherwise and as it once was      otherwise he has said i cannot serve such a mistress       but really i continue do you in your heart mean to say that he      should absolutely and for ever give up the state and country i      hope not i do not think he has so committed himself that the      conclusion he has come to is a very grave one and not consistent      with his going on blindly in the din and hurry of business without      having principles to guide him i admit and this i conceive is      his reason for at once retiring from the ministry that he may      contemplate the state of things calmly and from without but i      really cannot pronounce nor can you nor can he perhaps at once      what is a christians duty under these new circumstances whether      to remain in retirement from public affairs or not retirement      however could not be done by halves if he is absolutely to give      up all management of public affairs he must retire not only from      the ministry but from parliament       i see another reason for his retiring from the ministry the      public thought they had in his book a pledge that the government      would not take such a step with regard to maynooth as is now before      the country had he continued in the ministry he would to a certain      extent have been misleading the country       you say he made some show of seeing his way in future for he      gave advice he said it would be well for all parties to yield      something to see his way and to give advice is as if he had found      some principle to go on i do not so understand him i thought he      distinctly stated he had not yet found a principle but he gave      that advice which facts or what he called circumstances made      necessary and which if followed out will it is to be hoped lead      to some basis of principle which we do not see at present  compared to the supreme case of conscience indicated here and it haunted mr gladstone for nearly all his life the perplexities of party could be but secondary those perplexities were never sharper than in the four years from 1854 to 1859 and with his living sense of responsibility for the right use of transcendent powers of national service it was practically inevitable that he should at last quit the barren position of the one remaining ishmael in the house of commons                                     iv  later in this year mr gladstone was chosen to be the first lord rector of the university of edinburgh under powers conferred by a recent law his unsuccessful rival was lord neaves excellent as lawyer humorist and scholar in april the following year in the midst of the most trying session of his life he went down from the battleground at westminster and delivered his rectorial address393not particularly pregnant original or pithy but marked by incomparable buoyancy enforcing a conception of the proper functions of a university that can never be enforced too strongly or too often and impressing in melodious period and glowing image those ever needed commonplaces about thrift of time and thirst for fame and the glory of knowledge that kindle sacred fire in young hearts it was his own career intellectual as well as political that gave to his discourse momentum it was his own example that to youthful hearers gave new depth to a trite lesson when he exclaimed believe me when i tell you that the thrift of time will repay you in after life with an usury of profit beyond your most sanguine dreams and that the waste of it will make you dwindle alike in intellectual and in moral stature beneath your darkest reckonings so too we who have it all before us know that it was a maxim of his own inner life when he told them the thirst for an enduring fame is near akin to the love of true excellence but the fame of the moment is a dangerous possession and a bastard motive and he who does his acts in order that the echo of them may come back as a soft music in his ears plays false to his noble destiny as a christian man places himself in continual danger of dallying with wrong and taints even his virtuous actions at their source  footnotes  387 not however sir robert until 1862 when he was knighted on becoming queens advocate he was created baronet in 1881  388 lord hartingtons motion wasthat it is essential for the satisfactory result of our deliberations and for facilitating the discharge of your majestys high functions that your majestys government should possess the confidence of this house and of the country and we deem it our duty respectfully to submit to your majesty that such confidence is not reposed in the present advisers of your majesty  389 life of cobden ii pp 229233  390 there is a strange story in the halifax papers of bright at this time visiting lord aberdeen and displaying much ill humour he cannot reconcile himself to not being considered capable of taking office lord john broached a scheme for sending him as governorgeneral to canada i rather doubted the expediency of this but mr gladstone seemed to think it not a bad scheme june 15 1859 many curious things sprang up in mens minds at that moment  391 reproduced in mr russells book on mr gladstone pp 1445  392 it is worth noticing that he sat on the ministerial side of the house without breach of continuity from 1853 to 1866 during the first derby government as we have already seen p 423 he sat below the gangway on the opposition side during the palmerston administration of 1855 he sat below the gangway on the government side and he remained there after the second derby accession to office in 1858  393 the address is in gleanings vii                                      appendix

addressing you on a subject of importance and much affecting my own future destiny from a supposition that your time and thoughts have been much occupied for several months past by other matters of great interest in succession now however believing you to be more at leisure i venture to bring it before you it is as you will have anticipated the decision of the profession to which i am to look forward for life above eighteen months have now passed since you spoke to me of it at seaforth and most kindly desired me if unable then to make up my mind to go into the law to take some time to consider calmly of the whole question  it would have been undutiful to trouble you with a recurrence of it until such a period had been suffered to elapse as would suffice to afford by the effects it should itself produce some fair criterion and presumption of the inclination which my mind was likely to adopt in reference to the final decision at the same time it would also have been undutiful and most repugnant to my feelings to permit the prolongation of that intervening period to such an extent as to give the shadow of a reason to suppose that anything approaching to reserve had been the cause of my silence the present time seems to lie between these two extremes and therefore to render it incumbent on me to apprise you of the state of my own views  i trust it is hardly necessary to specify my knowledge that when i speak of the state of my own views on this question i do so not of right but by sufferance by invitation from you by that more than parental kindness and indulgence with which i have ever met at my parents hands which it would be as absurd to make a matter of formal acknowledgment as it would be impossible to repay and for which i can only say and i say it from the bottom of my heart may god reward them with his best and choicest gifts eternal unfading in the heavens  if then i am to advert to the disposition of my own mind as regards this matter i cannot avoid perceiving that it has inclined to the ministerial office for what has now become a considerable period with a bias at first uncertain and intermittent but which has regularly and rapidly increased in force and permanence it has not been owing as far as i can myself discern to the operation of any external cause whatever nor of internal ones to any others than those which work their effects in the most gradual and imperceptible manner day after day it has grown upon and into my habit of feeling and desire it has been gradually strengthened by those small accessions of power each of which singly it would be utterly impossible to trace but which collectively have not only produced a desire of a certain description but have led me by reasonings often weighed and sifted and resifted to the best of my ability to the deliberate conclusion which i have stated above i do not indeed mean to say that there has been no time within this period at which i have felt a longing for other pursuits but such feelings have been unstable and temporary that which i now speak of is the permanent and habitual inclination of my mind and such too i think it is likely to continue as far at least as i can venture to think i see anything belonging to the future or can anticipate the continuance of any one desire feeling or principle in a mind so wayward and uncertain as my ownso far do i believe that this sentiment will remain  it gives me pain great pain to communicate anything which i have even the remotest apprehension can give the slightest annoyance to you i trust this will not do so although i fear it may but though fearing it may i feel it is my duty to do it because i have only these three alternatives before me first to delay communication to some subsequent opportunity but as i have no fair prospect of being able then to convey a different statement this plan would be attended with no advantage whatever as far as i can see secondly to dissemble my feelings an alternative on which if i said another word i should be behaving undutifully and wickedly towards you thirdly to follow the course i have now chosen i trust with no feelings but those of the most profound affection and of unfeigned grief that as far as my own view is concerned i am unable to make it coincide with yours i say as far as my own view goes because i do not now see that my own view can or ought to stand for a moment in the way of your desires in the hands of my parents therefore i am left but lest you should be led to suppose that i have never reasoned with myself on this matter but yielded to blind impulses or transitory whims i will state not indeed at length but with as much simplicity and clearness as i am able some of the motives which seem to me to urge me with an irresistible accumulation of moral force to this conclusion and this alone in the first place i would say that my own state and character is not one of them nor i believe could any views of that character be compatible with their existence and reception but that in which it now appears to me namely as one on which i can look with no degree of satisfaction whatever and for the purification of which i can only direct my eyes and offer up my prayers to the throne of god  first then with reference to the dignity of this office i know none to compare with it none which can compete with the grandeur of its end or of its meansthe end the glory of god and the means the restoration of man to that image of his maker which is now throughout the world so lamentably defaced true indeed it is that there are other fields for the use and improvement of all which god lends to us which are wide dignified beneficial desirable desirable in the first and highest degree if we had not this but as long as this field continues and as long as it continues unfilled i do not see how i am to persuade myself that any powers be they the meanest or the greatest can be so profitably or so nobly employed as in the performance of this sublime duty and that this field is not yet filled how can any one doubt who casts his eyes abroad over the moral wilderness of this world who contemplates the pursuits desires designs and principles of the beings that move so busily in it to and fro without an object beyond the finding food be it mental or bodily for the present moment or the present lifeit matters little whichor beyond ministering to the desires under whatever modification they may appear of selfwill and selflove when i look to the standard of habit and principle adopted in the world at large and then divert my eyes for a moment from that spectacle to the standard fixed and the picture delineated in the book of revelation then my beloved father the conviction flashes on my soul with a moral force i cannot resist and would not if i could that the vineyard still wants labourers that the kingdoms of this world are not yet become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and that till they are become such till the frail race of adam is restored to the knowledge and the likeness of his maker till universally and throughout the wide world the will of god is become our delight and its accomplishment our first and last desire there can be no claim so solemn and imperative as that which even now seems to call to us with the voice of god from heaven and to say i have given mine own son for this rebellious and apostate world the sacrifice is offered and accepted but you you who are basking in the sunbeams of christianity you who are blessed beyond measure and oh how beyond desert in parents in friends in every circumstance and adjunct that can sweeten your pilgrimage why will you not bear to fellowcreatures sitting in darkness and the shadow of death the tidings of this universal and incomprehensible love  in this i believe is included the main reason which influences me a reason as full of joy as of glory that transcendent reason in comparison with which every other object seems to dwindle into utter and absolute insignificance but i would not conceal from youwhy should ithat which i cannot conceal from myself that the darker side of this great picture sometimes meets me and it is vain that shuddering i attempt to turn away from it my mind involuntarily reverts to the sad and solemn conviction that a fearfully great portion of the world round me is dying in sin this conviction is the result of that same comparison i have mentioned before between the principles and practices it embraces and those which the almighty authoritatively enjoins and entertaining it as i do how my beloved parent can i bear to think of my own seeking to wanton in the pleasures of life i mean even its innocent pleasures or to give up my heart to its business while my fellowcreatures to whom i am bound by every tie of human sympathies of a common sinfulness and a common redemption day after day are sinking into death i mean not the death of the body which is but a gate either to happiness or to misery but that of the soul the true and the only true death can i with this persuasion engrossing me be justified in inactivity or in any measure short of the most direct and most effective means of meeting if in any degree it be possible these horrible calamities nor is impotency and incompetency any argument on the other side if i saw a man drowning i should hold out my hand to help him although i were uncertain whether my strength would prove sufficient to extricate him or not how much more strongly then is this duty incumbent when there are thousands on thousands perishing in sin and ignorance on every side and where the stake is not the addition or subtraction of a few short years from a life which can but be a span longer or shorter but the doom the irrevocable doom of spirits made for god and once like god but now alienated and apostate and the remedy which god has provided for this portentous evil is not like the ponderous and elaborate contrivances of men its spear is not like goliaths the weavers beam but all its weapons are a few pure and simple elements of truth ill calculated like the arms of david in the estimation of the world to attain their object but yet capable of being wielded by a striplings hand and yet more mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds  what i have said is from the bottom of my heart and put forward without the smallest reservation of any kind and i have said it thus because in duty bound to do it and having too the comfort of the fullest persuasion that even if your judgment should disallow it your affection would pardon it it is possible indeed that the as it seems to me awful consideration which i have last put forward may have been misstated or misapprehended would god it may be so happy should i be to find either by reason or revelation that the principles of this world were other than i have estimated them to be and consequently that their fate would be other likewise i may be under darkness and delusion having consulted with none in this matter but till it is shown that i am so i am bound by all the most solemn ties ties not created in this world nor to be dissolved with it but eternal and changeless as our spirits and he who made them to regulate my actions with reference to these allimportant truthsthe apostasy of man on the one hand the love of god on the other of my duties to men as a social being can any be so important as to tell them of the danger under which i believe them to lie of the precipice to which i fear many are approaching while thousands have already fallen headlong and others again even while i write are continuing to fall in a succession of appalling rapidity of my duties to god as a rational and responsible being especially as a being for whom in common with all men the precious blood of christ has been given can any more imperatively and more persuasively demand all the little i can give than this the proclaiming that one instance of gods unfathomable love which alone so transcends as almost to swallow up all others while those others thus transcended and eclipsed are such as would be of themselves by far the highest and holiest obligations man could know did we not know this  thus i have endeavoured to state these truths if truths they are at least these convictions to you dwelling upon them at a length which may perhaps be tedious and appear affected simply as i trust in order to represent them to your mind as much to the life as possible i mean as nearly as possible in the light in which they have again and again appeared and do habitually appear to my own so as to give you the best means in my power of estimating the strength or detecting the weakness of those grounds on which the conclusions above stated rest i have not mentioned the benefit i might hope myself to derive from this course of living compared with others and yet this consideration though here undoubtedly a secondary one is i believe more weighty than any of those which can be advanced in favour of an opposite determination  for some time i doubted whether to state reasons at all fearing that it might appear presumptuous but i resolved to do it as choosing rather to incur that risk than the hazarding an appearance of reserve and desire to conceal my real sentiments from one who has a right to see into the bottom of my heart  yet one trespass more i must make on your patience it may perhaps seem that the inducements i have stated are of an unusual character unsubstantial romantic theoretical and not practical unusual indeed they are because though it is not without diffidence that i bring this sweeping chargeindeed i should not dare to bring it were it not brought elsewhere it is a rare thing in this world even where right actions are performed to ground them upon right motives at least i am convinced that there are fundamental errors on this subject very prevalentthat they are in general fixed far too low and that the height of our standard of practice must ever be adapted more or less to that of principle god only knows whether this be right but hence it has been that i have endeavoured i trust not improperly to put these motives forward in the simplicity of that form wherein they seem to me to come down from the throne of god to the hearts of men and to consider my prospects and obligations not under all the limitations which a highly artificial state of society might seem to impose upon them but direct and undiluted not in short as one who has certain pursuits to follow certain objects of his own to gain and relations to fulfil and arrangements to executebut as a being destined shortly to stand before the judgment seat of god and there give the decisive account of his actions at the tribunal whose awards admit of no evasion and of no appeal  that i have viewed them in this light i dare not assert but i have wished and striven to view them so and to weigh them and to answer these questions in the same manner as i must answer them on that day when the trumpet of the archangel shall arouse the living and the dead and when it will be demanded of me in common with all others how i have kept and how employed that which was committed to my charge i dare not pretend that i could act even up to the standard here fixed but i can eye it though distant with longing hope and look upwards for the power which i know is allsufficient and therefore sufficient to enable even such an one as myself to reach it  viewing then these considerations in such a light as this i can come to no other conclusion at least unaided than that the work of spreading religion has a claim infinitely transcending all others in dignity in solemnity and in usefulness destined to continue in force until the happy moment come when every human being has been made fully and effectually acquainted with his condition and its remedieswhen too as it seems to me it will be soon enoughof course i lay down this rule for myself provided as i am to the extent of my wants and very far beyond themto devise other occupations now it behoves me to discharge the overwhelming obligation which summons me to this  i have scarcely mentioned my beloved mother in the whole of this letter for though little has ever passed between us on this subject through the medium of language and nothing whatever i believe since i last spoke with you upon it yet i have long been well aware of the tendency of her desires long indeed before my own in any degree coincided with them  i await with deference and interest the communication of your desires upon this subject earnestly desiring that if i have said anything through pride or selflove it may be forgiven me at your hands and by god through his son and that if my statements be false or exaggerated or romantic or impracticable i may by his mercy and through your instrumentality or that of others be brought back to my right mind and taught to hold the truth of god in all its sobriety as well as in all its forceand believe me ever my beloved and honoured father your affectionate and dutiful son                                                    wm e gladstone                         john gladstone to his son                                          leamington 10 aug 1830  my beloved williami have read and given my best consideration to your letter dated the 4th which i only received yesterday i did hope that you would have delayed making up your mind on a subject so important as your future pursuits in life must be to yourself and to us all until you had completed those studies connected with the attainment of the honours or distinctions of which you were so justly ambitious and on which your mind seemed so bent when we last communicated respecting them you know my opinion to be that the field for actual usefulness to our fellowcreatures where a disposition to exercise it actively exists is more circumscribed and limited in the occupations and duties of a clergyman whose sphere of action unless pluralities are admitted as i am sure they would not be advocated by you is necessarily in a great degree confined to his parish than in those professions or pursuits which lead to a more general knowledge as well as a more general intercourse with mankind such as the law taking it as a basis and introduction to public life to which i had looked forward for you considering you as i do peculiarly well qualified to be made thus eminently useful to others with credit and satisfaction to yourself there is no doubt but as a clergyman faithfully and conscientiously discharging the duties of that office to those whose spiritual interests are entrusted to your care should you eventually be placed in that situation that you may have both comfort and satisfaction with few worldly responsibilities but you will allow me to doubt whether the picture your perhaps too sanguine mind has drawn in your letter before me would ever be practically realised be this as it may whenever your mind shall be finally made up on this most important subject i shall trust to its being eventually for your good whatever that determination may be in the meantime i am certainly desirous that those studies with which you have been occupied in reading for your degree may be followed up whether the shorter or longer period may be necessary to prepare you for the results you are young and have ample time before you let nothing be done rashly be consistent with yourself and avail yourself of all the advantages placed within your reach if when that ordeal is passed you should continue to think as you now do i shall not oppose your then preparing yourself for the church but i do hope that your final determination will not until then be taken and that whatever events may occur in the interval you will give them such weight and consideration as they may appear to merit your mother is much as usualwith our united and affectionate love i ever am your affectionate father                                                       john gladstone                                  canada 1838                                  page 144  jan 2038today there was a meeting on canada at sir r peels there were present duke of wellington lords aberdeen ripon ellenborough stanley hardinge and others peel said he did not object to throwing out the government provided it were done by us on our own principles but that to throw them out on radical principles would be most unwise he agreed that less might have been done but was not willing to take the responsibility of refusing what the government asked he thought that this rebellion had given a most convenient opportunity for settling the question of the canadian constitution which had long been a thorny one and inaccessible that if we postponed the settlement by giving the assembly another trial the revolt would be forgotten and in colder blood the necessary powers might be refused he thought that when once you went into a measure of a despotic character it was well to err if at all on the side of sufficiency lord ripon strongly concurred the duke sat with his hand to his ear turning from one towards another round the circle as they took up the conversation in succession and said nothing till directly and pressingly called upon by peel a simple but striking example of the selfforgetfulness of a great man  jan 2638i was myself present at about eight hours ie on three occasions of discussion in peels house upon the canadian question and bill and there was one meeting held to which i was not summoned the conservative amendments were all adopted in the thoroughly straightforward view of looking simply at the bill and not at the government and the position of parties peel used these emphatic words depend upon it our course is the direct one dont do anything that is wrong for the sake of putting them out dont avoid anything that is right for the sake of keeping them in every one of these points has now been carried without limitation or exception for the opposition party this is in familiar language a feather in its cap the whole has been carefully thoroughly and effectually done nothing since i have been in parliamentnot even the defeat of the church rate measure last yearhas been of a kind to tell so strikingly as regards appearances upon the comparative credit of the two parties                          sir robert peels government                                 page 247  in the great mountain of mr gladstones papers i have come across an unfinished and undated draft of a letter written by him for the queen in 1880 on sir robert peels government       mr gladstone with his humble duty reverts to the letter which your      majesty addressed to him a few days back and in which your majesty      condescended to recollect and to remind him of the day now nearly      forty years ago a day he fears not altogether one of pleasure to      your majesty when together with others he had the honour to be      sworn of your majestys privy council your majesty is pleased to      pronounce upon the government then installed into office a high      eulogy a eulogy which mr gladstone would presume as far as he      may to echo he values it and values the recollection of the men      who principally composed it because it was in the first place a      most honourable and highminded government because its legislative      acts tended greatly and almost uniformly to increase the      wellbeing of the country and to strengthen the attachment of the      people to the throne and the laws while it studied in all things      to maintain the reverse of an ambitious or disturbing policy       it was mr gladstones good fortune to live on terms of intimacy      and even affection with the greater portion of its principal and      more active members until the close of their valued lives and      although he is far from thinking that they and he himself with      them committed no serious errors yet it is his conviction that in      many of the most important rules of public policy that government      surpassed generally the governments which have succeeded it      whether liberal or conservative among them he would mention purity      in patronage financial strictness loyal adherence to the      principle of public economy jealous regard to the rights of      parliament a single eye to the public interest strong aversion to      extension of territorial responsibilities and a frank admission of      the rights of foreign countries as equal to those of their own      with these recollections of the political character of sir r peel      and his government mr gladstone has in no way altered his feelings      of regard and respect for them in all the points he has mentioned      he would desire to tread in their steps and in many of them or at      least in some he has no hope of soon seeing them equalled the      observance of such principles is in his conviction the best means      of disarming radicalism of whatever is dangerous in its      composition and he would feel more completely at ease as to the      future prospects of this country could he feel more sure of their      being faithfully observed       mr gladstone is and has been but a learner through his life and      he can claim no special gift of insight into the future the      history of his life may not be flattering to his selflove but he      has great consolation in believing that the great legislative acts      of the last halfcentury in most of which he has had some share        and here the fragment closes                       crisis on the sugar duties 1844                                 page 267  in 1841 the whig government raised the question of the sugar duties and proposed to substitute a protective duty of 12 per cwt for the actual or virtual prohibition of foreign sugars which had up to that time subsisted they were strongly opposed and decisively beaten the argument used against them was i think twofold there was the protection plea on behalf of the west indians whose estates were now worked only by free labourand there was the great and popular contention that the measure not only admitted sugar the product of slave labour which we would not allow our own colonies to employ but that our new supplies would be derived from brazil and above all from cuba and puerto rico where the slave trade was rampant and was prosecuted on an enormous scale the government of sir r peel largely modified our system its general professions were the abolition of prohibition and the reduction of protective duties to a moderate rate in 1844 it was determined to deal with the sugar duties and to admit sugar at i think a rate of 10 per cwt beyond the rate for britishgrown but we had to bear in mind the arguments of 1841 and it was determined that the sugars so to be admitted were to be the product of free labour only there was some uncertainty from whence they were to come java produced sugar largely under a system involving certain restraints but as we contended essentially free the whole argument however was difficult and perplexed and a parliamentary combination was formed against the government the opposition with perfect consistency mustered in full force the west indian interest which though much reduced in wealth still subsisted as a parliamentary entity was keenly arrayed on the same side there were some votes attracted by dislike perhaps to the argument on our side which appeared to be complex and overrefined a meeting of the party was held in order to confront the crisis sir robert peel stated his case in a speech which was thought to be haughty and unconciliatory i do not recollect whether there was hostile discussion or whether silence and the sulks prevailed but i remember that when the meeting of the party broke up sir robert peel said on quitting the room that it was the worst meeting he had ever attended it left disagreeable anticipations as to the division which was in immediate prospect the opposition in general had done what they could to strengthen their momentary association with the west indian conservatives their hopes of a majority depended entirely upon conservative votes of course therefore it was vital to confine the attack to the merits of the question immediately before the house as an attack upon the policy of the government generally could only strengthen it by awakening the susceptibilities of party and so reclaiming the stray voters to the administration lord howick entering into the debate as the hours of enhanced interest began made a speech which attacked the conservative policy at large and gave the opening for an effective reply lord stanley perceived his opportunity and turned it to account with great force and adroitness in a strictly retaliatory speech he wound up conservative sentiment on behalf of ministers and restored the tone of the house the clouds of the earlier evening hours dispersed and the government was victorious two speeches one negatively and the other positively reversed the prevailing current and saved the administration i have never known a parallel case the whole honour of the fray in the ministerial sense redounded to lord stanley i doubt whether in the twentysix years of his after life he ever struck such a stroke as this                               colonial policy                                 page 362   you have reversed within the last seventy years every one of these salutary principles your policy has been this you have retained at home the management of and property in colonial lands you have magnificent sums figuring in your estimates for the ordinary expenses of their governments instead of allowing them to bear their own expenses instead of suffering them to judge what are the measures best adapted to secure their peaceful relations with the aboriginal tribes and endeavouring to secure their good conductinstead of telling them that they must not look for help from you unless they maintain the principles of justice you tell them you must not meddle with the relations between yourselves and the natives that is a matter for parliament a minister sitting in downing street must determine how the local relations between the inhabitants of the colony and the aboriginal tribes are to be settled in every point down to the minutest detail nay even their strictly internal police your soldiery is often called upon to maintain then again the idea of their electing their own officers is of course revolutionary in the extremeif not invading the royal supremacy it is something almost as bad dismembering the empire and as to making their own laws upon their local affairs without interference or control from us that is really an innovation so opposed to all ideas of imperial policy that i think my honourable friend the member for southwark sir william molesworth has been the first man in the house bold enough to propose it thus in fact the principles on which our colonial administration was once conducted have been precisely reversed our colonies have come to be looked upon as being not municipalities endowed with internal freedom but petty states if you had only kept to the fundamental idea of your forefathers that these were municipal bodies founded within the shadow and cincture of your imperial powersthat it was your business to impose on them such positive restraints as you thought necessary and having done so to leave them free in everything elseall those principles instead of being reversed would have survived in full vigouryou would have saved millions i was going to say countless millions to your exchequer but you would have done something far more important by planting societies more worthy by far of the source from which they spring for no man can read the history of the great american revolution without seeing that a hundred years ago your colonies such as they then were with the institutions they then possessed and the political relations in which they then stood to the mothercountry bred and reared men of mental stature and power such as far surpassed anything that colonial life is now commonly considered to be capable of producingspeech on second reading of the new zealand constitution bill may 21 1852               financial arrangements of 1853 as affecting ireland                                page 465  when the report of the irish financial relations commission of 1894 was named to him mr gladstone made the following observations  the changes adopted in that year were explained in my budget speech and will be found in my volume of financial statements pp 53 60 and 69 they affected the spirit duties and the incometax  1 the spirit dutieswe laid 8d per gallon upon irish spirits imposed at the same time 1s per gallon in scotland and laid it down that the equalisation of the duty in the three countries would require a reduction of the duty of 8s chargeable in england sir robert peel had imposed 1s per gallon on irish spirits in 1842 but was defeated by the smuggler and repealed the duty in consequence of the failure in 1842 the duty was levied by a separate revenue police i abolished this separate police and handed the duty to the constabulary force which raised it and without difficulty  2 the incometax was also in that year extended to ireland i pointed out that sir robert peel in imposing the burden on great britain proposed to give a compensation for it by progressive reductions of duty on consumable commodities and that ireland had for twelve years enjoyed her full share of the compensation without undergoing any part of the burden but i also laid it down as a fundamental principle that the peace incometax was to be temporary and i computed that it might cease in 1860 this computation was defeated first by the crimean war second by a change of ideas as to expenditure and establishments which i did everything in my power to check but which began to creep in with and after that war we were enabled to hold it in check during the government of 185966 it has since that time and especially in these last years broken all bounds but although the computation of 1853 was defeated the principle that the incometax should be temporary was never forgotten at least by me and in the year 1874 i redeemed my pledge by proposing as mentioned to repeal ita course which would have saved the country a sum which it is difficult to reckon but very large this fact which was in the public mind in 1853 when the incometax was temporary is the key to the whole position from this point of view we must combine it with the remission of the consolidated annuities i have not now the means of making the calculation exactly but it will be found that a descending incometax on ireland for seven years at 7d then 6d then 5d is largely though not completely balanced by that remission it will thus be seen that the finance of 1853 is not responsible either for a permanent peace incometax upon ireland or for the present equalisation of the spirit duties at the same time i do not mean to condemn those measures i condemn utterly the extravagance of the civil expenditure in ireland which if ireland has been unjustly taxed cannot for a moment be pleaded as a compensation i reserve my judgment whether political equality can be made compatible with privilege in point of taxation i admit for my own part that in 1853 i never went back to the union whence the difficulty springs but only to the union of the exchequers in or about 1817 it is impossible to resist the authority which has now affirmed that we owe a pecuniary as well as a political debt to ireland                         financial proposal of 1853                               page 473                mr gladstone to sir stafford northcote  aug 6 1862i have three main observations to make upon the conversion scheme two of which are confessions and one a maxim for an opposition to remember  1 in the then doubtful state of foreign politics had i been capable of fully appreciating it at the time i ought not to have made the proposal  2 such a proposal when made by a government ought either to be resisted outright or allowed to pass i do not say without protest but without delay for that can do nothing but mischief to a proposal depending on public impression the same course should be taken as is taken in the case of loans  3 i am sorry to say i made a more serious error as regards the south sea stocks than the original proposal in the summer i think of 1853 and a good while before harvest the company proposed to me to take mr goulburns 3 per cents to an equal amount in lieu of their own they were at the time more valuable and i refused but it would have been wise to accept not because the event proved it so but because the state of things at the time was so far doubtful as to have made this kind of insurance prudent  for the benefit of the expert i give mr gladstones further observations on this highly technical matter  i have other remarks to offer i write however from memory three millions of the £8000000 were paid in exchequer bills the difference between £100 and the price of consols at the time may in argument at least fairly be considered as public loss you say it was 90 or 91 we could not however if the operation had not taken place have applied our surplus revenue with advantage to the reduction of debt the balances would have been richer by £5000000 but we had to raise seven millions for the services of the year 18545 now as i am making myself liable for the loss of half a million of money in repaying the south sea company and thereby starving the balances i am entitled to say on the other hand that the real loss is to be measured by the amount of necessity created for replenishing them and the charge entailed in effecting it this i think was done by the exchequer bonds and beyond all doubt a large saving was effected to the public by raising money upon those bonds instead of borrowing in consols at 84 or thereabouts which i think would have been the price for which we should in that year have borrowedsay at 84 the redemption price ie the price at which on the average consols have been in recent times redeemed can hardly i think be less than 95 and may be higher there was in 1854 a strong combination in the city to compel a loan by bearing the funds and when it was defeated by the vote of the house of commons a rapid reaction took place several millions as i understand were lost by the bear and the attempt was not renewed in 1855 when the loan was i believe made on fair terms relatively to the state of the market                          the reform bill of 1854                               page 491  in cabinet on wednesday lord john russell opened the question of the reform bill stated the prospect of defeat on sir e derings motion and expressed his willingness to postpone the measure until the 27th april lord palmerston recommended postponement altogether lord aberdeen and graham were averse to any postponement the latter even declaring his opinion that we ought at the time when the queens speech was framed to have assumed the present state of circumstances as inevitable and that therefore we had no apology or ground for change further that we ought if necessary to dissolve upon defeat in order to carry the measure no one else went this length all the three i have named were from their different points of view disposed to concur in the expedient of postponement which none of them preferred on its merits of the rest of the cabinet molesworth and i expressed decidedly our preference for the more decided course of at once giving up the bill for the year as did the chancellor and this for the ultimate interest of the plan itself lord lansdowne wood clarendon herbert were all with more or less decision of phrase in the same sense newcastle granville and argyll were i believe of the same mind but all were willing to accept the postponement until april 27 rather than the very serious alternative molesworth and i both expressed our apprehension that this course would in the end subject the government to far more of censure and of suspicion than if we dealt with the difficulty at once next day lord john came to see me and told me he had the idea that in april it might probably be found advisable to divide the part of the bill which enfranchises new classes from that which disfranchises places and redistributes seats with a view of passing the first and letting the latter take its chance as the popular feeling would tell for the first while the selfish interests were provoked by the last he thought that withdrawal of the bill was equivalent to defeat and that either must lead to a summary winding up of the session i said the division of the bill was a new idea and a new light to me but observed that it would by no means help graham who felt himself chiefly tied to the disfranchising part and submitted to him that his view of a withdrawal of the bill given such circumstances as would alone induce the cabinet to think of it was more unfavourable than the case warrantedmarch 3 1854                             civil service reform                                 page 511       extracts from a letter to lord john russell jan 20 1854   i do not hesitate to say that one of the great recommendations of the change in my eyes would be its tendency to strengthen and multiply the ties between the higher classes and the possession of administrative power as a member for oxford i look forward eagerly to its operation there happily we are not without some lights of experience to throw upon this part of the subject the objection which i always hear there from persons who wish to retain restrictions upon elections is this if you leave them to examination eton harrow rugby and the other public schools will carry everything i have a strong impression that the aristocracy of this country are even superior in natural gifts on the average to the mass but it is plain that with their acquired advantages their insensible education irrespective of booklearning they have an immense superiority this applies in its degree to all those who may be called gentlemen by birth and training and it must be remembered that an essential part of any such plan as is now under discussion is the separation of work wherever it can be made into mechanical and intellectual a separation which will open to the highly educated class a career and give them a command over all the higher parts of the civil service which up to this time they have never enjoyed  i must admit that the aggregate means now possessed by government for carrying on business in the house of commons are not in excess of the real need and will not bear serious diminution i remember being alarmed as a young man when lord althorp said or was said to have said that this country could no longer be governed by patronage but while sitting thirteen years for a borough with a humble constituency and spending near ten of them in opposition i was struck by finding that the loss or gain of access to government patronage was not traceable in its effect upon the local political influences i concluded from this that it was not the intrinsic value of patronage which is really none inasmuch as it does not or ought not to multiply the aggregate number of places to be given but only acts on the mode of giving them that was regarded but simply that each party liked and claimed to be upon a footing of equality with their neighbours just in the same way it was considered necessary that bandsmen flagmen and the rest should be paid four times the value of their services without any intention of bribery but because it was the custom and was done on the other sidein places where this was thought essential it has now utterly vanished away and yet the people vote and work for their cause as zealously as they did before may not this after all be found to be the case in the house of commons as well as in many constituencies  it might increase the uncertainties of the government in the house of commons on particular nights but is not the hold even now uncertain as compared with what it was thirty or forty years ago and is it really weaker for general and for good purposes on account of that uncertainty than it then was i have heard you explain with great force to the house this change in the position of governments since the reform bill as a legitimate accompaniment of changes in our political state by virtue of which we appeal more to reason less to habit direct interest or force may not this be another legitimate and measured step in the same direction may we not get i will not say more ease and certainty for the leader of the house but more real and more honourable strength with the better and in the long run the ruling part of the community by a signal proof of cordial desire that the processes by which government is carried on should not in elections only but elsewhere too be honourable and pure i speak with diffidence but remembering that at the revolution we passed over from prerogative to patronage and that since the revolution we have also passed from bribery to influence i cannot think the process is to end here and after all we have seen of the good sense and good feeling of the community though it may be too sanguine i cherish the hope that the day is now near at hand or actually come when in pursuit not of visionary notions but of a great practical and economical improvement we may safely give yet one more new and striking sign of rational confidence in the intelligence and character of the people                            mr gladstone and the bank                                   page 519  from the time i took office as chancellor of the exchequer i began to learn that the state held in the face of the bank and the city an essentially false position as to finance when those relations began the state was justly in ill odour as a fraudulent bankrupt who was ready on occasion to add force to fraud after the revolution it adopted better methods though often for unwise purposes and in order to induce monied men to be lenders it came forward under the countenance of the bank as its sponsor hence a position of subserviency which as the idea of public faith grew up and gradually attained to solidity it became the interest of the bank and the city to prolong this was done by amicable and accommodating measures towards the government whose position was thus cushioned and made easy in order that it might be willing to give it a continued acquiescence the hinge of the whole situation was this the government itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of finance but was to leave the money power supreme and unquestioned in the conditions of that situation i was reluctant to acquiesce and i began to fight against it by financial selfassertion from the first though it was only by the establishment of the post office savings banks and their great progressive development that the finance minister has been provided with an instrument sufficiently powerful to make him independent of the bank and the city power when he has occasion for sums in seven figures i was tenaciously opposed by the governor and deputygovernor of the bank who had seats in parliament and i had the city for an antagonist on almost every occasionundated fragment                    the duke of newcastle and sidney herbert                                  page 521  with reference to the crimean war i may give a curious example of the power of selfdeception in the most upright men the offices of colonial secretary and war minister were in conformity with usage united in the hands of the duke of newcastle on the outbreak of war it became necessary to separate them it evidently lay with the holder to choose which he would keep the duke elected for the war department and publicly declared that he did this in compliance with the unanimous desire of his colleagues and no one contradicted him we could only grin and bear it i cannot pretend to know the sentiments of each and every minister on the matter but i myself and every one with whom i happened to communicate were very strongly of an opposite opinion the duke was well qualified for the colonial seals for he was a statesman ill for the war office as he was no administrator i believe we all desired that lord palmerston should have been war minister it might have made a difference as to the tolerance of the feeble and incapable administration of our army before sebastopol indeed i remember hearing lord palmerston suggest in cabinet the recall of sir richard airy  in that crisis one man suffered most unjustly i mean sidney herbert to some extent perhaps his extraordinary and most just popularity led people to refrain from pouring on him those vials of wrath to which his office exposed him in the eyes especially of the uninformed the duties of his department were really financial i suppose it to be doubtful whether it was not the duty of the secretary of states department to deal with the question of supply for the army leaving to him only the management of the purchasing part but i conceive it could be subject to no doubt at all that it was the duty of the administrative department of the army on the spot to anticipate and make known their wants for the coming winter this if my memory serves me they wholly failed to do and the duke of newcastles staff being in truth very little competent herbert strained himself morning noon and night to invent wants for the army and according to his best judgment or conjecture to supply them so was laden the great steamer which went to the bottom in the harbour of balaclava and so came herbert to be abused for his good deedsautobiographic note sept 17 1897                                 the crimean war                                   page 546                       mr gladstone to duke of argyll  oct 18 55you have conferred a great obligation on me by putting me into the witnessbox and asking me why i thought last year that we were under an obligation to lord palmerston for concentrating the attention of the cabinet on the expedition to the crimea such was then my feeling entertained so strongly that i even wrote to him for the purpose of giving to it the most direct expression and such is my feeling still i think the fall of sebastopol viewed in itself and apart from the mode in which it has been brought about a great benefit to europe this benefit i should have contemplated with high and so to speak unmixed satisfaction were i well assured as to the means by which we had achieved it but of course there is a great difference between a war which i felt however grievous it was yet to be just and needful and a war carried on without any adequate justification so far as i can to this hour tell without even any welldefined practical object your letter if i must now pass from the defensive seems to me to involve assumptions as to our right to rectify the distribution of political power by bloodshed which carry it far beyond just bounds in the hour of success doctrines and policy are applauded or pass unquestioned even under misgiving which are very differently handled at a period of disaster or when a nation comes to feel the embarrassments it has accumulated the government are certainly giving effect to the public opinion of the day if that be a justification they have it as all governments of england have had in all wars at eighteen months from their commencement apart from the commanding consideration of our duty as men and christians i am not less an objector to the postaprilpolicy on the ground of its certain or probable consequencesin respect first and foremost to turkey in respect to the proper place and power of france in respect to the interest which europe has in keeping her and us all within such place and power in respect to the permanence of our friendly relations with her and lastly in respect to the effects of continued war upon the condition of our own people and the stability of our institutions but each of these requires an octavo volume i must add another head i view with alarm the future use against england of the arguments and accusations we use against russia  dec 1what i find press hardest among the reproaches upon me is thisyou went to war for limited objects why did you not take into account the high probability that those objects would be lost sight of in the excitement which war engenders and that this war if once begun would receive an extension far beyond your views and wishes  dec 3i do mean that the reproach i named is the one most nearly just what the weight due to it is i forbear finally to judge until i see the conclusion of this tremendous drama but i quite see enough to be aware that the particular hazard in question ought to have been more sensibly and clearly before me it may be good logic and good sense i think to sayi will forego ends that are just for fear of being driven upon the pursuit of others that are not so whether it is so in a particular case depends very much upon the probable amount of the driving power and of the resisting force which may be at our command                                  chronology394  1832  dec  13 elected member for newarkgladstone 887 handley 798             wilde 726
