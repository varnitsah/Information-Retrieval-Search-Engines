he had been sick his father and mother lived in boston but now he was spending the summer at sandy river country with his grandmother his father thought that if he could run about a few months in the open air and play among the rocks and under the trees he would grow more strong and healthy and that his cheeks would not look so pale  his grandmother made him a blue jacket with bright buttons she liked metal buttons because they would wear longer than covered ones but he liked them because they were more beautiful besides said he i can see my face in them grandmother  little caleb then went to the window so as to see his face plainer he stood with his back to the window and held the button so that the light from the window could shine directly upon it  why grandmother said caleb i cannot see now so well as i could before  that is because your face is turned away from the light said she  and the button is turned towards the light said caleb  but when you want to see any thing reflected in a glass you must have the light shine upon the thing you want to see reflected not upon the glass itself and i suppose it is so with a bright button  then caleb turned around so as to have his face towards the light and he found that he could then see it reflected very distinctly his grandmother went on with her work and caleb sat for some time in silence  the house that caleb lived in was in a narrow rocky valley a stream of water ran over a sandy bed in front of the house and a rugged mountain towered behind it across the stream too there was a high rocky hill which was in full view from the parlour window this hill was covered with wild evergreens which clung to their sides and to the interstices of the rocks and mosses green and brown in long festoons hung from their limbs here and there crags and precipices peeped out from among the foliage and a grey old cliff towered above at the summit  caleb turned his button round again towards the window and of course turned his face from the window the reflection of his face was now dim as before but in a moment his eye caught the reflection of the crags and trees across the little valley  o grandmother said he again i can see the rocks in my buttons and the trees and there is an old stump he continued his voice falling to a low tone as if he was talking to himselfand there is a treeandwhywhy what is that it is a bear grandmamacalling aloud to heri see a bear upon the mountain  nonsense caleb said the grandmother  i do certainly said caleb and he dropped the corner of his jacket which had the button attached to it and looked out of the window directly at the mountain  presently caleb turned away from the window and ran to the door there was a little green yard in front of the house with a large smooth flat stone for a doorstep caleb stood on this step and looked intently at the mountain in a moment he ran back to his grandmother and said  grandmother do come and see this black bear  why child said she smiling it is nothing but some old black stump or log  but it moves grandmother it certainly moves  so his grandmother smiled and said well i suppose i must come and see so she laid down her work and took off her spectacles and caleb took hold of her hand and trotted along before her to the step of the door it was a beautiful sunny morning in june  there said caleb triumphantly pointing to a spot among the rocks and bushes halfway up the mountainthere what do you call that  his grandmother looked a moment intently in silence and then said  i do see something there under the bushes  and isnt it moving said caleb  why yes said she  and isnt it black  yes said she  then it is a bear said caleb halfdelighted and half afraid isnt it grandmother ill go and get the gun  there was an old gun behind the high desk in the back sittingroom but it had not been loaded for twenty years and had no back upon it still caleb always supposed that some how or other it would shoot  shall i grandmother said he eagerly  no said she i dont think it is a bear  what then said caleb  i think it is cherry  cherry said caleb  yes cherry said she run and see if you can find the boys  cherry was the cow she had strayed from the pasture the day before and they could not find her she was called cherry from her colour for although she had looked almost black as caleb had seen her in the bushes she was really a cherry colour caleb saw at once as soon as his grandmother said that it was cherry that she was correct in fact he could see her head and horns as she was holding her head up to eat the leaves from the bushes however he did not stop to talk about it but obeying his grandmother immediately he ran off after the boys  he went out to the back door where the boys had been at play and shouted out david david dwight david but there was no reply except a distant echo of david and dwight from the rocks and mountains  so caleb came back and said that he could not find the boys and that he supposed that they had gone to school  then we must call raymond said she  and may i ring for him grandmother said caleb  grandmother said he might and so caleb ran off to the porch at the back door and took down quite a large bell which was hanging there caleb stood upon the steps of the porch and grasping the great handle of the bell with both hands he rang it with all his might in a minute or two he stopped and then he heard a faint and distant ayeaye coming from a field caleb put the bell back into its place and then went again to his grandmother  in a few minutes raymond came in he was a thickset and rather tall young man broadshouldered and strongslow in his motions and of a very sober countenance caleb heard his heavy step in the entry though he came slowly and carefully as if he tried to walk without making a noise  did you want me madam rachel said he holding his hat in his hand  calebs grandmother was generally called madam rachel  yes said she cherry has got up on the rocks caleb spied her there he will shew you where and i should like to have you go and drive her down  caleb wanted to go too but his grandmother said it would not do very well for he could not keep up with raymond and besides she said that she wanted him so caleb went out with raymond under the great elm before the house and pointed out the place among the rocks where he had seen cherry she was not there then at least she was not in sight but raymond knew that she could not have gone far from the place so he walked down over the bridge and soon disappeared  while caleb stood watching raymond as he walked off with long strides towards the mountain his grandmother came to the door and said  come caleb  caleb turned and ran to his grandmother she had in her hand a little red morocco book and taking calebs hand she went slowly up stairs he frisking and capering around her all the way there was a bed in the room with a white covering and by the window an easy chair with a high back and round wellstuffed arms madam rachel went to the easy chair and sat down and took caleb in her lap caleb looked out upon the long drooping branches of the elm which hung near the window  calebs countenance was pale and he was slender in form and delicate in appearance he had been sick and even now he was not quite well his little taper fingers rested upon the windowsill while his grandmother opened her little bible and began to read caleb sat still in her lap with a serious and attentive expression of countenance  two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee the other a publican  what is a pharisee and a publican asked caleb  you will hear presently and the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers  what are all those asked caleb  o different kinds of crimes and sins the pharisee thanked god that he had not committed any of them  was he a good man grandmother  very likely he had not committed any of these great crimes  very well grandmother go on  or even as this publican a publican you must know was a taxgatherer he used to collect the taxes from the people they did not like to pay their taxes and so they did not like the taxgatherers and despised them and thus the pharisee thanked god that he was not like that publican i fast twice in the week i pay tithes of all that i possess  tithes said caleb  yes that was money which god had commanded them to pay they were to pay in proportion to the property they had but some dishonest men used to conceal some of their property so as not to have to pay so much but this pharisee said he paid tithes of all that he possessed  that was right grandmother said caleb  yes said his grandmother that was very well  if he really did it continued caleb doubtfully do you think he did grandmother  i think it very probable i presume he was a pretty good man outside  what do you mean by that grandmother  why his heart might have been bad but he was probably pretty careful about all his actions which could be seen of men but we will go on  and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other  which man said caleb  the publican  the publican was justified said caleb what does justified mean  forgiven and approved god was pleased with the publican because he confessed his sins honestly but he was displeased with the pharisee because he came boasting of his good deeds  here there was a pause caleb sat still and seemed thoughtful his grandmother did not interrupt him but waited to hear what he would say  yes but grandmother if the pharisee really was a good man it wasnt right for him to thank god for it  it reminds me of thomass acorns said madam rachel  thomass acorns said caleb tell me about them grandmother  why thomas and his brother george were sent to school they stopped to play by the way until it was so late that they did not dare to go in then they staid playing about the fields till it was time to go home they felt pretty bad and out of humour and at last they separated and went home different ways  in going home thomas found an oaktree with acorns under it ah said he i will carry mother home some acorns he had observed that his mother was pleased whenever he brought her things and he had an idea of soothing his own feelings of guilt and securing his mothers favour by the good deed of carrying her home some acorns so when he came into the house he took off his hat carefully with the acorns in it and holding it in both hands marched up to his mother with a smiling face and look of great selfsatisfaction and said here mother i have got you some acorns  and what did his mother say asked caleb  she shook her head sorrowfully and told him to go and put the acorns away she knew where he had been  then presently george came in he put away his cap walked in softly and put his face down in his mothers lap and said with tears and sobs mother i have been doing something very wrong now which of these do you think came to his mother right  whygeorge said he certainly  yes and that was the way the publican came but the pharisee covered up all his sins being pleased and satisfied himself and thinking that god would be pleased and satisfied with his acorns  here madam rachel paused and caleb sat still thinking of what he had heard  madam rachel then closed her eyes and in a low gentle voice she spoke a few words of prayer and then she told caleb that he must always remember in all his prayers to confess his sins fully and freely and never cover them up and conceal them with an idea that his good deeds made him worthy then she put caleb down and he ran down stairs to play  he asked his grandmother to let him go over the bridge so as to be ready to meet raymond when he should come back with the cow she at first advised him not to go for she was afraid she said that he might get lost or fall into the brook but caleb was very desirous to go and finally she consented he had a little whip that david had made for him the handle was made from the branch of a beachtree which david cut first to make a cane of for himself but he broke his cane and so he gave caleb the rest of the stick for a whiphandle the lash was made of leather it was cut out of a round piece of thick leather round and round as they made leather shoestrings and then rolled upon a board this is a fine way to make lashes and reins for boys  caleb took his whip for company and sauntered along over the bridge when he had crossed the bridge he walked along the bank of the stream watching the grasshoppers and butterflies and now and then cutting off the head of a weed with the lash of his whip  the banks of the brook were in some places high and the water deep in other places there was a sort of beach sloping down to the waters edge and here the water was generally shallow to a considerable distance from the shore caleb was allowed to come down to the water at these shallow places but he had often been told that he must not go near the steep places because there was danger that he would fall in  now boys are not very naturally inclined to obey their parents they have to be taught with great pains and care they must be punished for disobedience in some way or other a good many times but neglected children that is those that are left to themselves are almost always very disobedient and unsubmissive caleb now was not a neglected child he had been taught to submit and obey when he was very young and his grandmother could trust him now  besides caleb had still less disposition now to disobey his grandmother than usual for he had been sick and was still pale and feeble and this state of health often makes children quiet gentle and submissive  so caleb walked slowly along carefully avoiding all the high banks but sometimes going down to the water where the shore was sloping and safe at length at one of these little landing places he stopped longer than usual he called it the cotton landing david and dwight gave it that name because they always found wedged in in a corner between a log and the shore a pile of cotton as they called it it was in reality light white froth which always lay there and even if they pushed it all away with a stick they would find a new supply the next day caleb stood upon the shore and with the lash of his whip cut into the pile of cotton the pile broke up into large masses and moved slowly and lightly away into the stream one small tuft of it floated towards the shore and caleb reached it with his whiphandle and took a part of it in saying now i will see what it is made of  on closely examining it he found to his surprise that it was composed of an infinite number of very small bubbles piled one upon another like the little stones in a heap of gravel it was white and beautiful and in some of the biggest bubbles caleb could see all the colours of the rainbow he wondered where this foam could come from and he determined to carry some of it home to his grandmother so he stripped off a flat piece of birch bark from a neighbouring tree and took up a little of the froth upon it and placed it very carefully upon a rock on the bank where it would remain safely he thought till he was ready to go home  just above where he stood was a little waterfall in the brook the current was stopped by some stones and logs and the water tumbled over the obstruction forming quite a little cataract which sparkled in the sun  caleb threw sticks and pieces of bark into the water above the fall and watched them as they sailed on faster and faster and then pitched down the descent then he would go and whip them into his landing and thus he could take them out and sail them down again after amusing himself some time in this manner he began to wonder why raymond did not come and he concluded to take his foam and go along he went to the rock and took up his birch bark but to his surprise the foam had disappeared he was wondering what had become of it when he heard across the road and at a little distance above him a scrambling in the bushes on the side of the mountain at first he was afraid but in a moment more he caught a glimpse of the cow coming out of the bushes and supposing that raymond was behind he threw down his birch bark and began to gallop off to meet him lashing the ground with his whip  at the same time the cow somewhat worried by being driven pretty fast down the rocks came running out into the road and when she saw caleb coming towards her and with such antics began to cut capers too she came on in a kind of halffrolicsome halfangry canter shaking her horns and caleb before he got very near her began to be somewhat frightened at first he stopped looking at her with alarm then he began to fall back to the side of the road towards the brook at this instant raymond appeared coming out of the bushes and seeing caleb called out to him to stand still  stand still caleb till she goes by she will not hurt you but caleb could not control his fears his little heart beat quick and his pale cheek grew paler he could not control his fears though he knew very well that what raymond said must be true he kept retreating backwards nearer and nearer to the brook as the cow came on whipping the air towards her to keep her off he was now at some little distance above the cotton landing and opposite to a part of the bank where the water was deep raymond perceived his danger and as he was now on the very brink he shouted out suddenly  caleb caleb take care  but the sudden call only frightened poor caleb still more and before the take care was uttered his foot slipped and he slid back into the water and sank into it until he entirely disappeared  raymond rushed to the place and in an instant was in the water by his side and pulling caleb out he carried him gasping to the shore he wiped his face with his handkerchief and tried to cheer and encourage him  never mind caleb said he it wont hurt you it is a warm sunny morning caleb cried a few minutes but finally became pretty nearly calm and raymond led him along towards home sobbing as he went o dear mewhat will my grandmother say     chapter ii  trouble   as caleb walked along by the side of raymond and came upon the bridge he was seen both by his grandmother who happened to be standing at the door and also at the same instant by the two boys dwight and david who were just then coming home from school dwight seeing caleb walking along so sadly his clothes and hair thoroughly drenched set up a shout and ran towards him over the bridge david was of a more quiet and sober turn and he followed more slowly but with a face full of surprise and curiosity  madam rachel too perceived that her little grandson had been in the brook and she said can it be possible that he has disobeyed then again the next thought was well if he has he has been punished for it pretty severely and so i will treat him kindly  david and dwight came eagerly up with exclamations and questions without number this made poor caleb feel worse and worsehe wanted to get home as soon as possible and he could not tell the boys all the story there and presently raymond finding that he could not get by them very well took him up in his arms and carried him towards the house david and dwight following behind caleb expected that his grandmother would think him very much to blame and so as he came near enough to speak to her he raised his head from raymonds shoulder and began to say  i am very sorry grandmother but i could not help it i certainly could not help it  but he saw at once by his grandmothers pleasantlooking face that she was not going to find any fault with him  you have not hurt yourself caleb i hope said she as raymond put him down  no said he but i feel rather cold  his grandmother said she would soon warm him and she led him into a little bedroom where he was accustomed to sleep and undressed him talking goodhumouredly with him all the while so as to relieve his fears and make him feel more happy she wiped him dry with soft flannel and gave him some clean dry clothes and made him very comfortable again she did not ask him how he happened to fall in the water for she knew it would trouble him to talk about it so she amused him by talking about other things and at last let him out again into the parlour  the wetting did caleb no injury but the fright and the suddenness of the plunge gave him a shock which in his feeble state of health he was ill able to bear a good stout boy with red cheeks and plump limbs would not have regarded it at all but would have been off to play again just as soon as his clothes were changed but poor caleb sat down in his little rocking chair by the side of his grandmother and began to rock back and forth as if he was rocking away the memory of his troubles while his grandmother went on with her work  presently he stopped to listen to the voices of dwight and david who were out before the house  grandmother said he is that the boys  yes said she i believe it is  then caleb went on rocking and the voices died away  presently they came nearer again the boys seemed to be passing down in front of the house with a wheelbarrow towards the water  grandmother said caleb stopping again what do you suppose the boys are doing  i dont know said she should not you like to go and see you can play with them half an hour before dinner if you please  caleb did not answer but began to rock again he did not seem inclined to go  soon after he heard a splash as of stones thrown into the water caleb started up and said  grandmother what can they be doing  i dont know said she if you want to know very much you must go and see  caleb rose slowly put his rocking chair back into its place and went to the door he looked down towards the bank of the brook before the house and saw dwight and david there they had a wheelbarrow close to the edge of the water with a few stones in it some as big as calebs head each of the boys had a stone in his hand which he was just throwing into the brook caleb had a great desire to go down and see what they were doing but he felt weak and tired and so after looking on a moment he said to himself i had rather sit down here so he sat down upon the step of the door and looked on  after the boys had thrown one or two large stones into the water they took hold of the wheelbarrow and then tipping it up the whole load slid down into the water close to the shore the boys then came back wheeling the great wheelbarrow up into the road  they went after another load of stones and calebs curiosity was so far awakened that he rose slowly and walked down towards the place in a few minutes the boys came back with their load david wheeling and dwight walking along by his side and pushing as well as he could to help as soon as he saw caleb he began to call out  o caleb you were afraid of a cow  caleb looked sad and unhappy david said  i would not laugh at him dwight caleb we are building a mole  a mole said caleb what is that  why it is a kind of wharf built out far into the water to make a harbour for our shipping we learned about it in our geography  yes said dwight coming up eagerly to caleb you see the current carries all our vessels down the stream you know caleb and we are going to build out a long mole out into the middle of the brook and that will stop our vessels and then we are going to make it pretty wide so that we can walk out upon it and the end of it will do for a wharf  yes it will be a sort of harbour for em said david  caleb looked quite pleased at this plan and wanted the boys to let him help and dwight said he might go and help them get their next load of stones  but caleb did not help much although he really tried to help he kept getting into the other boys way at last dwight got out of patience and said  caleb you dont help us the least mite i wish you would go away  but caleb wanted to help and dwight tried to make him go away presently he began to laugh at him for being afraid of a cow  i suppose i could frighten you by mooing at you caleb  caleb did not answer but walked along by the side of the wheelbarrow david was wheeling it for they had now got it loaded and were going back to the shore of the brook caleb on one side and dwight upon the other dwight saw that caleb hung his head and looked confused  moo moo said dwight  caleb walked along silent as before  moo moo said dwight running round to calebs side of the wheelbarrow and mooing close into his ear  caleb let go of the wheelbarrow turned around burst into tears and walked slowly and sorrowfully away towards the house  there now said david you have made him cry what do you want to trouble him so for  dwight looked after caleb and seeing that he was going to the house he was afraid that he would tell his grandmother so he ran after him and began to call to him to stop but before he had gone many steps he saw his grandmother standing at the door of the house and calling to them all to come  caleb had nearly stopped crying when he came up to his grandmother she did not say any thing to him about the cause of his trouble but asked him if he was willing to go down cellar with mary anna and help her choose a plateful of apples for dinner his eye brightened at this proposal and mary anna who was sitting at the window reading rose laid down her book took hold of his hand with a smile and led him away  madam rachel then went to her seat in her great armchair and david and dwight came and stood by her side  i am sorry dwight that you wanted to trouble caleb  but mother said dwight i only mooed at him a little  and what did you do it for  o only for fun mother  did you suppose it gave him pain  whyi dont know  did you suppose it gave him pleasure  why no said dwight looking down  and did not you know that it gave him pain now tell me honestly  why yes mother i knew it plagued him a little but then i only did it for fun  i know it said madam rachel and that is the very thing that makes me so sorry for it  why mother said dwight in a tone of surprise  because if you had given caleb four times as much pain for any other reason i should not have thought half so much of it as to have you trouble him for fun if it had been to do him any good or to do any body else any good or from mistake or mere thoughtlessness i should not have thought so much of it but to do it for fun  here madam rachel stopped as if she did not know what to say  i rather think mother it was only thoughtlessness said david by way of excusing dwight  no because he knew that it gave caleb pain and it was in fact for the very purpose of giving him pain that dwight did it if he had been saying moo accidentally without thinking of troubling caleb that would have been thoughtlessness but it was not so and what makes me most unhappy about this continued madam rachel putting her hand gently on dwights head is that my dear dwight has a heart capable under some circumstances of taking pleasure in the sufferings of a helpless little child  david and dwight were both silent though they saw clearly that what their mother said was true  and yet perhaps you think it is a very little thing after all she continued just mooing at caleb a little the pain it gave him was soon over just sending him down cellar to get apples made him forget it in a moment so that you see it is not the mischief that is done in this case but the spirit of mind in you that it shews it is a little thing i know but then it is a little symptom of a very bad disease it is very hard to cure  well mother said dwight looking up and speaking very positively i am determined not to trouble caleb any more  yes but i am afraid your determinations wont reach the difficulty as long as the spirit of mind remains so that you are capable of taking pleasure in the sufferings of another your determinations not to indulge the bad spirit will not do much good you will forget them all when the temptation comes dont you remember how often i have talked with you about this and how often you have promised not to do it before  why yes mother said dwight despondingly  so you see determinations will not do much good as long as your heart is malicious the malice will come out in spite of all your determinations  just at this moment caleb came in bringing his plate of apples with an air of great importance and satisfaction he had nearly forgotten his troubles soon after this dinner was brought in and madam rachel said no more to the boys about malice after dinner they went out again to play     chapter iii  building the mole   caleb sat down upon the step of the door eating a piece of bread while dwight and david returned to their work of building the mole they got the wheelbarrow and loaded it with stones  caleb sat a few minutes more at the door and then he went into the house and got his little rocking chair and brought it out under the elm and sat down there looking towards the boys who were at work near the water at last david spied him sitting there and said  there is caleb sitting under the great tree  dwight looked around and then throwing down the stone that he had in his hands he said  i mean to go and get him to come here  so he ran towards him and said  come caleb come down here and help us make our mole  no said caleb shaking his head and turning away a little i dont want to go  o do come caleb said dwight i wont trouble you any more  no said caleb i am tired and i had rather stay here in my little chair  but i will carry your chair down to the brook and there is a beautiful place there to sit and see us tumble in the stones  so caleb got up and dwight took his chair and they walked together down to the shore of the brook dwight found a little spot so smooth and level that the rockingchair would stand very even upon it though it would not rock very well for the ground was not hard like a floor caleb rested his elbow upon the arm of his chair and his pale cheek in his little slender hand and watched the stones as one after another they fell into the brook  the brook at this place was very wide and shallow and the current was not very rapid so that they got along pretty fast and thus the mole advanced steadily out into the stream  well caleb said dwight as he stopped after they had tossed out all the stones from the wheelbarrow and how do you like our mole  o not very well said caleb  why not said dwight surprised  it is so stony  stony said dwight  yes said caleb i dont think i could walk on it very well  o said dwight we are going to make the top very smooth when we get it done  how said caleb  why we are going to haul gravel on it and smooth it all down  why cant we do it now said david as we go along and then we can wheel our wheelbarrow out upon it and tip our stones in at the end  agreed said dwight and they accordingly leveled the stones off on the top and put small stones in at all the interstices that is the little spaces between the large stones so as to prevent the gravel from running down through then they went and got a load of gravel out of a bank pretty near and spread it down over the top and it made a good smooth road only it was not trodden down hard at first and so it was not very easy wheeling over it  they found one difficulty however and that was that the gravel rolled over each side of the mole and went into the water to prevent this they arranged the largest stones on each side in a row for the edge and then filled in with gravel up to the edge and thus they gradually advanced towards the middle of the stream finishing the mole completely as they went on caleb then said he liked it very much and wanted to walk on it so the boys let him he went out to the end and stood there a minute and then said that he wished he had his whip there to whip in a stick which was sailing down a little way off  where is your whip said david  i suppose it is hanging up on its nail said caleb i mean to go and get it  so caleb walked off the mole and went slowly up towards the house singing by the way while david and dwight went after another load of gravel while they were putting down this load and spreading it on caleb came back looking disappointed and sorrowful and saying that he could not find his whip  where did you put it when you had it last asked david  i put it on the nail said caleb i always put it on the nail  o no caleb said dwight you must have left it about somewhere  no said caleb shaking his head with a positive air i am sure i put it on my nail  when did you have it last  whylet me see said caleb thinking i had it yesterday playing horses on the woodpile and then i had it this morningi believewhen i went up the brook to meet raymond  then you left it up there i know said dwight  no said caleb i am sure i put it on my nail  you did not have it caleb said david mildly when we met you on the bridge  didnt i said caleb standing still and trying to think  no replied dwight decidedly  i wish you would go up there with me and help me find it  why we want to finish our mole said david  ill go said dwight while you david get another load of gravel come caleb said he go and shew me where it was  so dwight and caleb walked on they went down to the bridge crossed the stream upon it then turned up on the opposite bank and walked on until they came to the cotton landing caleb then pointed to the place where he had fallen in and they looked all about there upon the bank and in the water but in vain no whip was to be found  before they returned they stopped a moment at the cotton landing and caleb shewed dwight that the cotton was all made of little bubbles they got some of it to the shore and examined it and then just as they were going away dwight exclaimed suddenly  there is your whip now caleb  caleb looked round and saw that dwight was pointing towards the little fall or rather great ripple of water and there just in the fall was the whiphandle floating and kept from drifting away by the lash which had got caught in the rocks there the handle lay or rather hung bobbing up and down and struggling as if it was trying to get free  after various attempts to liberate it by throwing sticks and stones at it dwight took off his shoes turned up his pantaloons to his knees and waded in to the place and after carefully extricating the whip brought it safely to the shore  i am very glad i have got my whip again said caleb while dwight was putting on his shoes  i am glad too said dwight but you told a lie about it caleb  a lie said caleb  yes you said you certainly hung it up upon the nail said dwight as they began to walk along  well i thought i did said caleb  that makes no difference you did not say you thought you hung it up but that you were sure you did  well i certainly thought i did said caleb and i am sure it wasnt a lie  dwight insisted that it was and caleb determined to ask his grandmother  they returned to the mole  it was not long after this that david on looking towards the house called out that his mother was coming it was true she put on her bonnet and was coming slowly down to the brook to see how the boys got on with their work they were rejoiced to see her coming they took calebs chair and laid it down upon its side and then put one of the sidepieces of the wheelbarrow upon it with the clean side up and this made quite a comfortable seat for her though it was a little unsteady she sat down upon it and made a good many enquiries about their plan and the progress of the work  well boys said she that is a capital plan and you will have a great eddy above your mole  an eddy said dwight what is that  why the water coming down will strike upon the outer end of your mole and be turned in towards the shore and then will go round and will come into the stream again there you can see it is beginning to run so already  so the boys looked above the mole and they saw the little bubbles that were floating in the water sailing round and round slowly in a small circle between the upper side of the mole and the shore  when you get it built away out said madam rachel there will be quite a whirlpool you might call it the maelstrom there you see caleb can have a little harbour up there on the shore and one of you can go out to the end of the mole and put a little ship into the water and the eddy will carry it round to him then he can take out the cargo and put in a new one and then set the ship in the water and the current will carry it back again round on the other side of the whirlpool  the boys were very much delighted at this prospect and they determined to build out the mole very far so as to have a great sweep as dwight called it in the eddy caleb went out upon the part of the mole which was finished and put in a piece of wood and watched it with great delight as it slowly sailed round     chapter iv  a discussion   while caleb stood upon the mole he began to whip the water and in doing so he spattered david and dwight a little  dwight said take care calebdont spatter us and he went up to him and was going gently to take hold of his whip to take it away let me have the whip said he  no said caleb holding it firmly i want it  let go of it dwight said madam rachel  why mother he ought to let me have it for i went and got it for him he would not have had it at all without me  you must not take it by violence said his mother if you have ever so good a right to it but did you get it for him  yes mother and he told a lie about it  o dwight said his mother you ought not to say so i cant think caleb would tell a lie  he did mother he said he was sure he hung it up when after all he dropped it in the water and we agreed to leave it to you if that was not telling a lie  did you know caleb when you said you hung it up that you had really left it in the water  no grandmother said caleb very earnestly i really thought i had hung it up  then it was not telling a lie dwight a lie is told with an intention to deceive to make it a lie it is necessary that the person who says a thing must know distinctly at the time that he says it that it is not true and he must say it with the particular intention to deceive now caleb did not do this  well mother said dwight i am sure you have told us a good many times that we must never say any thing unless we are sure it is true  so i have i admit that caleb did wrong in saying so positively that he had hung his whip up when he did not know certainly that he had but this does not prove that it was telling a lie you know there are a great many other faults besides telling lies and this is one of them  what do you call it mother said david  i dont know said she hesitating it is a very common faultasserting a thing positively when you do not know whether it is true or not but if you think it is true even if you have no proper grounds for thinking so and are entirely mistaken it is not telling a lie  in fact she continued i once knew a case where one boy was justly punished for falsehood when what he said was true and another was rewarded for his truth when what he said was false  why mother said dwight and david together with great surprise  yes said madam rachel the case was this they were farmers boys and they wanted to go into the barn and play upon the hay their father told them they might go but charged them to be careful to shut the door after them in going in so as not to let the colt get out so the boys ran off to the barn in high glee and were so eager to get upon the hay that they forgot altogether to shut the door when they came down they found the door open and to their great alarm the colt was nowhere to be seen josy one of the boys said let us shut the door now and not tell father that we let the colt out and he will think somebody else did it  no said james the other let us tell the truth  so about an hour afterwards josy went into the house and his father said josy did you let the colt out  no sir said josy  not long after he met james  james said he you had a fine time upon the hay i suppose i hope you did not let the colt out  james hung his head and said why yes sir we did we forgot to shut the door and so he got away  now which of these boys do you suppose was guilty of telling a lie  why josy certainly said david dwight and caleb all together  yes and yet the colt had not got away  hadnt he said dwight  no he was safely coiled up in a corner upon some hay out of sight and there the farmer found him safe and sound when he went in to look but did that make any difference in josys guilt do you think  no mother said dwight david at the same time shook his head shewing that he entertained the same opinion  i think it did not continued madam rachel and the farmer thought so too for he very properly punished josy and rewarded james  dwight seemed to assent to this rather reluctantly as if he was almost sorry that caleb had not been proved guilty of telling a lie  well mother he said presently with a more lively tone at any rate he disobeyed you for you told him not to go near the brook where the bank was high and he did or else he never would have fallen in  but i could not help it said caleb the cow frightened me so  yes you could help it said dwight for the cow did not come up and push you you walked back yourself of your own accord  madam rachel observed that caleb appeared more pale and languid than usual and this new charge which dwight brought against him made him more sad and melancholy still  madam rachel accordingly then said she would not talk any more about it then for she must go in and she asked caleb whether he would rather go in with her or remain out there with the boys he said he would rather go in so he took hold of madam rachels hand and walked along by her side david said he would bring his rockingchair for him when he and dwight should come in     chapter v  the story of blind samuel   madam rachel went into the house and sat down in her large rockingchair by a window in a back parlour that looked out upon a little garden and began to sew caleb played around a little while rather languidly and at last came up to his grandmother and leaning upon her lap asked her if she would not take him up and rock him a little she could not help pitying him he looked so feeble and sad and she accordingly laid down her work and lifted him uphe was not heavy  well caleb you have not asked me to take you up and tell you a story so for a long time this is the way i used to do when you were quite a little boy only then you used to kneel in my lap and lay your head upon my shoulder so that my mouth was close to your ear but you are too big now  caleb smiled a little for he was glad to find that he was growing big but it was rather a faint and sad smile  but i dont grow any stronger grandmother said he i wish i was well and strong like the other boys  you dont know what would be best for you my little caleb god leads you along in his own way through life and you must go patiently and pleasantly on just where he thinks best you are like blind samuel going through the woods with his father  how was that grandmother said he sitting up and turning round to look at her  you sit still said she gently laying him back again and i will tell you  samuel was a blind boy he had been away and was now going home with his father his father led him and he walked along by his side presently they came to a large brook and before they got near it they heard it roaring his father said samuel i think there is a freshet i think so too said samuel for i hear the water roaring when they came in sight of the stream his father said yes samuel there has been a great freshet and the bridge is carried away and what shall we do now said samuel why we must go round by the path through the woods that will be bad for me said samuel but i will lead you said his father all the way just trust every thing to me yes father said samuel i will  so his father took a string out of his pocket and gave one end of it to samuel there samuel said he take hold of that and that will guide you and walk directly after me  how long was the string said caleb  o not very long replied madam rachel so as just to let him walk a step or two behind  after he had walked on a short distance he said father i wish you would let me take hold of your hand but you said replied his father that you would trust every thing to me so i will father said samuel but i do wish you would let me take hold of your hand instead of this string very well said his father you may try your way  so samuel came and took hold of his fathers hand and tried to walk along by his fathers side but the path was narrow there was not more than room for one and though his father walked as far on one side as possible yet samuel had not room enough the branches scratched his face and he stumbled continually upon roots and stones at length he said father you know best i will take hold of the string and walk behind  so after that he was patient and submissive and followed his father wherever he led after a time his father saw a serpent in the road directly before them so he turned aside to go round by a compass in the woods  a compass said caleb  yes said his grandmother that is a roundabout way but it was very rough and stony presently samuel stopped and said father it seems to me it is pretty stony havent we got out of the path  yes said his father but you promised to be patient and submissive and trust every thing to me  well said samuel you know best and i will follow  so he walked on again when they had got by his father told him that the reason why he had gone out of the road was that there was a serpent there and so when god leads us in a difficult way caleb that we dont understand at the time we often see the reason of it afterwards  caleb did not answer and madam rachel went on with her story  by and by his father came within the sound of the brook again and stopped a minute or two and then he told samuel that he should have to leave him a short time and that he might sit down upon a log and wait until he came back but father said samuel i dont want to be left alone here in the woods in the dark it is not dark said his father it is all dark to me said samuel i know it is said his father and i am very sorry but you promised to leave every thing to me and be obedient and submissive so i will father you know best and i will do just as you say so samuel sat down upon the log and his father went away he was a little terrified by the solitude and the darkness and the roaring of the water but he trusted to his father and was still  by and by he heard a noise as of something heavy falling into the water he was frightened for he thought it was his father but it was not his father what do you think it was caleb  caleb did not answer madam rachel looked down to see why he did not speak and as she moved him a little so as to see his face his head rolled over to one side and in short madam rachel found that he was fast asleep  poor little fellow said she and she rose carefully and carried him to the bed and laid him down he opened his eyes a moment when his cheek came in contact with the cool pillow but turned his face over immediately shut his eyes again and was soon in a sound sleep     chapter vi  engineering   when caleb awoke it was almost evening the rays of the setting sun were shining in at the window caleb opened his eyes and after lying still a few moments began to sing he thought it was morning and that it was time for him to get up presently however he observed that the sun was shining in at the wrong window for morning then he noticed that he was not undressed and finally he thought it must be night but he could not think how he came to be asleep there at that time  caleb went out into the parlour david and dwight were just putting the chairs around the tea table at tea time the boys talked a good deal about the mole and they asked mary anna if she would help them rig some vessels to sail in the maelstrom  sail in the maelstrom said mary anna whoever heard of sailing in the maelstrom that is a great whirlpool which swallows up ships they never sail in it you had better call it the gulf stream  well said dwight we will and will you help us rig some vessels  yes said mary anna when you get the mole done  mary anna was a beautiful girl about seventeen years old with a mild and gentle expression of countenance and very pleasant tone of voice she helped the children in all their plays and they were always pleased when she was with them she had great stores of pasteboard and coloured papers to make boxes and portfolios and little pocketbooks and wallets of and she had a paintbox and pencils and drawingbooks and portfolios of pictures and drawing lessons  she rigged the boys vessels and covered their balls and made them beautiful flags and banners out of her pieces of coloured silk she advised them to have a flagstaff out at the end of the mole as they generally have on all fortifications and national works she told them she would make them a handsome flag for the purpose  after tea she went down with them to see the works she seemed to like the mole very much the whirlpool was moving very regularly and she advised them to build the mole out pretty far  yes said dwight and we are going to have a piece across up and down the stream at the end of it so as to make a t of it  i think you had better make a y of it said mary anna  a y said dwight how  why instead of having the end piece go straight across the end of the mole let the two parts of it branch out into the stream one upwards and the other down  what good will that do said david  why if you make it straight like a t the current will run directly along the outer edge of it and so your vessels will not stay there but if you have it yshaped there will be a little sort of harbour in the crotch where your vessels can lie quietly while the current flows along by out beyond the forks  that will be excellent said dwight clapping his hands  and besides said she the upper part of the y will run out obliquely into the stream and so turn more of the current into your eddy and make the whirlpool larger  well and we will make it so said david and then it will be an excellent mole  yes said mary anna there will be all sorts of water around ita whirlpool above a little harbour in the crotch a current in front and still water below it will be as good a place for sailing boats as i ever saw  but the twilight was coming on and they all soon returned to the house  madam rachel had a little doublebedroom as it was called where she slept it was called a doublebedroom because it consisted in fact of two small rooms with a large arched opening between them without any door in one room was the bed which moved in and out on little trucks for caleb in the other room was a table in the middle with books and papers upon it there was a window in one side and opposite the arched opening which led to the bedroom was a small sofa  now it was madam rachels custom every evening before the children went to bed to take them into her bedroom and hear them read a few verses of the bible and then she would explain the verses and talk with them a little about what had occurred during the day and give them good advice and good instruction at such times the children usually sat upon the sofa on one side of the table and madam rachel took her seat on the other side of the table in the chair so as to face them the children generally liked this very much and yet she very seldom told them any stories at these times it was almost all reasonings and explanations and yet the children liked it very much     chapter vii  the sofa   the boys took their places on the sofa and afterwards laid their books upon the table after that madam rachel began to talk about the occurrences of the day as follows  there are two or three things boys that i have been keeping to talk with you about this evening one is the question you asked dwight about calebs disobeying me when he fell into the water  yes mother said dwight looking up at once very eagerly you told him never to go near the bank and yet he went and so he fell in  but i could not help it said caleb  why yes mother he certainly could help it for he walked there himself of his own accord  very well that is the question for us to consider but first we must all be in a proper state of mind to consider it or else it will do us no good now dwight i am going to ask you a question and i want to have you answer it honestlywhich way do you wish to have this question about calebs disobedience decided  whyi dont know said dwight  suppose i should come to the conclusion that caleb did right and should prove it by arguments should you feel a little glad or a little sorry  dwight hung his head and seemed somewhat confused but said doubtfully that he did not know  now i think myself said his mother that you have a secret wish to have it appear that caleb is guilty of disobedience you said he disobeyed at first from unkind feelings which you seemed to feel towards him at the moment and now i suppose you wish to adhere to it so as to get the victory now honestly isnt it so  dwight did not answer at first he looked somewhat ashamed presently however he concluded that it was best to be frank and honest so he looked up and acknowledged that it was so  yes said his mother and while you are under the influence of such a prejudice it would do no good for us to discuss the subject for you would not be convinced so you had better give it up  madam rachel saw while she was speaking that dwight did not look sullen and dissatisfied but goodnatured and pleasant and so she knew that he had concluded to listen candidly to what she had to say  i think that caleb was not to blame at all said madam rachel for two reasons one is that he was probably overwhelmed with terror to be sure as you say the cow did not push him he walked himselfyet still he was impelled as strongly as if he had been pushed though in a different manner  then there is another reason why caleb is innocent of any disobedience when i told him that he must not go to the high banks i did not mean that he never must go in any case whatever  i thought you said he never must said david  i presume i did say so and i made no exceptions but still some exceptions are always implied in such a case in all commands however positive they may be there is always some exception implied  why mother said dwight with surprise  it is so said his mother suppose for instance that i were to tell you to sit down by the parlour fire and study a lesson and not to get out of your chair on any account and suppose that after i had gone and left you the fire should fall down and some coals roll out upon the floor would it not be your duty to get up and brush them back  why yes said dwight  so in all cases very extreme and extraordinary occurrences that could not by possibility have been considered make exceptions and caleb thinking as he did that he was in great danger from the cow if he had thought of my command at all he would have done perfectly right to have considered so extraordinary a case an exception and so have retreated towards the brook notwithstanding my commands and now that question is settled  here little caleb who had been sitting up very straight and looking eagerly at his grandmother and at the other boys during the progress of the conversation drew a long breath and leaned back against the sofa as if he felt a good deal relieved  and now dwight there is one thing i have seen in you today which gave me a great deal of pleasure and another which gave me pain  what mother said dwight  why after i talked with you at noon about teasing caleb you began to treat him very kindly that gave me a great deal of pleasure i saw that your heart was somewhat changed in regard to caleb for you seemed to take pleasure in making him happy while before you took delight in making him miserable  dwight looked gratified and pleased while his mother was saying these things  but then in the course of the afternoon she continued the old malignant heart seemed to come back again when i came down to see the mole i found you in such a state of mind as to take pleasure in calebs suffering you wanted to prove that he had told a lie and looked disappointed when i shewed you that he had not then you wanted to prove he had disobeyed me when after all you knew very well that he had not  o mother said dwight  yes dwight i am very sorry to have to say so but you undoubtedly had no real belief that caleb had done wrong suppose i had told you i was going to punish him for disobeying me in retreating to the brook should you have thought that it would have been right  why no mother said dwight  you would have been shocked at such an idea and now dont you see that all your attempts to prove that he had done wrong was only the effect of the illwill you felt towards him at the time it was malice triumphing over your judgment and your sense of right and wrong i told you you know that your resolutions would not reach the case  well mother i am determined said dwight very deliberatively and positively that i never will tease or trouble caleb any more  the evil is not so much in teasing and troubling caleb as in having a heart capable of taking any pleasure in it that is the great difficulty  well mother i am determined i never will feel any pleasure in his trouble again  i am afraid that wont depend altogether upon the determination you make for instance when you went to caleb today and kindly tried to persuade him to go down and offered to carry his rockingchair for him your heart was then in a state of love towards him do you think you could then by determination have changed it from love to hate and begun to take pleasure in teasing him  dwight remembered how kindly and pleasantly he had felt towards caleb at that time and he thought that it would have been impossible for him then to have found any pleasure in tormenting him and so he said no mother i could not  and so when you are angry with a person and your heart is in a state of illwill and malice towards him does it seem to you that you can merely by a determination change it all at once and begin to be filled with love so as to feel pleasure in his happiness  dwight was silent at first he presently answered faintly that he could not  and if you cannot change your heart by your mere determination at the time you certainly cannot by making one general determination now beforehand for all time to come  dwight saw his helpless condition and sighed after a pause he said  mother it seems to me you are discouraging me from trying to be a better boy  no dwight but i dont want you to depend on false hopes that must only end in your disappointment your determination will help in not indulging the bad feelings but i want to have your heart changed so that you could not possibly have such feelings i hope mine is i once shewed the same spirit that you do but now i dont think it would be possible for me to take any pleasure in teasing caleb or you or david  i hope added madam rachel that god will give you a benevolent and tender heart so that there shall be no tendency in you to do wrong he will change yours if you pray to him to do it in fact i hope and sometimes i almost believe that he has begun i do not think you would have gone to caleb today so pleasantly and acknowledged your fault as you did by your actions and felt so totally different from what you had done if god had not wrought some change in you i have very often talked with children about such faults as plainly and kindly as i did with you and it produced no effect when they went away i found by their looks and actions afterwards that their hearts were not changed at all and so dwight said she i have not been saying this to discourage you but to make you feel that you need a greater change than you can accomplish and so to lead you to god that you may throw yourself upon him and ask him not merely to help you in your determinations not to act out your bad feelings but to change the very nature of them or rather to carry on the change which i hope he has begun  dwight remembered while his mother was talking how full his heart had been of kindness and love to caleb while he was helping him that afternoon and he perceived clearly that he had not produced that state of mind by any of his own determinations that he would feel so before he actually did he remembered how happy he had been at that time and how discontented and miserable after he had been troubling caleb and he had a feeling of strong desire that god would change his heart and make him altogether and always benevolent and kind  now it happened that caleb had not understood this conversation very well and he began to be weary and uneasy besides just about this time he began to recollect something about his grandmothers beginning a story for him when she took him up in her lap after he came in from the mole so when he noticed that there was a pause in the conversation he said  grandmother you promised to tell me a story about blind samuel  so i did said his grandmother smiling and i began it but before i got through you got fast asleep  david and dwight laughed and so in fact did caleb and madam rachel then said that if he would tell david and dwight the story as far as she had gone she would finish it  well said caleb i will once there was a blind boy and his name was samuel and you see he was going through the woods and his father was with him and his father walked along and he walked along and it was stony and he said he would do just what his father said because his father knew bestandand so he took hold of the string again  what string said dwight  why it was his fathers string said caleb eagerly looking up into dwights face  what did he have a string for said david  why to lead him along by said caleb  yesbut why did not he take hold of his fathers hand asked dwight  whywhythere was a snake in the road i believewasnt there grandmother  his grandmother smiledfor caleb had evidently got bewildered in his drowsiness so that he had not a very distinct recollection of the story she therefore began again and told the whole when she got to the place where she left off before that is to the place samuel heard a splash in the water dwight started up and asked eagerly  what was it  a stone i suppose said david coolly  no said madam rachel it was only the end of the stem of a small tree which samuels father was trying to fix across the brook so that he could lead his blind boy over it was lying upon the ground and he took it and raised it upon its end near the edge of the bank on one side and then let it fall over in hopes that the other end would fall upon the opposite bank but it did not happen to fall straight across and so the end fell into the water and this was the noise that samuel heard  he drew the stick back again and then contrived to raise it on its end once more and this time he was more successful it fell across and so extended from bank to bank in a few minutes he succeeded in getting another by its side and then he came back to samuel  samuel said he i have built a bridge  a bridge said samuel  yes said he a sort of a bridge and now i am going to try to lead you over  but father i am afraid  you said you would trust yourself entirely to me and go wherever i should say  well father said samuel i will you know best after all  so samuel took hold of his fathers hand and with slow and very careful steps he got over the roaring torrent and then they soon came out into a broad smooth road and so got safely home  now caleb continued madam rachel after she had finished her story do you remember what i meant to teach you by this story  yes grandmother you said that i was like blind samuel and that god knew what was best for me and that i must let him lead me wherever he pleases  yes and what was it that you said that reminded me to tell you the story  i said that i wished that i was well and strong like the other boys  yes said his grandmother i do not think you said it in a fretful or impatient spirit but i thought that this story of samuel would help to keep you patient and contented  yes grandmother it does said caleb     chapter viii  the cart ride   a week after this caleb had his whip to mend he had broken off the lash by whipping in sticks and little pieces of driftwood to the mole david and dwight worked a little every day upon the mole and had carried it out pretty far into the stream and had almost finished the lower branches of the y so one morning after the boys had gone to school and caleb had had his reading lesson he sat down upon the steps of the door behind the house and began to tie on his lash with a piece of twine which mary anna had given him  behind the house where calebs grandmother lived there was a lane which led to the pasture at the head of the lane where you entered it from the yard were a pair of bars while caleb was mending his whip he accidentally looked up and noticed that the bars were down  there mr raymond said caleb talking to himself as he went on winding his twine round and round the whiphandle for once in your life you have been careless you have left your bars down now we shall have the cattle all let out unless i go and stop the mischief  caleb thought he would go and put the bars up again as soon as he had tied the ends of his twine but before he got quite ready he heard a noise as of something coming in the lane he could not see down the lane far from the place where he sat for the barn was in the way but he wondered what could be coming and he looked towards the bars and sat waiting for it to appear  in a moment the head and horns of a great ox came into view and immediately after the body of the ox himself walking slowly along towards the bars  there now said caleb there comes lion and hell get away so he jumped up and ran towards the ox a few steps brandishing his whip and shouting out to drive him back old lion however seemed to pay no attention but came steadily forward stepping carefully over the ends of the bars and then advancing a little way into the yard began quietly to feed upon the grass before caleb got over his surprise at the entire indifference which old lion seemed to feel towards him and his whip he heard the bars rattling again and looking there he saw star lions mate following on  o dear me said caleb what shall i do all our oxen are getting away ill run and call raymond  so he began to shout out raymond as loud as he could call and immediately afterwards he heard raymonds voice answering just down the lane and looking that way he saw him coming over the bars himself as if he had been following the oxen along up the lane  raymond raymond he cried out come quiet all your oxen are getting away  o no said raymond quietly as he was putting up the bars after the oxen they cannot get awayi have fastened the outer gate  then caleb looked around and observed that the outer gate was fastened so that they could not get out of the yard  o very well said he i did not know you were driving them up and so he quietly returned to his seat and went on playing with his whip raymond in the mean time proceeded to yoke up the cattle  raymond said caleb at length where are you going with the cattle  out into the woods said raymond  what are you going to do in the woods said caleb  i am going to make a piece of fence  may i go with you  i dont think you can help me much about the fence said raymond  i can pull bushes along said caleb  raymond made no reply but began to drive the oxen towards a cart that was standing in a corner of the yard and after a few minutes caleb renewed his request  raymond i wish you would let me go with you  wellit is just as your grandmother says replied raymond  so caleb ran to ask his grandmother and she came to the window and enquired of raymond how long he expected to be gone he said it would take him more than half a day to make the piece of fence and he was going to take his dinner with him this was an objection to calebs going but yet his grandmother concluded on the whole to consent so they put up some bread and butter and some apples with raymonds dinner for caleb these things were all put in paper parcels and the parcels put into a bag which was thrown into the bottom of the cart  then caleb wanted to take his hatchet  his grandmother thought it would not be safe  ill be very careful said he and if i dont have my hatchet how can i help to make the fence  raymond smiled and madam rachel seemed at a loss to know what to say  it wont dowill it raymond said she  he might cut himself said raymond  but there is a small keyhole saw in the barn that i filed up the other day perhaps he might have that to saw the bushes down with  can you saw caleb said his grandmother  not very well said caleb looking somewhat disappointed the saw sticks so  i can set it pretty rank said raymond speaking to madam rachel at the window and then i think he can make it run smooth  madam rachel did not understand what raymond meant by setting it rank and so she said  how will that help it raymond  why then it will cut a wide kerf said raymond and so the back will follow in easily  she did not understand from this much better than she did before but as she had great confidence in raymond she concluded to let him manage in his own way she accordingly told him that he might fix the saw and take caleb with him  so raymond went out into the barn and took down the saw from a nail the teeth looked bright and sharp  why raymond how sharp it looks and the teeth are of different shape from what they were before  yes said raymond i have made a cutting saw of it  a cutting saw said caleb can you cut with a saw i thought they always sawed with a saw  i mean cut across the grain said raymond smiling when a saw is filed so as to saw along the board then it is called a splitting saw but when it is to saw across the board then i call it a cutting saw  caleb looked carefully at the teeth so as to see how the teeth of a cutting saw were shaped and while he looked on he observed that raymond had a little instrument in his hand and he took hold of the first tooth of the saw with it and bent it over a little to one side and then he took hold of the next one and bent it over to the other side and so he went on bending them alternately to the right and left until he passed along from one end of the saw to the other  there said he that is set pretty rank  what do you mean by that said caleb as he followed raymond out of the barn  why the teeth are set off a good way each side and it will cut a good wide kerf and so your saw will run easy  by this time they had reached the cart raymond took hold of caleb under the arms and jumped him up into the cart behind and then handed him his saw then he put in an axe and an iron bar for himself and one or two spare chains and then he went to open the great gate just at this moment mary anna appeared at the window and said  caleb are you going into the woods  yes said caleb  then if you see any good smooth birch bark wont you bring me home some  i will said caleb and then raymond opened the gate and started the oxen on caleb stood up in front holding on by a stake and wondering all the while what raymond could mean by a kerf  one would think that he might have known by the connection in which raymond used itfor he said that he had bent the teeth out so as to make the saw cut a good wide kerf and so he might have supposed that the kerf was the cut in the wood which a saw makes in going in the reason why boys find it so difficult to saw is because the teeth do not generally spread very much and so the kerf is narrow still the back of the saw would run in it well enough without sticking if they were to saw perfectly straight but they generally make the saw twist or wind a little and then the back of the saw rubs upon one side or the other and sticks now raymonds plan was to make the teeth set off each side so far as to make the kerf very wide and then he thought that caleb would be able to make it go especially as the saw was very narrow  raymond got into the cart and took his seat upon a board which passed across from side to side and they rode along  they reached at length a place where there was a small cart path leading off from the main road into the woods raymond turned off into this path but it was so narrow that both he and caleb had sometimes to lean away to one side or the other to avoid the bushes at length he stopped and unfastened the oxen from the tongue when all was right he started the oxen on before him caleb trotting on behind with his saw in his hand  presently they struck off from the cart path directly into the woods and in a few minutes came to the place where the fence was to be made     chapter ix  the fire   raymond let the cattle browse about while he went to work cutting down some small but yet pretty tall and bushy trees he then brought up the team and hooked a long chain into the ring which hung down from the middle of the yoke upon the under side the end of the chain trailed upon the ground as the oxen came along and caleb was very much interested to see how they would trample along any where among the rocks roots mire logs bushes stumps and in fact over and through almost any thing chewing their cud all the time patient and unconcerned when they were brought up near to one of the trees that had been cut down raymond would hook the chain around the butt end of it and then at his command they would drag it out of its place in the line of the fence after looking on for some time caleb began to think that he would go to work and he went to a little tree with a stem about as big round as his arm and began to saw away upon it he found that the saw would run very well indeed and in a short time he got the tree off and then undertook to drag it to the fence  raymond was always a very silent man he seldom spoke unless to answer a question and while caleb had been watching him when he first began to work instead of talking with caleb as caleb would have desired he was all the time singing  do re mi fa sol la si do  the truth was that raymond had just begun to go to a singing school and he was taking this opportunity to rise and fall the notes as he called it when caleb asked him any question about his work he would just answer it in a few words and then a minute after begin again with his do re mi and all the rest  caleb became tired of this singing and when at length his tree got wedged fast so that he could not move it any farther he sat down discouraged upon a log and looked anxiously towards raymond as if he wished that he would come and help him  raymond had just hooked his chain to another tree and taking up his goad stick called out  ha star ha lion and then as his oxen started on he followed them with his  do re mi fa sol la si do  dear me said caleb with a deep sigh  do si la sol fa mi re do sang raymond coming down the scale  caleb got up and walked along towards raymond a little way and called out  raymond  what said raymond  when do you think you shall be done singing that tune  raymond smiled and asked why  why said caleb in rather a timid voice i dont think it is a very pretty tune  dont you said raymond well i dont admire it much myself  then what do you sing it so much for raymond  o thats my lesson said raymond but how does your saw do caleb  very well only i cant get my tree along  where do you want to get it  o out to the fence said caleb  you had better not try to make a fence you had better build a fire  but i have not got any fire to light it with  yes said raymond i brought a tinderbox because i thought you would want a fire and i forgot to give it to you  so raymond pointed to a place among some rocks off at a little distance before him near the line in which he was coming along with his fence and advised caleb to make a fire there caleb liked this plan very much he said he would play camp out and so build a camp and have a fire before the camp raymond told him that so soon as he should get his pile of sticks ready he would come and strike fire for him  caleb went to the place and began to work he cut down bushes and placed them up against the rocks in such a manner as to make a little hut which he should get into he then collected a pile of sticks in front of it first he picked up all the dry sticks he could find near and then he sawed off branches from the old dead trees which were lying around in the forest  in an hour with raymonds help in lighting his fire caleb had a very good camp his hut was quite a comfortable one with a blazing fire near it and three large apples roasting before the fire by and by caleb saw raymond coming towards him with the bag over his arm he opened it and took out one parcel after another and then laying the mouth of the bag down upon the ground he took hold of the bottom of it and raised it in the air while caleb watched to see what was coming out it proved to be potatoes and raymond told caleb he might roast them in his fire  cover them up well with hot ashes and coals caleb and then build a fire upon the top  so caleb dug out the bottom of his fire with a polefor the fire had pretty much burnt down to ashesand he put the potatoes in there were five of them raymond helped him to cover them up and then he put more sticks upon the top when that was done and just as he was going back to his work raymond said see there calebthere is a fine chimney for you to burn out  caleb looked where raymond pointed and saw a very tall and large hollow tree or rather trunk of a treefor the top had long since decayed and dropped away there it stood desolate with a great hole in the side near the bottom and the bark hanging loosely about it all the way up to the top the boys always liked to find such hollow trees in the woods to build fires in they called it burning out a chimney  now said raymond all you have got to do is to go to work while your potatoes are roasting and fill up that old hollow tree at the bottom with sticks and brush and old pieces of bark pack them in close then when i come to dinner i will help you to light it  raymond then went back to the fence and caleb began his work as raymond had directed he got all the dried branches that he could find and carried them to the foot of the tree others he sawed and he packed all the pieces in the hollow of the tree as closely as he could  by this time caleb saw raymond coming along towards the camp and he went there to meet him they raked open the fire and took out the potatoes raymond turned a stone upon its edge towards the fire so as to keep them warm he also cut some square pieces of birch bark from a neighbouring tree for plates and gave one to caleb and took one himself and then they both sat down upon a smooth log which raymond drew up to the fire and took their birch bark plates in their lap  raymond took a little paper of salt out of his pocket and poured the salt out upon another square piece of birch bark which he placed upon a stone between himself and caleb so that both could reach it  what shall i do for a spoon said caleb  o you dont need a spoon said raymond and he took up a potatoe himself broke it in two sprinkled some salt upon it and began to eat it as a boy would eat an apple  o i cant eat my potatoes so said caleb  why not said raymond putting a little more salt upon his own potatoe  it is too hot said caleb  then you must wait until it cools  but i want a spoon very much said caleb  well said raymond i will make you one  so raymond took out his knife and cut off a piece from a dry pine branch which lay near him he split this so as to get a flat piece out of it which he fashioned into a rude sort of spoon that answered calebs purpose very well but before caleb had much more than begun his dinner raymond had finished his and rising said that he must go back to his work  but first i will set your chimney afire said he  no said caleb i want you to let me kindle it  you cant  yes i can said caleb i can get some birch bark  very well only if i go away to my work now you must not come and trouble me to come back again because you cant get the fire agoing  no said caleb i wont  so raymond went back to his work and caleb finished his dinner  at length however his potatoes and bread and butter were all gone and his apple cores he had pretty thoroughly scraped with his wooden spoon and thrown into the fire so he got up from his seat and prepared to light his chimney he took his plate for a slow match it was pretty large and stiff and he thought it would burn long enough for him to carry it from the fire to his chimney he accordingly took hold of it by one corner and held the other corner into the flame which was curling up from a brand by the side of his fire  but before the birch bark took fire the flame of the brand went out and then caleb looked around for another the fire had however burnt nearly down so as to leave a great bed of embers with the brands all around it the burnt ends pointing inwards caleb pushed some of these into the fire and soon made a blaze again and then once more attempted to set the corner of his plate on fire  he succeeded the corner began to blaze and curl and caleb rose and moved along carefully lest the wind should blow it out this precaution was however scarcely necessary for the little wind that his motion occasioned only fanned the flame the more and the part which was on fire curled round upon that which was not and thus formed a round and solid mass which burned fiercely  caleb walked along the bark blazing higher and higher and curling in upon itself more and more until at length he began to be afraid it would reach his fingers before he could get to his chimney he walked faster and faster and presently began to run this fanned the fire the more until just as he came within a few steps of his chimney the curling bark reached his fingers and he tripped over a great root at the very instant when he was dropping the piece of bark from his hands he came down upon allfours and the bark which was now a compact roll rolled down a little slope crackling and blazing by the way  caleb got up and looked at the blazing mass a minute or two in despair but finding that it kept on burning his eye suddenly brightened and he said aloud  ill poke it up  so he looked around for a stick he readily found one and began to push the blazing roll up the acclivity but as fast as he pushed it up it rolled down again and all his efforts were consequently vain  o dear me said caleb at length throwing down his stick what shall i do  in the meantime the roll continued blazing and caleb looking at it steadily observed that it was hollow  ah said he ill stick him  so he took up his stick again and tried to thrust the end of the stick into the roll after one or two ineffectual attempts he succeeded though by this time the bark was pretty well burnt through and was all ready to fall to pieces he however succeeded in raising it into the air upon the end of his pole but before he got it to the hollow tree it dropped off again in several blazing fragments which continued to burn a moment upon the ground and then went out entirely  caleb then went to raymond and told him that he could not make his fire burn  o you must not come to me youngster you promised not to trouble me with it said raymond as he hooked the chain around the buttend of another tree  but i thought i could make it burn  well whats the matter with it but stand back for i am going to start this tree along  why the bark all curls up and burns my hand said caleb retreating at the same time out of the way of the top of raymonds tree  the oxen started along dragging the tree and caleb followed trying to get an opportunity to speak once more to raymond raymond however went calling aloud to his oxen and directing them here and there with his gee star and his ha lion and his wo up whoa  at length however he had the tree in its place and seeing caleb standing at a little distance patiently he asked him again  what do you say is the matter with your fire caleb  why the birch bark curls up and burns me i wish you would come and set it afire  no said raymond walking along by the side of his oxen i must not leave my work to help you play but i will tell you three ways to carry the fire and you can manage it in one or the other of them  so saying he took out his knife and cut down a small slender maple which was growing near him and trimmed off the top and the few little branches which were growing near the top it made a slender pole about five feet long with smooth but freckled bark from end to end he then made a little split in one end  there caleb said he take that and stick a piece of birch bark in the split end then you can carry it and let it curl as much as it pleases or if that fails put a large piece of birch bark directly upon the fire then as soon as it begins to burn it will begin to curl and then you must put the end of the stick down to it in such a manner that the bark will curl over and grasp it and then you can take it up and carry the roll upon the end of your pole  very well said caleb there are two ways  there are two ways repeated raymond  now if both these fail you must put on a good many fresh sticks upon the fire with one end of each of them out then as soon as the ends which are in the fire have got burnt through take up two of them by the ends that were out of the fire and lay them down at the foot of the hollow tree close to the wood you have got together there then come back and get two more brands and lay them down in the same way and be careful to have the burnt ends all together so you must keep going back and forth until you find that the brands are beginning to burn up freely in the new place  caleb took the maple pole and went back to his fire he tore the saltcellar in two and this made two very good small strips of bark he pulled open the split end of his pole and carefully inserted one of them and then holding it over a little flame which was rising from a burning brand he set it on fire the bark was soon in a blaze and it writhed and curled as if it were struggling to get away but it only clung to the end of the pole more closely and caleb much pleased at the success of his experiment waved it in the air and shouted to raymond to look and see  he then walked slowly along stopping every moment to wave his great flambeau and shout and so when at last he reached the hollow tree the bark was nearly burnt out and the fragments were beginning to fall off from the end of the pole he then thrust it hastily under the heap of fuel which had been collected in the tree but it was too late it flickered and smoked a minute or two and finally went out altogether  i dont care said caleb to himself for i have got the other half of the saltcellar and he went back for that it happened unluckily however this time that in pulling open the cleft which raymond had made in his maple pole he pulled too hard and split one side off here was at once an end to all attempts to communicate fire to his chimney by this method so after refitting the split part of his stick to its place once or twice and finding that the idea of uniting it again was entirely out of the question he threw the broken piece away and said to himself that he must try raymonds second plan  he accordingly took the other large piece of bark which was the one which raymond had used for his plate and laid it upon the fire as soon as it began to curl he laid the end of the stick close to it on the side towards which it seemed to be bendingand in such a way that it curled over upon it and soon clasped it tight as raymond had predicted that it would do he then raised it in the air and set out to run with it so that it should not burn out before he reached the place but he ought not to have run it would have been far safer and better to have walked along carefully and slowly for as he ran on jumping over logs and stones and scrambling up and down the hummocks the top of the pole with the blazing roll of bark was jerked violently about in the air until at length as he was wheeling around a tree he accidentally held the top of the pole so far that it wheeled round through the air very swiftly and threw the birch bark off by the centrifugal force and away it went rolling along upon the ground  the centrifugal force is that which makes any thing fly off when it is whirled round and round  caleb did not understand this very well but he was surprised to see his roll flying off in that manner he immediately took two sticks and tried to take up the roll with them as one would with a pair of tongs but he could not hold it with them  well then said he i must try the third way  so he began to gather sticks and put the ends of them upon the fire when they began to burn he took up one but as soon as he got it off the fire it began to go out and he said that he knew that way to kindle a fire never would do in fact he began to get out of patience he threw down the stick and went off again after raymond  raymond said he i cannot make my fire burn and i wish you would come and kindle it for me  have you tried the ways i told you about  yes said caleb  have you tried all of them faithfully  all but the last said caleb and i know that wont do  you must try them all faithfully or else i cant come so saying raymond went on with his work  caleb went back a good deal out of humour with himself and saying that he wished raymond was not so cross he took up two of the sticks which were now pretty well on fire and carried them along swinging them by the way to make fiery rings and serpents in the air when he reached the chimney he threw them down carelessly and stood watching them to see if they were going to burn instead however of setting the other wood on fire they only grew dimmer and dimmer themselves and he said to himself i knew they would not burn then he sat down upon a log in a sad state of fretfulness and dissatisfaction  however after waiting a few minutes longer he went back to the fire determined to bring all the brands there were and put them down though he knew he said that they would not burn he was going to do it so that then he could go and tell raymond that he had tried all his plans and that now he must come and light the fire himself  so he walked along back and forth bringing the brands and laying them down together near the foot of the heap of fuel in the tree but before he had brought them all he found that they began to brighten up a little and at length they broke out into a little flame he stood and watched it a few minutes it blazed up higher and higher he then put on some more wood which was near the flame crept up between these sticks and soon began to snap and crackle among the brush in the tree caleb stepped back and watched the flame a moment as it flashed up higher and higher and then clapped his hands jumped up on a log and shouted out  raymond its aburning its aburning     chapter x  the captive   when raymond heard calebs voice calling to him so loudly he paused a moment from his work and seeing that the fire had actually taken in earnest he told caleb that he must go back a little way for byandbye the tree would fall so caleb went back to some distance and asked raymond if that was far enough raymond said it was and raymond then sat down upon a log with his maple pole in his hand to watch the progress of the fire  a dense smoke soon began to pour out of the top of the chimney the fire roared up through the hollow and it caught outside too under the bark and soon enveloped the whole tree in smoke sparks and flame large pieces of the blazing bark detached themselves from time to time from the side of the tree and came down crackling and sparkling to the ground and the opening below where caleb had crammed in his fuel soon glowed like the mouth of a furnace  near the top of the tree was an old branch or rather the stump of an old branch decayed and blackened reaching out a little way like an arm this was soon enveloped in smoke and as caleb was watching it as it appeared and disappeared in the wreaths he thought he saw something move he looked again intently it was a squirrelhalf suffocated in the smoke and struggling to hold on caleb immediately called out to raymond as loud as he could call  raymond raymond come here quick here is a poor squirrel burning up  raymond dropped his axe and ranbounding over the logs and hummocks but before he reached the place the squirrel unable to hold on any longer and half stifled with the smoke and scorching heat dropped from his hold to the ground raymond came up at the moment and seized him he brought him to where caleb was sittingcaleb himself eagerly coming forward to see  is it dead said caleb  pretty much said raymond the squirrel lay gasping helplessly in raymonds hands here put him in my cap said caleb that will make a good bed for him and perhaps he will come to life again  raymond examined him pretty carefully and he did not seem to be burnt he said he thought he must have been suffocated by breathing the smoke and hot air raymond then went back to his work and caleb sat upon the log watching alternately the squirrel and the burning tree  in a few minutes a great flame flashed out at the top of the tree and finally after about half an hour the whole trunk being all in a blaze from top to bottom began slowly to bend and bend over  raymond shouted calebraymond lookit is going to fall  the tall trunk moved at first slowly but soon more and more rapidly and finally came down to the ground with a crash  the crash startled the little squirrel so that he almost regained his feet and caleb was afraid that he was going to run away but he laid over again upon his side and was soon quiet again as before  not long after this raymond finished his work and prepared to go home he proposed to caleb that they should leave the squirrel there upon the log but caleb was very desirous to carry him home because he said he could tame him and give him to mary anna so raymond asked how they should contrive to carry him caleb wanted to carry him home in his cap but raymond said that he would take cold by riding home bareheaded however said raymond perhaps i can contrive something so he went after another piece of birch bark from the tree about six inches wide and two feet long and rolled it over bringing the two ends together so as to make a sort of round boxonly it was without top or bottom to keep it in shape he tied a string round it  but how are you going to keep him in asked caleb  raymond said nothing but he took a handkerchief out of his jacket pocket and spread it out upon the ground and put his birch bark box upon it he then laid the squirrel gently in upon the handkerchief which thus served for a bottom next he drew the corners of the handkerchief up over the top and tied the opposite pairs of ends together thus the handkerchief served for top bottom and handle  they soon reached the place where they had left the cart they got into it and rode on caleb held the squirrel in his lap and of course as there was nothing but the thin handkerchief for a bottom to the box caleb felt the weight of the squirrel pressing soft and warm upon his knees the squirrel lay very still until they got very near home and then caleb began to feel a creeping sensation as if he was beginning to move caleb was highly delighted to perceive these signs of returning life he held his knees perfectly still that he might not disturb him crying out however to raymond  hes moving raymond hes moving hes moving     chapter xi  mary anna   caleb and raymond reached home about the middle of the afternoon and while raymond went into the yard to leave the cart and turn out the cattle caleb pressed eagerly into the house to shew his prize mary anna or marianne as they generally called her came to meet him to see what he had got in his hand  is that my birch bark said she  there i forgot your birch bark said calebbut i have got something here a great deal better and so saying he put his handkerchief down and began very eagerly to untie the knots  when he had got two of the ends untied and was at work upon the other two out leaped the squirrel and ran across the room mary anna startled by the sudden appearance of the animal ran off to the door and caleb called out in great distress o dear o dear what shall i do hell get away shut the door mary annashut the door quick call raymond call raymond  mary anna at first retreated outside of the door and stood there a moment peeping in finding however that the squirrel remained very quiet in a corner of the room she returned softly and went round and shut all the doors and windows and then caleb went and called raymond  the squirrel had by no means yet got over his accident and he allowed himself to be easily retaken and secured raymond contrived to fasten him into a box so as to keep him safe until next morning and by that time they thought if he should then seem likely to get well they could determine what it was best to do with him  while caleb was coming home there had been a strange mixture of delight and uneasiness in his feelings the delight was occasioned by the possession of the squirrel that was obvious enough the uneasiness he did not think about very distinctly and did not notice what the cause of it was boys very often feel a sort of uneasiness of mindthey do not know exactly how or whyand they have this feeling mingling sometimes strangely with their very enjoyment in their hours of gaiety and glee now the real reason of this unquiet state of mind in calebs case was that his conscience had been disturbed by his feelings of vexation and impatience towards raymond for not leaving his work to come and kindle his fire he had not yielded to these feelings he had restrained them and had stood still and spoken respectfully to raymond all the time in fact he was hardly aware that he had done any thing wrong at all but still for a moment selfish passions had had possession of his heart and whenever they get possession even if they are kept in subjection so as not to lead to any bad actions or words and even if they are soon driven away by new thoughts as calebs were by the sight of his blazing firestill they always leave more or less of misery behind  so caleb as he was going home had his heart filled with delight at the thoughts of the squirrel resting warmly in his lap and he was also a prey in some degree to a gnawing uneasiness which he could not understand but which was really caused by a sting which sin had left there  and yet caleb came home with an idea that he had been a very good boy so after they had got tired of looking at the squirrel and mary anna had taken her seat at her work by the window with her little worktable before her caleb came up to her and kneeling upon her cricket and putting his arms in her lap he said  well aunt marianne i have been a good boy all day today and so i want you to make me a picturebook this evening  marianne had a way of making picturebooks that pleased children very much the way was this she used to save all the old wornout picture books and loose pictures she could find and put them carefully in one of her drawers up stairs then she would make a small blank book of white paper and sew it through the back then she would cut out pictures enough from her old stores to fill the book leaving the colours blank because they were to be covered with some prettycoloured paper for a title then she would paste the pictures in and here when mary anna first began to make such books an unexpected difficulty arose for when paper is wet it swells and then when it dries again though it shrinks a little and does not shrink back quite into its original dimensionsthat is quite to the length and breadth that it had at first now when mary anna pasted her pictures in the pages of the book that part of the leaf which was under the picture was wet by the paste and so it swelled while the other part remained dry and when the picture came to dry it did not shrink quite back again it remained swelled a little and this caused the page to look warped or puckered so that the leaves did not lie smooth together  at length she found out a way to remedy this difficulty entirely and this was to wet the whole of the leaf as well as that part that the picture was pasted to and that made it all swell alike the way she managed the operation was this  after sewing the book she would cut out a piece of morocco paper or blue paper or gilt paper and sometimes a piece of morocco itself just the size of the book when open for the cover then after spreading out a large newspaper upon the table so as to keep the table clean she would lay down the cover with the handsome side down and then spread the paste over the other side very carefully with a brush which she made from the end of a quill then she would put the back edge of the book down upon this cover and lay it over first on one side and then on the other and pat it down well with a towel and that would make the cover stick to the outside leaves of the book and cover up and hide the great stitches in the back by which the leaves had been sewed together then she would take the book before her and begin at the beginning first she would lay down the cover and put upon it a piece of tin made to fill papers with to keep it down smooth then she would lay the next leaf down upon the tin the leaf was to have the titlepage upon it and so there were to be no pictures pasted to it she would therefore lay this down upon the tin and then with one of her large paint brushes dipped in the water she would wet it all over patting it afterwards with a towel to take up all the superfluous water then she would take up the tin and put the titleleaf down upon the cover and put the tin over it to keep it down smooth the next leaf would be for pictures and after pasting pictures upon it on both sides she would lay it down upon the tin and with her brush she would wet all those parts which had not been pasted then patting it with a dry towel or soft cloth to dry it as much as possible she would put it under the tin in this way she would go on regularly through the book pasting pictures upon all the pages and wetting with her brush all those parts of the paper which had not been wet by the paste and putting the tin over the leaves as fast as she finished them to keep them all smooth then when she had got through she would put the whole away between two boards to dry the weight of the paper board being sufficient to keep the leaves all smooth the next morning when she came to look at her book she generally found it nearly dry and then she would put some heavy weight upon the upper board to press it harder when it was perfectly dry she took out the book and pared off the edges all around with a sharp knife and a rule then she would get her paintbox and colour all the pictures beautifully and make borders about them in bright colours and print a handsome titlepage with her pen and write the name of the boy in it whom she meant to give it to  so caleb when he came and told mary anna what a good boy he had been meant to have her make such a book as this  but sometimes boys are mistaken in thinking they have been good boys i should want to ask raymond  he would say so i know said caleb for i certainly did not trouble him at all all the day  suppose you run and ask him  well said caleb and away he ran  but stop said mary anna you must not ask him by a leading question  what is that said caleb  dont you know said mary anna  no said caleb  o that is very important for boys to know for they very often ask leading questions when they ought not to now if you go and say raymond havent i been a good boy today that way of asking the question shews that you want him to say yes you have it is called a leading question because it leads raymond to answer in a particular way now if i should go and ask him thus has caleb been a good boy today with the emphasis on has it would be a leading question the other way it would sound as if i wanted him to say you had not been a good boy  how must i ask him then said caleb  why you can say raymond aunt marianne wants to know what sort of a boy i have been today that way of putting the question would not lead him one way or the other  why he might know said caleb that i should want him to say i have been good  yes but not from the form of the question the question would not lead him  while mary anna was saying this caleb was standing with his hand upon the latch of the door ready to go and when she had finished what she was saying he started off to find raymond  as he passed across the yard he heard the sound of voices before the house it was dwight and david coming home from school in a minute they appeared in view by the great elm dwight had a long slender pole in his hands which he was waving in the air and david had a small piece of wood and a knife he sat down under the elm and began to shave the wood with the knife  caleb ran to tell them about his squirrel but before he got there dwight seeing him began to wave his pole in the air and shout and then said see what a noble flagstaff we have got  is that your flagstaff said caleb  yes john davis gave it to us he got it out of his fathers shop we are going to set it up out at the end of our mole  yes said david and i am going to make a truck on the top to haul up the flag by marianne is going to make us a flag  a truck said caleb enquiringly  yes said david a little wheel to put a string over to hoist it by  caleb looked upon the pole and upon davids work for a minute in silence and then said  i have got something better than a flagstaff  what asked dwight  a squirrel  a squirrel said david in surprise  yes said caleb a grey squirrel  where is he said david looking up eagerly from his work  in the backroom said caleb raymond put him in a boxcome and i will shew him to you  down went dwights pole in a moment david too shut his knife and put it in his pocket and off they went to see the squirrel  the little nutcracker was frightened at seeing so many eyes peeping in upon him from every crevice and opening in his box he looked much brighter and better than he did when he was put into the box and caleb thought he would get entirely well  o i wish i had him said dwight  i am going to keep him in a cage said caleb  i wish he was mine said dwight why cant you give him to me caleb  o no said caleb i want to keep him  you dont know how to take care of him said dwight come you give him to me and i will give you my flagstaff  no said caleb i dont want any flagstaff i want to keep the squirrel  see see said david he is creeping along  o said dwight i wish he was mine  there he is curling up in the corner  would you give him to me for my top said dwight very eagerly  hes going to eat that kernel of corn said david  i should think you might give him to me said dwight pettishly for that top the top is worth a great deal the most  after a few minutes dwight finding that there was no prospect of inducing caleb to sell him the squirrel desisted from his attempts and then after a moments pause he said  i dont think it is your squirrel after all caleb  whose is it then  raymonds he saved it the poor thing would have been burnt up if he had not run and caught it up  no he wouldnt said caleb i was just going to get him myself  dwight having decided in his own mind that the squirrel was raymonds ran off to find raymond with the design of asking him to give the squirrel to him but raymond said the squirrel was calebs  but you caught him said dwight  yes but i caught him for caleb not for myself  and you fixed the box to bring him home in said dwight  i know it but i only did it to please caleb the squirrel is his altogether  so dwight had to return disappointed  when caleb came in mary anna was putting up her work and arranging her things neatly in her drawer  well caleb said she and what did raymond say  o he said it was mine replied caleb  what was yours said mary anna  the squirrel  the squirrel repeated mary anna you went to ask him what sort of a boy you had been  o said calebtherei forgot all about that ill run and ask him now  nostop said mary anna it is time for supper now and besides i will take your word for it you are a pretty honest boy you say you was a pleasant boy all day  yes said caleb i was he had forgotten his feelings of illhumour when raymond would not come and light his fire  and you think i ought to make you a picture book for a reward  yes said caleb i wish you would  but i cannot tell how pleasant in mind you have been all day unless i know what you have had to try you  to try me asked caleb  yes i want to know what troubles or difficulties or disappointments you had to bear and did bear patiently and pleasantly  caleb looked a little perplexed  you know caleb she continued there is no merit in being pleasant unless things go wrong  isnt there said caleb  why no said mary anna as she shut up her worktable drawer is there  why no said caleb smiling for he could not help smiling while yet he was a little disappointed at finding all his fancied goodness melted away  now did you have a good time in the woods today  yes said caleb  did raymond take good care of you  yes said he  and did you have a good dinner  yes and a noble great fire said caleb  you little rogue then said mary anna laughing and stabbing at his sides with her finger here you have been having a beautiful time in the woods amusing yourself all day and had every thing to please you and now you come to me to pay you for not having been impatient and fretful you little rogue  caleb turned and ran laughing away mary anna after him and pointing at him with her finger caleb made his escape into the front entry and hid behind the door mary anna pretended to have lost sight of him and not to know where he was and she went about saying  where is that little rogue he came to get away one of my picturebooks for nothing he wanted to be paid for bearing happiness patiently the rogue ill pinch him if i can only find him  so saying mary anna went and sat down to supper and soon after caleb came and took his seat too mary anna roguishly shaking her finger at him all the time he had to hold his hand over his mouth to keep from laughing aloud  perhaps some of the readers of this book may smile at calebs idea of his merit in having been a pleasant boy all day when he felt vexed and unsubmissive in the only case which brought him any trial but it is so with almost all children and some grown persons too a great deal of the goodness upon which we all pride ourselves is only the quiescence of bad propensities in the absence of temptation and trial     chapter xii  the walk   outside of the window in madam rachels bedroom where the children used to sit and talk with her just before going to bed there was a little platform with a plain roof over it supported by small square posts altogether forming a sort of portico below this window there were two doors opening from the middle out each way so that when the window was raised and the doors were opened a person could walk in and out there were seats in the portico and there was a wild grapevine growing upon a plain trellis on each side in front of the portico was one of the broad walks of the garden for on this side the garden extended up to the house at least there was no fence between though there was a small plot of green grass next to the house and next to that came the trees and flowers  one pleasant evening dwight and caleb were playing on this grass waiting for madam rachel to come and call them in to the sofa it was about eight oclock but it was not dark the western sky still looked bright for though the sun had gone down so that it could no longer shine upon the trees and houses it still shone upon the clouds and atmosphere above and made them look bright  presently madam rachel came and stood at the window  wheres david said she  out in the garden said dwight and mother he continued i wish you would walk in the garden tonight  at first madam rachel said she thought she could not very well that evening for she had a difficult text to talk about but the boys promised to walk along quietly and to be very sober and attentive and so she went and put on her garden bonnet and came out  the garden was not large it extended back to some high rocky precipices where the boys used sometimes to climb up for play  i am afraid said madam rachel as she sauntered along the walk the children around her that you will not like the verse that i am going to talk with you about this evening very well when you first hear it  what is it mother said dwight  and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins  what does quickened mean asked david  made alive or brought to life quick means alive sometimes as for instance the quick and the dead means the living and the dead and so we say cut to the quick that is cut to the living flesh where it can feel  once i read in a fable said david of a horse being stung to the quick  what by a hornet said dwight  no said david by something the ass said  o yes said madam rachel that means it hurt his feelings if a bee should sting any body so that the sting should only go into the skin it would not hurt much but if it should go in deep so as to give great pain we should say it stung to the quick that is to the part which has life and feeling so i suppose that something that the ass said hurt the horses feelings  what was it david that the ass said asked dwight  whyhe said i believe that the horse was proud or something like that  no matter about that fable now said their mother you understand the meaning of the verse it was written to good men it says that god gave them life and feeling when they were dead in trespasses and sins but i must first tell you what dead means  o we know what dead means well enough said dwight  perhaps not exactly what it means here said madam rachel  dead means here insensible  but i dont know what insensible means said caleb  i will explain it to you said she once there were two boys who quarreled in the recess at school and the teacher decided that for their punishment they should be publicly reproved before all the scholars so after school they were required to stand up in their places and listen to the reprimand while they were standing and the teacher was telling them that they had done very wronghad indulged bad passions and displeased god and destroyed their own happiness and brought disgrace upon the schoolone of them stood up with a bold and careless air while the teacher was speaking and afterwards when he took his seat looked round to the other scholars and laughed the other boy hung his head and looked very much ashamed and as the teacher had finished what he was saying he sunk into his seat put his head down upon his desk before him and burst into tears now the first one was insensible or as it is called in this text dead to all sense of shame the other was alive to it you understand now  yes mother said the boys  the party walked on for a short time in silence admiring the splendid and beautiful scenery which was presented to view in the setting sun and the calm tranquility which reigned around  suddenly caleb seeing a beautiful lily growing in a border as they were walking by stopped to gather it madam rachel was afraid that he was not attending to what she was saying  now caleb said she thats a very pretty lily but suppose you should go and hold it before seizem do you suppose he would care any thing about it  seizem was a great dog that belonged to madam rachel  no grandmother said caleb i dont think he would  and suppose you were to go and pat him on his head and tell him he was a good dog would he care any thing about that  yes said dwight he would jump and wag his tail and almost laugh  then you see boys that seizem is quick and alive to praise but to beauty of colour and form he is insensible and as it were dead the beauty makes no impression upon him at all he is stupid and lifeless so far as that is concerned  now what is meant by men being dead in trespasses and sins is that they are thus insensible to gods goodness and their duty to love and obey him suppose now i was to go out into the street and find some boys talking harshly and roughly to one another as boys often do in their plays and suppose they were boys that i knew so that it was proper for me to give them advice now if i were to go and tell them that it was the law of god that they should be kind to one another and that they ought to be so and thus obey and please him what effect do you think it would have  they would not mind it very much said david  i expect that they would though said dwight  i dont think that they would mind it much myself each one wants to have his own way and to seek his own pleasures and they do not see the excellence of obeying and pleasing god at all it seems to me a very excellent thing for boys to try to please god but i know very well that most boys care no more about it than seizem would for your lily caleb in respect to god they are insensible and dead dead in trespasses and sins and the only hope for them is that god will quicken them that is give them life and feeling and then if i say just the same things to them they will listen seriously and attentively and will really desire to please god as it is now with almost all boys they are so insensible and dead to all sense of regard to god that when we want to influence them to do their duty we must appeal to some other motive something that they have more sensibility to  for example you remember the other day when you went a strawberrying with mary anna  yes said dwight  now i recollect that i thought there was great danger that you might be troublesome to mary anna or to some others of the party and i wanted to say something to you before you went to make you a good boy the highest and best motive would have been for me to say now dwight remember and do what is right today the trees and fields and pleasant sunshine the flowers and the strawberries your own health and strength and joyous feelings all come from god the whole scene that you are going to enjoy today he has contrived for you and now he will watch over you all the time and be pleased if he sees you careful and conscientious in doing right all day now be a good boy for the sake of pleasing him suppose i had said that to you do you think it would have made you a good boy  dwight held down his head and said hesitatingly that he did not think it would  that motive would have been piety if a boy takes pains to do what is right and avoid what is wrong because he is grateful to god and wishes to please him it is piety but i was afraid that would not have much influence with you and so i tried to think of some other motive i thought of filial affection next  what is that said caleb  filial affection is a boys love for his father or mother replied madam rachel i said to myself how will it do to appeal to dwights filial affection today i can say to him now dwight be a good boy today to please me i shall be very happy tonight if mary anna comes home and says that you have been kind and gentle and yielding all day but then on reflection i thought that that motive would not be powerful enough i knew you had at least some desire to please me but i had some doubt whether it would be enough to carry you through all the temptations of the whole day do you recollect what i did say to you dwight  yes mother replied dwight you told me just before i went away that if i was a good pleasant boy mary anna would want to take me again some day  yes and what principle in your heart was that appealing to  dwight did not answer david said selfishness  yes said his mother or rather not selfishness but selflove selfishness means not only a desire for our own happiness but injustice towards others it would have been wrong for me to have appealed to dwights selfishness as that would have been encouraging a bad passion but it was right for me to appeal to his selflove that is to shew him how his own future enjoyment would depend upon his being a good boy that day  now dwight do you think that what i said had any influence over you that day  yes mother said dwight i think it did i thought of it a good many times  would it have had as much influence if i had asked you to be a good boy only to please me  dwight acknowledged that he did not think it would  do you think it would have had as much influence if i had asked you to do right to please god  no mother said dwight  do you think that would have had any influence at all  dwight seemed at a loss and said he didnt know  do you think it would said caleb  why yes said madam rachel though she spoke in rather a doubtful tone i rather think it would have had some influencenot much but some he would not have thought of it very often but still i rather think at least i hope that dwight has some desire to please god and that it now and then influences him a little but in boys generally i dont think that such a motive would have any influence at all  not any at all said david  why you can judge for yourself do you suppose that the boys at school and those that you meet in the street are influenced in their conduct every day by any desire to please god  why nobody tells them said dwight  o yes they have been told over and over again at church and in the sabbath school till they are tired of hearing it  the boys were silent and the whole party walked along very slowly for several steps and then david said that he thought that though the boys were pretty bad he did not think they were quite so bad as they would be if they did not hear any thing about god he said it seemed to him that it had some influence upon them  o yes said madam rachel i have no doubt that what is said to them about their duty to god has a very important influence over them in various ways religious instruction produces a great many good effects upon the conduct of boys and men even where it does not awaken any genuine love for god and honest desire to please him that is a peculiar feeling i will tell you  so saying madam rachel paused and seemed a moment to be lost in thought the whole party had by this time gone almost the whole round of the walk and were now slowly sauntering towards the house and as madam rachel said those last words they were just passing along by the side of the rocky declivity at the back of the garden madam rachel looked upon the rocks and saw a beautiful little bluebell growing there in a crevice and hanging over at the top  what a beautiful bluebell there is said she  where said the boys looking around  there said she just by the side of the little firtree how mary anna would admire it  ill climb up and get it for her said dwight ill have it in a minute  he dropped his mothers hand and began scrambling up the rocks they were jagged and irregular fragments with bushes and trees among them and dwight who was a very expert climber soon had the bluebell in his hand and was coming down delighted with his prize he brought the leaves of the plant with it and it was in fact an elegant little flower  now dwight said madam rachel as they walked along again dwight holding his flower very carefully in his hand notice this feeling you have towards mary anna which led you to get the flower it was not fear of herit was not hope of getting any reward from her i suppose  no indeed mother said dwight  it was simply a desire to give her pleasure when you go in you will take a pleasure yourself in going to her and gratifying her with the present now do you suppose that the boys generally have any such feeling as that towards god  no mother said david i dont think they have  nor do i they are dead to all such feelings they take no pleasure in pleasing god they dont like to think of him and i dont see that they shew any signs of having any love for him at all  they walked along after this silently dwight saw how destitute of love to god his heart had been and still was and yet he could not help thinking that he did sometimes feel a little grateful to god for all his kindness and care and at least some faint desires to please him  it was nearly dark when they arrived at the house and dwight asked his mother to let him run and give mary anna her bluebell she was very much pleased with it indeed she arranged it and the leaves that dwight had brought with it so as to give the whole group a graceful form and put it in water saying she meant to rise early the next morning to paint it dwight determined that he would get up too and see her do it     chapter xiii  the junk   a few days after this when david and dwight were at work one evening upon their mole and caleb was playing near sometimes helping a little and sometimes looking on mary anna came down to see them they had nearly finished the stonework and were trying to contrive some way to fasten up their flagstaff at the end  we cant drive the flagstaff down into our mole said dwight looking up with an anxious and perplexed expression to mary anna for it is all stony  couldnt you drive it down into the bottom of the brook and then build your mole up all around it said mary anna  no said dwight the bottom of the brook is stony too  it looks sandy said mary anna looking down through the water to the bottom of the brook  no it is very hard and stony under the sand and we cannot drive any thing down at all  well said mary anna go on with your work and i will sit down upon the bank and consider what you can do  after some time mary anna proposed that the boys should go up to the woodpile and get a short log of wood which had one end sawed off square and roll it down to the mole then that they should dig out a little hole in the bottom of the brook with a hoe so deep that when they put in the log the upper end would be a little above the surface of the mole then she said they might put in the log with the sawed end uppermost and while one boy held it steady the other might throw in stones and sand all around it till it was secure in its place then they could build the mole a little beyond it and thus there would be a solid wooden block firmly fixed in the end of the mole  but how shall we fasten our flagstaff to it said david  why you must get an augur and bore a hole down in the middle of it and make the end of your flagstaff round so that it will just fit in  the boys thought this an excellent plan and went off after the log while they were gone mary anna asked caleb if he had fed his squirrel that evening and caleb said he had not  hadnt you better go now and feed him before it is too dark  why no said caleb i dont want to go now besides i am going to let dwight feed him tonight i promised dwight that i would let him feed him sometimes  the truth was that caleb wanted to stay and see the boys fix their log he had had his squirrel now several days and had lost his interest in him as boys generally do in any new plaything after they have had it a few days he was really under this show of generosity and faithful performance of his promise only gratifying his own selfish desires but he did not see it himself the heart is not only selfish and sinful but it is deceitful it even deceives itself  so presently when caleb saw david and dwight rolling the log down from the house he ran off to meet them and said  dwight you may feed my squirrel tonight and i will help david roll down the log  dwight looked up with an air of indifference and said he did not want to feed the squirrel that night  caleb was quite surprised at the answer and he walked along by the side of dwight and david towards the mole as they rolled the log along scarcely knowing what to do he did not want to leave the poor squirrel without his supper and on the other hand he did not want to go away from the mole mary anna saw his perplexity and she understood the reason of it  now it happened that mary anna had been forming a very curious plan about the squirrel from the very day when he was brought home though she had not said any thing to the boys about it to carry her plan into execution it was necessary that the squirrel should be hers and she resolved from the beginning that as soon as a convenient opportunity should offer she would try to buy him she determined therefore to wait quietly until she saw some signs of calebs being tired of his squirrel and then she determined to buy him  she did not suppose that caleb would have got tired of the care of his squirrel quite so soon as this but when she found that he had she thought that the time had arrived for her to attempt to make the purchase so when caleb came back to the mole she said  caleb i have a great mind to go and feed your squirrel for you if you want to stay here and help the boys to make the mole in fact i should like to buy him of you if you would like to sell him  well said caleb what will you give me for him  let me seewhat can i make you and mary anna tried to think what she could make caleb that he would like as well as the squirrel she proposed first a new picturebook and then a flag and next her monthly rose and finally she said she would make him something or other and let him see it and then he could tell whether he would give his squirrel for it or not  i shall i know said caleb for i can see him just as well if he is yours as i can if he is mine  but perhaps i shall let him go said mary anna  o no said caleb you must not let him go  if i buy him of you replied mary anna he will be mine entirely and i must do whatever i please with him  o but i shall make you promise not to let him go said caleb or else i shall not want to sell him to you  very well said mary anna though you can tell better when you see what i am going to make you  mary anna then went up to the house and fed the squirrel and as it began to grow dark pretty soon after that the boys themselves soon came up she asked david if he would make her a mast and also a small block of wood for a step  a step said david a step for what  a step for the mast said mary anna  what is a step for a mast  it is a block with a hole in it for the lower end of the mast to fit into said mary anna  do they call it a step said david  yes said mary anna i read about it in a book where i learned about rigging any little block will do  davids curiosity was very much excited and he begged mary anna to tell him what she was going to make  well said mary anna if you will keep the secret  yes said david i will  a chinese junk said mary anna  a chinese junk said david with surprise and delight  yes now run along to mother  so david went and mary anna began to think of her work she happened to have recollected that there was in the garret an old breadtray of japanned ware which had been worn out and thrown aside and was now good for nothing and yet it was whole and mary anna thought it would make a good boat as however it was not shaped like a boat she thought she would call it a chinese junk which is a clumsy kind of vessel built by the chinese accordingly after the boys had gone to bed she got all her materials together the old breadtray for the hull of the junk some fine twine for the rigging davids mast and step and a piece of birch bark which she thought would represent very well the mats of which the chinese make their sails she carried all those things to her room so as to have them all ready for her to go to work upon the vessel very early the next morning  and early the next morning she did get to work on the whole the craft when finished if it was not built exactly after the model of a real chinese junk would sail about as well and was as gay she got it all done before breakfast and carried it down and hid it under some bushes near the mole  then after breakfast she took the boys all down and told caleb that she was ready to make him an offer for his squirrel she then went to the bushes and taking out the junk she went to the mole and carrying it out to the end she gently set it down into the water the boys looked on in great delight as the junk wheeled slowly around in the great circles of the whirlpool  caleb hesitated a good deal before he finally decided to give mary anna his squirrel and he tried to stipulate with her that is make her agree that she would not let him go but mary anna would not make any such agreement she said that if she had the little fellow at all she must have him for her own without any condition whatever and caleb at length finding the elegance of the chinese junk irresistible decided to make the trade  and now for mariannas plan she liked to see the squirrel very much she admired his graceful movements his beautiful grey colour and his bushy tail curled over his back like a plume but then she did not like to have him a prisoner she knew that he must love a life of freedomrambling among the trees climbing up to the topmost branches and leaping from limb to limb and it was painful to her to think of his being shut up in a cage and yet she did not like to let him go for then she knew that in all probability he would run off to the woods and she would see him no more  it happened that one limb of the great elm before the house was hollow for a considerable distance up from the trunk of the tree and there was a hole leading into this hollow limb at the crotch where the limb grew out from the tree she thought that this would make a fine house for the squirrel if he could only be induced to think so himself and live there it occurred to her that she might put him in and fasten up the hole with wires for a time like a cage and she thought that if she kept him shut up there and fed him there with plenty of nuts and corn for a week or two he would gradually forget his old home in the woods and get wonted to his new one  after thinking of several ways of fastening up the mouth of the hole she concluded finally on the following plan she got some small nails and drove them in pretty near together on each side of the hole and then she took a long piece of fine wire and passed it across from one to the other in such a manner as to cover the mouth of the hole with a sort of network of wire she then got raymond to put the squirrel in through a place which she left open for that purpose and then she closed this place up like the rest with wires the squirrel ran up into the limb and disappeared  when the boys came and saw the ingenious cage which mary anna had contrived they thought it was an excellent plan and they asked her if she was not afraid that when she opened the cage door he would run off into the woods again she said she was very much afraid that he would but that still there was a possibility that he might stay and if he should she should often see him from her window running about the tree and she should take so much more pleasure in that than in seeing him shut up in a cage that she thought she should prefer to take the risk she made the boys promise not to go to the hole for fear they might frighten him and she said she meant to feed him herself every day with nuts and corn and try to get him tame before she took away the wires  the children felt a good deal of curiosity to see whether the squirrel would stay in the tree or run away when mary anna should open his cage door and after a few days they were eager to have her try the experiment but she said no she wished to let him have full time to become well accustomed to his new home  mary anna generally went early in the morning to feed the squirrelbefore the boys were up then she fed him again after they had gone to school and also just before they came home at night she knew that if she fed him when they were at home they would want to go with her and it would frighten the squirrel to see so many strange faceseven if the boys should try to be as still as possible  one morning mary anna and the boys were down near the mole and were talking about the squirrel david and dwight were sailing their boats and mary anna was sitting with caleb upon a bench which david had made for his mother close to the shore calebs junk was upon the ground by his side caleb asked mary anna when she was going to let her squirrel out  o i dont know said she perhaps in a week more  a week said dwight pushing his boat off from the shore i wouldnt wait so long as that  why when i first had him you wanted to have me keep him in a cage all the time  i know it said dwight but now i want to see whether he will run away  i would not try yet said davidbut youd better have a name for him marianne  i have got a name for him said she  what is it said dwight eagerly  mungo  mungo repeated dwight i dont think that is a very good name what made you think of that name  o i heard of a traveller once named mungo the whole of his name was mungo park but i thought mungo was enough for my squirrel  he has not been much of a traveller said dwight  o yes replied mary anna i think it probable he has travelled about the woods a great deal  did mungo park travel in the woods  yes in africa i think mungo knows his name too said mary anna  do you said dwight why  why whenever i go to feed him said mary anna i call mungo mungo and drop my nuts and corn down through the wires into the hole and now he begins to come down when he hears my voice and the little rogue catches up a nut and runs off with it  does he said caleb o i wish you would let him out i dont believe he would run away  not just yet said mary anna  but if you dont let him out pretty soon i shall be gone said caleb for i am going to boston you know next week  so you are said mary anna i forgot that  calebs father and mother were coming up from boston that week and they had written something about taking caleb back with them when they returned caleb was much pleased with this idea he liked living in the country better than living in boston but still he was very much pleased at the thought of seeing his father and mother and his little sister at home he also liked riding and was very glad of the opportunity to ride several days in the carryall upon the front seat with his father he expected that his father would let him have the whip and reins pretty often to drive  it is not certain however continued mary anna that you will go to boston this summer mother said that perhaps you would not go until the fall and then perhaps she would go with you and bring you back to stay here through the winter  but i dont want to stay here in the winter said caleb  why not said mary anna  o it is so cold and snowyand we cant play any  thats a great mistake said dwight we have fine times in the winter  why what can you do  o a great many things last winter we dug out a house in a great snowdrift under the rocks and played in it a good deal  but it must be very cold in a snowhouse said caleb  o we had a fire  a fire said caleb  certainly said dwight we put some large stones for the fireplace and let the smoke go out at the top  but then it would melt your house down  it did melt it a little around the sides and so made it grow larger but it did not melt it down we had some good boards for seats and we could stay there in the cold days  yes said mary anna i remember i went in one cold windy day and i found you boys all snugly stowed in your snowhouse warm and comfortable by a good blazing fire  once we made some candy in our snowhouse said david  did you said caleb  yes said david mary anna proposed the plan and got mother to give us the molasses in a little kettle and we put it upon three stones in our snowhouse and we boiled it all one wednesday afternoon and when it was done we poured it out upon the snow it was capital candy  i should like to see a snowhouse said caleb very much  then should not you like to stay here next winter and then we can make one said david  perhaps i could make one in boston said caleb  ho said dwight with a tone of contempt you couldnt make a snowhouse  but there are enough other boys in boston to help me said caleb  there is not any good place said mary anna in a mild and pleasant tone there is only a very small yard and that is full of wood piles  i can make it on the common said caleb the common is large enough i can tell you  here dwight suddenly called out in a tone of great eagerness and delight to look off to a little bush near them to which he pointed with his finger  see see there is a squirrela large grey squirrel  where said caleb where i dont see him  hush said mary anna in a low tone all keep perfectly still ill shew him to you caleb there creeping along the branch  i see him said david let us catch him and put him in with mungo  im afraid it is mungo said mary anna  mungo said dwight with surprise  yes said mary anna it looks like him i am afraid he has got out of some hole and is going away sit still and we will see what he will do  o no said dwight i will go and catch him  no by no means said mary anna holding dwight back let us see what he will do  it was mungo he had gnawed himself a hole and escaped from his prison  he did not however seem disposed to go away very fast he came down from the bush and crept along upon the ground towards the brook and then finding that he could not get across very well he ran about the grass a little while and then went back by degrees to the tree he climbed up to the great branch playing a minute or two about the grating over the hole and then ran along out to the end of the branch the children watching him all the time and walking slowly along up towards the tree  ill go and get him some corn said mary anna and see if he will not come down for it to his hole when i call him you stand here perfectly still till i come back  so she went in and got a nut instead of corn and put it down by the hole calling mungo mungo as usual the squirrel came creeping down the branch and mary anna left the nut upon the grating and went away he crept down cautiously seized the nut stuffed it into his cheek and ran off to one of the topmost branches and there standing upon his hind legs and holding his nut in his forepaws he began gnawing the shell watching the children all the time  the next morning mary anna tore off the netting and the squirrel lived in the tree a long while caleb however saw but little more of him at this time for he went to boston the next week with his father what befell him there may perhaps be described in another book
