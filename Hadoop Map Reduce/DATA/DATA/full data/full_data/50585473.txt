50585473	the great prince shan  by  e phillips oppenheim  1922        chapter i   a club for diplomats and gentlemen prince karschoff remarked looking lazily through a little cloud of tobacco smoke around the spacious but almost deserted card room the classification seems comprehensive enough yet it seems impossible to get even a decent rubber of bridge  sir daniel harker a many years retired plenipotentiary to one of the smaller powers shrugged his shoulders  personally i have come to the conclusion he declared that the raison dêtre for the club seems to be passing there is no diplomacy nowadays and every man who pays his taxes is a gentleman kingley you are the youngest ransack the club and find a fourth  the honourable nigel kingley smiled lazily from the depths of his easychair he was a young englishman of normal type longlimbed cleanshaven with good features a humorous mouth and keen grey eyes  in actual years he admitted i may have the advantage of you two but so far as regards the qualities of youth karschoff is the youngest man here besides no one could refuse him anything  it is a subterfuge the prince objected but if i must go i will go presently we will wait five minutes in case providence should be kind to us  the three men relapsed into silence they were seated in a comfortable recess of the card room of the st philips club the atmosphere of the apartment seemed redolent with suggestions of faded splendour there was a faint perfume of russian calf from the many rows of musty volumes which still filled the stately bookcases the oil paintings which hung upon the walls belonged to a remote period in a distant corner four other men were playing bridge speechless and almost motionless the white faces of two of them like cameos under the electric light and against the dark walls there was no sound except the soft patter of the cards and the subdued movements of a servant preparing another bridge table by the side of the three men then the door of the room was quietly opened and closed a man of youthful middleage carefully dressed with a large cleanshaven face blue eyes and fair hair sprinkled with grey came towards them he was well set up almost anxiously ingratiating in manner  you see now what providence has sent sir daniel harker observed under his breath  it is enough to make an atheist of one this the prince muttered  any bridge the newcomer enquired seating himself at the table and shuffling one of the packs of cards  the three men rose to their feet with varying degrees of unwillingness  immelan is too good for us sir daniel grumbled he always wins  i am lucky the newcomer admitted but i may be your partner in which case you too will win  if you are my partner the prince declared i shall play for five pounds a hundred i desire to gamble london is beginning to weary me  mr kingley is a better player though not so lucky immelan acknowledged with a little bow  never believe it with all due respect to our young friend here sir daniel replied as he cut a card kingley plays like a man with brain but without subtlety in a duel between you two i would back immelan every time  kingley took his place at the table with a little gesture of resignation he looked across the table to where immelan sat displaying the card which he had just cut the eyes of the two men met a few seconds of somewhat significant silence followed then immelan gathered up the cards  i have the utmost respect for mr kingley as an adversary he said  the latter bowed a little ironically  may you always preserve that sentiment today chance seems to have made us partners your deal mr immelan  what stakes the prince enquired settling himself down in his chair  they are for you to name immelan declared  the prince laughed shortly  i believe you are as great a gambler at heart as i am he observed  with mr kingley for my partner and the game one of skill was the courteous reply i do not need to limit my stakes  a servant crossed the room bringing a note upon a tray he presented it to kingley who opened and read it through without change of countenance when he had finished it however he laid his cards face downwards upon the table  gentlemen he said i owe you my most profound apologies i am called away at once on a matter of urgent business  but this is most annoying the prince declared irritably  here comes my saviour kingley remarked as another man entered the card room henderson will take my place glad i havent to break you up after all henderson will you play a rubber  the newcomer assented nigel kingley made his adieux and crossed the room immelan watched him curiously  what is our friend kingleys profession he enquired  he has no profession sir daniel replied he has never come into touch with the sordid needs of these moneygrubbing days he is the nephew and heir of the earl of dorminster  immelan looked away from the retreating figure  lord dorminster he murmured the same lord dorminster who was in the government many years ago  he was foreign secretary when i was governor of jamaica sir daniel answered a very brilliant man he was in those days  immelan nodded thoughtfully  i remember he said  nigel kingley on leaving the st philips club was driven at once in the automobile which he found awaiting him to a large corner house in belgrave square which he entered with the air of an habitué the waiting majordomo took him at once in charge and piloted him across the hall  his lordship is very much occupied mr nigel he announced he is not seeing any other callers he left word however that you were to be shown in the moment you arrived  his lordship is quite well i hope  well in health sir but worried and i dont wonder at it the man replied speaking with the respectful freedom of an old servant i never thought id live to see such times as these  a man in the early sixties still goodlooking notwithstanding a somewhat worn expression looked up from his seat at the library table on kingleys entrance he nodded but waited until the door was closed behind the retreating servant before he spoke  good of you to come nigel he said bring your chair up here  bad news the newcomer enquired  damnable  there was a brief silence during which nigel knowing his uncles humours leaned back in his chair and waited upon the table was a little pile of closely written manuscript and by their side several blackbound code books upon which the foprivate still remained though almost obliterated with time lord dorminsters occupation was apparent he was decoding a message of unusual length presently he turned away from the table however and faced his nephew his hands travelled to his waistcoat pocket he drew out a cigarette from a thin gold case lit it and began to smoke then he crossed his legs and leaned a little farther back in his chair  nigel he said we are living in strange times  no one denies that sir was the grave assent  lord dorminster glanced at the calendar which stood upon the desk  today he continued is the twentythird day of march nineteen hundred and thirtyfour fifteen years ago that terrible peace treaty was signed since then you know what the history of our country has been i am not blowing my own trumpet when i say that nearly every man with true political insight has been cast adrift at the present moment the country is in the hands of a body of highly respectable and wellmeaning men who as a parish council might conduct the affairs of dorminster town with unqualified success as statesmen they do not exist it seems to me nigel that you and i are going to see in reality that spectre which terrified the world twenty years ago we are going to see the breaking up of a mighty empire  tell me what has happened or is going to happen nigel begged  well for one thing his uncle replied the emperor of the east is preparing for a visit to europe he will be here probably next month you know whom i mean of course  prince shan nigel exclaimed  prince shan of china lord dorminster assented his coming links up many things which had been puzzling me i tell you nigel what happens during prince shans visit will probably decide the destinies of this country and yet i wouldnt mind betting you a thousand to one that there isnt a single official of the government who has the slightest idea as to why he is coming or that he is coming at all  do you know nigel asked  i can only surmise let us leave prince shan for the moment nigel now listen you go about a great deal what do people say about mehonestly i mean speak with your face to the light  they call you a faddist and a scaremonger nigel confessed yet there are one or two especially at the st philips club diplomatists and ambassadors whose place in the world has passed away who think and believe differently you know sir that i am amongst them  lord dorminster nodded kindly  well he said i fancy i am about to prove myself seven years ago it was he went on reminiscently when the new national party came into supreme power you know one of their first battle criesdown with all secret treaties down with all secret diplomacy let nothing exist but an honest commercial understanding between the different countries of the world how germany and russia howled with joy in place of an english statesman with his countrys broad interests at heart we have in berlin and petrograd half a dozen representatives of the great industries whose object in their own words is i believe to develop friendly commercialism and a feeling of brotherhood between the nations not only our ambassadors but our secret service were swept clean out of existence i remember going to broadley the day he was appointed foreign minister and i asked him a simple question i asked him whether he did not consider it his duty to keep his finger upon the pulses of the other great nations however friendly they might seem to keep himself assured that all these expressions of good will were honourable and that in the heart of the german nation that great craving for revenge which is the natural heritage of the present generation had really become dissipated broadley smiled at me lord dorminster he said the chief cause of wars in the past has been suspicion we look upon espionage as a disgraceful practice it is the people of germany with whom we are in touch now not a military oligarchy and the people of germany no more desire war than we do besides there is the league of nations those were broadleys views then and they are his views today you know what i did  nigel assented cautiously  i suppose it is an open secret amongst a few of us he observed you have been running an unofficial secret service of your own  precisely i have had a few agents at work for over a year and when i have finished decoding this last dispatch i shall have evidence which will prove beyond a doubt that we are on the threshold of terrible events the worst of it iswell we have been found out  what do you mean nigel asked quickly  his uncles sensitive lips quivered  you knew sidwell  quite well  sidwell was found stabbed to the heart in a café in petrograd three weeks ago lord dorminster announced an official report of the enquiry into his death informs his relatives that his death was due to a quarrel with some russian sailors over one of the women of the quarter where he was found  horrible nigel muttered  sidwell was one of those unnatural people as you know lord dorminster went on who never touched wine or spirits and who hated women to continue atcheson was a friend of yours wasnt he  of course he was at eton with me it was i who first brought him here to dine dont tell me that anything has happened to jim atcheson  this dispatch is from him lord dorminster replied indicating the pile of manuscript upon the tablea dispatch which came into my hands in a most marvellous fashion he died last week in a nursing home inwell let us say a foreign capital the professor in charge of the hospital sends a long report as to the unhappy disease from which he suffered as a matter of fact he was poisoned  nigel kingley had been a soldier in his youth and he was a brave man nevertheless the horror of these things struck a cold chill to his heart he seemed suddenly to be looking into the faces of spectres to hear the birth of the winds of destruction  that is all i have to say to you for the moment his uncle concluded gravely in an hour i shall have finished decoding this dispatch and i propose then to take you into my entire confidence in the meantime i want you to go and talk for a few minutes to the cleverest woman in england the woman who in the face of a whole army of policemen and detectives crossed the north sea yesterday afternoon with this in her pocket  you dont mean maggie nigel exclaimed eagerly  his uncle nodded  you will find her in the boudoir he said i told her that you were coming in an hours time return here  lord dorminster rose to his feet as his nephew turned to depart he laid his hand upon the latters shoulder and nigel always remembered the grave kindliness of his tone and expression  nigel he sighed i am afraid i shall be putting upon your shoulders a terrible burden but there is no one else to whom i can turn  there is no one else to whom you ought to turn sir the young man replied simply i shall be back in an hour     chapter ii   lady maggie trent a stepdaughter of the earl of dorminster was one of those young women who had baffled description for some years before she had commenced to take life seriously she was neither fair nor dark petite nor tall no one could ever have called her nondescript or have extolled any particular grace of form or feature her complexion had defied the ravages of sun and wind and that moderate indulgence in cigarettes and cocktails which the youth of her day affected her nose was inclined to be retroussé her mouth tender but impudent her grey eyes mostly veiled in expression but capable of wonderful changes she was curled up in a chair when nigel entered immersed in a fashion paper she held out her left hand which he raised to his lips  well nigel dear she exclaimed what do you think of my new profession  i hate it he answered frankly  she sighed and laid down the fashion paper resignedly  you always did object to a woman doing anything in the least useful do you realise that if anything in the world can save this stupid old country i have done it  i realise that youve been running hideous risks he replied  she looked at him petulantly  what of it she demanded we all run risks when we do anything worth while  not quite the sort that you have been facing  she smiled thoughtfully  do you know exactly where i have been she asked  no idea he confessed what my uncle has just told me was a complete revelation so far as i was concerned i believed with the rest of the world what the newspapers announcedthat you were visiting japan and china and afterwards the south sea islands with the wendercombes  she smiled  dad wanted to tell you she said but it was i who made him promise not to i was afraid you would be disagreeable about it we arranged it all with the wendercombes but as a matter of fact i did not even start with them for the last eight months i have been living part of the time in berlin and part of the time in a country house near the black forest  alone  not a bit of it i have been governess to the two daughters of herr essendorf  essendorf the president of the german republic  lady maggie nodded  he isnt a bit like his pictures he is a huge fat man and he eats a great deal too much oh the horror of those meals she added with a little shudder think of me dear nigel who never eat more than an omelette and some fruit for luncheon compelled to sit down every day to a mittagessen i wonder i have any digestion left at all  do you mean that you were there under your own name he asked incredulously  she shook her head  i secured some perfectly good testimonials before i left she said they referred to a miss brown the daughter of prebendary brown i was miss brown  great heavens nigel muttered under his breath you heard about atcheson  she nodded  poor fellow they got him all right you talk about thrills nigel she went on do you know that the last night before i left for my vacation i actually heard that fat old essendorf chuckling with his wife about how his clever police had laid an english spy by the heels and telling her also of the papers which they had discovered and handed over all the time the real dispatch written by atcheson when he was dying was sewn into my corsets hows that for an exciting situation  its a mans job anyhow nigel declared  she shrugged her shoulders and abandoned the personal side of the subject  have you been in germany lately nigel she enquired  not for many years he answered  she stretched herself out upon the couch and lit a cigarette  the germany of before the war of course i cant remember she said pensively i imagine however that there was a sort of instinctive jealous dislike towards england and everything english simply because england had had a long start in colonisation commerce and all the rest of it but the feeling in germany now although it is marvellously hidden is something perfectly amazing it absolutely vibrates wherever you go the silence makes it all the more menacing soon after i got to berlin i bought a copy of the treaty of peace and read it nigel was it necessary to have been so bitterly cruel to a beaten enemy  logically it would seem not nigel admitted actually we cannot put ourselves back into the spirit of those days you must remember that it was an unprovoked war a war engineered by germany for the sheer purposes of aggression that is why a punitive spirit entered into our subsequent negotiations  she nodded  i expect history will tell us some day she continued that we needed a great statesman of the beaconsfield type at the peace table however that is all ended they sowed the seed at versailles and i think we are going to reap the harvest  after all nigel observed thoughtfully it is very difficult to see what practical interference there could be with the peace of the world i can very well believe that the spirit is there but when it comes to hard factswell what can they do england can never be invaded the war of 1914 proved that besides germany now has a representative on the league of nations she is bound to toe the line with the rest  it is not in germany alone that we are disliked maggie reminded him we seem somehow or other to have found our way into the bad books of every country in europe clumsy statesmanship is it or what  i should attribute it nigel replied to the passing of our old school of ambassadors after all ambassadors are born not made and they should bethey very often weremen of rare tact and perceptions we have no one now to inform us of the prejudices and humours of the nations we often offend quite unwittingly and we miss many opportunities of a rapprochement it is trade trade trade and nothing else the whole of the time and the men whom we sent to the different courts to further our commercial interests are not the type to keep us informed of the more subtle and intricate matters which sometimes need adjustment between two countries  that may be the explanation of all the bad feeling maggie admitted and you may be right when you say that any practical move against us is almost impossible dad doesnt think so you know he is terribly exercised about the coming of prince shan  i must get him to talk to me nigel said as a matter of fact i dont think that we need fear asiatic intervention over here prince shan is too great a diplomatist to risk his countrys new prosperity  prince shan maggie declared is the one man in the world i am longing to meet he was at oxford with you wasnt he nigel  for one year only he went from there to harvard  tell me what he was like she begged  i have only a hazy recollection of him nigel confessed he was a most brilliant scholar and a fine horseman i cant remember whether he did anything at games  goodlooking  extraordinarily so he was very reserved though and even in those days he was far more exclusive than our own royal princes we all thought him clever but no one dreamed that he would become asias great man ill tell you all that i can remember about him another time maggie im rather curious about that report of atchesons have you any idea what it is about  she shook her head  none at all it is in the old foreign office cipher and it looks like gibberish i only know that the first few lines he transcribed gave dad the jumps  i wonder if he has finished it by now  hell send for you when he has how do you think i am looking nigel  wonderful he answered rising to his feet and standing with his elbow upon the mantelpiece gazing down at her but then you are wonderful arent you maggie you know i always thought so  she picked up a mirror from the little bag by her side and scrutinized her features  it cant be my face she decided turning towards him with a smile i must have charm  your face is adorable he declared  are you going to flirt with me she asked with a faint smile at the corners of her lips you always do it so well and so convincingly and i hate foreigners they are terribly in earnest but there is no finesse about them you may kiss me just once please nigel the way i like  he held her for a moment in his arms tenderly but with a reserve to which she was accustomed from him presently she thrust him away her own colour had risen a little  delightful she murmured think of the wasted months no one has kissed me nigel since we said goodbye  have you made up your mind to marry me yet he asked  my dear she answered patting his hand do restrain your ardour do you really want to marry me  of course i do  you dont love me  i am awfully fond of you he assured her and i dont love any one else  she shook her head  it isnt enough nigel she declared and strange to say its exactly how i feel about you  i dont see why it shouldnt be enough he argued perhaps we have too much common sense for these violent feelings  it may be that she admitted doubtfully on the other hand dont lets run any risk i should hate to find an affinity and all that sort of thing after marriagedivorce in these days is such shocking bad form besides honestly nigel i dont feel frivolous enough to think about marriage just now i have the feeling that even while the clock is ticking we are moving on to terrible things i cant tell you quite what it is i carried my life in my hands during those last few days abroad i dare say this is the reaction  he smiled reassuringly  after all you are safe at home now dear he reminded her and i really am very fond of you maggie  and im quite absurdly fond of you nigel she acknowledged it makes me feel quite uncomfortable when i reflect that i shall probably have to order you to make love to some one else before the week is out  i shall do nothing of the sort he declared firmly i am not good at that sort of thing and who is she anyhow  they were interrupted by a sudden knock at the doornot the discreet tap of a wellbred domestic but a flurried almost an imperative summons before either of them could reply the door was opened and brookes the elderly butler presented himself upon the threshold even before he spoke it was clear that he brought alarming news  will you step down to the library at once sir he begged addressing nigel  what is the matter brookes maggie demanded anxiously  i fear that his lordship is not well the man replied  they all hurried out together brookes was evidently terribly perturbed and went on talking half to himself without heeding their questions  i thought at first that his lordship must have fainted he said i heard a queer noise and when i went in he had fallen forward across the table parkins has rung for doctor wilcox  what sort of a noise nigel asked  it sounded like a shot the man faltered  they entered the library nigel leading the way lord dorminster was lying very much as brookes had described him but there was something altogether unnatural in the collapse of his head and shoulders and his motionless body nigel spoke to him touched him gently raised him at last into a sitting position something on which his right hand seemed to have been resting clattered on to the carpet nigel turned around and waved maggie back  dont come he begged  is it a stroke she faltered  i am afraid that he is dead nigel answered simply  they went out into the hall and waited there in shocked silence until the doctor arrived the latters examination lasted only a few seconds then he pointed to the telephone  this is very terrible he said i am afraid you had better ring up scotland yard mr kingley lord dorminster appears either to have shot himself as seems most probable he added glancing at the revolver upon the carpet or to have been murdered  it is incredible nigel exclaimed he was the sanest possible man and the happiest and he hadnt an enemy in the world  the physician pointed downwards to the revolver then he unfastened once more the dead mans waistcoat opened his shirt and indicated a small blue mark just over his heart  that is how he died he said it must have been instantaneous  time seemed to beat out its course in leaden seconds whilst they waited for the superintendent from scotland yard nigel at first stood still for some moments from outside came the cheerful but muffled roar of the london streets the hooting of motor horns the rumbling of wheels the measured footfall of the passing multitude a boy went by whistling another passed calling hoarsely the news from the afternoon papers a muffin man rang his bell a small boy clattered his stick against the area bailing the whole world marched on unmoved and unnoticing in this sombre apartment alone tragedy reigned in sinister silence on the sofa lord dorminster who only half an hour ago had seemed to be in the prime of life and health lay dead  nigel moved towards the writingtable and stood looking at it in wonder the code book still remained but there was not the slightest sign of any manuscript or paper of any sort he even searched the drawers of the desk without result every trace of atchesons dispatch and lord dorminsters transcription of it had disappeared     chapter iii   on a certain day some weeks after the adjourned inquest and funeral of lord dorminster nigel obtained a longsoughtfor interview with the right honourable mervin brown who had started life as a factory inspector and was now prime minister of england the great man received his visitor with an air of goodnatured tolerance  heard of you from scotland yard havent i lord dorminster he said as he waved him to a seat i gather that you disagreed very strongly with the open verdict which was returned at the inquest upon your uncle  the verdict was absolutely at variance with the facts nigel declared my uncle was murdered and a secret report of certain doings on the continent which he was decoding at the time was stolen  the medical evidence scarcely bears out your statement mr mervin brown pointed out dryly nor have the police been able to discover how any one could have obtained access to the room or left it without leaving some trace of their visit behind further there are no indications of a robbery having been attempted  i happen to know more than any one else about this matter nigel urgedmore even than i thought it advisable to mention at the inquestand i beg you to listen to me mr mervin brown i know that you considered my uncle to be in some respects a crank because he was farseeing enough to understand that under the seeming tranquillity abroad there is a universal and deepseated hatred of this country  i look upon that statement as misleading and untrue the minister declared your late uncle belonged to that mischievous section of foreign politicians who believed in secret treaties and secret service and who fostered a state of nervous unrest between countries otherwise disposed to be friendly we have turned over a new leaf lord dorminster our efforts are all directed towards developing an international spirit of friendliness and trust  utopian but very shortsighted nigel commented if my uncle had lived to finish decoding the report upon which he was engaged i could have offered you proof not only of the existence of the spirit i speak of but of certain practical schemes inimical to this country  the papers you speak of have disappeared mr mervin brown observed with a smile  they were taken away by the person who murdered my uncle nigel insisted  the right honourable gentleman nodded  well you know my views about the affair he said i may add that they are confirmed by the police i am in no way prejudiced however and am willing to listen to anything you may have to say which will not take you more than a quarter of an hour he added glancing at the clock upon his table  here goes then nigel began my uncle was a statesman of the old school who had no faith in the utopian programme of the present government of this country when you abandoned any pretence of a continental secret service he at his own expense instituted a small one of his own he sent two men out to germany and one to russia the one sent to russia was the man sidwell whose murder in a petrograd café you may have read of of the two sent to germany one has disappeared and the other died in hospital without a doubt poisoned a few days after he had sent the report to england which was stolen from my uncles desk that report was brought over by lady maggie trent lord dorminsters stepdaughter who was really the brains of the enterprise and under another name was acting as governess to the children of herr essendorf president of the german republic half an hour before his death my uncle was decoding this dispatch in his library i saw him doing it and i saw the dispatch itself he told me that so far as he had gone already it was full of information of the gravest import that a definite scheme was already being formulated against this country by an absolutely unique and dangerous combination of enemies  those enemies being  nigel shook his head  that i can only surmise he replied my uncle had only commenced to decode the dispatch when i last saw him  then i gather lord dorminster the minister said that you connect your uncles death directly with the supposed theft of this document  absolutely  and the conclusion you arrive at then  is an absolutely logical one nigel declared firmly i assert that other countries are not falling into line with our lamentable abnegation of all secret service defence and that in plain words my uncle was murdered by an agent of one of these countries in order that the dispatch which had come into his hands should not be decoded and passed on to your government  the right honourable gentleman smiled slightly he was a man of some natural politeness but he found it hard to altogether conceal his incredulity  well lord dorminster he promised i will consider all that you have said is there anything more i can do for you  yes nigel replied boldly induce the cabinet to reëstablish our intelligence department and secret service even on a lesser scale and dont rest until you have discovered exactly what it is they are plotting against us somewhere on the continent  to carry out your suggestions lord dorminster the minister pointed out would be to be guilty of an infringement of the spirit of the league of nations the existence of which body is we believe a practical assurance of our safety  nigel rose to his feet  as man to man sir he said i see you dont believe a word of what i have been telling you  as man to man the other admitted pleasantly as he touched the bell i think you have been deceived                                       nigel even as a prophet of woe was a very human person and withal a philosopher he strolled along piccadilly and turned into bond street thoroughly enjoying one of the first spring days of the season flower sellers were busy at every corner the sky was blue with tiny flecks of white clouds there was even some dust stirred by the little puffs of west wind he exchanged greetings with a few acquaintances lingered here and there before the shop windows and presently developed a fit of contemplation engendered by the thoughts which were all the time at the back of his mind bond street was crowded with vehicles of all sorts from wonderfully upholstered automobiles to the resuscitated victoria the shop windows were laden with the treasures of the world buyers were plentiful promenaders multitudinous every one seemed to be cheerful but a little engrossed in the concrete act of living nigel almost ran into prince karschoff at the corner of grafton street  dreaming my friend the latter asked quietly as he laid his hand upon nigels shoulder  guilty nigel confessed you are an observant man prince tell me whether anything strikes you about the bond street of today compared with the bond street of say ten years ago  the russian glanced around him curiously he himself was a somewhat unusual figure in his distinctively cut morning coat his carefully tied cravat his silk hat black and white check trousers and faultless white spats  a certain decline of elegance he murmured and is it my fancy or has this country become a trifle americanised as regards the headgear of its men  nigel smiled  i believe our thoughts are moving in the same groove he said to me there seems to be a different class of people here as though the denizens of west kensington suddenly enriched had come to spend their money in new quarters not only that but there is a difference in the wares set out in the shops an absence of taste if you can understand what i mean as though the shopkeepers themselves understood that they were catering for a new class of people  it is the triumph of your bourgeoisie the russian declared your aristocrat is no longer able to survive noblesse oblige has no significance to the shopman he wants the fat cheques and he caters for the people who can write them let us pursue our reflections a little farther and in a different direction my friend he added glancing at his watch lunch with me at the ritz and we will see whether the cookery too has been adapted to the new tastes  nigel hesitated for a moment a somewhat curious hesitation which he many times afterwards remembered  i am not very keen on restaurants for a week or two he said doubtfully besides i had half promised to be at the club  not today karschoff insisted today let us listen to the call of the world woman is at her loveliest in the spring the ritz restaurant will look like a bouquet of flowers perhaps one for you and one for me at any rate one is sure of an omelette one can eat  the two men turned together towards piccadilly     chapter iv   luncheon at the ritz was an almost unexpectedly pleasant meal the two men sat at a table near the door and exchanged greetings with many acquaintances karschoff who was in an unusually loquacious frame of mind pointed out many of the habitués of the place to his companion  i am become a club and restaurant lounger in my old age he declared a little bitterly almost a boulevardier still what else is there for a man without a country to do  you know everybody nigel replied without reference to his companions lament tell me who the woman is who has just entered  karschoff glanced in the direction indicated and for a moment his somewhat saturnine expression changed a smile played upon his lips his eyes seemed to rest upon the figure of the girl half turned away from them with interest almost with pleasure she was of an unusual type tall and dark dressed in black with the simplicity of a nun with only a little gleam of white at her throat her hairso much of it as showed under her flowergarlanded hatwas as black as jet and yet where she stood in the full glare of the sunlight the burnish of it was almost winecoloured her cheeks were pale her expression thoughtful her eyes rather heavily lidded were a deep shade of violet her mouth was unexpectedly soft and red  ah my friend no wonder you ask karschoff declared with enthusiasm that is a woman whom you must know  tell me her name nigel persisted with growing impatience  her name karschoff replied is naida karetsky she is the daughter of the man who will probably be the next president of the russian republic you see i can speak those words without a tremor her father at present represents the shipping interests of russia and england he is one of the authorised consuls  is he of the party  karschoff scrutinised the approaching figures through his eyeglass and nodded  her father is the dark broadshouldered man with the square beard he indicated immelan as you can see is the third they are coming this way we will speak of them afterwards  naida with her father and oscar immelan left some acquaintances with whom they had been talking and preceded by a maître dhôtel moved in the direction of the two men the girl recognised the prince with a charming little bow and was on the point of passing on when she appeared to notice his companion for a moment she hesitated the prince anticipating her desire to speak rose at once to his feet  mademoiselle he said bending over her hand welcome back to england you bring with you the first sunshine we have seen for many days  are you being meteorological or complimentary she asked smiling will you present your companion i have heard of mr kingley  with the utmost pleasure the prince replied mr kingley through the unfortunate death of a relative is now the earl of dorminstermademoiselle karetsky  nigel as he made his bow was conscious of an expression of something more than ordinary curiosity in the face of the girl who had herself aroused his interest  you are the son then she enquired of lord dorminster who died about a month ago  his nephew nigel explained my uncle was unfortunately childless  i met your uncle once in paris she said it will give me great pleasure to make your better acquaintance will you and my dear friend here she added turning to the prince take coffee with us afterwards i shall then introduce you to my father oscar immelan you both know of course  they murmured their delighted assent and she passed on nigel watched her until she took her place at the table  surely that girl is wellborn he observed i have never seen a more delightful carriage  you are right karschoff told him karetsky is a welltodo man of commerce but her mother was a baroness kolchekoff a distant relative of my own the kolchekoffs lived on their estates and as a matter of fact we never met naida has gone over to the people though body and soul  she is extraordinarily beautiful nigel remarked  his companion was swinging his eyeglass back and forth by its cord  many men have thought so he replied for myself there is antagonism in my blood against her i wonder whether i have done well or ill in making you two acquainted  nigel felt a sudden desire to break through a certain seriousness which had come over his own thoughts and which was reflected in the others tone he shrugged his shoulders slightly and filled his glass with wine  every man in the world is the better he propounded for adding to the circle of his acquaintances a beautiful woman  sententious and a trifle inaccurate the prince objected with a sudden flash of his white teeth the beauty which is not for him has been many a mans undoing but seriously my quarrel with naida is one of prejudice only she is the confidante and the inspiration of matinsky and though one realises of course that so long as there is a russian republic there must be a russian president i suppose i should scarcely be human if i did not hate him  surely nigel queried she must be very much his junior  matinsky is fortyfour karschoff said naida is twentysix or twentyseven the disparity of years you see is not so great matinsky however is married to an invalid wife and concerning naida i have never heard one word of scandal but this much is certain matinsky has the blandest confidence in her judgment and discretion she has already been his unofficial ambassador in several capitals of europe i am convinced that she is here with a purpose but enough of my countrypeople we came here to be gay let us drink another bottle of wine  the joy of living seemed for a moment to reassert itself in karschoffs face his momentary fierceness reminiscent of his tartar ancestry had passed but it had left a shadow behind  at least one should be grateful he conceded a moment later for the distinction such a woman as naida karetsky brings into a room like this our bond street lament finds its proof here except for their clothesso illworn too most of themthe women here remind one of blackpool and their men of huddersfield i am inclined to wish that i had taken you to soho  nigel shook his head his eyes had strayed to a distant corner of the room where naida and her two companions were seated  we cannot escape anywhere he declared from this overmastering wave of mediocrity a couple of generations and a little intermarriage may put things right a chancellor of the exchequer with genius fifteen years ago might even have prevented it  you can claim at any rate a bloodless and unapparent revolution the prince observed you chivied your aristocracy of birth out of existence with yellow papers your aristocracy of mind with a devastating income tax this is the class whom you left to gorgethe war profiteers i hope that whoever writes the history of these times will see that it is properly illustrated  in the lounge they had barely seated themselves before naida with her father and immelan appeared the little party at once joined up and naida seated herself next to nigel she talked very slowly but her accent amounted to little more than a prolongation of certain syllables which had the effect of a rather musical drawl her father after the few words of introduction had been spoken strolled away to speak to some acquaintances and immelan and the prince discussed with measured politeness one of the commonplace subjects of the moment naida and her companion became almost isolated  i met your uncle once naida said at a dinner party in paris i remember that he attracted me he represented a class of englishman of whom i had met very few the thinking aristocrat with a sense for foreign affairs it was some years ago that he remained outside politics did he not until his death  outside all practical politics nigel assented he had his interests though  she looked at him thoughtfully  have you inherited them she asked  he declined the challenge of her eyes after all she belonged to the russia whose growing strength was the greatest menace to european peace and whose attitude towards england was entirely uncertain  my uncle and i were scarcely intimate he said i was never really in his confidence  not so much so as lady maggie trent she would be your cousin  it is not a relationship of blood nigel replied lady maggie was the daughter of my uncles second wife  she is very charming naida murmured  i find her delightful nigel agreed  she is not only charming but she has intelligence naida continued i think that lord dorminster was very fond of her that he trusted her with many of his secrets  had he secrets nigel asked  she remained for a moment very thoughtful smoking a thin cigarette through a long holder and watching the little rings of smoke  you are right she said at last i find your attitude the only correct one did you know that maggie was a friend of mine lord dorminster  i can very well believe it he answered but i have never heard her speak of you  ah but she has been away for some months you have not seen much of her perhaps since her return  very little he acquiesced she only arrived in london just before my uncles death and since then i have had to spend some time at dorminster  as a matter of curiosity naida enquired when do you expect to see her again  this afternoon i hope he replieddirectly i leave here in fact  then you will give her a little message for me please  with great pleasure  tell her from memind she understands this if you pleasethat she is not to leave england again until we have met  is this a warning he asked  she looked at him searchingly  i wonder she reflected how much of you is lord dorminsters nephew  and i in my turn he rejoined with sudden boldness wonder how much of you is matinskys envoy  she began to laugh softly  we shall perhaps be friends lord dorminster she said i should like to see more of you  you will permit me to call upon you he begged eagerly  will you come we are at the milan court for a little time my father is trying to get a house my sister is coming over to look after him i am unfortunately only a bird of passage  then i shall not run the risk of missing you he declared i shall call very soon  immelan intervenedgrim suspicious a little disturbed for some reason or other the meeting between these two young people seemed to have made him uneasy  your father has desired me to present his excuses to lord dorminster he announced and to escort you back to the milan he has been telephoned for from the consulate  naida rose to her feet with some apparent reluctance  you will not delay your call too long lord dorminster she enjoined as she gave him her hand i shall expect you the first afternoon you are free  i shall not delay giving myself the pleasure he assured her  she nodded and made her adieux to the prince the two men stood together and watched her depart with her companion  really one gains much through being an onlooker the prince reflected there go the spirit of russia and the spirit of germany you dabble in these things my friend dorminster can you guess what they are met forfor whom they wait  i might guess nigel replied but i would rather be told  they wait for the master spirit karschoff declared taking his arm they wait for the great prince shan     chapter v   nigel and maggie had tea together in the little room which the latter had used as a boudoir they were discussing the question of her future residence there  i am afraid he declared that you will have to marry me  it would have its advantages she admitted thoughtfully i am really so fond of you nigel i should be married at st mary abbots kensington and have the annersley children for bridesmaids dont you think i should look sweet in old gold and orange blossoms  dont tantalise me he begged  we really must decide upon something she insisted i hate giving up my rooms here i should hate having my worthy aunt as resident duenna and i suppose it would be gloriously improper for us two to go on living here if i didnt are you quite sure that you love me nigel  i am not quite so sure as i was this morning he confessed holding out his cup for some more tea i met a perfectly adorable girl today at luncheon at the ritz such eyes maggie and the slimmest most wonderful figure you ever saw  who was the cat maggie enquired with asperity  she is russian her name is naida karetsky karschoff introduced me  maggie was suddenly serious there was just a trace of the one expression he had never before seen in her facefearlurking in her eyes even asserting itself in her tone  naida karetsky she repeated tell me exactly how you met her  she was lunching with her father and oscar immelan she stopped to speak to karschoff and asked him to present me afterwards she invited us to take coffee in the lounge  she went out of her way to make your acquaintance then  yes i suppose she did  you know who she is  the daughter of one of the russian consuls over here i understood  she is more than that maggie declared nervously she is the inspiration of the president himself she is the most vital force in russian politics she is the woman whom i wanted you to know to whom i told you that i wished you to pay attentions and now that you know her i am afraid  where did you meet her he asked curiously  we were at school together in paris she was two years older than i but she stayed there until she was twenty afterwards we met in florence  nigel was greatly interested  somehow or other nothing that you can tell me about her surprises me he admitted she has the air of counting for great things in the world she is very beautiful too  she is beautiful enough maggie replied to have turned the head of the great paul matinsky himself they say that he would give his soul to be free to marry her as it is she is the uncrowned tsarina of russia  nigel frowned slightly  isnt that going rather a long way he objected  not when one remembers what manner of a man matinsky is maggie replied he may have his faults but he is an absolute idealist so far as regards his private life there has never been a word of scandal concerning him and naida nor will there ever be but in his eyes naida has that most wonderful gift of allshe has vision he once told a man with whom i spoke in berlin that naida was the one person in the world to whom a mistake was impossible nigel did she give you any idea at all what she was over here for  not as yet he replied but she has asked me to go and see her  did she seem interested in you personally or was it because your name is dorminster  nigel sighed  i hoped it was a personal interest but i cannot tell she asked me whether i had inherited my uncles hobby  what did you tell her she asked eagerly  very little she seemed sympathetic but after all she is in the enemy camp she and immelan seemed on particularly good terms  yet i dont believe that she is committed as yet maggie declared she always used to speak so affectionately of england nigel do you think that i have vision  i am sure that you have he answered  very well then i will tell you what i see she continued i see naida karetsky for russia oscar immelan for germany austria and sweden and prince shan for asiaheremeeting in londonwithin the next week or ten days to take counsel together to decide whether the things which are being plotted against us today shall be or shall not be of immelan we have no hope he conceals it cleverly enough but he hates england with all the fervour of a zealot naida is unconvinced she is to be won and prince shan  well what about him nigel demanded a little carried away by maggies earnestness  she shook her head  i dont know she confessed if the stories one hears about him are true no man nor any woman could ever influence him at least though one could watch and hope  prince shan is supposed to be coming to paris not to london nigel remarked  if he goes to paris maggie said naida and immelan will go so shall we if he comes here it will be easier tell me nigel did you see the prime minister  i saw him nigel replied but without the slightest result he is clearly of the opinion that the open verdict was a merciful one in other words he believes that it was a case of suicide  how wicked maggie exclaimed  i suppose it is trying the ordinary britisher a little high nigel remarked to ask him to believe that he was murdered in cold blood here in the heart of london by the secret service agent of a foreign power the strangest part of it all is that it is true to think that those few pages of manuscript would have told us exactly what we have to fear why i actually had them in my hand  and i in my corsets maggie groaned  they were both silent for a moment then nigel moved towards the door and opened it  come downstairs into the library will you maggie he begged let us go in for a little reconstruction  they found brookes in the hall and took him with them the blinds in the room had never been raised and there was still that nameless atmosphere which lingers for long in an apartment which has become associated with tragedy instinctively they all moved quietly and spoke in hushed voices nigel sat in the chair where his uncle had been found dead and made a mental effort to reconstruct the events which must have immediately preceded the tragedy  i know that this was all thrashed out at the inquest brookes he said but i want you to tell me once more you see how far it is from this table to the door my uncle must have had abundant warning of any one approaching was there no other way by which any one could have entered the room  there was your lordship the man replied and i have regretted several times since that i did not mention it at the inquest the cleaners were here on the morning of that day and the window at the farther end of the room was unfastenedi even believe that it was open  nigel rose and examined the window in question it was almost flush with the ground and although there were iron railings separating it from the street a little gate opening from the area entrance made ingress not only possible but easy nigel returned to his chair  i cant understand this not having been mentioned at the inquest brookes he said  i was waiting for the question to be asked your lordship it was perfectly clear to every one there if your lordship will excuse my saying so that both the coroner and the police seemed to have made up their minds that it was a case of suicide  nigel nodded  i had the same idea with reference to the coroner at any rate brookes he said so long as the verdict was returned in the form it was i am not sure that it was not better so  he dismissed the man with a little nod and sat turning over the code books which still stood upon the table  you and i at any rate maggie know the truth he said and so long as we can get no help from the proper quarters i think that we should do better to let the matter remain as it is we dont want to direct peoples attention to us we want to lull suspicion so far as we can to be free to watch the three  the telephone bell rang and as nigel moved his arm to take off the receiver he knocked over one of the black moroccobound code books a sheet of paper with a few words upon it came fluttering to the ground maggie picked it up glanced at it carelessly at first and then with interest  nigel she exclaimed you see whose handwriting this is could it be part of the decoded dispatch  the telephone enquiry had been unimportant nigel pushed the instrument away they both looked eagerly at the page of manuscript paper it was numbered 8 at the top and the few words written upon it in lord dorminsters writing were obviously the continuation of a paragraph       the name of the middle one then of the three secret cities into      which at all costs some one must find his way is kroten and the      telephone number which is all the clue i have been able to get up      to the present to the london end of the affair is mayfair 146  this is just where he got to in the decoding nigel declared i wonder whether its any use looking for the rest  they searched through every page of the heavy code books in vain then they returned to their study of the single page nigel dragged down an atlas and studied it  kroten he muttered here it isa small place about six hundred miles from petrograd apparently the centre of a barren swampy district population thirty thousand birth rate declining industries nil cheerful sort of spot it seems  i have more luck than you maggie cried her finger tracing out a line in the open telephone book look  nigel glanced over her shoulder and read the entry to which she was pointing  immelan oscar 13 clarges street w mayfair 146     chapter vi   nigel played golf at ranelagh on the following sunday morning with jere chalmers a young american in the diplomatic service who had just arrived in london and brought a letter of introduction to him they had a pleasant game and strolled off from the eighteenth green to the dressing rooms on the best of terms with each other  say dorminster his young companion enjoined lets get through this fixingup business quickly ive had a kind of feeling for a cocktail these last four holes which i cant exactly put into words besides i want to have a word or two with you before the others come down  i shant be a minute nigel promised im going to change into flannels after lunchthat is if you dont mind playing a set or two at tennis my cousininlaw maggie trent whom youll meet at luncheon is rather keen and she doesnt care about golf  im game for anything the other agreed lifting his head spluttering from the basin gee thats good get a move on theres a good fellow i have a fancy for just five minutes with you out on the lawn with the ice chinking in our glasses  nigel finished smoothing his hair and the two men strolled through the hall gave an order to a redcoated attendant and found a secluded table under a marvellous tree in the gardens on the other side chalmers had become a little thoughtful  dorminster he declared yours is a wonderful country  just how is it appealing to you at the moment nigel enquired  ill try and tell you was the meditative reply its your extraordinary insouciance it seems to me as a budding diplomat that you are running the most ghastly risks on earth  in what direction  the young american shrugged his shoulders  well youve got a thoroughly democratic governmentnot such a bad government i should say as things go theyve bled your bourgeoisie a bit and serve em right but with an empire to keep up youre losing all touch upon international politics your ambassadors have been exchanged for trade consuls the whole of your secret service staff has been disbanded you place your entire faith on this sacred league of nations say dorminster youre taking risks  you mustnt forget dorminster replied that it was your country who started the league of nations  president wilson did chalmers grunted you cant say that the country ever backed him up thats the worst of us on the other sidewe so seldom really get a common voice  the league of nations was a thundering good idea nigel declared but it belongs to utopia and not to this vulgar planet  just so chalmers rejoined and yet you are about the only nation who ever took it into her bosom and suckled it to be perfectly frank with you now what other nation in the world is there except yours which is obeying the conventions strictly i tell you frankly we keep our eye on japan and we build a good many commercial ships which would astonish you if you examined them thoroughly our national guard too know a bit more about soldiering than their grandfathers you people on the other hand seem to have become infatuated pacifists i cant tell tales out of school but i dont like the way things are going on eastwards asia means something different now that that amazing fellow prince shan has made a great nation of china  i am entirely in accord with you nigel agreed but what is one to do about it our present government has a big majority trade at home and abroad is prosperous the income tax is down to a shilling in the pound and looks like being wiped out altogether everybody is fat and happy  just as they were in 1914 chalmers remarked significantly  more so dorminster asserted in those days we had our alarmists nowadays they too seem to have gone to sleep my uncle  your uncle was an uncommonly shrewd man chalmers interrupted i was going to talk about him  after lunch nigel suggested rising to his feet here come my cousin and some of her tennis friends karschoff is lunching with us too you know him dont you come along and ill introduce you to the others  it was a very cheerful party who after a few minutes under the trees strolled into luncheon and took their places at the round table reserved for them at the end of the room maggie at once took possession of chalmers  i have been so anxious to meet you mr chalmers she said they tell me that you represent the modern methods in american diplomacy and that therefore you have been made first secretary over the heads of half a dozen of your seniors how they must dislike you and how clever you must be  i dont know that im so much disliked the young man answered with a twinkle in his eyes but i flatter myself that i have brought a new note into diplomacy i was always taught that there were thirtyseven different ways of telling a lie which is to state a diplomatic fact i have swept them all away i tell the truth  how daring maggie murmured and how wonderfully original what should you say now if i asked you if my nose wanted powdering  i should start by saying that the question was outside the sphere of my activities he decided i should then proceed to add as a private person that a little dab on the left side would do it no harm  i begin to believe she confessed that all i have heard of you is true  tell me exactly what you have heard he begged leave out everything that isnt nice i thrive on praise and good reports  to begin with then that you are an extraordinarily shrewd young man she replied that you speak seven languages perfectly and know your way about every capital of europe and that you have ideas of your own as to what is going to happen during the next six or seven years  youve been moving in wellinformed circles he admitted now shall i proceed to turn the tables upon you  you cant possibly know anything about me she declared confidently  i could tell you what ive discovered from personal observation he replied  that sounds like compliments or candour she murmured im terrified of both  well i guess im not out to frighten you he assured her ill keep the secrets of my heart hiddenuntil after luncheon at any rateand just ask youhow you enjoyed your stay in berlin  maggies manner changed she lowered her voice  in berlin she repeated  in the household of the erstwhile leather manufacturer the present president herr essendorf i hope you liked those fat children they always seemed to me loathsome little brats  what do you know about my stay in berlin she demanded  everything there is to be known he answered to tell you the truth our people there were a trifle anxious about you i was the little angel watching from above  you are without a doubt maggie pronounced a most interesting young man we will talk together presently  a hint which sends me back to my mutton the young man observed dorminster he added turning to his host i heard the other day on very good authority that you were thinking of writing a novel if you are study the lady who has just entered there is a type for you an intelligence which might baffle even your attempts at analysis  naida escorted by her father and immelan took her place at an adjacent table she bowed to nigel and karschoff before sitting down and her eyes travelled over the rest of the party with interest then she recognised maggie and waved her hand  immelan is a very constant admirer prince karschoff remarked a little uneasily  is that her father maggie asked  the prince nodded  he is one of the ambassadors of commerce from my country he said in place of diplomacy he superintends the exchange of shipping cargoes and talks freights i suppose immelan and he are all the time comparing notes but i scarcely see where my dear friend naida comes in  there is still the oldest interest in the world for her to fall back upon chalmers murmured one hears that immelan is devoted  scandalmonger the prince declared severely young man from the new world he proceeded get on with your lunch and drink your iced water let the vision of those two remind you that it was your people who foisted the league of nations upon us and be humble even sorrowful when you view one of the sad results  i cant be responsible directly or indirectly for a political flirtation chalmers grumbled besides why should there be any politics about it at all mademoiselle karetsky is quite attractive enough to turn the head even of a seasoned old boulevardier like you prince  that young man karschoff said deliberately will find himself before long face to face with a blighted career he has no respect for age and he is shockingly lacking in finesse all the same on one point i am agreed i dont think there is a man breathing who could resist naida if she wished to call him to her  the little party broke up presently and wandered out into the gardens they sat for a while upon the lawn drinking their coffee and exchanging greetings with acquaintances in the distance the orchestra was playing soft music with a fine regard for the atmosphere of the pleasant almost languorous spring afternoon everywhere were signs of contentment even gaiety and here the alien streak of unfamiliar newcomers was far less pronounced when the time came for tennis chalmers led the way with maggie as soon as they were out of hearing of the others she turned towards him a little abruptly  tell me exactly what you know about my stay in berlin she demanded  everything he answered gravely  you mean  i mean that the new world today has progressed where the old world seems to have been stricken with a terrible blindness our secretservice system has never been better and frankly i hear many things which i dont like i am going to talk to lord dorminster this afternoon very seriously but in the meantime i wanted to speak to you i heard a rumour that you thought of going back to berlin  i dont know how you heard it but the rumour is not altogether untrue she admitted i have not yet made up my mind  dont go he begged  you think they really do know all about me  i know that they do i dont mind telling you that you had the shave of your life on the dutch frontier last time and i dont mind telling you also that we had two of our men shadowing you one of them acted on his own initiative or you would never have crossed the frontier  i rather wondered why they let me out she observed perhaps you can explain why frau essendorf keeps on writing to me under my pseudonym of miss brown and to my reputed address in lincolnshire begging me to return  i could tell you that too he replied they want you back in berlin  they really do know then that i brought over the dispatch from atcheson she asked  they know it he assured her they know too that it was chiefly a wasted labour their london agents saw to that  perhaps she suggested you know who their london agents are  sooner or later in our conversation he remarked we were bound to arrive at a point  come along and let us make up a set then she intervened     chapter vii   naida deserted by her father who had found a taxicab to take him back to the purlieus of piccadilly and auction bridge sauntered along at the back of the tennis nets until she arrived at the court where nigel and his party were playing  i should like to watch this game for a few minutes she told her companion the men are such opposite types and yet both so goodlooking and lady maggie fascinates me  immelan fetched two chairs and they settled down to watch the set nigel with his clean wellknit figure looked his best in spotless white flannels chalmers a more powerful and muscular type also presented a fine appearance the play was fast and sometimes brilliant nigel had maggie for a partner and chalmers one of her friends and the set was as nearly equal as possible naida leaned forward in her chair following every stroke with interest  i find this most fascinating she murmured i hope that lord dorminster and his cousin will win your sympathies of course are on the other side  you are right immelan assented my sympathies are on the other side  there was a lull in the game for a moment or two the sun was troublesome and the players were changing courts naida turned towards her companion thoughtfully  my friend she said glancing around as though to be sure that they were not overheard there are times when you move me to wonder in the small things as well as the large you are so unchanging i think that you would see an englishman die whether he were your friend or your enemy very much as you kick a poisonous snake out of your path  it is quite true was the calm reply  but america was once your enemy she continued watching chalmers powerful service  with america we made peace he explained with england never if you would really appreciate and understand the reason for that undying hatred which i and millions of my fellow countrymen feel it will cost you exactly one shilling go to any stationers and buy a copy of the treaty of versailles read it word by word and line by line it is the most brutal document that was ever printed it will help you to understand  she nodded slowly  paul always declared she said that in those days england had no statesmenno one who could feel what lay beyond the daybyday horizon when i think of that treaty my friend i sympathise with you it is not a great thing to forge chains of hate for a beaten enemy  if you realise this are you not then our friend immelan asked  she appeared for a few moments to be engrossed in the tennis her companion however waited for her answer  in a way she acknowledged i find something magnificent in your wonderfully conceived plans for vengeance and in the spirit which has evolved and kept them alive through all these years then on the other hand i look at home and i ask myself whether you do not make what they would call over here a catspaw of my country  ours is the most natural and most beneficial of all possible alliances immelan insisted germany and russia hand in hand can dominate the world  i am not sure that it is an equal bargain though which you seek to drive with us she said germany aims of course at world power but you are still fettered by the terms of that treaty you cannot build a great fleet of warships or æroplanes you cannot train great armies you cannot lay up for yourselves all the store that is necessary for a successful war so you bring your brains to russia and you ask us to do these things but russia does not aim at world power russia seeks only for a great era of selfdevelopment she too has a mighty neighbour at her gates i am not sure that your bargain is a fair one  it is the first time that i have heard you talk like this immelan declared with a little tremor in his tone  i have been in england twice during the last few months naida said you know very well at whose wish i came i have been studying the conditions here studying the people so far as i can i find them such a kindly race i find their present government so unsuspicious so genuinely altruistic after all that treaty belongs to an england that has passed the england of today would never go to war at all they believe here that they have solved the problem of perpetual peace  immelan smiled a little bitterly  dear lady he said if i lose your help if you go back to petrograd and talk to paul matinsky as you are talking to me do you know that you will break the heart of a nation  she shook her head  paul does not look upon me as infallible she protested besides there are other considerations and now please we will talk of the tennis i do not know whether it is my fancy but that man there to your left in grey seems to me to be taking an interest in our conversation he cannot possibly overhear and he has not glanced once in our direction yet i have an instinct for these things  immelan glanced in the direction of the strangera quietlooking spare man dressed in a grey tweed suit cleanshaven and of early middleage there was nothing about his appearance to distinguish him from a score or more of other loiterers  you are quite right her companion admitted one should not talk of these things even where the birds may listen but it is so difficult as for that man he could not possibly hear but there might be others one passes behind on the grass so noiselessly  they relapsed into silence naida leaning a little forward became once more engrossed in the play her eyes were fixed upon nigel it was his movements which she followed his strokes which she usually applauded immelan sat by her side and watched  they are well matched he remarked presently  mr chalmers has a wonderful service she declared but lord dorminster has more skill oh bravo  the set at that moment was finished by a backhanded return from nigel which skimmed over the net at a great pace completely out of reach of the opposing couple the players strolled across to the seats under the trees naida smiled at nigel and he came over to her side once again he was conscious of that peculiar sense of pleasure and wellbeing which he felt in her company  you play tennis very well lord dorminster she said  i found inspiration he answered  in your partner  maggie is always charming to play with i was thinking of the onlookers  mr immelan is very interested in tennis she remarked with a smile which challenged him  and you  even more so  tell me about games in russia he begged seating himself on the grass by her side  we have none she replied i learnt my tennis at cannes where curiously enough i saw you play three years ago  you were there then he asked with interest  for a few days only we were motoring from spain to monte carlo cannes was very crowded but you see i remembered  her voice seemed to have some lingering charm in it some curiously potent suggestion of personal interest which stirred his pulses he looked up and met her eyes for a moment the world of tennis fields of pleasant chatter and of holidaymakings passed away he rose abruptly to his feet this time he avoided looking at her  you must come over and speak to maggie he begged perhaps mr immelan will spare you for a few moments  immelan bowed sphinxlike but coldly furious the two strolled away together  when the next set was over naida who had rejoined her companion had disappeared on one of their vacated chairs was seated the quietlooking stranger in grey chalmers passed his arm through nigels and led him in that direction  i want you two to know each other he said jesson this is lord dorminstermr gilbert jessonlord dorminster  the two men shook hands nigel a little vaguely he was at first unable to place this newcomer  mr jesson chalmers explained dropping his voice a little was a highly privileged and very much valued member of our intelligence department until he resigned a few months ago i think that if you could spare an hour or two any time this evening dorminster it would interest you very much to know exactly the reason for mr jessons resignation  i should be very pleased indeed nigel replied wont you both come and dine in belgrave square tonight i was going to ask you anyhow chalmers naida karetsky has promised to come and my cousin will be hostess  it will give me very great pleasure jesson acquiesced you will understand he added that the information which mr chalmers has just given you concerning myself is entirely confidential  nigel nodded  we three will have a little talk to ourselves afterwards he suggested at eight oclocknumber 17 belgrave square  jesson strolled away after a little desultory conversation chalmers looked after him thoughtfully  harmlesslooking chap isnt he he observed yet ill let you in on this dorminster there isnt another living person who knows so much of what is going on behind the scenes in europe as that man  why has he chucked his job then nigel enquired  he will tell you that tonight was chalmers quiet reply     chapter viii   i dont think i shall marry you after all maggie announced that evening as she stood looking at herself in one of the gilded mirrors with which the drawingroom at belgrave square was adorned  why not nigel asked with polite anxiety  you are exhibiting symptoms of infidelity she declared your flirtation with naida this afternoon was most pronounced and you went out of your way to ask her to dine tonight  i like that nigel complained supposing it were true i should simply be obeying orders it was you who incited me to devote myself to her  the sacrifices we women make for the good of our country maggie sighed however you neednt have taken me quite so literally do you admire her very much nigel  he smiled his manner however was not altogether free from selfconsciousness  of course i do he admitted shes a perfectly wonderful person isnt she lets get out of this victorian environment he added looking around the huge apartment with its formal arrangement of furniture and its atmosphere of prim but faded elegance well go into the smaller room and tell brookes to bring us some cocktails and cigarettes chalmers wont expect to be received formally and mademoiselle karetsky will appreciate the cosmopolitan note of our welcome  we do look a little too domestic dont we maggie replied as she passed through the portière which nigel was holding up im not at all sure that i ought to come and play hostess like this without an aunt or anything i must think of my reputation i may decide to marry mr chalmers and americans are very particular about that sort of thing  from what i have seen of him i should think that chalmers would make you an excellent husband nigel declared as he rang the bell you need a firm hand and i should think he would be quite capable of using it  you take the matter far too calmly she objected i can assure you that i am getting peevish i hate all russian women with creamy complexions and violetcoloured eyes  they are wonderful eyes nigel declared after he had given brookes an order  maggie looked at him curiously  naida is for your betters sir she reminded him you must not forget that she is to rule over russia some day  just at present nigel observed paul matinsky has a perfectly good wife of his own  an invalid  invalids always live long  presidents and emperors can always get divorces maggie insisted especially in this irreligious age  matinsky isnt that sort nigel said cheerfully even an old gossip like karschoff calls him a purist and you yourself have spoken of his principles  maggie shrugged her shoulders  all right she remarked if you are determined to rush into danger i suppose you must there is just one more point to be considered though i suppose you know that if you succeed any farther with naida you will introduce a personal note into our coming struggle  what do you mean nigel demanded  why immelan of course she replied hes head over ears in love with naida any one can see that  nigel laughed scornfully  my dear child he protested can you imagine a woman like naida thinking seriously of a fellow like immelana scheming teutonic adventurer without even the breeding of his class  maggie laughed softly for several moments  my dear nigel she exclaimed what a luxury to get at the man of you i havent seen your eyes flash like that for ages the cocktails thank goodness shake one for me till it froths all the way up the glass please and then give me a cigarette  nigel obeyed orders helped himself and glanced at the clock as brookes left the room  how nice of you to come half an hour early maggie he remarked  she made a little grimace  the first time you have noticed it she said dolefully do you realise nigel that it is nearly a week since you proposed to me apart from your penchant for naida dont you really want to marry me any more  he came across the room and stood looking down at her thoughtfully she was wearing a somewhat daringly fashioned black lace gown which showed a good deal of her white shoulders and neck her brown hair was simply but artistically arranged she was piquante alluring with a provocative smile at the corners of her lips and a challenging gleam in her eyes the daintiness and femininity of her were enthralling  you would make an adorable wife he reflected  for some one else  an unspeakable proposition he assured her  youre very nicelooking nigel she murmured  youre terribly attractive maggie  then why is it she sighed that we neither of us want to marry the other  if a serious proposition would really be of interest to you he began  she made a little grimace  you heard them coming she interrupted  the three expected guests arrived almost together bringing with them at any rate so far as chalmers and naida were concerned an atmosphere of lightheartedness which was later on to make the little dinner party a complete success naida too was in black a gown simpler than maggies but full of distinction she wore no jewellery except a wonderful string of pearls her black hair was brushed straight back from her forehead but drooped a little over her ears she seemed to bring with her a larger share of girlishness than any of them had previously observed in her as though she had made up her mind for this one evening to cast herself adrift from the graver cares of life and to indulge in the frivolities which after all were the heritage of her youth she sat at nigels right hand and plied him with questions as to the lighter side of his lifehis favourite sport books and general occupation she gave evidences of humour which delighted everybody and nigel though he would at times have welcomed and did his best to initiate an incursion into more serious subjects found himself compelled to admire the tact with which she continually foiled him  it is a mistake she declared once to believe that a woman is ever serious unless she is forced to be all our natural proclivities are towards gaiety we are really butterflies by instinct and we are at our best when we are natural dont you agree with me maggie  from the bottom of my heart maggie assented nothing but conscience ever induces me to pull a long face and turn my thoughts to serious things and i havent a great deal of conscience  so you see naida continued smiling up at her host when you try to get a woman to talk politics or sociology with you you are brushing a little of the down off her wings we really want to be toldother things  i should imagine he replied that my sex frequently indulged you  not so much as i should desire she assured him i have somehow or other acquired an undeserved reputation for brains in russia especially when i meet a stranger they dont even look at my frock or the way my hair is done they plunge instead into a subject of which i know nothingphilosophy or history or international politics  do you know nothing of international politics nigel asked  a home thrust she declared laughing i suppose that is a subject upon which i have some glimmerings of knowledge really not very much though but then i have a theory about that i think sometimes that the clearest judgments are formed by some one who comes a little fresh to a subject some one who hasnt been dabbling in it half their lifetime and acquired prejudices do you always provide strawberries for your guests lord dorminster if so i should like to come and live here  if you will promise to come and live here he replied i will provide strawberries if i have to start a nursery garden in jersey  maggie naida announced across the table lord dorminster has proposed to me the matter of strawberries has brought us together i dont think i shall accept him there are no means of making him keep his bargain  hed make an awfully good husband maggie declared if no one else wants me i shall probably marry him myself some day  naida shook her head  lord dorminster is more my type she declared besides you have had your chance if you really wanted him i have a great friend in russia who prophesies that i shall never marry that does not please me i think not to be married is the worst fate that can happen to any woman  the remedy nigel told her is in your own hands  jesson quieter than the others was still an interesting personality often intervening with a shrewd remark and listening to the sallies of the others with a humorous gleam in his spectacleshielded eyes when at last the girls left them for a time nigel led the way at once into the library where coffee and liqueurs were served  i expect the others will find their way here in a few minutes he said as the door closed behind brookes and his satellite you had something to say to me chalmers about mr jesson here  all that i have to say is in the nature of a testimonial the young american replied jesson was easily one of our best men in europe he resigned a few months ago simply because he wants a job with you fellows  i dont quite understand nigel began  let me explain jesson begged i spent the last three years poking about europe and so far as the united states is concerned theres nothing doing my reports arent worth much more than the paper they are written on and while im drawing my money from washington its not my business to collect information that affects other countries thats why ive sent in my resignation there are great events brewing eastwards lord dorminster and i want to take a hand in the game  do you want to work for us nigel asked  youre right was the quiet reply i guess thats how ive figured it out you see im one of those americans who still consider themselves half english next to the united states great britain is the country for me i know what im talking about lord dorminster and ive come to the conclusion that theres a lot of trouble in store for you people  im pretty well convinced of that myself nigel agreed but you know how things are with us we have a democratic government who have placed their whole faith in the league of nations and who are absolutely and entirely antimilitarist on paper the governments of russia germany and most of the other countries of europe are of the same ilk some of usmy uncle was onewho have studied history and who know something of the science of international politics realise perfectly well that no empire can be considered secure under such conditions this country swarms with foreign secretservice men what they are planning against us heaven knows  heaven and naida karetsky chalmers intervened softly  you believe that she is our enemy nigel asked with a look of trouble in his eyes  she is immelans friend chalmers reminded him  there was a man named atcheson jesson began quietly  nigel nodded  he was one of the men my uncle sent out the first one was stabbed in petrograd jim atcheson was poisoned and died in berlin  there was rather a scare in a certain quarter about atcheson jesson observed he was supposed to have got a report through to the late lord dorminster  he got it through all right nigel replied my uncle was busy decoding it seated in this room at that table when he died  his death was very sudden jesson ventured  i have not the faintest doubt but that he was murdered nigel declared the document upon which he was working disappeared entirely except for one sheet  you have that one sheet jesson asked eagerly  nigel produced it from his pocketbook smoothed it cut and laid it upon the table  there are two things worth noticing here he pointed out the first is that the actual name of a town in russia is given and a telephone number in london kroten i have looked up on the map it seems to be an unimportant place in a very desolate region the telephone number is oscar immelans  that is interesting though not surprising jesson declared immelan as you of course know is one of your enemies one of those who are working in this country for purposes of his own but as regards kroten may i ask where you obtained your information about the place  nigel dragged down the atlas and showed them the paragraph jesson read it with a faint smile upon his lips  i fancy he remarked that this is a little out of date i should like if you have no objection to start for kroten this week  good heavens why nigel exclaimed  i can scarcely answer that question jesson said i am like a man with a puzzle board and a heap of loose pieces kroten is one of those pieces but i havent commenced the fittingin process yet here he said is as much as i can tell you about it there are three cities situated in different countries in the world which are each in their way connected with the danger which is brewing for this country i have heard them described as the three secret cities one is in germany i have been there at the risk of my life and i came away simply puzzled kroten is the next and of the third i have still to discover the whereabouts are you willing lord dorminster to let me act for you abroad i require no salary or remuneration of any sort i am a wealthy man and investigations of this kind are my one hobby i shall not move without your permission although i recognise of course that your own position is entirely an unofficial one if you will trust me however i promise that all my energies shall be devoted to the interests of this country  nigel held out his hand  it is a pact he decided before you leave i will give you the whole of my uncles brief correspondence with sidwell you may be able to gather from it what he was after sidwell you remember was stabbed in a café in the slums of petrograd  i remember quite well jesson admitted quietly i knew sidwell he was a clever person in his way but he relied too much upon disguises i fancy that i hear the voices of the ladies coming i shall just have time to tell you rather a curious coincidence  the two men waited eagerly jesson touched with his forefinger the sheet of paper which he had been studying  sidwell he concluded could not have been so far off the mark the man with whom he was spending the evening in that café was a mechanic from kroten     chapter ix   naida early one afternoon a few days after the dinner at belgrave square raised herself on one elbow from the sofa on which she was resting glanced at the roses and the card which the maid had presented for her inspection and waved them impatiently away  the gentleman waits the woman reminded her  naida glanced out of the window across a dull and apparently uninviting prospect of roofs and chimneys to where in the background a faint line of silver and a wheeling flock of sea gulls became dimly visible through the branches of the distant trees the window itself was flung wide open but the slowly moving air had little of freshness in it sparrows twittered around the windowsill and a little patch of green shone out from the embankment gardens the radiance of spring here found few opportunities  the gentleman waits the serving woman repeated stolidly speaking in her native russian  you can show him up her mistress replied a little wearily  immelan entered a few moments later spruce and neat in a wellfitting grey suit and carrying a grey homburg hat he was redolent of soaps and perfumes his step was buoyant almost jaunty yet in his blue eyes as he bent over the hand of the woman upon whom he had come to call lurked something of the disquietude which notwithstanding his most strenuous efforts was beginning to assert itself  you make me very happy my dear naida he began that you receive me thus so informally your good father is smoking in the lounge he bade me come up  she beckoned him to a seat  a thousand thanks for your flowers my friend she said now tell me why you are possessed to see me at this untimely hour i always rest for a time after luncheon and i am only here because the sunshine filled my room and made me restless  there is a little matter of news he announced slowly i thought it might interest you i hoped it would  she turned her head and looked at him  news she repeated news from you means only one thing is it good or bad  it is good he replied because it saves me a long and tedious journey because it saves me also from a separation which i should have found detestable  your journey to china then is abandoned  it is rendered unnecessary prince shan has decided after all to adhere to his original plan and come to europe  you are sure  i have an official intimation he replied i may probably have to go to paris but no farther it is even possible that i might leave tonight  she was genuinely interested  there is no one in the whole world she declared whom i have wanted to meet so much as prince shan  you will not be disappointed he promised her there is no one like him when he enters the room you know that you are in the presence of a great man the three of us together naida we will remake the map of the world  she frowned a little uneasily  do not take too much for granted oscar she enjoined remember that i am here to watch and to report it is not for me to make decisions  then for whom else he demanded paul matinsky himself wrote me that you had his entire confidencethat you possessed full powers for action you will not be fainthearted naida  i shall never be false to my convictions she replied  there was a brief silence he was not altogether satisfied but he judged the moment unpropitious for any further reference to the coming of prince shan  my plans as you see are changed he said at last and for that reason a promise which i made to myself will not now be kept  she rose to her feet a little uneasily shook out her fluffy morning gown and retreated towards the door leading to the apartments beyond he watched her without movement she picked up a pile of letters from a table in the middle of the room glanced at them and threw them down  it is as well she warned him to keep all promises  as for this one he replied i have no responsibility save to myself i absolve myself i give myself permission to speak your father is even wishful that i should do so i crave from you naida the happiness which only you can bring into my life i ask you to become my wife  she looked at him without visible change of expression her lips however were a little parted the air of aloofness with which she moved through the world seemed suddenly more marked he would have been a brave man or one entirely without perceptions who would have advanced towards her at that moment  that is quite impossible she pronounced  i do not admit it he contended no i will never admit that the fates brought us together it will take something stronger than fate to drive us apart i had not meant to speak yet i had meant to wait until the great pact was sealed and the glory to come assured but during these last few days i have suffered a strange fancy has come to me i seem to feel something between us so i speak before it can grow i speak because without you life for me would be a thing not worth having you are my life and my soul you will not send me away  naida was troubled but unhesitating it was perhaps at that moment that a hidden characteristic of her features showed itself her mouth sometimes almost too voluptuous in its softness had straightened into a firm line of scarlet the deeper violet of her eyes had gone so a woman might have looked who watched suffering unmoved the woman of the bull or prize fight  i am glad that you have spoken oscar she said i know a thing now which has been a source of doubt and anxiety to me what you ask is impossible i do not love you i shall never love you a few days ago i asked myself the very question you have just asked me and i could not answer it now i know  pain and anger struggled in his face he was suffering without a doubt but for a moment it seemed as though the anger would predominate his great shoulders heaved his hands were clenched until the signet ring on his left finger cut into the flesh his eyes were like glittering points of fire  it is the old dream concerning paul he demanded  it has nothing to do with paul she assured him concerning him i will admit that i have had my weak moments i think that those have passed it was such a wonderful dream she went on reflectively the dream of ruling the mightiest nation in the world a nation that even now after many years of travail is only just finding its way through to the light it seemed such a small thing that stood in the way since then i have met pauls wife she does not understand but at least she loves  she is a poor fool no helpmate for any man immelan declared yet it is not his cause i plead but mine i too can minister to your ambitions be my wife and i swear to you that before five years have passed i will be president of the german republic germany is no strange country to you he went on passionately it is you who have helped in the great rapprochement at times when paul has been difficult you have smoothed the way i would not speak against your country i would not speak against anything which lies close to your heart but let me tell you that when the day of purification comes the day when god gives us leave to pour out the vials of vengeance there will be no prouder no more glorious people than ours our triumph will be yours naida you yourself will help to cement the great alliance of these years  she shook her head  i am a woman she said simply incidentally i am a politician and something of an altruist but when it comes to marriage i am a woman i do not love you oscar and i will not marry you  there was a darker shade upon his face now unconsciously he had drawn a little nearer to her  listen he begged it is perhaps possible that i have not been mistakenthat a certain change has crept up in you even within the last few days tell me is there any one else who has found his way into your heart no i will not say heart it could not be your heart in so short a time into your fancy is there any one else naida of whom you are thinking  that is my concern oscar and mine only she answered haughtily  a weaker woman he would have bullied his veins were filled with anger his tongue ached to spend itself naidas bearing cowed him she remained a dominating figure the unnatural restraint imposed upon himself however made his voice sound hard and unfamiliar there were little patches of white around his mouth his teeth showed when he spoke more than usual  if there were any one else he declared and that some one else should chance to be an englishman i would find a new hell for him  there is no one else she answered calmly but if there ever should be oscar immelan and if you ever interfered with him either in this country or any other my arm would follow you around the world remember that  she turned away for a moment eager to gain a brief respite from his darkening face when she looked around he was gone she heard his footsteps passing down the corridor the bell ringing for the lift the clank of the gates as he stepped in once more she gazed out over the uninspiring prospect there was a little more sunshine upon the river more of the dusty chimneypots seemed bathed in its silvery radiance as she stood there she felt herself growing calmer the tension passed from her nerves her eyes grew soft again then an impulse came to her she stretched out her hand for the telephone book turned over the pages restlessly looked through the ds until she found the name for which she was searching for a long time she hesitated when at last she took up the receiver and asked for a number she was conscious of a slight thrill a sense of excitement which in moments of more complete selfcontrol would at least have served as a warning to her     chapter x   the curtain fell upon the first act of louise the lights were turned up the tenseness relaxed men made dives for their hats and the unmusical murmured the usual platitudes naida leaned forward from the corner of her box to the man who was her sole companion  father she said i am expecting a caller with whom i wish to speaklord dorminster if he comes will you leave us alone and if any one else should be here please take them away  more mysteries her father muttered not unkindly who is this man dorminster  naida leaned back in her chair and fanned herself slowly  no one i know very much about she acknowledged i have selected him in my mind however as being a typical englishman of his class i wish to talk to him to appreciate his point of view you know what paul said when he gave you the appointment and sent us over here find out for me what sort of men these englishmen are  matinsky should know her father observed he was here twelve years ago he came over with the first commission which established regular relations with the british government  no doubt she said equably he was able to gauge the official outlook but this country during the last ten years has gone through great vicissitudes besides it is not only the official outlook in which paul is interested he doesnt understand and frankly i dont the position of what they call over here the man in the street you see he must be either a fool or he must be grossly deceived  so far as my dealings with him go i should never call the englishman a fool karetsky confessed  there are degrees and conditions of fools his daughter declared calmly a man with a perfectly acute brain may have simply idiotic impulses towards credulity and a credulous man is always a fool anyhow i know what paul wants  there was a knock at the door karetsky opened it and stood aside to let nigel pass in naida held out her hand to the latter with a smile  i am so glad that you have come she said raising her eyes for a minute to his father you remember lord dorminster  the two men exchanged a few commonplace remarks then karetsky reached for his hat  your arrival lord dorminster he observed leaves me free to make a few calls myself we shall i trust meet again  nigel murmured a few courteous words and watched the retreating figure with some curiosity  your father is very typical he declared he reminds me of your country itself he is massive has suggestions of undeveloped strength  add that he is a little ponderous naida said lightly slow to make up his mind but as obstinate as the urals themselves and you have described him now tell me what you think of a young woman who rings you up without the slightest encouragement and invites you to come to the opera purposely to visit her box  i deny the absence of encouragement and i am very grateful for the opportunity of coming nigel answered and if i were to tell you all that i think of you he added after a moments pause it would take me a great deal longer than this quarter of an hours interval  these were their first few moments absolutely alone neither of them was unduly emotional neither wholly free from experience yet they looked and spoke and felt as though the coming of new things was at hand the atmosphere of music still present was a wonderful background to the intensified sensations of which both were conscious naida had the utmost difficulty in steadying her voice  i wanted to talk to you seriously because you can help me very much if you will she began in a sense i am over here upon a mission some of us in russia feel that your nation is imperfectly understood there we are bearing grudges against you which may not be wholly justified you see to speak very plainly we are under the constant influence of a people which cherishes no feelings of friendship towards you  for a moment the personal element had disappeared nigel remembered who his companion was and all that she stood for he drew his chair a little nearer to hers  if you are looking for a typical englishman he said i fear that i shall be a disappointment to you the typical englishman of today is hiding his head in the sand i am not disposed to do anything of the sort i recognise a great coming danger and i am afraid of your country  the attitude of the official englishman i know she declared a little eagerly what i want to find out is whether there are many like yourself who are awake  i am afraid that i am in the minority he confessed i am trying to carry on the work which my uncle commenced i am trying to secure firm and definite evidence of a certain plot which i believe to be brewing in your country and in germany  tell me exactly what you know she begged  nigel looked at her for several moments in silence she was wearing a russian headdress a low tiara of bound coils of pearls a rope of pearls hung from her neck her white net gown was trimmed with ermine at her first appearance in the front of the box she had created almost a sensation among those to whom she was visible in these darker shadows the sensuous disturbance of which he had been conscious since his entrance swept over him once more with overmastering power  you are very beautiful he said a little abruptly  i am glad you think so she murmured with a very sweet answering light in her eyes but i am hoping that you have other things to tell me  you are the friend of immelan he reminded her  to some extent yes she assented but i admit of no prejudices the greatest friend i have in the world is paul matinsky and it is at his wish that i am here he is anxious above all things not to make a mistake  your country is very much under the dominance of germany he ventured  very much i admit but not utterly so you must remember that after the cataclysm of 1917 russia has been born again in travail and agony no hand was outstretched to help her save that of germany alone for her own sake ultimately perhaps but nevertheless with invaluable results to russia we had vast resources which germany exploited magnificent human material which germany has educated and disciplined the two nations have grown together for their common interest at the same time paul matinsky and very many others have always felt that there is one of germanys great ambitions in which russia ought not necessarily to become involved i thinki hope that you understand me  in plain words nigel said you refer to this projected plan of isolating england  in plain words i do she admitted russias intentions concerning that are trembling in the balance germany is pressing her hard nothing will be finally decided until i return to petrograd you see i speak to you quite openly for i myself have had some experience of your present statesmen i believe if you were to repeat this conversation to any one of them if even you could open their eyes to what is happening they would only shrug their shoulders and say that they relied for their protection on the league of nations  you are unhappily right nigel groaned yet one perseveres and after all there is an element of mystery about the whole affair the french as you know have not imitated our blind credulity their frontier would seem to be impregnable and the difficulties of invading england even from the air are very much as they were during the last war it was these considerations which made my uncle persevere in his attempt at secretservice work on the continent everything depends upon our knowing exactly what is in store for us  and have you discovered that she enquired  he shook his head  everything that we have learnt so far has been of negative value he replied the german citizen army is large but not threateningly so so far as we have been able to discover they do not seem to have any secret store of guns or ammunition their docks hold no secrets yet we know that there is something brewing both the men upon whom my uncle relied have been murdered  but one of them succeeded in getting a dispatch through did he not she asked quietly  yes he succeeded nigel acknowledged my uncle was murdered however in the act of decoding it and the dispatch itself was stolen  you are very frank she said i suppose i ought to feel flattered that you treat me with so little reserve  if you are a friend to germany he replied you probably know all that i can tell you if you are inclined towards friendship with us then it is as well that you should know everything  that is reasonable she admitted now listen this conversation can only last a few minutes longer it is true that oscar immelan is my fathers old friend and also mine but my judgment in all matters which relate to the welfare of my country is not influenced by that fact  there was a report once nigel said taking his courage into both hands that you were engaged to be married to him  she looked him in the eyes against the whiteness of his skin the colour of her own seemed more wonderful than ever  that is not true she replied it will never be true  i am glad he declared fervently  there was a brief pause both seemed conscious of a renewal of that air of disturbance which had reigned between them during their first few moments alone it was naida who made an effort to restore their conversation to its former tone  if germany has any scheme against this country she said believe me it will not be so obvious as you seem to think it will be a scheme which can only be carried out with the assistance of other countries and that assistance is not yet wholly promised i cannot betray to you my knowledge of certain things she went on after a moments hesitation but i can at least give you this warning it is not for his health alone that prince shan is flying from china to paris if there is a single member of your government who has the least apprehension of world politics now is the time for action  there is no one nigel answered gloomily  the box was suddenly invaded karetsky reappeared with several other men in the rear of the little procession came immelan his face darkened as he recognised nigel naida looked across at him with a slight frown upon her forehead  you have changed your mind she remarked i thought you were for paris tonight  a fortunate chance intervened immelan replied  fortunate  immelan watched nigels retreating figure with a menacing frown  i find it so he replied our wonderful prima donna is in great voice tonightand i like to be prepared for all possible combinations     chapter xi   maggie came suddenly into the library at belgrave square where jesson chalmers and nigel were talking together she carried in her hand a note which she handed to the latter  naida is a dear after all she declared there is one person at least who does not wish to have me pass away in a german nursing home or fall a victim to frau essendorfs cooking  nigel read the note aloud it consisted of only a sentence or two and was dated from the milan court that morning       maggie dear this is just a line of advice from your friend you      must not go back to germany       naida  i fear maggie sighed that my little expedition is scotched even if i had been able to persuade you others to let me go every one seems to have made up their mind that i shall not go to germany it will be such a disappointment to those flaxenhaired atrocities gertrud and bertha their somuchloved miss brown can never return to them again  in any case the game was scarcely worth the candle nigel observed we have already all the evidence we require that some scheme inimical to this country is being proposed and fostered by immelan our next move must be to find out the nature of this schemewhether it be naval military or political i dont think essendorf would be at all likely to give away any more interesting information in the domestic circle  what are we all going to do then maggie asked  we are met here to discuss it nigel replied jesson is off to russia this afternoon i asked him to come round and have a few last words with us in case there was anything to suggest for us stayathomes  we shall have to rely very largely upon luck jesson declared there are three places in any of which we might discover what we want to know one is kroten another is paris provided that prince shan really goes there and the third london  london maggie repeated  there are two people in london jesson declared who know everything we are seeking to discover one is immelan and the other naida karetsky  it seems to me maggie said that if that is so the place for us is where those two people are what is the importance of kroten mr jesson  kroten jesson replied is the second of what i have seen referred to in a private diplomatic report written in an enemy country as the three mystery cities of the world the first one is in germany and i have already explored it i have information but information which without its sequel is valueless kroten is the second ten years ago it was a town of eighteen thousand inhabitants today there are at least two hundred thousand people there and it is growing all the time  say how can a town of that size chalmers enquired be termed a mystery city in any sense of the word travellings free in russia i guess any one that wanted could take a ticket to kroten  a good many do jesson assented calmly and some never come back america and russia are on friendly terms yet two men in my branch of the servicegood fellows they were toostarted out from washington for kroten six months ago neither of them has been heard of since neither ever will be  hows it done chalmers asked curiously  in the first place jesson explained the city itself stands at the arm of the river in a sort of culdesac with absolutely untraversable mountains on three sides of it all the roads have to come around the plain and enter from eastwards there is only one line of railway so that all the approaches into the city are easily guarded  thats all right geographically of course nigel admitted but what earthly excuse can any one make for keeping tourists or travellers out of the place if they want to go there  that is perhaps the most ingenious thing of all jesson replied you know that russia is now practically a tranquil country but there are certain bands of the extreme bolshevistic faction who never gave in to authority and who practically exist in the littleknown places by means of marauding expeditions the mountains about kroten are supposed to have been infested by these nomadic companies whether the outrages set down to them are really committed or not i dont suppose any one knows but my point of view is that the presence of these people is absolutely encouraged by the government to give them an excuse for the most extraordinary precautions in issuing passports or allowing any one from the outside world to pass into the city if you get in i understand you are waited upon by the police within half an hour and have to tell them the story of your past life and your future intentions after that you are allowed to go about on parole if you get too inquisitive you are discovered to be in touch with the robber bands andwellthats an end of you  a nice salubrious spot nigel murmured  it sounds most interesting maggie declared i think a woman would be less likely to cause suspicion she added hopefully  utterly out of the question jesson pronounced kroten is the one place that must be left in my hands i know more about the getting there than any of you and i know the tricks of changing my identity  i should rather like to go with you nigel confessed  impossible was the brief reply  why  jesson smiled  to be perfectly frank he said because you are developing an interest in the one person in the world who might give success over into our hands it is necessary for you to remain where you can encourage that interest  nigel was a little staggered  my friendship with mademoiselle karetsky he protested is scarcely likely to influence her political views  i am a somewhat close observer jesson continued you will not ask me to believe that your conversation with mademoiselle in her box at the opera last night related all the time towell shall we say music  nigel you never told me you were at the opera maggie intervened what made you go  i think that it was a message from mademoiselle karetsky jesson suggested quietly  nigel smiled  upon my word i think youre going to be a success jesson he declared perhaps you can tell me what we did talk about  i believe i almost could was the calm reply in any case i think i see the situation as it exists mademoiselle karetsky is a wonderful woman she has a great open mind to a certain extent of course she has seen things from the point of view of paul matinsky immelan and that little coterie of russogermans who see a future for both countries only in an alliance of the oldfashioned order matinsky however has always had his doubts that is why he sent over here the one person whom he trusted presently she will make a report and the whole issue will remain with her immelan knows this and pays her ceaseless court my impression however is that his influence is waning i believe that today he is terrified at the bare reflection of how much naida karetsky knows  you believe that she does know exactly what is intended nigel asked  i am perfectly certain of it jesson replied if she could be induced to tell us everything my journey to kroten might just as well be abandoned yet somehow i do not think she will go so far as that the most that we can hope for is that she will advise matinsky to reject immelans proposals and that she will perhaps bring some influence to bear in the same direction upon prince shan  i am inclined to agree with jesson nigel pronounced inasmuch as i believe that mademoiselle karetsky is disposed to change or modify her views concerning us you see after all this threatened blow against england is purely a private affair of germanys there is really no reason why russia or any other country should be dragged into it she is the monkey pulling the chestnuts out of the fire for her most dangerous rival  matinsky might be brought to think that way chalmers observed but they say half the members of his cabinet are under german influence  if matinsky believed that nigel declared he is quite strong enough to clear them all out and make a fresh start  in the meantime maggie interposed i should like to know in what way you propose to use poor little me i am not to go to germany the man whom i at one time seriously thought of marrying is told off to engage the attentions of another woman mr jesson here is going to kroten and he doesnt show the slightest inclination to take me with him am i to sit here and do nothing  there remains for you the third enterprise jesson replied one in which so far as i can see he continued with a smile you have not the faintest chance of success  tell me what it is at least she begged  the conversion of prince shan  maggie made a little grimace  arent you trying me a little high she murmured  very high indeed jesson acknowledged prince shan for all his wonderful statesmanship and his grip upon world affairs is reputed to be almost an anchorite in his daily life no woman has ever yet been able to boast of having exercised the slightest influence over him at the same time he is an extraordinarily human person and success with him would mean the end of your enemies  it sounds a bit of a forlorn hope maggie remarked cheerfully but ill do my little best  prince shan has abandoned his idea of landing at paris jesson continued he is coming direct to london i have to thank chalmers for that information immelan will meet him directly he arrives and their first conversations will make history afterwards if things go well mademoiselle karetsky will join the conference  i fear maggie sighed that there will be difficulties in the way of my establishing confidential relations with prince shan  there will be difficulties jesson assented but the thing is not so impossible as it would be in paris prince shan has a very fine house in curzon street which is kept in continual readiness for him he will probably entertain to some extent you will without doubt have opportunities of meeting him socially  maggie glanced at herself in the glass  a chinaman she murmured  i guess that doesnt mean what it did chalmers pointed out prince shan is an aristocrat and a born ruler he has every scrap of culture that we know anything about and something from his thousandyearold family that we dont quite know how to put into words dont you worry about prince shan lady maggie ask dorminster here what they called him at oxford  the first gentleman of asia nigel replied i think he deserves the title     chapter xii   on the morning following the conclave in belgrave square the right honourable mervin brown received two extremely distinguished visitors in downing street it was doubtful whether the prime minister was altogether at his best there was a certain amount of irritability rankling beneath his customary air of bonhommie he motioned his callers to take chairs however and listened attentively to the few words of introduction which his secretary thought necessary  this is general dumesnil sir of the french staff and monsieur pouilly of the french cabinet they have called according to appointment on government business  very glad to see you gentlemen was the prime ministers brisk welcome sorry i cant talk french to you politics these last ten years havent left us much time for the outside graces  monsieur pouilly at once took the floor he was a thin dark man with a beautifully trimmed black beard flashing black eyes and thoughtful delicate features he was attired in the frock coat and dark trousers of diplomatic usage and he appeared to somewhat resent the brown tweed suit and soft collar of the man who was receiving him  mr mervin brown he began you will kindly look upon our visit as official we are envoys from monsieur le président and the french government general dumesnil has accompanied me in case our conversation should turn upon military matters here or at the war office  the general saluted the prime minister bowed a little awkwardly  so far as i am concerned the latter declared i will be perfectly frank with you from the start i know nothing whatever about military affairs my job is to govern this country to make the most of its resources and to bring prosperity to its citizens from the english channel to the north sea we dont need soldiers and never shall that i can see i am firmly convinced that the days of wars are over the government of every country in the world is getting into the hands of the democracy and the democracy dont want war and never did if any of the more quarrelsome folk on the continent get scrapping well my conception of my duty is to keep out of it  monsieur pouilly restrained himself to judge from his appearance however it was not altogether an easy matter  you belong sir he said to a type of statesman whose rise to power in this country some of us have watched with a certain amount of concern for although it is not my mission here today to talk politics i am yet bound to remind you that you do not stand alone the very league of nations upon which you rely imposes certain obligations upon you some actual some understood it is to discuss the situation arising from your neglect to make the provisions called for in that agreement that i am here today  mr mervin brown glanced at some figures which his secretary had laid before him  you complain i presume of the reduction of our standing army he observed  we complain of that monsieur pouilly replied and we complain also of the gradually decreasing interest shown by your government in matters of æronautics artillery and naval construction we learnt our lesson in 1914 if trouble should come again our country would once more be the sufferer you would no doubt do everything that was expected of you in time before you were ready however france would be ruined you entered into certain obligations under the league of nations my government begs to call your attention to the fact that you are not fulfilling them  it is my intention within the course of the next few months mervin brown declared to lay before the league of nations a scheme for total disarmament  monsieur pouilly was staggered a little exclamation escaped the general  what about those nations the latter enquired who were left outside the league what of russia for instance  russia is a great and peaceful republic mervin brown replied all her efforts are devoted towards industrial development no nation would have less to gain by a return to militarism  pardon monsieur but how do you know anything about russia monsieur pouilly asked you have not a single secret service agent there and your ambassadors are ambassadors of commerce  i know what every one else knows mervin brown declared our commercial travellers are our secret service agents they travel where they please in russia  and germany the general queried  i defy you to say that there is the slightest indication of any militarism in germany the prime minister insisted i was there myself only a few months ago the country is quiet and moving on now to a new prosperity i am absolutely and entirely convinced that the world has nothing to fear from either russia or germany  have you any theory sir general dumesnil enquired as to why russia refused to join the league of nations  none whatever was the genial acknowledgment russia was left out at the start through jealous statesmanship and afterwards she preferred her independence i have every sympathy with her attitude  one more question the soldier begged are you aware sir that since japan left the league of nations on the excuse of her isolation she has been building æroplanes and battleships on a new theory instigated if you please by china  and look at her last balance sheet as a result of it was the prompt retort if a nation chooses to make herself a bankrupt by building war toys no one in the world can help her legislation of that sort is foolish and simply an incitement to revolution look at the difference in our country our income tax is practically abolished our industrial troubles are over our credit never stood so high the wealth of the country was never so great we are satisfied a peaceful nation makes for peace the rattling of the sabre incites military disturbance do not ask us gentlemen to train armies or build ships  we ask you only to keep your covenant monsieur pouilly pronounced stiffly  who does keep it the prime minister demanded the world is governed now by common sense and humanity i look upon a war of aggression on the part of any country as a sheer impossibility  what about a war of revenge the general enquired quietly  you can search germany from end to end mervin brown declared and find no trace of any spirit of the sort i am sorry if i am a disappointment to you gentlemen but the present government views your attitude without sympathy general richardson is expecting a visit from you this morning at the war office and he will give you any information you desire an appointment has also been made for you this afternoon at the admiralty you are doing me the honour of dining with me here tomorrow night to meet certain members of my cabinet and we will if you choose discuss the matter further then i have thought it best to place my views clearly before you however at the outset of your visit here  the frenchmen rose a few minutes later and took their leave ceremoniously but with obvious discontent the prime minister leaned back in his chair and awaited his secretarys return with a wellsatisfied smile in a few minutes the latter presented himself  well franklin the great man said ive let them hear the truth for once plain speaking eh  the young man bowed  they certainly know your views sir  the minister glanced at his subordinate sharply  whats the matter with you this morning franklin he demanded  there is nothing the matter with me thank you sir was the quiet reply  youre not going to tell me that you disapprove of my attitude  by no means sir the young man assured his chief hastilynot altogether that is to say at the same time one wonders how far those two men represent the feeling of france  his chief shrugged his shoulders  the military spirit is hard to kill he said it is in the blood of most frenchmen they are not big enough to understand that the world is moving on to greater things what did they say to you before they left  nothing much sir the general just asked me whether i thought you would soon be content to leave london unpoliced  what rubbish any one else for me to see this morning  you promised to give lord dorminster ten minutes the young man reminded him he is in the anteroom now  the prime minister frowned  dorminster he repeated he is a nephew of the man who was always worrying the government to reëstablish the secret service i remember he came to see me the other day declared that his uncle had been murdered and a secret dispatch from germany stolen i wonder he didnt wind up with a report that the chinese were on their way to seize ireland  it is the same man sir  well i suppose id better see him and get it over his chief declared irritably if only one could make these people realize how far behind the times they are  nigel was shown in a few minutes later mr mervin brown was gracious but terse  i havent had the opportunity of congratulating you upon becoming one of our hereditary legislators lord dorminster since you took your seat in the house of lords he said pray let me do so now i hope that we may count upon your support  my support sir nigel replied will be given to any party which will take the urgent necessary steps to protect this country against a great danger  god bless my soul the prime minister exclaimed another of you  i can only guess who my predecessors were nigel continued smiling but i will frankly confess that the object of my visit is to beg you to reëstablish our secret service in germany russia and china  nothing the other declared would induce me to do anything of the sort  are you aware nigel enquired that there is a considerable foreign secret service at work in this country at the present moment  i am not aware of it and i dont believe it was the blunt retort  i have absolute proof nigel insisted not only that but two exsecret service men whom my uncle sent out to germany and russia on his own account were murdered there as soon as they began to get on the track of certain things which had been kept secret a report from one of these men got through and was stolen from my uncles library in belgrave square on the day he was murdered you will remember that i placed all these facts before you on the occasion of a previous visit  mervin brown nodded  anything else he asked patiently  you know that a special envoy from china is on his way here at the present moment to meet immelan  oscar immelan the german commissioner  the same nigel assented  a most delightful fellow the prime minister declared warmly and a great friend to this country  i must take the liberty of disagreeing with you nigel rejoined because i know very well that he is our bitter enemy prince shan who is on his way from china to meet him is the envoy of the one country outside europe whom we might fear we sit still and do nothing we have no means of knowing what may be plotted against us here in london at least a polite request might be sent to prince shan to ask him to pay you a visit and disclose the nature of his conference with immelan  if he cares to come we shall be glad to see him mervin brown replied but i for one shall not go out of my way to talk politics  do you know what politics are sir nigel asked in a sudden fury  the prime ministers eyes flashed for a moment he controlled himself however and rang the bell  i have an idea that i do he answered a few millions of my fellow countrymen believe the same thing or i should not be here i think that you know what my principles are lord dorminster i am here to govern this country for the benefit of the people we dont want to govern any one elses country we dont want to meddle in any one elses affairs least of all do we want to revert to the times when your uncle was a young man and every country in europe was sitting with drawn sword trusting nobody fearing everybody living in a state of nerves with the roll of the drum always in their ears the best preventative of war in my opinion is not to believe in it good morning lord dorminster  it was a dismissal against which there was no appeal nigel followed the secretary from the room  you found the chief a little bit ratty this morning i expect lord dorminster the latter remarked weve had the french mission here  mr mervin brown has at least the virtue of knowing his own mind nigel replied dryly     chapter xiii   the automobile turned in through the great entrance gates of the south london aeronautic terminus and commenced a slow ascent along the broad asphalted road to what a few years ago had been esteemed a new wonder of the world maggie rose to her feet with a little exclamation of wonder  do you know i have never been here at night before she exclaimed isnt it wonderful  marvellous nigel replied its the largest aeronautic station in the worldbigger they say than all our railway termini put together look at the flares maggie no wonder the sky from the housetop at belgrave square seems always to be on fire at night  they were approaching now the first of the huge sheds which were arranged in circular fashion around an immense stretch of perfectly level asphalted ground every shed was as big as an ordinary railway station its arched opening framed with electric illuminations inside could be seen the crowds of people waiting on the platforms in many of them the engine of a great airship was already throbbing waiting to start in the background was a huge wireless installation and around at regular intervals enormous pillars on the top of which flares of differentcoloured fire were burning the automobile came to a standstill before a large electrically illuminated time chart nigel alighted for a moment and spoke to one of the inspectors  which station for the black dragon private ship from china he enquired  the man glanced at the chart  number seven on the other side he replied you can drive around  how is she for time  she crossed the north sea punctually he replied we should see her violet lights in ten minutes mind the traffic as you pass number three the north ship from norway is just in  nigel addressed a word of caution to the chauffeur and they drove on from the first shed they passed a stream of vehicles was pouring outporters with luggage jostling throngs of newly arrived passengers on their way to the electric underground they drove into number seven shed left the car and walked to the end of the long platform the great arc of glasscovered roof above them was brilliantly illuminated throwing a queer downward light upon the long line of waiting porters the refreshment rooms the kiosks and newspaper stalls in the far end a huge airship bound for the east was already filling up maggie and her companion stood for a few minutes gazing into the huge void of space  tell me about naida the former begged a little abruptly  naida is a wonderful woman nigel declared enthusiastically we lunched at ciros she wore a black and white muslin gown which arrived this morning from paris afterwards we went down to ranelagh and sat under the trees  throwing yourself thoroughly into your little job arent you maggie sniffed  youll have a chance to catch me up before long he replied naida has promised that she will arrange a meeting with the prince  i wonder what oscar immelan will have to say about it maggie reflected  to tell you the truth nigel said hopefully i believe that immelan is losing ground his whole scheme is too selfish of course naida wont discuss these things with me in plain words but she gives me a hint now and then amongst her gifts she has a marvellous sense of justice and a hatred of any form of bribery that is where i feel convinced that she and immelan will never come together immelan could never see more than the selfish side even of a world upheaval naida searches everywhere for motive she has the altruistic instinct i wonder no longer at matinsky she is a born ruler herself  im glad you are getting along with her maggie remarked look she broke off catching at his arm the violet lights  high up in the sky outside two violet specks of light suddenly rose and fell like airballs a crowd of mechanics appeared through subterranean doors and stood about in the vast arena very soon the airship came into sight her cars brilliantly illuminated she circled slowly round and came noiselessly to the ground and with the mechanics running by her side and her engines now scarcely audible came slowly into the shed and to a standstill by the side of the platform maggie and her companion stood well in the background  there he is the latter whispered  immelan suddenly appeared as though from the bowels of the earth was shaking hands warmly with a tall slender man who was one of the first to descend from the airship they talked rapidly together for a few minutes then they disappeared walking down towards the luggageclearing station maggie watched the retreating figures earnestly  he doesnt look in the least chinese she declared  i told you he didnt nigel replied he was considered the bestlooking man of his year up at oxford  maggie was unusually silent on their way back  it was perhaps scarcely worth our while this little expedition of ours maggie said thoughtfully  youre not sorry that we came he asked  she shook her head i think not she replied  why only think  she roused herself with an effort  i dont know nigel she confessed i cant imagine what is wrong with me i feel shiverynervousas though something were going to happen  he looked at her curiously this was a maggie whom he scarcely recognised  presentiments he asked  absurd isnt it she replied with a weak smile ill get over it directly i dont think i am going to like prince shan nigel  well you havent been long making up your mind he observed i shouldnt have thought you had been able even to see his face  i had a queer lightninglike glimpse of it she reflected to me it seemed as though it were carved out of granite and as though all that was human about him were the mouth and the eyes i wish he hadnt been looking  are you flattering yourself that he will recognise you nigel asked  i know that he will she answered simply                                       in a corner of the whiteandgold restaurant at the ritz on the following evening prince shan and immelan dined têteàtête immelan in the best of spirits talking of the pleasant trifles of the world drinking champagne and pointing out notabilities prince shan his features and expression unchanging and his face as white as the perfectly fitting shirt he wore his clothes were fashionable and distinctive his black pearls unobtrusive but wonderful his smoothly brushed dark hair his immaculate finger nails his skilfully tied tie all indicative of his close touch with western civilization there was nothing in fact except his sphinxlike expression the slightly unusual shape of his brilliant eyes and his queer air of personal detachment to denote the oriental he drank water he ate sparingly he preserved an almost unbroken silence yet he had the air of one giving courteous attention to everything which his companion said and finding interest in it only once he asked a question  you are well acquainted here my host he said you know the trio at the table just behind the entrancethe attractive young lady with her chaperon and a gentleman who i rather fancy must be an old college acquaintance whose name i have forgotten tell me some more about them in their private capacity and not as saviours of their country  immelan frowned slightly as he glanced across the room  there is not much to tell he answered without enthusiasm the young lady is as you know lady maggie trent the older lady with the white hair is i believe her aunt the name of their escort is lord dorminster you would probably know him by the name of kingleyhe has only just succeeded to the title  prince shan was looking straight across the room his eyes travelling over the heads of the many brilliant little groups of diners to rest apparently upon an empty space in the whiteandgold walls he had been a great traveller but always his first evening when he came once more into touch with a civilisation more meretricious but more poignant than his own resulted in this disturbing cloud of sensations his companions voice sounded emptily in his ears  they say that the young lady is engaged to lord dorminster that is only gossip however  for the second time prince shan looked directly at the little group his eyes rested upon maggie simply dressed but wonderfully soignée very alluring laughing up into the face of her escort their eyes did not actually meet but each was conscious of the others regard once more he felt the disturbance of the west  if we should chance to come together naturally he said it would gratify me to make the acquaintance of lady maggie trent     chapter xiv   the introduction which prince shan had requested came about very naturally the lounge of the hotel was more than usually crowded that evening and the table towards which an attentive maître dhôtel conducted immelan and his companion was next to the one reserved by nigel the transference of a chair opened up conversation immelan was bland and ingenuous as usual introducing every one glad apparently to make one common party prince shan remained by maggies side after the introduction had been effected a chair which immelan schemed to offer him elsewhere he calmly refused  this is my first evening in london lady maggie he said i am fortunate  why she asked  he looked at her meditatively then he accepted her unspoken invitation and seated himself on the lounge by her side  we who come from the selfcontained countries of the world he explained and china is one of them come always with the desire and longing for new experiences new sensations my own appetite for these is insatiable  and am i a new sensation maggie asked glancing up at him innocently enough but with a faint gleam of mockery in her eyes  you are he answered placidly you revealor rather you suggestthe things of which in my country we know nothing  but i thought you were all so hypercivilised over there maggie observed please tell me at once what it is that i possess which your womenkind do not  if i answered all that your question implies he said i should make use of speech too direct for the conventions of the world in which you live i would simply remind you that whereas we men in china may claim i think to have reached the same standard of culture and civilisation as europeans we have left our womenkind far behind in that respect the chinese woman even the noble lady does not care for serious affairs the god of the mountains as they call him made her a flower to pluck a beautiful plaything for her chosen mate she remains primitive that is why in time man wearies of her why the person of imagination looks sometimes westward finds a new joy and a strange new fascination in a wholly different type of femininity  but you have many european women now living in china maggie reminded himamerican women too and they are so much admired everywhere  the chinese especially we of the nobility prince shan replied are born with racial prejudices an individual may forgive an affront a nation never the days of retaliation by force of arms may indeed have passed but the gentleman of china even of these days is not likely to take to his heart the woman of america  dear me maggie murmured isnt it rather out of date to persevere in these ancient feuds  feeling of all sorts is out of date he admitted patiently yet there are some things which endure i should be honoured by your friendship lady maggie  this is very sudden she laughed i am very flatteredbut what does it mean  permission to call upon youand your aunt he added glancing around the little circle  we shall be delighted maggie replied but you wont like my aunt she is a little deaf and she has no sense of humour she has come to live with us because lord dorminster and i are not really related although we call ourselves cousins and i should hate to leave belgrave square you shall take me out to tea tomorrow afternoon instead if you like  a smouldering fire burned for a moment in his eyes  that will make me very happy he said i shall attend you at four oclock  thenceforward conversation became general prince shan with the air of one who has achieved his immediate object left his place by maggies side and talked with grave courtesy to her aunt presently the little party broke up bound it seemed for the same theatre nigel had become a little serious  well youve made a good start maggie he remarked leaning forward in his place in the limousine  have i maggie answered thoughtfully i wonder  i wish we could get at him in some different fashion her companion observed uneasily  my dear man im hardened to these enterprises maggie assured him i even let the president of the german republic hold my hand once when his wife wasnt looking nothing came of it she added with a little sigh these germans are terribly sentimental when it doesnt cost them anything theyve no idea of a fair exchange  by a fair exchange you mean her aunt suggested a little censoriously that you expected him to barter his countrys secrets for a touch of your fingers  or my lips perhaps maggie added with a little grimace please dont look so serious aunt im not really in love with prince shan you know and tonight i rather feel like marrying nigel if i can get him back again i like his waistcoat buttons and the way he has tied his tie  too late my dear nigel warned her i give you formal notice i have transferred my affections  that decides me maggie declared firmly i shall collect you back again i hate to lose an admirer  the nonsense you young people talk mrs bollington smith observed as they reached the theatre  chalmers joined them soon after they had reached their box he sank into the empty place by maggies side which nigel had just vacated and leaned forward confidentially  so youve started the campaign he whispered  how do you know she enquired  i was at the ritz tonight he told her at the far end of the room with my chief and two other men we were behind you in the lounge afterwards  i was so engrossed maggie murmured  chalmers paused for a moment to watch the performance when he spoke again his voice was for him unusually serious  young lady he said i told you on our first meeting my idea of diplomacy truth no beating about the bushjust the plain unvarnished truth i have conceived an affection for you  goodness gracious maggie exclaimed softly are you going to propose  nothing he assured her is farther from my thoughts lest i should be misunderstood let me substitute the term affectionate interest for affection i have felt uneasy ever since i saw prince shan watching you across the restaurant tonight  did he really watch me maggie asked complacently  he not only watched you chalmers assured her but he thought about youand very little else  congratulate me then she replied i am on the way to success  chalmers frowned  im not quite so sure he said youll think im an illogical sort of person but ive changed my mind about your rôle in this little affair  why  because i am afraid of prince shan he answered deliberately  she looked at him from behind her fan her eyes sparkled with interest if there were any other feeling underneath she showed no trace of it  what a queer word for you to use  he nodded  i know it i would back you lady maggie to hold your own against any male creature breathing of your own order and your own race but prince shan plays the game differently he possesses every gift which women and men both admire but he hasnt our standards life for him means power a wish for him entails its fulfilment  you are afraid maggie suggested still with the laughter in her eyes that he will trifle with my affections  something like that he admitted bluntly prince shan will be here for a weekperhaps a fortnight when he goes he goes a very long distance away  i may decide to marry him maggie said one gets rather tired here of the regular st georges hanover square business and all that comes afterwards  dear lady maggie chalmers replied that is the trouble prince shan would never marry you  why not she asked simply  first of all chalmers went on after a moments hesitation because prince shan broadminded though he seems to be and is on all the great questions of the world still preserves something of what we should call the superstition of his country and order i believe in his own mind he looks upon himself as being one of the few elect of the earth he travels he is gracious everywhere but though his manner is the perfection of form in his heart he is still aloof he rides through the clouds from asia and he leaves always something of himself over there on the other side let me tell you this lady maggie i have never forgotten it he was at harvard in my year and so far as he unbent to any one he sometimes unbent to me i asked him once whether he were ever going to marry he shook his head and sighed i can never marry he replied why not i asked him because there are no women of the shan line alive he answered later he took pity on my bewilderment he let me understand for two thousand years no shan has married save one of his own line to ally himself with a princess of the royal house of england would be a mésalliance which would disturb his ancestors in their graves of course this sounds to us very ridiculous but to him it isnt it is part of the religion of his life  you are not very encouraging are you maggie remarked perhaps he has changed since those days  her companion shook his head  i should say not he replied the prince is not of the order of those who change  is it matrimony alone she asked which he denies himself  chalmers glanced towards mrs bollington smith whose eyes were closed then he nodded towards the stage  you see the woman who has just come upon the stage  maggie glanced downwards a very wonderful little figure in white satin lithe and sinuous as a cat chinese in the subtlety of her looks european in her almost sinister overcivilisation stood smiling blandly at the applauding audience  la belle nita maggie murmured i thought she was in paris well what of her  she is reputed to be a protégée of prince shan you see how she looks up at his box  maggie was conscious of a queer and almost incomprehensible stab at the heart she answered without hesitation or change of expression however  the prince must be kind to a fellow countrywoman she declared indulgently you are talking terrible scandal  la belle nita danced wonderfully sang like a linnet danced again and disappeared notwithstanding the almost wild calls for an encore with the end of her turn came a selection from the orchestra and a general emptying of the boxes presently chalmers went in search of nigel a few moments later there was a knock at the door maggie gripped the sides of her chair tightly she was moved almost to fury by the turmoil in which she found herself her invitation to enter was almost inaudible  i am deserted prince shan explained as he made his bow and took the chair to which maggie pointed my friend immelan has left me to visit acquaintances and i chance to be unattended this evening i trust that i do not intrude  you are very welcome here maggie replied will you listen to the orchestra or talk to me  i will talk if i may he answered lord dorminster is not with you  nigel went to look up a friend whom he wants to bring to supper he is one of those people who seem to discover friends and acquaintances in every quarter of the globe  and to that fortunate chance her visitor continued dropping his voice a little i owe the happiness of finding you alone  maggie glanced towards her aunt who was leaning back in her seat  aunt seems to be asleep but she isnt she declared she is really a very efficient chaperon talk to me about china please and tell me about your dragon airship is it true that you have silver baths and that gauteron painted the walls of your dining salon  one is in the air five days on the way over he answered indifferently it is necessary that ones surroundings should be agreeable perhaps some day i may have the honour of showing it to you in the darkness and when she is docked there is little to be seen  she looked at him curiously  you knew that i was there then  yours was the first face i saw when i descended from the car he told her you stood apart watching and i wondered why i knew too that you would be at the ritz tonight that is why i came there as a rule i do not dine in public  how could you possibly know that i was going to be there maggie asked curiously  i sent a gentleman of my suite to look through the names of those who had booked tables he answered it was very simple  it was only a chance that the table was reserved in my name she reminded him  it was chance which brought us together he rejoined it is chance under another name to which i trust in life  for the first time in her life in her relations with the other sex maggie felt a queer sensation which was almost fear she felt herself losing poise her will governed her whole self dominated unconsciously she drew herself a little away her eyes travelled around the crowded house and suddenly rested on the box which her visitor had just vacated seated behind the curtains but leaning slightly forward her eyes fixed intently upon prince shan was la belle nita a green opera cloak thrown around her dancing costume a curious striking little figure in the semiobscurity  you have some one waiting for you in your box maggie told him  he glanced across the auditorium and rose to his feet she gave him credit for the adroitness of mind which rejected the obvious explanation of her presence there  i must go he said simply but i have many things which i desire to say to you you will not forget tomorrow afternoon  i shall not forget she answered in a low tone     chapter xv   there was a half reluctant admiration in prince shans eyes as he sat back in the dim recesses of his box and scrutinised his visitor la belle nita had learnt all that paris and london could teach her  you are very beautiful nita he said  many men tell me so she answered  life has gone well with you since we met last he asked reflectively  the months have passed she replied  you have been faithful  fidelity is of the soul  he paused as though pondering over her answer a famous french comedian was holding the stage and the house rocked with laughter  you have the same apartment  she pressed the clasp of a black velvet bag which rested on the edge of the box opened it and passed him a key  it is the same  he held the key in his fingers for a moment but he had the air of a man to whom the action had no significance  you have enough money he asked  i have saved a million francs she told him i am waiting for my lord to speak of things that matter the woman in the box over therewho is she  an english spy he answered calmly  she lowered her eyes for a moment as though to conceal the sudden soft flash  an english spy she repeated my rival in espionage  you have no rival nita he replied and she is in the opposite camp  her two red lips were distorted into a pout  is it over my task she asked i am weary of paris i love it over here better i am weary of french officers of these solemn officials who come to my room like guilty schoolboys and who speak of themselves and their importance with bated breath as though their whisper would rock the world my master has enough information  more than enough he assured her you have done your work wonderfully  shall i now deal with her she continued with a slight eager movement of her head towards the opposite box  he smiled  she is harmless she and her entourage he replied some stroke of good fortune brought them word of the meeting between myself and immelan and beyond that they guessed at its significance they were at the shed to watch my arrival now with their mouths open they sit and wait for the information which they hope will drop in they are very ingenuous these anglosaxons but they are not diplomats  she turned her head and looked across the auditorium maggie was talking to a man whom nigel had just brought in and who was bending over her in obvious admiration nita with her wealth of cosmetics her overred lips stared curiously at this possible rival with her clear skin her beautiful neck and shoulders her hair dressed close to her head her air of quiet almost singular distinction  the young lady she confessed wears her clothes well for an english woman she is bien soignée but she looks a little difficult  his eyes followed the direction of hers and her object was achieved she read correctly the light that gleamed in them  i may come tonight she asked quietly  he shook his head  not again he replied  a violinist now held the stage a pole newly come to london la belle nita closed her eyes for a few minutes her sorrow seemed to throb to the minor music to which she was listening  for all my work then she said presently for the suffering and the risk there is to be nothing  is it nothing for you to be invited to live in whatsoever manner you choose he remonstrated  it is little she replied steadily there are a dozen who would do this for me who pray every day that they may do so what are all these things beside the love of my master  he looked at her a little sadly yet without any sign of real feeling to him she represented nothing more than a doll with brains from whose intelligence he had profited but of whose beauty he was weary  you know what our poet says nita he reminded her love is like the rustling of the wind in the almond trees before dawn we cannot command it it comes to us or leaves us without reason  she looked across the auditorium once more and spoke with her head turned away from her companion  there is no one in the east she said because those who write me weekly send news of my lords doings there is no one in the east because there they give the body who know nothing of the soul and so my prince is safe amongst them but herethese western women have other gifts is that she master of my life and soul  i met her this evening for the first time he replied  she laughed drearily  eyes may meet in the street without speech a glance may burn its way into the soul once i thought that i might love again because a stranger smiled at me in the bois and he had grey eyes and that look about his mouth which a woman craves for he passed on and i forgot you see my lord was still thereso this is the woman  who knows he answered  immelan came into the box a little abruptly there was a cloud upon his face which he did his best to conceal almost simultaneously a messenger from behind the scenes arrived for nita she rose to her feet and wrapped her green cloak closely around her lissom figure  in a quarter of an hour she said i have to appear again it is to be goodnight then  she raised her eyes to his and for a moment the appeal which knows no nationality shone out of their velvety depths she stood before him simply like a slave who pleads not a muscle of prince shans face moved  it is to be goodnight nita he answered calmly  her head drooped and she passed out she had the air of a flower whose petals have been bruised immelan looked after her curiously almost compassionately  it is finished then with the little one prince he enquired  it is finished was the calm reply  immelan stroked his short moustache thoughtfully  is it wise he ventured she has been faithful and assiduous she knows many things  prince shans eyes were filled with mild wonder  she has had some years of my occasional companionship he said it is surely as much as she could hope for or expect we are not like you westerners immelan he went on our women are the creatures of our will we call them or we send them away they know that and they are prepared  it seems a little brutal immelan muttered  you prefer your method his companion asked yet you practise deceit your fancy wanders and you lie about it you lose your dignity my friend no woman is worth a mans lie  immelan was leaning back in his chair gazing steadfastly across the crowded theatre  your principles he said are suited to your own womenkind la belle nita has become westernised are you sure that she accepts the situation as she would if she dwelt with you in pekin  i am her master prince shan declared calmly i have made no promises that i have not fulfilled  the promise between a man and a woman is an unspoken one immelan persisted you have not been in europe for five months all that time she has awaited you  something else has happened prince shan said deliberately  since your arrival in london  since my arrival in london since i stepped out of my ship last night  immelan was frankly incredulous  you mean lady maggie trent  certainly i have always felt that some day or other my thoughts would turn towards one of these strange western women that time has come lady maggie possesses those charms which come from the brain yet which appeal more deeply than any other to the subtle desires of the poet the man of letters and the philosopher she is very wonderful immelan i thank you for your introduction  immelan ceased to caress his moustache he leaned back in his chair and gazed at his companion for many years he and the prince had been associates yet at that moment he felt that he had not even begun to understand him  but you forget prince he said that lady maggie and her friends are in the opposite camp when our agreement is concluded and known to the world she will look upon you as an enemy  as yet prince shan answered calmly our agreement is not concluded  immelans face darkened nothing but his awe of the man with whom he sat prevented an expression of anger  but prince he expostulated apart from political considerations you cannot really imagine that anything would be possible between you and lady maggie  why not was the cool reply  lady maggie is of the english nobility immelan pointed out neither she nor her friends would be in the least likely to consider anything in the nature of a morganatic alliance  it would not be necessary prince shan declared it is in my mind to offer her marriage  immelan dropped the cigarette case which he had just drawn from his pocket he gazed at his companion in blank and unaffected astonishment  marriage he muttered you are not serious  i am entirely serious the prince insisted i can understand your amazement immelan when the idea first came into my mind i tore at it as i would at a weed but we who have studied in the west have learnt certain great truths which our own philosophers have sometimes missed all that is best of life and of death our own prophets have taught us from them we have learnt fortitude and chastity devotion to our country and singleness of purpose over here though one has also learnt something nobility is of the soul a prince of the shans must seek not for the body but for the spirit of the woman who shall be his mate if their spirits meet on equal terms then she may even share the throne of his life  immelan was speechless there was something final and convincing in his companions measured words his own protest when at last he spoke sounded paltry  but supposing it is true that she is already engaged to lord dorminster  prince shan smiled very quietly  that he said can easily be disposed of  but do you seriously believe that you would be able to induce her to return with you to pekin immelan persisted  at that moment it chanced that maggie turned her head and looked across at the two men prince shan leaned a little forward to meet her gaze his face was expressionless the lines of his mouth were calm and restful yet in his eyes there glowed for a single moment the fire of a man who looks upon the thing he covets  i seriously believe it he answered under his breath     chapter xvi   maggie leaned back in her chair with a little sigh of content the scarletcoated waiter had just removed their tea tray a pleasant breeze was rustling through the leaves of the trees under which she and prince shan were seated from the distance came the low strains of a military band everywhere on the lawns and along the paths men and women were promenading  confess that this is better than rumpelmayers or the ritz she murmured lazily  it is better he admitted it is a very wonderful place  you have nothing like it in china she asked him  it would not be possible he answered democracy there is confined to politics in other respects our class prejudices are far more rigid than yours but then i see a great change in this country since i was here as a student  you have lost your affection for it perhaps she ventured looking at him through halfclosed eyes  on the contrary he assured her my gratitude towards her was never so great as at this moment your country has given me nothing i prize so much lady maggie as my knowledge of you  she looked away from his very earnest eyes and the light retort died away upon her lips the men and women whom she watched so steadfastly seemed like puppets the flowers artificial the music unreal already she was beginning to resent the influence which he was establishing over her the art of badinage in which she was so proficient stood her in no stead words even the power of light speech had deserted her  tell me about the changes that you see she asked  perhaps he replied after a moments hesitation it is because i am an occasional visitor that differences seem so marked to me but look at the tables there that is the duke of illinton is it not at the next table the man in the strange clothes and uncomfortable hatit seems to me that i have seen him somewhere under different circumstances  maggie nodded  life is a terrible hotchpotch nowadays she admitted after the war our gentry and aristocracy who were not wealthy were taxed out of existence the profiteers and the men who had made fortunes during the war took their place it has made the country prosperous but less picturesque  you put things very clearly he said today in england is certainly the day of the shopkeepers triumph wealth is a great thing but it is great only for what it leads to i think your philosopher of the streets your new school of politicians have alike forgotten that  you have lost sympathy with england have you not prince shan maggie asked him  he turned towards her a faint but kindly smile upon his lips a light in his eyes which she did not altogether understand  lady maggie he said quietly they tell me that you are interested in the political side of my visit to this country  who tells you that she demanded what have i to do with politics  you have been gifted with great intelligence he continued and you are the confidante of your connection lord dorminster lord dorminster is one of those few englishmen who realise the ill direction of the destinies of this country you would like to help him in his present very strenuous efforts to ascertain the truth as to certain movements directed against the british empire that is so is it not  in plain words you are accusing me of being a spy  ah no he protested gently no one can be a spy in ones own country you are within your rights as a patriot in seeking to discover whatever may be useful knowledge to the english government that i fear is one reason for your kindness to me lady maggie i trust that it is not the only reason  she knew better than to make the mistake of denial after all it was an absurdly unequal contest  it is not the only reason she assured him a little tremulously  i am glad one word more upon this subject and we speak of other things please lady maggie do not stoop to be hopelessly obvious in these efforts of yours if i drop a pocketbook believe me there will be nothing in it to interest you if i speak with immelan or any other save in the secrecy of my chamber there will be nothing which it will be worth your while to overhear if lord dorminster should decide to adopt buccaneering expedients and kidnap me the attempt would probably fail and if it succeeded it would in the end profit you nothing as you say over here for your sake lady maggie i will lay the cards upon the table i am discussing with oscar immelan and indirectly with an emissary from russia a certain scheme which if carried out would certainly be harmful to this country i shall decide for or against that scheme entirely as it seems to me that it will be for the good or evil of my own country nothing will change my purpose in that in your heart you know that nothing should change it but i bring to the deliberations upon which we are engaged a new sentiment towards your country since i have known you other things being equal i shall decline the scheme for your sake lady maggie  there was a curious quivering at the corners of her mouth and a lump in her throat she was absolutely incapable of speech his grave and reasonable words seemed to fill her with a sense of importance her little efforts and schemes seemed puny almost laughable  so you see he continued after a moments pause that you have done your work you have done it very effectually you have created a strong sentiment in my mind in favour of this country a sentiment which i did not previously possess there is no other way in which you could have influenced the decision soon to be arrived at in return for what i have told you lady maggie i ask for no promise but i beg you to forget the role you played in germany not to attemptyou will not be offendedto influence events so far as i am concerned by any attempt at spying upon my actions or by treating me any other way than with your whole confidence i do not ask for any promise i have said something to you which has been on my mind now i shall ask you a favour he declared rising to his feet you will walk with me through the flower gardens yonder if there is one thing i miss in this country so much that the want of it makes me sometimes a little homesick he went on as they moved away together it is the perfume of the flowers in the morning and at night from the gardens of my summer palace next time you honour me with an hour or so of your time i shall ask you to let me bring some pictures of my favourite home in china  maggie walked dutifully by his side answering his frequent questions about flowers and shrubs listening while he told her about his white peacocks and the tame birds which were his own pets suddenly she broke into a fit of laughter she looked up into his grave face her eyes imploring him for sympathy  i feel so like a precocious child she exclaimed who has been put in her place no one has ever turned me inside out so skilfully has made me feel such an ignorant little donkey do you know i half like you for it prince shan and half detest you  he seemed suddenly to become younger to meet her upon her own ground  please do not be angry he begged please do not think that i look upon you at all as a little child you have brought something into my life for which i have searched and hoped and i am deeply grateful to you shall igo on  she caught at his wrist  please not she begged breathlessly be content with this moment  they had paused by the side of an arbour she suddenly felt the pressure of his fingers upon her hand  i shall be content he said in a low tone the passion of which seemed to throw her senses into complete turmoil only when i have what my heart desires but i will wait  they walked almost into the midst of a little crowd of acquaintances maggie was herself again immediately she chattered away with chalmers and led him off to see a wonderful yellow rose he watched her curiously when they found themselves isolated at the end of the garden path he ignored for a moment their mission  any luck lady maggie he asked  she looked up at him and to his amazement her eyes were swimming  i think that prince shan will be on our side she replied     chapter xvii   monsieur felix senn the distinguished frenchman who had just acquitted himself of the special mission which had brought him to london was a little loath to depart from the historical chamber in downing street diplomatically the interview was over the prime minister however on this occasion was courteous even affable there seemed no reason for his visitor to hurry away  you will accept i trust sir the latter begged this assurance of my extreme regret at the present unfortunate condition of affairs i am one of those who threw his hat into the air on the boulevards in august 1914 when the news came that your great country had decided to fulfil her unwritten promises and in the cause of honour had declared war against germany i have never forgotten that moment sir even in those months and years of misunderstandings which followed the signing of the treaty of peace i was one of those who pointed always to the sacrifices which great britain had made on our behalf to her glorious deeds on land and sea i have always been a friend of your country mr mervin brown that is why i think i was chosen to bring this dispatch  you are very welcome the prime minister assured him as for the purpose of your mission i assure you that i view it less seriously than you do glance with me at the position for a moment notwithstanding the era of peace which has sprung up all over the world owing to the happy influence of the league of nations france alone has decided to follow still the path of militarism your last years army estimates were staggering the number of men whom you keep out of your factories in order that they may learn a useless drill and wear an unnecessary uniform is to the economist simply scandalous look at the result compare our imports and exports with yours see the leaps and strides with which we have improved our financial position during the last ten years we have not only recovered from the after effects of the war but we have reached a state of prosperity which we never previously attained you on the other hand are still groaning with enormous taxes you carry a burden which is selfimposed and unnecessary you of all the nations refuse to recognise the fact that the government of the great countries of the world has passed into the hands of the democracy and that democracies will not tolerate war  there i join issue with you sir the frenchman replied these are the obvious and expressed views of other european countries yet month by month come rumours of the training of great masses of troops far in excess of the numbers permitted by the league of nations there is all the time a haze of secrecy over what is going on in certain parts of germany and as for russia ostensibly the freest country in the world tsarism in its worst days never imposed such despotic restrictions concerning the coming and going of foreigners in one particular district at any rate  the russian government have certainly given us cause for complaint in that direction mr mervin brown admitted strong representations are being made to them at the present moment on the other hand the reason for their attitude is easily enough understood in the days when russia lay exhausted foreigners took too much advantage of her attained far too close a grip upon her great natural resources russia has determined that what she has left she will keep to herself the attitude is reasonable although i am free to admit that she is carrying her legislation against foreigners too far  what about the number of men she has under arms every year monsieur senn enquired  russia has always a possible danger to fear from china the new colossus of asia the prime minister pointed out even russia herself has not made such strides within the last fifteen years as china the secession of the asiatic countries from the league of nations demanded certain precautions which russia is justified in taking  the frenchman had risen to his feet but he still lingered a tall man of commanding presence with olive complexion deep brown eyes and black hair lightly streaked with grey monsieur felix senn had been a great figure in the war of 19141918 and had retained since a commanding position in french politics it had often been said that nothing but his great friendship for england had prevented his gaining the highest honours his present mission therefore which was practically to end the alliance between the two countries was a peculiarly painful one to him  i must tell you before we part mr mervin brown he said gravely that neither i nor many of my fellow countrymen share your optimism you seem to have inherited the timeworn theory that the war of 1914 was entirely provoked by the junker class of germans that is not true it was a peoples war and the people have never forgotten what they were pleased to consider the harsh terms of the treaty of peace then as regards russia have you ever considered that russia financially and politically is more than half german when germany lost the war she had one great consolationshe acquired russia you have compared the economic condition of france today with that of your country sir i admit your commercial supremacy but let me tell you this i would not for the greatest boon the gods could offer me see france in the same helpless state as england is in today  the prime minister rose also to his feet he wore an air of offended dignity  monsieur senn he declared the spirit of militarism is in the blood of your country you cannot rid yourself of it in one generation or two but believe me no peoples government at any time in the future whether it be english russian german or american will ever dare to suggest or even to dream of a war of aggression or revenge if we are comparatively unprotected it is because we need no protection we hear the footfall of your marching millions and we thank god that that sound is represented in our country by the roar of machinery and the blaze of furnaces  the frenchman bowed and accepted the hand which the prime minister offered him  i present to you once more sir he said the compliments and infinite regrets of monsieur le président  a chapter of english history ended with the quiet passing of monsieur senn into the sunlit street the latter entered his waiting automobile and drove at once to the french embassy the ambassador listened in silence to his report  what about the press was his only question  monsieur le président insists upon the truth being known the emissary announced france has pledged her word against secret treaties besides the honour of france must never afterwards be called in question  the ambassador sighed he was new to his present post but he had grown grey in the service of his country  it is the end of a onesided arrangement he declared it is incredible that these people do not realise that it is against their own countryagainst themselvesthat this slowly fermenting hatred is being brewed the racial enmity between germany and france is nothing compared with the hate of antagonistic kinship between germany and england however france is the gainer by todays event we have only our own frontiers to watch  monsieur felix senn wandered on to the st philips club where he found his old friend prince karschoff talking in a corner of the smoking room with nigel they were both of them prepared for the news which he presently communicated to them karschoff was bitter nigel silent  well said carlyle that history is philosophy teaching by examples the former expounded how the historian of the future will revel in this epoch what treatises he will write what parallels he will draw see him point to the days when the aristocracy ruled england and england fought and flourished then to the epoch when the bourgeoisie took their place and with a mighty effort met a great emergency and flourished and finally in sympathy with the great european upheaval in sympathy with the great natural law of change labour ousts both singleeyed labour and down goes england crumbling into the dustlet us lunch my friends the cuisine is still good here  nigel excused himself  i am engaged he said we may meet afterwards  something tells me my dear nigel karschoff declared that you are bent on frivolity  if to lunch with a woman is frivolous i plead guilty nigel replied  karschoffs face was suddenly grave he seemed on the point of saying something but checked himself and turned away with a little shrug of the shoulders  each one to his taste he murmured for my aperitif a dash of absinthe in my cocktail for dorminster here the lure of a womans smile perhaps he gains who knows     chapter xviii   nigel waited for his luncheon companion in the crowded vestibule of londons most famous club restaurant he was to a certain extent out of the picture among the crowd of this new generation of pleasure seekers on the faces of whom opulence and acquisitiveness had already laid its branding hand the mecca alike of musical comedy and the stock exchange the place however still preserved a curious attraction for the foreign element in london so that when at last naida appeared she was exchanging courtesies with an italian duchess on one side and a celebrated russian dancer on the other nigel led her at once to the table which he had selected in the balcony  i have obeyed your wishes to the letter he said and i think that you are right up here we are entirely alone and as you see they have had the sense to place the tables a long way apart am i to blame i wonder for asking you to do so unconventional a thing as to lunch here again alone with me  she drew off her gloves and smiled across the table at him her plain tailormade gown with its high collar was the last word in elegance the simplicity of her french hat was to prove the despair of a wellknown modiste seated downstairs who made a sketch of it on the menu and tried in vain to copy it even to nigels exacting taste she was flawless  is it unconventional she asked carelessly i do not study those things i lunch or dine with a party generally because it happens so i lunch alone with you because it pleases me  and for this material side of our entertainment he enquired smiling as he handed her the menu card  a grapefruit a quail with white grapes and some asparagus she replied promptly you see in one respect i am an easy companion i know exactly what i want a mixed vermouth if you like yes and now tell me your news  there is news he announced which the whole world will know of before many hours are past france has broken her pact with england  it is my opinion she said deliberately that france has been very patient with you  and mine he acknowledged we have now to see what will become of a fat and prosperous country with a semiobsolete fleet and a comic opera army  must we talk of serious things she asked softly i am weary of the clanking wheels of life  he sighed  and yet for you he said they are not grinding out the fate of your country  nevertheless i too hear them all the time she rejoined and i hate them they make one lose ones sense of proportion after all it is our own individual and internal life which counts i can understand nero fiddling while rome burned if he really had no power to call up fire engines  are you an individualist he asked  not fundamentally she replied but i am caught up in the throes of a great reaction i have been studying events which it is quite true may change the destinies of the world so intently that i have almost forgotten that after all the greatest thing in the world my world is the happiness or illcontent of naida karetsky it is really of more importance to me today that my quail should be cooked as i like it than that england has let go her last rope  you are not an englishwoman he reminded her  that is of minor importance we are all so much immersed in great affairs just now that we forget it is the small ones that count i want my luncheon to be perfect i want you to seem as nice to me as i have fancied you and i want you to chase completely away the idea that you are cultivating my acquaintance for interested motives  that i can assure you from the bottom of my heart is not the case he replied whatever other interests i may feel in you he added after a moments hesitation my first and foremost is a personal one  she looked at him with gratitude in her eyes for his understanding  a woman in my position she complained is out of place a man ought to come over and study your deservings or your undeservings and pore over the problem of the future of europe i am a woman and i am not big enough i am too physical i have forgotten how to enjoy myself and i love pleasure now am i a revelation to you  you have always been that he told her you are so truthful yourself he went on boldly that i shall run the risk of saying the most banal thing in the world just because it happens to be the truth i have felt for you since our first meeting what i have felt for no other woman in the world  i like that and i am glad you said it she declared lightly enough although her lips quivered for a moment and they have put exactly the right quantity of maraschino in my grapefruit i feel that i am on the way to happiness i am going to enjoy my luncheontell me about maggie  i saw her yesterday he answered we have arranged for her to come and live at belgrave square after all  my terrible altruism once more she sighed i had meant not to speak another serious word and yet i must maggie is very clever amazingly clever i sometimes think but if she had the brains of all of her sex rolled into one she would still be facing now an impossible situation  just what do you mean he asked cautiously  maggie seems determined to measure her wits with those of prince shan she said believe me that is hopeless  she looked up at him and laughed softly  oh my dear friend she went on that wooden expression is wonderful you do not quite know where i stand exceptmay i flatter myselfas regards your personal feelings for me am i for immelan and his schemes or for your own foolish country you do not know so you make for yourself a face of wood  where do you stand he asked bluntly  sufficiently devoted to your interests to beg you this she replied do not let your little cousin think that she can deal with a man like prince shan there can be only one end to that  nigel moved a little uneasily in his place  prince shan is only an ordinary human being after all he protested  that is just where you are mistaken she declared prince shan is one of the most extraordinary human beings who ever lived he is one of the most farseeing men in the world and he is absolutely the most powerful  but china nigel began  his power extends far beyond china she interrupted and there is no brain in the world to match his today  if he were a god wielding thunderbolts nigel observed he could scarcely do much harm to maggie here in london  there was an artist once she said reflectively who drew a caricature of prince shan and sent it to the principal comic paper in america it was such a success that a little time later on he followed it up with another which included a line of prince shans ancestors within a months time the artist was found murdered prince shan was in china at the time  are you suggesting that the artist was murdered through prince shans contrivance  am i a fool she answered do you not know that to speak disrespectfully of the ancestors of a chinaman is unforgivable to all appearances prince shan never moved from his wonderful palace in pekin many thousands of miles away yet he lifted his little finger and the man died  isnt this a little melodramatic nigel murmured  melodrama is often nearer the truth than people think she said shall i give you another instance i know of several  one more then  prince shan was in paris two years ago incognito she continued there was at the time a small but very fashionable restaurant in the bois close to the pré catelan he presented himself one night there for dinner accompanied i believe by la belle nita the chinese dancer who is in london today as you know there is little in prince shans appearance to denote the oriental but for some reason or other the proprietor refused him a table prince shan made no scene he left and went elsewhere three nights later the café was burnt to the ground and the proprietor was ruined  anything else nigel asked  only one thing more she replied i have known him slightly for years in asia he ranks to all men as little less than a god his palaces are filled with priceless treasures he has the finest collection of jewels in the world his wealth is simply inexhaustible his appearance you appreciate yet i have never seen him look at a woman as he looked at your cousin the first time he met her i was at the ritz with my father and i watched i know you think that i am being foolish i am not i am a person with a very great deal of common sense and i tell you that prince shan has never desired a thing in life to which he has not helped himself maggie is a clever child but she cannot toss knives with a conjuror  nigel was impressed and a little worried  it seems absurd to think that anything could happen to maggie here in london he said after  he paused abruptly naida smiled at him  after her escape from germany i suppose you were going to say you see i know all about it there was no prince shan in berlin  he shrugged his shoulders slightly  well he admitted i dont quite bring myself to believe in your terrible ogre so i shall not worry tell me what news you have from russia  political  any news  she smiled  i notice she said that english people are changing their attitude towards my country a few years ago she seemed negligible to them now they are beginning to haveshall i call them fears even my kind host i think would like to know what is in paul matinskys heart as he hears the friends of oscar immelan plead their cause  i admit it he told her frankly i will go farther i would give a great deal to know what is in your own mind today concerning us and our destiny but these things are not for the moment it was not to discuss or even to think of them that i asked you here today  why did you invite me then she asked smiling  because i wanted the pleasure of having you opposite me he repliedbecause i wanted to know you better  and are you progressing  indifferently well he acknowledged i seem to gain a little and slide back again you are not an easy person to know well  nothing that is worth having is easy she answered and i can assure you when my friendship is once gained it is a rare and steadfast thing  and your affection he ventured  her eyes rested upon his for a moment and then suddenly drooped a little tinge of colour stole into her cheeks for a moment she seemed to have lost her admirable poise  that is not easily disturbed she told him quietly i think that i must have an unfortunate temperament there are so few people for whom i really care  he took his courage into both hands  i have heard it rumoured he said that matinsky is the only man who has ever touched your heart  she shook her head  that is not the truth paul matinsky cares for me in his strange way and he has a curiously exaggerated appreciation of my brain there have been times she went on after a moments hesitation when i myself have been disturbed by fancies concerning him but those times have passed  i am glad he said quietly  his fingers straying across the tablecloth met hers she did not withdraw them he clasped her hand and it remained for a moment passive in his then she withdrew it and leaned back in her chair  is that meant to introduce a more intimate note into our conversation she asked with a slight wrinkling of the forehead and the beginnings of a smile upon her lips  if i dared i would answer yes he assured her  they tell me she continued pensively that englishmen more than any other men in the world have the flair for saying convincingly the things which they do not mean  in my case that would not be true he answered my trouble is that i dare not say one half of what i feel  she looked across the table at him and nigel suddenly felt a great weight of depression lifted from his heart he forgot all about his countrys peril life and its possibilities seemed somehow all different he was carried away by a rare wave of emotion  naida he whispered  yes  her eyes were soft and expectant something of the gravity had gone from her face she was like a girl suddenly young with new thoughts  you know what i am going to say to you  do not say it yet please she begged somehow it seems to me that the time has not come though the thought of what may be in your heart is wonderful i want to dream about it first she went on i want to think  he laughed a strange sound almost to his own ears for nigel since his uncles death had tasted the very depths of depression  i obey he agreed it is well to dally with the great things meanwhile they grow  she smiled across at him  i hope that they may she answered and you will ask me to lunch again  lunch or dine or walk or motorwhatever you will he promised  she reflected for a moment and then laughed she was drawing on her gloves now and nigel was paying the bill  there are some people who will not like this she said  and one he declared for whom it is going to make life a paradise  they passed out into the street and strolled leisurely westwards as they crossed trafalgar square a stream of newsboys from the strand were spreading in all directions nigel and his companion seemed suddenly surrounded by placards all with the same headlines they paused to read                triumph of the chancellor           huge reduction of the national debt            total abolition of the income tax  they walked on naida said nothing although she shook her head a little sorrowfully nigel glanced across the square and down towards westminster  they will shout themselves hoarse there this afternoon he groaned  for the first time she betrayed her knowledge of coming events  it is amazing she whispered for the writing on the wall is already there     chapter xix   seated in one of the first tier boxes at the albert hall in the gorgeous but obsolete uniform of a staff officer in the russian imperial forces prince karschoff with nigel on one side and maggie on the other gazed with keen interest at the brilliant scene below and around the greatest city the world has ever known seemed in those days to have entered upon an orgy of extravagance unprecedented in history every box and every yard of dancing space on the floor beneath was crowded with men and women in wonderful fancy costumes the women bedecked with jewels which eager merchants had brought together from every market of the world even the men in their silks and velvets and ruffles carrying out the dominant note of wealth it was a ball given for charity and under royal patronage  all our friends seem to be here tonight the prince remarked glancing around i saw naida with her father and the eternal oscar immelan chalmers is here with an exceedingly gay party and yonder sits his imperial highness looking very much the barbaric princeby the by he added glancing towards maggie i thought that he was not coming  maggie who seemed a little tired nodded quietly it was a week or ten days later and an early season was now in full swing  he told me that he was not coming she said i suppose the temptation to wear that gorgeous raiment was too much for him  apropos of that there is one curious thing to be noted here with regard to clothes the prince continued amongst the men you find venetian doges chancellors gallants of every age but scarcely a single uniform in a way this seems typical of the passing of the militarism of your country you are beginning to remind me of venice in the middle ages there is a new type of brain dominant here fat instead of muscle a citizen aristocracy instead of the lean cleareyed athletic type  maggie moved in her place a little irritably  i am tired of warnings she declared i wish some one could do something  it is impossible the prince pronounced solemnly napoleon earned for himself a greater claim to immortality when he christened the english a nation of shopkeepers than when he won the battle of austerlitz if the englishman of today saw his material prosperity slipping away from him then indeed he would be nervous and restless ready to lean towards every wind that blew to listen to every disquieting rumour today his bank balance is prodigious and alls well with the worldhow wonderfully prince shan lives up to his part tonight  they looked across towards the opposite box whose single occupant in the bright green robes of a mandarin sat looking down upon the gay throng with an absolutely immovable expression there was something almost regal about his air of detachment his solitude amidst such a gay scene  there is one of the strangest and most consistent figures in history karschoff who was in a talkative frame of mind went on reflectively i honestly believe that prince shan considers himself to be of celestial descent to carry in his person the honour of countless generations of manchus he has no intimates even immelan usually has to seek an audience what his pleasures may be who knowsbecause everything that happens with him happens behind closed walls tonight the door of his box is guarded as though he were more than royalty no one is allowed to enter unless he has special permission  there is some one entering now maggie pointed out for the first time watch  la belle nita stood for a moment in the front of the box she was dressed in the gala costume of a chinese lady in a cherrycoloured robe with wide sleeves her hair with its many jewelled ornaments like a black pool of night her face ghastly white with a superabundance of powder prince shan turned his head slightly towards her and though no muscle of his face moved it was obvious that her coming was unwelcome she began to talk he listened with the face of a sphinx presently she drew back into the shadows of the box she had thrown herself into a chair and her face was hidden  la belle nita has made a mistake maggie observed his serene highness evidently had no wish to be disturbed  karschoffs eyes rested upon the figure in green silk and they were filled with an unwilling admiration  that man is magnificent he declared watch his face now that he is speaking not a muscle moves not a flash in his eyes yet one has the fancy that he is saying terrible things  it was obvious a moment later that la belle nita had left the box maggie sprang up her colour was a little heightened there was a rare nervousness in her tone  let us walk around and find some of the others she suggested turning to nigel i want to dance  they all three passed out and mingled with the dancers maggie put on her mask and deliberately glided into the crowd as though with the intention of losing herself it was not until she was underneath prince shans box and out of sight of its occupant that she paused her thoughts were in a turmoil his presence there after his deliberate assurance to her that he had no intention of coming his calm and unnoticing regard of her and every one else seemed to confirm in every way the wave of pessimism which she as well as nigel was experiencing she had passed immelan in the entrance and there was something ominously disturbing in his cool triumphant smile she pictured to herself the agreement signed some nameless terror already launched she remembered that nigel had complained of naidas inaccessibility during the last few days she herself had been surprised at prince shans apparent withdrawal temporary though it might be from the peculiar but impressive position which he had taken up with regard to her  she stood back against the wall in a dark corner striving to collect her thoughts thankful for the brief respite from conversation a man in the costume of a monk who had followed her across the room touched her on the shoulder he spoke in a quiet unfamiliar voice with a foreign accent  you are lady maggie trent  yes  will you please go to box number fourteen on the second tier there is some one there who waits for you  who is it she asked  the monk had glided away maggie after a few minutes reflection slipped out into the corridor mounted one flight of stairs and passed along the semicircular balcony the door of box number fourteen was ajar she pushed it gently open and glanced in seated so as to be out of sight of the whole house was la belle nita for a moment the two looked at each other then the chinese girl sprang to her feet made a quaint little bow and gliding around closed the door behind her visitor  sit down please she invited i will tell you things you may like to hear  a sudden thought flashed into maggies mind she began to see light she obeyed at once the two women sat well back and out of sight of the house la belle nita held the handle of the door in her hand while she spoke as though to prevent any one entering  i have an enemy who was once a friend she said and i wish to do him evil he is not only my enemy but he is yours he is the enemy of all you english people because it is a great disaster which he plans to bring upon you  you speak of prince shan maggie exclaimed  even at the mention of his name the girl shook she looked around as though fearing the shadows she rattled the door to make sure that it was closed  for him whom you call prince shan i have worked many years first of all in paris now here i was content with small reward that reward he now takes from me it is my wish to betray him  why do you send for me maggie asked  because you have been an english spy was the quiet reply it may surprise you that i know that but i do know i have been a spy for prince shan in paris you were a spy for england in berlin you were a spy for your countrys sake i was a spy for love now i betray for hate  please go on  prince shan came this time to europe with two schemes in his mind the girl continued one concerned france that one he has discarded through me he learned of the military strength of france her secret resources of her tireless watch upon the rhine so he listens to immelan and immelan and he together oh english lady they have made a wonderful plan  are you going to tell me what it is maggie asked her eyes bright with excitement  i cannot tell you because i do not know was the unwilling admission but i will make it so that you can discover for yourself a few hours ago the plan was submitted to prince shan it lies in the third drawer of an ebony cabinet in the room on the lefthand side of the hall after you have entered his house in curzon street  but no one can enter it maggie exclaimed the place is like a fort no stranger may pass the threshold even the prince has told me himself that he receives no visitors  la belle nita smiled from a pocket somewhere within the folds of her flowing gown she produced two small keys  listen she said the house in curzon street has been called the house of silence there are many servants there but they come only from beneath and when they are summoned there is what no other person has ever possessedthe key of the front door there is also the key of the cabinet prince shan has ordered his automobile for two oclock it is now barely midnight  the keys lay in the palm of maggies hand her heart had begun to beat quickly somehow or other she was conscious of a thrill of excitement which she had never before experienced even when she had sat back in her corner of the railway carriage watching for the frontier knowing that the wires were busy with her name and that men who knew no mercy were on her track  if the servants should hear me she faltered  you say only i await the prince la belle nita murmured that key never leaves his own person save for one in great favour they will believe that he gave it to you you will be unmolested  a queer sensation suddenly assailed maggie she felt extraordinarily primitive ridiculously feminine she looked at the girl opposite to her the girl whose body was draped in perfumed silks whose face was thick with rice powder whose eyes were sad she felt no pity what feeling she had she did not care to analyse  is this your key she asked  it was mine once but its use has been forbidden to me the girl replied prince shan is a changed man something has come into his life of which i know nothing but as it has come so must i go i give you your chance lady but already i weaken go quickly if you go at all please leave me for i am very unhappy  maggie stole quietly out and made her way through the jostling throng back to her own box which for the moment was empty she slipped on her cloak and from the hidden spaces where she stood she looked across the auditorium the silent figure in green silk robes was still seated in his place his eyes following the movements of the dancers his head a little thrown back a slight weariness in his face he was still alone he still had the air of being alone because it was his desire once he looked up towards the box in which she was and maggie although she knew she was invisible shrank back against the wall she set her teeth hard and looked back through the slightly misty space an unfamiliar feeling for a moment almost choked her she waited until she had vanquished it then adjusted her mask and left the box     chapter xx   from the moment when the taxicab drove away and left her in the deserted street maggie was conscious of a strange sense of suppressed excitement something more poignant and mysterious even than the circumstances of her adventure might account for it was exciting enough in its way to play the part of a marauding thief to find herself unexpectedly face to face with a possible solution of the great problem of prince shans intentions but beneath all this there was another feeling more entirely metaphysical which in a sense steadied her nerves because it filled her with a strange impression that she had lost her own identity that she was playing somebody elses part in a novel and thrilling drama  the street was empty when she inserted the little key in the front door there was not a soul there to see her step in as it swung open and then softly noiselessly but without any conscious effort of hers closed again behind her she held her breath and looked around  the hall was round painted white and dimly lit by an overhead electric globe in the centre was a huge green vase filled with great branches of some sort of blossoms not a picture hung upon the walls nor was there any hall stand chest closet for coats or hats or any of the usual furbishings of such a place there were three rugs upon the polished floor and nothing else except a yawning stairway and closed doors whatever servants might be in attendance were evidently in a distant part of the building not a sound was to be heard still without any lack of courage but oppressed with that curious sense of unreality she turned almost automatically towards the door on the left and opened it again it closed behind her noiselessly she realised that she was in one of the principal reception rooms of the house dimly lit as the hall from a domeshaped globe set into the ceiling she moved a yard or two across the threshold and stood looking about her here again there was an almost singular absence of furniture the walls were hung with applegreen silk richly embroidered there were some rugs upon the polished floor a few quaintly carved chairs set with their backs against the wall and opposite to her the ebony cabinet of which la belle nita had spoken she moved towards it somehow or other she found herself with the other key in her hand stooping down she counted the drawersone two threefitted in the key turned it and realised with a little start the presence in the drawer of a roll of parchment tied around with tape and sealed with a black seal she laid her hand upon it but even at that moment she felt a shiver pass through her body there had been no sound in the room which she could have sworn had been empty when she entered it yet she had now a conviction that she was not alone she turned slowly around her lips parted breathing quickly standing in the middle of the room a grim commanding figure in his flowing green robes the dim light flashing upon the great diamonds in his belt stood prince shan  to maggie at that moment came a great throbbing in her ears a sense of remoteness from this terrible happening followed by an intense and vital consciousness of danger the man who had brought new things into her life the polished gentleman of the world with his fascinating brain and gentle courtesy had gone it was prince shan of china who stood there she felt the chill of his contempt and disapproval in her heart she had forfeited her high estate she was a convicted thiefan adventuress  she gripped at the side of the cabinet her poise had gone she had the air of a trapped animal  you she exclaimed how did you get here  he answered her without change of expression a sense of crisis seemed to have made his tone more level his face stony  it is my house he said i do not often leave it i sat in my sleeping chamber behindhe pointed to the silken curtains through which he had passedi heard your entrance and guessed with pain and regret at your mission  but a quarter of an hour ago you were at the ball  you are mistaken he replied i do not attend such gatherings i had given you my word that i should not be there  but i saw you she persisted in that same costume  surely not he dissented the person whom you saw was a gentleman from my suite who wore the dress of an inferior mandarin he is sometimes supposed to resemble me i should have believed that your apprehension of such things would have informed you that no prince of my line would wear the garments of his order for a public show  her fingers had left the drawer now she stood upright pale and desperate  that woman of your country thenla belle nitadid she lie to me  how can i tell he answered coldly because i do not know what she said  maggie made an effort to test her position  i came here as a thief she confessed i am detected what are your intentions  he moved very slowly a little closer to her maggie felt her sense of excitement grow  you came here as a thief he repeated as a spy why did you not ask me for the information you desired  because you would not have told me she replied at least you would not have told me the truth  for a price he said the truth would have been yours for the asking for a different price it is yours now  again without noticeable movement he seemed to have drawn nearer the edge of that cool ebony cabinet seemed to be burning her fingers try however hard she could not frame the question which had risen to her lips  the price he continued is youyourself a few hours ago it was your love i craved for now it is yourself  he was so near to her now that she faced the steady radiance of his wonderful eyes so near that she could trace the faint lines about his mouth the strong stern immobility of his perfectly shaped olivetinted features  you are too wonderful he went on to remain a daughter of the crude west i want to take you back with me to the land where life still moves to poetry to the land where one can live in a world unknown by these struggling hordes you shall live in a palace where the perfume of flowers lingers always with the sound of running water in your ears a palace from which all sordid things and all manner of ugliness are banished because we alone have found the key to the garden of happiness  he raised his hand and it seemed as though unseen eyes watched them from every quarter the silken curtains through which he had issued were drawn back by invisible hands and the inner apartment was disclosed its faint illumination was obscured with purple shades there was a high lacquer bedstead with little ivory ladders on either side a bedstead hung with silks of black and purple and mauve there was a huge couch a shrine opposite the bed in which was a kneeling figure of black marble a faint odour as though from thousandyearold sachets very faint indeed and yet with its mead of intoxication seemed to steal out from the room which had borrowed from its curious hangings its marvellous adornments its strangely attuned atmosphere all the mysticism of a fabled world  you have come he said will you stay the inertia seemed suddenly to leave her limbs she threw up her head as though gasping for air escaped somehow or other from the thrall of his eyes and passed across the smooth floor with flying footsteps her fingers seized the handle of the door and turned it only to find it held by some invisible fastening she shook it passionately there was not even sound she turned back once more prince shan had only slightly changed his position he stood upon the threshold of the inner room and his arms were outstretched in invitation  am i a prisoner she sobbed  you came of your own free will he replied you will stay for my pleasure and for the joy of my being as for these things he went on moving slowly to the cabinet picking up the pile of papers and throwing them on one side contemptuously these are only ones amusements i pass my lighter hours with them they interest me in the same manner as a chess problem we do not care we in the mighty east which of you holds your head highest this side of suez all you western nations are to us a peck of dust outside our palace gates listen dear one we can leave if you will tonight and top the clouds before sunrise and i promise you this he went on when you pass from the greyness of these sordid lands into the everlasting sunshine of the east you will not care any longer about these people who go about the world on all fours day by day you will know what life and love mean you will find the cloying weight of material things pass from your brain and body and the joy of holy and wonderful living take their place  her whole being was in a turmoil she drew nearer to the papers upon the table she was now within a yard of prince shan himself he made no effort to intercept her no movement of any sort to stop her only his eyes never left her face and she felt a madness which seemed to be choking the life out of her a pounding of her heart against her ribs a strange and wonderful joy a joy in which there was no fear a joy of new things and new hopes with the papers for which she had come only a few yards away she forgot them she turned her head slowly his arms seemed to steal out from those long silken sleeves she suddenly felt herself held in a wonderful embrace  dear lady of all my desires he whispered in her ear you shall make me happy and find the secret of happiness yourself in giving in suffering in love  for a long and wonderful moment she lay in his arms she felt the soft burning of his kisses the call of the room with its intoxicating yet strangely ascetic perfume the room to which all the time he seemed to be gently leading her and then a flood of strange alien recollections and realisations seemed to bring her from a better place back to a worsethe sound of a passing taxicab the distant booming of big ben sounds of the world outside the actual daybyday world with its daybyday code of morals the world in which she lived and her friends and all that had made life for her she drew away and he watched the change in her  i want to go she cried let me go  you are no prisoner he assured her sadly  he clapped his hands she had reached the door by now and found the handle yield to her fingers outside in the hall the front door stood open and a heavy rain was beating in on the white flags she looked around she was in her own atmosphere here their eyes met and his were very sorrowful  my servants are assembling he said you will find a car at your service  even then she hesitated there was a strange return of the wonderful emotion of a few minutes ago she hoped almost painfully that he would call instead he lifted the silk hangings and passed out of sight somehow or other she made her way down the hall a butler stood upon the steps another servant was holding open the door of a limousine just drawn up she had no distinct recollection of giving any address she simply threw herself back amongst the cushions it was not until they were in piccadilly that she suddenly remembered that she had left upon the table the papers he had scornfully offered her then she began to laugh     chapter xxi   it chanced that the box was empty when maggie with flying footsteps hastened down the corridor and pushed open the door she sank into a chair her knees trembling her senses still dazed deliberately although with hot and trembling fingers she folded over and tore into small pieces a programme of the dances which she had picked up from an adjoining chair the action insignificant though it was seemed to bring her back into touch with the real and actual world the world of music and wild gayety of swiftly moving feet of laughter and languorous voices for a brief space of time she had escaped she had wandered a little way into an unknown country a country from whose thrilling dangers she had emerged with a curious feeling that life would never be altogether the same again she glanced at the clock at the back of the box she had been absent from the hall altogether only about an hour and twenty minutes there was still at least an hour before it would be possible for her to plead weariness and escape and opposite in the shadows of the distant box the mock prince shan seemed always to be gazing at her with that cryptic smile upon his lips  presently the door was stealthily opened a face as pale as death with black eyes like pieces of coal was framed for a moment in the shadowed slit a little waft of familiar perfume stole in la belle nita her flaming lips widely parted as soon as she recognised the sole occupant of the box crept through the opening and closed the door again  you are here she exclaimed incredulously your courage failed you you did not go  i have been and returned maggie answered now tell me what i have done that you should have plotted this thing against me  the girl sat on the edge of a chair and for a moment hummed the refrain of a sad chant as she rocked slowly backwards and forwards  what have you done the rose asked the butterfly what have you done the mimosa blossom asked the little blue bird whose wings fluttered amongst her leaves you have taken love from me love which is the blossom of life  it sounds very picturesque maggie said coldly but i do not follow your allegory what i want to know is why you lied to me why you sent me to that house to meet prince shan  how did i lie to you nita demanded the papers you sought were there were they not yours for the asking or was the price too great  the papers were there certainly maggie acquiesced but you knew very well  she stopped short slowly the oriental idea of it all was beginning to frame itself in her mind she dimly understood the bewilderment in the others face  the papers were there and he the most wonderful of all men was there nita murmured yet you leave him while the night is yet young you return here without them  maggie rose from her chair moved to the side table and poured herself out a glass of wine which she drank hastily anything to escape from the scornful wonder of those questioning eyes  i did not go there she said to make bargains with prince shan i believed as you wished me to believe that he was here in that box i believed that i should have found the house empty should have found what i wanted and have escaped with it why did you do this thing why did you send me on that errand when you knew that prince shan was there  it was my desire that he should know that you are no different from other women was the calm reply i was a spy for him you are a spyagainst him  it was a deliberate plot then maggie exclaimed trying to feel the anger which she imparted to her tone  la belle nita suddenly laughed softly and like a bird  you very very foolish englishwoman she said a hand leaned down from heaven and you liked better to stay where you were but i am glad  and why  because i have been his slave the girl continued at odd strange moments he has shown me a little love he has let me creep into a small corner of his heart now i am cast out and there is no more life for me because there is no more love and there is no more love because having felt his no other can come after here have i sat with all the tortures of hell burning in my blood because i knew that you and he were there alone because i was never sure that after all i was not doing my lords will and now i know that i suffered in vain you did not understand  maggie looked across at her visitor reflectively she was beginning to regain her poise  listen she said did you seriously expect me to accept prince shan as a lover  the girls eyes were round with wonder  it would be your great good fortune she murmured if he should offer you so wonderful a thing  maggie laughedpersisted in her laugh although it sounded a little hard and the mirth a little forced  i cannot reason with you she declared because you would not understand if you love him so much why not go back to him you will find him quite alone i dare say you know the secrets of his lockless doors and hordes of unseen servants  la belle nita rose to her feet about her lips there flickered the faintest smile  young english lady she said i shall not go because i am shut for ever out of his heart but listen would you have me go  for a moment maggies poise was gone again a strange uncertainty was once more upon her she was terrified at her own feelings the smile on the others lips deepened and then passed away  ah she murmured as with a little bow she turned towards the door you are not all snow and ice then there is something of the woman in you he must have known that i am better content  alone in the box maggie was confronted once more with spectres she felt all the fear and the sweetness of this new awakening the old dangers and problems the danger of life and death the problem of her wellordered days fell away from her as trifles there was wilder music in the world than any to which she had yet listenedmusic which seemed to be awakening vibrant melodies in her terrified heart the curtain which hung about the forbidden world had been suddenly lifted little shivers of fear convulsed her her standards were confused her whole sense of values disturbed her primal virginity left to itself because it had never needed a guard had suddenly become a questioning thing she sat there face to face with this new phase in her life she was not even conscious of the abrupt pause in the music the agitated murmur of voices the sudden cessation of that rhythmical sweep of footsteps on the floor below  the door of the box was once more opened naida attired as a lady of the russian court entered followed by nigel both were obviously disturbed nigel who was in ordinary evening dress carrying his discarded mask in his hand was paler than usual and exceedingly grave naidas dark eyes too seemed filled with a sense of awesome things almost at the same moment maggie realised for the first time that the music had ceased that there was a hush outside curiously perceptible almost audible  what has happened she asked breathlessly  nigel had poured out a glass of wine and was holding it to naidas lips  something very terrible he said quietly prince shan was murdered in his box there a few minutes ago  maggie half rose to her feet the walls seemed spinning round then she looked across the great empty space the still figure in the applegreen coat had disappeared  prince shan was murdered in that box she repeated a few minutes ago  yes nigel assented gravely he seems to have feared something of the sort for he had two servants on guard outside and announced that he was not receiving visitors tonight no one knows any particulars but a number of people in the auditorium saw him fall sideways from his chair when he was picked up there was a small dagger through his heart  through prince shans heart maggie persisted wildly  yes  suddenly she began to laugh it was a strange hysterical ebullition of feeling frankly horrifying naida gazed at her with distended eyes  prince shan has never been here maggie explained brokenly he has never left his house in curzon street he is there now  nigel shook his head  what is the matter with you maggie he demanded every one has seen prince shan here you spoke of him yourself he was in the box exactly opposite  she shook her head  that was one of his suite she cried i know i tell you i know she went on her voice rising a little prince shan is safe in his house in curzon street  how can you possibly know this maggie naida intervened eagerly  because i left him there half an hour ago was the tremulous reply     chapter xxii   there is in the anglosaxon temperament an almost feverish desire to break away from any condition of strain a sort of shamefaced impulse to discard emotionalism the strange hush which had lent a queer sensation of unreality to all that was passing in the great building was without any warning brought to an end whispers swelled into speech and speech into almost a roar of voices then the music struck up although at first there were few who cared to dance there were many who like maggie and her companions silently left their places and hurried homewards  in the limousine scarcely a word was spoken maggie leaned back in her seat her face dazed and expressionless opposite to her nigel sat with set grim face looking with fixed stare out of the window at the deserted streets of the three naida seemed more on the point of giving way to emotion they had passed hyde park corner however before a word was spoken then it was she who broke the silence  where do we go to first she demanded  to the milan court nigel replied  you are taking me home first then  yes  she was silent for a moment then she leaned forward and touched the window  pull that down please she directed i am stifling  he obeyed and the rush of cold wet air had a curiously quietening effect upon the nerves of all of them raindrops hung from the leaves of the lime trees and still glittered upon the windowpane on the way towards the river the masses of cloud were tinged with purple and faintly burning stars shone out of unexpectedly clear patches of sky the night of storm was over but the wind dying away before the dawn seemed to bring with it all the sweetness of the cleansed places to be redolent even of the budding trees and shrubsthe lilac bushes drooping with their weight of moisture and the pink and white chestnut blossoms dashed to pieces by the rain but yielding up their lives with sweetness the streets in that single hour between the hurrying homewards of the belated reveller and the stolid tramp of the early worker were curiously empty and seemed to gain in their loneliness a new dignity trafalgar square with the national gallery in the background became almost classical whitehall the passageway for heroes  what does it all mean naida asked almost pathetically  it was maggie who answered her tone was lifeless but her manner almost composed  it means that the attempt to assassinate prince shan has failed she said prince shan told me himself that he had no intention of going to the ball he kept his word the man who was murdered was one of his suite  but how do you know this naida persisted  you heard what i told you in the box was the quiet reply i shall explainas much as i can explainto nigel when we get home he can tell you everything later on today at lunchtime if you like  it has been one of the strangest nights i ever remember naida declared after a brief pause oscar immelan who was dining with us arrived half an hour late i have never seen him in such a condition before he had the air of a broken man  have you any idea of what had happened nigel asked  only this naida replied we saw prince shan last night he spent several hours with us i may be wrong but i came to the conclusion then that he had at any rate modified his views about the whole situation since his arrival in england  again there was a brief silence the minds of all three of them were busy with the same thought prince shans word had been spoken and immelans hopes dashed to the groundand within a few hours this murder they nursed the thought but no one put it into words  a sleepyeyed porter opened the door of the car outside the milan court naida gathered herself together with a little shiver  i think that after tonight she said quietly there need be no secrets between any of us  nigel held her hand in his their eyes met and both of them were conscious in that moment of closer personal relations of the passing of a certain sense of strain she even smiled as she turned away  tomorrow she concluded there must be a great exchange of confidences i am lunching at belgrave square if maggie has not forgotten and i shall tell you then what i have written to paul matinsky i showed it to prince shan yesterday good night  she patted maggies hand affectionately and flitted away the revolving doors closed behind her and the car swung out once more into the strand glided down the mall past buckingham palace and stopped at last before the great lifeless house in belgrave square nigel opened the front door with a latchkey and turned on the light  you wont mind sparing me a few minutes he begged  i suppose not she answered shivering  he led the way to the study she threw off her cloak and sank into the depths of one of the big easychairs she looked very frail and rather pathetic as she leaned her head against the chair back now that the excitement was over the strain of the emotion she had experienced showed in the violet shadows under her eyes and in the droop of her shoulders  i am tired she said plaintively  nigel came over and sat on the arm of her chair  tell me what happened tonight maggie  the little chinese girl sent for me to go to her box she explained she told me where in prince shans house were hidden the papers which revealed the understanding between immelan and himself she gave me a key of the house and a key of the cabinet we could both see the man whom i believed to be prince shan seated in his box she assured me that he would be there for the next two hours i went to the house in curzon street  well  his monosyllable was sharp and incisive his face was grey and anxious she herself remained lifeless all that there was of emotion between them seemed to have become vested in his searching eyes  i found what i believe to have been the papers they were in the cabinet just where she had told me then i turned around and found prince shan watching me he had been there all the time  go on please  at first he said little but i knew that he was very angry i have never felt so ashamed in my life  you must tell me the rest please  she stirred uneasily in her chair  it is very difficult she confessed frankly  remember he persisted that in a way maggie i am your guardian i am responsible too for anything which may happen to you whilst you are engaged in work for the good of our cause you seem to have walked into a trap did he threaten you or what  there was nothing definite she answered and yethe made me understand  made you understand what  his wishes she replied looking up coolly he offered me the papers  that damned chinaman  there was a cold light in her eyes which nigel had met with before and dreaded  you forget yourself nigel she said prince shan is a great nobleman  the rest tell me the rest he demanded  i am here she reminded him  and the papers  i came away without them  he turned and walking to the window threw it open the dawn had become almost silvery and the leaves of the overhanging trees were rustling in the faintest of breezes presently he came back  what exactly are your feelings for this man maggie he asked  for the first time he was struck with a certain pathos in her immobile face she looked up at him and there was a gleam almost of fear in her eyes  i dont know nigel she confessed  he moved restlessly about the room seemed to notice for the first time the whisky and soda set out upon the sideboard and the open box of cigarettes he helped himself and came back  did you read the papers he asked  she shook her head  i had no chance  you dont know for certain what they were about  i think i do she replied i believe they contained the text of the agreement between immelan and prince shan i believe they would have shown us exactly what we have to fear  he stood there for a moment thoughtfully  tonight he said i find it difficult to concentrate upon these things naida was extraordinarily hopeful she has seen prince shan and between them i believe that they have decided to let oscar immelans scheme alone karschoff too has heard rumours he is of the same opinion somehow or other though i seem to have lost my sense of perspective a greater fear has come into my heart maggie  she rose to her feet and laid her hands upon his shoulders  nigel she whispered i cannot answer you i cannot say what you would like me to say although on the other hand there is no surety of what you seem to fear i am going to bed i am very tired  a feeble shaft of sunlight stole into the room flickered and passed away then suddenly reappeared nigel turned and opened the door and she passed out curiously silent and absorbed he looked after her perplexed and worried suddenly a strangely commonplace yetin the silence of the house and the great hallan almost dramatic sound startled him the front doorbell rang sharply after a moments hesitation he hurried to it himself karschoff stood upon the steps still in his evening clothes his face a little drawn and haggard in the bright light  i could not resist coming in nigel he said i saw the light in the study from outside is there any definite news  nigel drew him inside  there are indications he replied cautiously that the present danger is passing  karschoff nodded  i gathered so from naida he admitted prince shan though is the pivot upon which the whole thing turns you have heard nothing final from him  nothing tell me was any one arrested at the albert hall  no one the murdered man as i suppose you have heard was sen lu one of the princes secretaries  the whole thing seems strange nigel remarked do you suppose prince shan knew that an attempt upon his life was likely tonight  karschoff shook his head doubtfully  it is difficult to say these orientals contrive to surround themselves with such an atmosphere of mystery but from what i know of prince shan he went on i do not think that he is one to shirk dangereven from the assassins dagger  a milk cart drew up with a clatter outside there was the sound of the area gate being opened karschoff put on his hat he looked nigel in the face  maggie he began  nigel nodded understandingly as he threw open the front door  ill tell you about it tomorrow he promised or rather later on today shes a little overwrought otherwisetheres nothing  karschoff turned away with a sigh of relief  i am glad he said prince shan is the soul of honour according to his own standard but these orientalsone never knows i am glad nigel     chapter xxiii   in his spacious reception room with its blue walls the high vases of flowers the faint odour of incense its indefinable ascetic charm prince shan sat in his highbacked chair whilst li wen his trusted secretary talked li wen was very eloquent his tone was never raised he never forgot that he was speaking to a being of a superior world he had a great deal to say however and he was eager to say it prince shan as he listened smoked a long cigarette in a yellow tube he wore a ring in which was set an uncut green stone on the fourth finger of his left hand although the hour was barely nine oclock he was shaved and dressed as though for a visit of ceremony he listened to li wen gravely and critically  i am sorry about the little one he said looking through the cloud of tobacco smoke up towards the ceiling nita has been very useful she has been as faithful too as is possible for a woman  li wen bowed and waited he knew better than to interrupt  it was through the information which nita brought me his master went on that i have been able to check the truth of immelans statement as to the french dispositions and the rapprochement with italy nita has served me very well indeed what she has done in this matter she has done in a moment of caprice  my lord li wen ventured a woman is of no account in the plans of the greatest she is like a leaf blown hither or thither on the winds of love or jealousy she may be used but she must be discarded  it is a strange world this western world prince shan mused in our own country li wen we plot or we fight we build the great places climb to the lofty heights and when we rest we pluck flowers and women are our flowers but here while one builds the women are there while one climbs the women are in the way they jostle the thoughts they disturb the emotions not only of the poet and the pleasure seeker but of the man who hews his way upwards to the goal he seeks and it is very deliberate li wen an englishman eats and drinks in public and places opposite him a flower he has plucked or hopes to pluck he drugs himself deliberately half the time when he should be soaring in his thoughts he descends of deliberate intent instead of his flower he makes his woman the partner of his grossness  the master speaks li wen murmured but what of the woman she awaits your pleasure  i shall hear what she has to say prince shan decided  walking backwards as nimbly as a cat his head drooped his hands in front of him li wen left his masters presence a moment later he reappeared ushering in la belle nita prince shan waved him away the girl came slowly forward pale and trembling smouldering fires in her narrow eyes not a muscle of prince shans face moved he watched her approach in silence she sank on to the floor by the side of his chair  what is my masters will she asked  prince shan looked downwards at her and she began to tremble again there was nothing threatening in his eyes nothing menacing in his expression nevertheless she felt the chill of death  you have done me many good and faithful services nita he said what evil spirit has put it into your brain that it would be a good thing to deceive me  her scarlet lips opened and closed again  how have i deceived she faltered i gave the keys to the woman with the blue eyes and i sent her to my lord it was a hard thing to do that but i did it was there any risk of evil my lord was here to deal with her  why did you do this thing nita he asked  my lord knows she answered simply i did it to bring evil upon this english woman whom he has preferred i did it that he might understand it was my lord himself who told me that she was a spy now it is proved  prince shans fingers stole into the pocket of his coat he held out a crumpled sheet of paper on which was written a single sentence the girl began to shiver  you have been very anxious indeed nita he said to bring evil upon this woman this is the message you sent to immelan do you recognise your words listen these are your words  the greatest of all will desert you if the englishwoman whom he loves is not speedily removed even tonight he may give papers into her hand and your secret will be known  the girl sat transfixed she seemed to have lost all power of speech  that is a copy of the message which you sent to immelan he told her sternly  it is the terrible li wen she faltered he has the second sight the devil walks with him  the devil is sometimes a useful confederate her companion continued equably you warned immelan that it was in my mind to refuse his terms and to open my heart to the englishwoman and you seduced sen lu to carry your message yet your judgment was at fault the hand of immelan was stretched out against me and me alone but for my knowledge of these things i might have sat in the place of sen lu who rightly died in my stead what have you to say  she rose to her feet he made no movement but his eyes watched her and the muscles of his body stiffened he watched the white hand which stole irresolutely towards the loose folds of her coat  you ask me why i have done this she cried but you already know it is because you have taken this woman with the blue eyes into your heart  if that were true he answered of what concern is it to others i am prince shan  you sent me here to breathe this cursed western atmosphere she moaned to drink in their thoughts and see with their eyes i see and know the folly of it all but who can escape jealousy with us is a disease over there one creeps away like a hurt animal because there is nothing else here it is different the frenchwoman the englishwoman who loses her lovershe does not fold her hands she strikes she is a wronged creature i too have felt that  her master sat for long in silence  you are right he pronounced i shall try to be just you are a person of small understanding you have never made any effort to live with your head in the clouds let that be so the fault was mine  i do not wish to live she cried  he shrugged his shoulders  live or diewhat does it matter he answered indifferently with life there is pain and with death there is none but if you choose life remember this the woman with the blue eyes as you call her has become the star of my life if harm should come to her not only you but every one of your family and race in whatsoever part of the world they may be will leave this life in agony  the girl stood and wondered  my lord thinks so much of a plaything she murmured  prince shan frowned his finely shaped silky eyebrows almost met she covered her eyes and drooped her head  we of the east he said although we are the mightier race progress slowly because the love of new things is not with us something of western ways i have learned and the love of woman it is not for a plaything i desire her whom we will not name she shall sit by my side and rule i shall wed her with my brain as with my body our minds will move together we shall feel the same shivering pleasure when we rule the world with great thoughts as when our bodies touch i shall teach her to know her soul even as my own has been revealed to me  no woman is worthy of this my lord the girl faltered  he waved his hand and she stole away at the door he stopped her  do you go to life or death nita he asked  she looked at him with a great sorrow  i am a worthless thing she replied i go where my lords words have sent me  li wen reappeared presently for an appointed audience he brought messages  highness he announced there is a code dispatch here from kichou an american gained entrance to the city last week yesterday he left by æroplane for india he was overtaken and captured it is feared however that he has agents over the frontier for no papers were found upon him  it was a great achievement prince shan said thoughtfully no other foreigner has ever passed into our secret city is there word as to how he got there  he came as a russian artificer from that city in russia of which we do not speak li wen replied he brought letters and his knowledge was great  his name the prince asked  gilbert jesson highness his passport and papers refer to washington but his message if he sent one is believed to have come to london  the man must die the prince said calmly that without doubt he expects yet the news is not serious my heart has spoken for peace li wen  li wen bowed low his master watched him curiously  if i had asked it li wen where would your counsel have led  towards peace highness i do not trust immelan it is not in such a manner that chinas empire shall spread there are ancestors of mine who would turn in their graves to find china in league with a western power  you are a wise man li wen his master declared we hold the mastery of the world what shall we do with it  the mightiest sword is that which enforces peace was the calm reply highness the lady whom you were expecting waits in the anteroom  prince shan nodded he welcomed naida who was ushered in a moment or two later with rather more than his usual grave and pleasant courtesy leading her himself to a chair  i wondered she confessed if i were ever to be allowed to see inside your wonderful house  it is my misfortune to be compelled to pay so brief a visit to this country he replied as a rule it gives me great pleasure to open my rooms three evenings and entertain those who care to come and see me  i have heard of your entertainments she said smiling prima donnas sing you rob the capitals of europe to find your music then the great monsieur auguste is lured from paris to prepare your supper and not a lady leaves without some priceless jewel  i entertain so seldom he reminded her i fear that the fame of my feasts has been exaggerated  when do you leave prince she asked him  within a few days he replied  i come for your last word she announced all that i have written to paul matinsky you know  the last word is not yet to be spoken he said this however you may tell matinsky the scheme of oscar immelan has been laid before me i have rejected it  in what other way then would you use your power she asked  he made no answer she watched him with a great and growing curiosity  prince she said they tell me that you are a great student of history  i have read what is known of the history of most of the countries of the world he admitted  there have been men she persisted who have dealt in empires for the price of a womans smile  such men have loved he said as i love  yet for you life has always been a great and lofty thing she reminded him you could not stand where you do if you had not realised the beauty and wonder of sacrifice fate has given the peace of the world into your keeping you will not juggle with the trust  he rose to his feet a servant stood almost immediately at the open door  fate and an american engineer he remarked with a smile i thank you dear lady for your visit you will hear my news before i leave  she looked into his eyes for a moment  it is a great decision she said which rests with you     chapter xxiv   an hour or so later prince shan left his house in curzon street and followed at a discreet distance by two members of his household strolled into the park it had pleased him that morning to conform rigorously to the mode of dress adopted by the fashionable citizens of the country which he was visiting few people without the closest observation would have taken him for anything but a wellturnedout exceedingly handsome and distinguishedlooking englishman he carried himself with a faint air of aloofness as though he moved amongst scenes in which he had no actual concern as though he were living in thought at any rate in some other world the morning was brilliantly sunny and both the promenade and the row were crowded slightly hidden behind a tree he stood and watched a gay crowd of promenaders passed along the broad path and the air was filled with the echo of laughter the jargon of the day intimate references to a common world invitations lightly given and lightly accepted it was sunday morning in a season when colour was the craze of the moment and the women who swept by seemed to his rather mystical fancy like the flowers in some of the great open spaces he knew so well stirred into movement by a soft wind they were very beautiful these western women handsome too the men with whom they talked and flirted always they had that air however of absolute complacency as though they felt nothing of the quest which lay like a thread of torture amongst the nerves of prince shans being there was no more distinguished figure among the men there than he himself and yet the sense of alienation grew in his heart as he watched there were many familiar faces many to whom he could have spoken no one who would not have greeted him with interest even with gratification and yet he had never been so deeply conscious of the gulf which lay between the oriental fatalism of his life and ways and the placid selfassurance of these westerners so wellcontent with the earth upon which their feet fell he had judged with perfect accuracy the place which he held in their thoughts and estimation he was something of a curiosity his title half a joke the splendour of his long race a thing unrealisable by these scions of a more recent aristocracy yet supposing that this new wonder had not come into his life that immelan had been a shade more eloquent had pleaded his cause upon a higher level that naida karetsky also had formed a different impression of the world which he was studying so earnestlywhat a transformation he could have brought upon this lighthearted and joyous scene the scales had so nearly balanced at the bottom of his heart he was conscious of a certain faint contempt for the almost bovine selfsatisfaction of a nation without eyes literature and painting art in all its farflung branches even science were suffering in these days from a general and paralysing inertia life which demanded no sacrifice of anybody was destructive of everything in the nature of aspiration sport seemed to be the only incentive to sobriety the desire to live long in this fat land the only brake upon an era of selfindulgence he looked eastwards to where his own millions were toiling with his daybyday maxims in their ears and it seemed to his elastic fancy that he was inhaling a long breath of cooler and more vigorous life  the current of his reflections was broken he had moved a little towards the rails and he was instantly aware of the girl cantering towards hima slight frail figure she seemed upon a great bay horse she wore a simple brown habit and bowler hat and she sat her horse with that complete lack of selfconsciousness which is the heritage of a born horsewoman she was looking up at the sky as she cantered towards him with no thought of the crowds passing along the promenade yet as she drew nearer she suddenly glanced down and their eyes met as though obeying his unspoken wish she reined in her horse and came close to the rails behind which he stood for a moment bareheaded there was the faintest smile upon her lips she was amazingly composed she had asked herself repeatedly almost in terror how they should meet when the time came now that it had happened it seemed the most natural thing in the world she was scarcely conscious even of embarrassment  you are demonstrating to the world she remarked that the reports of your death this morning were exaggerated  i had forgotten the incident he assured her calmly  his callousness was so unaffected that she shivered a little  yet this sen lu this man for whom you were mistaken was an intimate member of your household was he not  sen lu was a very good friend prince shan answered he did his duty for many years if he knows now that his life was taken for mine he is happy to have made such atonement  she manoeuvred her horse a little to be nearer to him  why was sen lu murdered she asked  there are those he replied of whom i myself shall ask that question before the day is over  you have an idea then she persisted  if he said you desire my whole confidence it is yours  she sat looking between her horses ears  to tell you the truth she confessed i do not know what i desire your philosophy i suppose does not tolerate moods i shall escape from them some time i expect but just now i seem to have found my way into a maze the faces of these people dont even seem real to me and as for you i am perfectly certain that you have never been in china in your life  tell me the stimulant that is needed to raise you from your apathy he asked will you find it in the rapid motion of your horsea very noble animalin the joy of this mornings sunshine and breeze or in the toyland where these puppets move and walk he added glancing down the promenade dear lady maggie i beg permission to pay you a visit of ceremony will you receive me this afternoon  she knew then what it was that she had been hoping for she looked down at him and smiled  at four oclock she invited  she nodded touched her horse lightly with the whip and cantered off prince shan found himself suddenly accosted by a dozen acquaintances all plying him with questions he listened to them with an amused smile  the whole affair is a very simple one he said a member of my household was assassinated last night it was probably a plot against my own life those things are more common with us perhaps than over here  jolly country china i should think one of the younger members of the group remarked you can buy a mans conscience there for ninepence  prince shan looked across at the speaker gravely  the market value here he observed seems a little higher but the supply greater  touché karschoff laughed there is another point of view too the further east you go the less value life has westwards it becomes an absolute craze to preserve and coddle it to drag it out to its furthermost span the american millionaire for example has a resident physician attached to his household and is likely to spend the aftermath of his life in a semidrugged and comatose condition and in the east who cares if not todaytomorrow inevitability which is the nightmare of the west is the philosophy of the east by the by prince he added have you any theory as to last nights attempt  that is just the question prince shan replied which two very intelligent gentlemen from scotland yard asked me this morning theory why should i have a theory  the attempt was without a doubt directed against you karschoff observed do you imagine that it was personal or political  how can i tell the prince rejoined carelessly why should any one desire my death these things are riddles ah here comes my friend immelan he went on immelan help us in this discussion you are not one of those who place the gift of life above all other things in the world  my own or anothers immelan asked with blunt cynicism  i trust was the bland reply that you are as i have always esteemed you an altruist  and why  prince shan shrugged his shoulders he was a very agreeable figure in the centre of the little group of men the hands which held his malacca cane behind his back the smile which parted his lips benign yet cryptic  because he explained it is a great thing to have more regard for the lives of others than for ones own and there are times he added when it is certainly ones own life which is in the more precarious state  there was a little dispersal of the crowd a chorus of congratulations and farewells immelan and prince shan were left alone the former seemed to have turned paler the sun was warm and yet he shivered  just what do you mean by that prince he asked  you shall walk with me to my house and i will tell you was the quiet reply     chapter xxv   i suppose immelan suggested as the two men reached the house in curzon street it would be useless to ask you to break your custom and lunch with me at the ritz or at the club  his companion smiled deprecatingly  i have adopted so many of your western customs he said apologetically to this lunching or dining in public however i shall never accustom myself  immelan laughed goodnaturedly the conversation of the two men on their way from the park had been without significance and some part of his earlier nervousness seemed to be leaving him  we all have our foibles he admitted one of mine is to have a pretty woman opposite me when i lunch or dine music somewhere in the distance a little sentiment a little promise perhaps  it is not artistic prince shan pronounced calmly it is not when the wine mounts to the head and the sense of feeding fills the body that men speak best of the things that lie near their hearts still we will let that pass each of us is made differently there is another thing immelan which i have to say to you  they passed into the reception room with its shining floor its marvellous rugs its silken hangings and its great vases of flowers prince shan led his companion into a recess where the light failed to penetrate so completely as into the rest of the apartment a wide settee piled with cushions protruded from the wall in semicircular shape in front of it was a round ebony table upon which stood a great yellow bowl filled with lilies prince shan gave an order to one of the servants who had followed them into the room and threw himself at full length among the cushions his head resting upon his hand his face turned towards his guest  they will bring you the aperitif of which you are so fond he said also cigarettes mine i know are too strong for you  they taste too much of opium immelan remarked  prince shans eyes grew dreamy as he gazed through a little cloud of odorous smoke  there is opium in them he admitted believe me they are very wonderful but i agree with you that they are not for the ordinary person  the softfooted butler presented a silver tray upon which reposed a glassful of amber liquid immelan took it sipped it appreciatively and lit a cigarette  your man prince he acknowledged mixes his vermouths wonderfully  i am glad that what he does meets with your approval was the courteous reply he came to me from one of your royal palaces i simply told him that i wished my guests to have of the best  yet you never touch this sort of drink yourself immelan observed curiously  the prince shook his head  sometimes i take wine he said that is generally at night a few evenings ago for instance he went on with a reminiscent smile i drank chateau yquem smoked egyptian cigarettes ate some muscatel grapes and read pippa passes that was one of my banquets  as a matter of fact immelan remarked thoughtfully you are far more western in thought than in habit the temperance of the east is in your blood  i find that my manner of life keeps the brain clear prince shan said slowly i can see the truth sometimes when it is not very apparent i saw the truth last night immelan when i sent sen lu to die  immelans expression was indescribable he sat with his mouth wide open the hand which held his glass shook he stared across the bowl of lilies to where his host was looking up through the smoke towards the ceiling  sen lu was a traitor the latter went on a very foolish man who with one act of treachery wiped out the memory of a lifetime of devotion in the end he told the truth and now he has paid his debt  what do you mean immelan demanded in a voice which he attempted in vain to control how was sen lu a traitor  sen lu the prince explained was in the pay of those who sought to know more of my business than i chose to tellwho sought indeed to anticipate my own judgment when they gathered from him and alas from my sweet but frail little friend nita that the chances were against my signing a certain covenant they came to what even now seems to me a strange decision they decided that i must die there i fail wholly to follow the workings of your mind immelan how was my death likely to serve your purpose  immelan was absolutely speechless three times he opened his lips only to close them again some instinct seemed to tell him that his companion had more to say he sat there as though mesmerised meanwhile the prince lit another cigarette  a blunder believe me immelan he continued thoughtfully death will not lower over my path till my task is accomplished i am youngmany years younger than you immelanand the greatest physicians marvel at my strength against the assassins knife or bullet i am secure you have been brought up and lived my terrified friend in a country where religion remains a shell and a husk without comfort to any man it is not so with me i live in the spirit as in the body and my days will last until the sun leans down and lights me to the world where those dwell who have fulfilled their destiny  immelan drained the contents of the glass which his unsteady hand was holding then he rose to his feet the veins on his forehead were standing out his blue eyes were filled with rage  blast sen lu he muttered the man was a double traitor  he has atoned his companion said calmly he made his peace and he went to his death it seems very fitting that he should have received the dagger which was meant for my heart now what about you oscar immelan  immelan laughed harshly  if sen lu told you that i was in this plot against your life he lied  the prince inclined his head urbanely  such a man as sen lu goes seldom to his death with a lie upon his lips he said yet i confess that i am puzzled why should you plan this thing immelan you cannot know what is in my mind concerning your covenant i have not yet refused to sign it  you have not refused to sign it immelan replied but you will refuse  indeed the prince murmured  you are even now trifling with the secrets confided to you immelan went on you know very well that the woman who came to you last night is a spy whose whole time is spent in seeking to worm our secret from you  your agents keep themselves well informed was the calm comment  yours still have the advantage of us immelan answered bitterly now listen to me i have heard it said of youi have heard that you claim yourselfthat you have never told a falsehood we have been allies answer me this question have you parted with any of our secrets  not one the prince assured him a certain lady visited this house last night not as you seem to think at my invitation but on her own initiative she was not successful in her quest  she would not pay the price eh immelan sneered by the gods of your ancestors prince shan are there not women enough in the world for you without bartering your honour and the great future of your country for a blueeyed jade of an englishwoman  the prince sat slowly up his appearance was ominous his face had become set as marble there was a look in his eyes like the flashing of a light upon black metal he contemplated his visitor across the lilies  a man so near to death immelan he enjoined might choose his words more carefully  immelan laughed scornfully  i am not to be bullied he declared your doors with their patent locks have no fears for me when you walk abroad you are followed by members of your household when you come to my rooms they attend you i am not a prince but i too have a care for my skin three of my secret service men never let me out of their sight they are within call at this moment  his host smiled  this is very interesting he said but you should know me better immelan than to imagine that mine are the clumsy methods of the dagger or the bullet the man whom i will to diedrinks with me  he pointed a long forefinger at the empty glass immelan gazed at it and the sweat stood out upon his forehead  my god he muttered there was a queer taste i thought that it was aniseed  there was nothing in that glass the prince declared which the greatest chemist who ever breathed could detect as poison yet you will die my friend immelan without any doubt shall i tell you how would you know in what manner the pains will come no but my friend you disappoint me you showed so much courage an hour ago listen feel for a swelling just behindah  immelan was already across the room the prince touched a bell the doors were opened ghastly pale his head swimming the tortured man dashed out into the street the prince leaned back amongst his cushions untied a strawfastened packet of his long cigarettes lit one and closed his eyes     chapter xxvi   nigel was just arriving at dorminster house when maggie returned from her ride he assisted her to dismount and entered the house with her  there is something here i should like to show you maggie he said as he drew a dispatch from his pocket it was sent round to me half an hour ago by chalmers from the american embassy  its about gilbert jesson maggie exclaimed holding out her hand for it  nigel nodded  theres a note inside and an enclosure he said you had better read both  maggie opened out the former       my dear dorminster       i am afraid there is rather bad news about jesson one of our      regular line of airships running from san francisco to      vladivostok has picked up a wireless which must have come from      somewhere in the south of china they kept it for a few days worse      luck thinking it was only nonsense as it was in code washington      got hold of it however and cabled it to us last night i enclose      a copy decoded       sincerely yours       jere chalmers  the copy was brief enough maggie felt her heart sink as she glanced through the few lines       report dispatched london fear escape impossible goodby       jesson  horrible maggie exclaimed with a shiver i thought he was in russia  so did we all nigel replied he must have come to the conclusion that the key to the riddle he was trying to solve was in china and gone on there look here maggie he continued after a moments hesitation do you think anything could be done for jesson with prince shan  maggie was silent they were standing in a shaded corner of the hall but a fleck of sunshine shone in her hair she was still a little out of breath with the exercise her cheeks full of healthy colour her eyes bright she tapped her skirt with her riding whip nigel watched her a little uneasily  prince shan is calling here this afternoon maggie announced i hope you dont mind  what are you going to say to him nigel asked bluntly  there was a short tense silence even at the thought of the crisis which she knew to be so close at hand maggie felt herself unnerved and in dubious straits  i do not know she said at last for one thing i do not know what he wants  what he wants seems perfectly plain to me nigel replied gravely he wants you  maggie made a desperate effort to regain the lightheartedness of a few weeks ago  if you believe that she said your composure is most unflattering  there was a ring at the front doorbell and a familiar voice was heard outside maggie turned away to the staircase with a little sigh of relief  naida she exclaimed i remember now i asked her for a quarter past one instead of halfpast you must entertain her nigel ill change into something quickly and of course ill speak to prince shan we mustnt lose a minute about that ill telephone from my room in a few minutes naida nigel will look after you  naida came down the hall cool and exquisitely gowned in a creation of shimmering white nigel led her into the rarely used drawingroom and found a chair for her between the open window and the conservatory at first they exchanged but few words the sense of her near presence affected nigel as nothing of the sort had ever done before she for her part seemed quite content with a silence which had in it many of the essentials of eloquence  if the history of these days is ever written by an irascible german historian naida remarked at length he will probably declare that the destinies of the world have been affected during this last month by an outburst of primitivism do you know that i have written quite nice things to paul about you english people honest things of course but still things which you helped me to discover and prince shan too i think that when he rode here through the clouds he believed in his heart that he was coming as a harbinger of woe  you really think then that the crisis is past nigel asked  she nodded  i am almost sure of it prince shan returns to china within the course of the next few days  we have lived so long nigel observed in dread of the unknown i wonder whether we shall ever understand the exact nature of the danger with which we were faced  it depends upon prince shan she replied the terms were immelans but the method was his  do you believe he asked a little abruptly that the attempt on prince shans life last night was made by immelan  there was a touch perhaps of her muscovite ancestry in the cool indifference with which she considered the matter  i should think it most likely she decided prince shan never changes his mind and i believe that he has decided against immelans scheme immelans only chance would be in prince shans successor  why is china so necessary nigel asked  she turned and smiled at her companion  alas she sighed we have reached an impasse the great english diplomat asks too many questions of the simple russian girl  it is unfortunate he replied in the same vein because i feel like asking more  as for example  whether you would be content to live for the rest of your life in any other country except russia  a woman is content to live anywhere under certain circumstances she murmured  karschoff discreetly announced entered the room with flamboyant ease  it is well to be young he exclaimed as he bent over naidas fingers you look my faraway but much beloved cousin as though you had slept peacefully through the night and spent the morning in this soft sunlit air with perhaps if one might suggest such a thing an hour at a bond street beauty parlour here am i with crowsfeet under my eyes and ghosts walking by my side yet none the less he added as the door opened and maggie appeared looking forward to my luncheon and to hear all the news  there is no news naida declared as the butler announced the service of the meal we have reached the far end of the ways the next disclosures if ever they are made will come from others at luncheon we are going to talk of the english country the seaside the meadows and the quiet places the time arrives when i weary weary of the brazen ticking of the clock of fate  i shall tell you nigel declared of a small country house i have in devonshire there are rough grounds stretching down to the sea and crawling up to the moors behind my grandfather built it when he was chancellor of england or rather he added to an old farmhouse he called it the house of peace  my father built a house very much in the same spirit naida told them he called it after an old turkish inscription engraven on the front of a villa in stamboulthe house of thought and flowers  maggie smiled across the table approvingly  i like the conversation she said naida and i are after all women and sentimentalists we claim a respite an armisticecall it what you will prince karschoff wont you tell me of the most beautiful house you ever dwelt in  always the house i am hoping to end my days in he answered but let me tell you about a villa i had in cannes fifteen years ago people used to speak of it as one of the worlds treasures  when the two men were seated alone over their coffee nigel passed chalmers note and the enclosure across to his companion  you remember i told you about chalmers friend jesson the secret service man who came over to us he said chalmers has just sent me round this  karschoff nodded and studied the message through his great hornrimmed eyeglass  i thought that he was going to russia for you he said  so he did he must have gone on from there  and the message comes from southern china prince karschoff reflected  nigel was deep in thought china russia germany prince shan in england negotiating with immelan and behind sinister menacing mysteriousjapan  supposing he propounded at last there really does exist a secret treaty between china and japan  if there is prince karschoff observed one can easily understand what immelan has been at prince shan can command the whole of asia i know they are afraid of something of the sort in the states an american who was in the club yesterday told us they had spent over a hundred millions on their west coast fortifications in the last two years  one can understand too in that case nigel continued why japan left the league of nations that stunt of hers about being outside the sphere of possible misunderstandings never sounded honest  it was unfortunate prince karschoff said that america was dominated for those few months by an honest but impractical idealist he had the germ of an idea but he thrust it on the world before even his own country was ready for it in time the nations would certainly have elaborated something more workable  you cannot keep a fullblooded man from clenching his fist if hes insulted nigel pointed out and nations march along the same lines as individuals its existence has never for a single moment weakened germanys hatred of england and the stronger she grows the more she flaunts its conditions france guards her frontiers night and day with an army ten times larger than she is allowed russia has become the country of mysteries with something up her sleeve beyond a doubt and there are cities in modern china into which no european dare penetrate japan quite frankly maintains an immense army the united states is silently following suitand god help us all if a war does come  you are right karschoff assented gloomily the last glamour of romance has gone from fighting there were remnants of it in the last war especially in palestine and egypt and when we first overran austria today science would settle the whole affair the war would be won in the laboratory the engine room and the workshop i doubt whether any battleship could keep afloat for a week and as to the fighting in the air if a hundred airships were in action i do not suppose that one of them would escape then they say that france has a gun which could carry a shell from amiens to london and more mysterious than all china has something up her sleeve which no one has even a glimmering of  except jesson nigel muttered  and jessons gleam of knowledge or suspicion prince karschoff remarked seems to have brought him to the end of his days can anything be done with prince shan about him do you think  only indirectly i am afraid nigel replied maggie is seeing him this afternoon as a matter of fact i believe she telephoned to him before luncheon but i havent heard anything yet when a man goes out on that sort of a job he burns his boats and jesson isnt the first who has turned eastwards during the last few months i heard only yesterday that france has lost three of her best men in chinaone who went as a missionary and two as merchants theyve just disappeared without a word of explanation  the telephone extension bell rang nigel walked over to the sideboard and took down the receiver  is that lord dorminster a mans voice asked  speaking nigel replied  i am david franklin private secretary to mr mervin brown the voice continued mr mervin brown would be exceedingly obliged if you would come round to downing street to see him at once  i will be there in ten minutes nigel promised  he laid down the receiver and turned to karschoff  the prime minister he explained  what does he want you for  i think nigel replied that the trouble cloud is about to burst     chapter xxvii   mr mervin brown on this occasion did not beat about the bush his old air of confident almost smug selfsatisfaction had vanished he received nigel with a new deference in his manner without any further sign of that goodnatured tolerance accorded by a busy man to a kindly crank  lord dorminster he began i have sent for you to renew a conversation we had some little time since i will be quite frank with you certain circumstances have come to my notice which lead me to believe that there may be more truth in some of the arguments you brought forward than i was willing at the time to believe  i must confess that i am relieved to hear you say so nigel replied all the information which i have points to a crisis very near at hand  the prime minister leaned a little across the table  the immediate reason for my sending for you he explained is this my friend the american ambassador has just sent me a copy of a wireless dispatch which he has received from china from one of their former agents the report seems to have been sent to him for safety but the sender of it of whose probity by the by the american ambassador pledges himself appears to have been sent to china by you  jesson nigel exclaimed i have heard of this already sir from a friend in the american embassy  the dispatch mr mervin brown went on is in some respects a little vague but it is on the other hand i frankly admit disturbing it gives specific details as to definite military preparations on the part of china and russia associated presumably with a third power whose name you will forgive my not mentioning these preparations appear to have been brought almost to completion in the strictest secrecy but the headquarters of the whole thing very much to my surprise i must confess seems to be in southern china  in that case nigel pointed out if you will permit me to make a suggestion sir you have a very simple course open to you  well  send for prince shan  prince shan the prime minister replied with knitted brows is not over in this country officially he has begged to be excused from accepting or returning any diplomatic courtesies  nevertheless nigel persisted i should send for prince shan if it had not been he went on slowly for the complete abolition of our secret service system you would probably have been informed before now that prince shan has been having continual conferences in this country with one of the most dangerous men who ever set foot on these shoresoscar immelan  immelan has no official position in this country the prime minister objected  a fact which makes him none the less dangerous nigel insisted he is one of those free lances of diplomacy who have sprung up during the last ten or fifteen years the product of that spurious wave of altruism which is responsible for the league of nations immelan was one of the first to see how his country might benefit by the new régime it is he who has been pulling the strings in russia and china and i fear another country  what i want to arrive at mr mervin brown said a little impatiently is something definite  let me put it my own way nigel begged a very large section of our presentday politiciansyou if i may say so amongst them mr mervin brownhave believed this country safe against any military dangers because of the connections existing between your unions of working men and similar bodies in germany this is a great fallacy for two reasons first because germany has always intended to have some one else pull the chestnuts out of the fire for her and second because we cannot internationalise labour english and german workmen may come together on matters affecting their craft and the conditions of their labour but at heart one remains a german and one an englishman with separate interests and a separate outlook  well at the end of it all mr mervin brown said the bogey is war what sort of a war an invasion of england is just as impossible today as it was twenty years ago  nigel nodded  i cannot answer your question he admitted i was looking to jessons report to give us an idea as to that  you shall see it tomorrow mr mervin brown promised it is round at the war office at the present moment  without seeing it nigel went on i expect i can tell you one startling feature of its contents it suggested did it not that the principal movers against us would be russian and china anda country which you prefer just now not to mention  but that country is our ally mr mervin brown exclaimed  nigel smiled a little sadly  she has been he admitted still if you had been au fait with diplomatic history thirty years ago mr mervin brown you would know that she was on the point of ending her alliance with us and establishing one with germany it was only owing to the genius of one english statesman that at the last moment she almost reluctantly renewed her alliance with us she is in the same state of doubt concerning our destiny today she has seen our last two governments forget that we are an imperial power and endeavour to apply the principles of sheer commercialism to the conduct of a great nation she may have opened her eyes a thousand years later than we did but she is awake enough now to know that this will not do there is little enough of generosity amongst the nations none amongst the orientals i have a conviction myself that there is a secret alliance between china and this other power a secret and quite possibly an aggressive alliance  mr mervin brown sat for a few moments deep in thought somehow or other his face had gained in dignity since the beginning of the conversation the nervous fear in his eyes had been replaced by a look of deep and solemn anxiety  if you are right lord dorminster he pronounced presently the world has rolled backwards these last ten years and we who have failed to mark its retrogression may have a terrible responsibility thrust upon us  politically i am afraid i agree with you nigel replied only the idealist and the prejudiced idealist can ignore the primal elements in human nature and believe that a few lofty sentiments can keep the nations behind their frontiers war is a terrible thing but human life itself is a terrible thing its principles are the same and force will never be restrained except by force if the league of nations had been established upon a firmer and less selfish basis it certainly might have kept the peace for another thirty or forty years as it is i believe that we are on the verge of a serious crisis  war for us is an impossibility mr mervin brown declared frankly simply because we cannot fight our army consists of policemen science has defeated the battleship and practically the same conditions exist in the air  you sent for me i presume to ask for my advice nigel said at any rate let me offer it i have reason to believe that the negotiations between prince shan and oscar immelan have not been entirely successful send for prince shan and question him in a friendly fashion  will you be my ambassador the prime minister asked  nigel hesitated for a moment  if you wish it he promised prince shan is in some respects a strangely inaccessible person but just at present he seems well disposed towards my household  arrange if you can mr mervin brown begged to bring him here tomorrow morning i will try to have available a copy of the dispatch from jesson it refers to matters which i trust prince shan will be able to explain  nigel lingered for a moment over his farewell  if i might venture upon a suggestion sir he said do not forget that prince shan is to all intents and purposes the autocrat of asia he has taught the people of the world to remodel their ideas of china and all that china stands for and further than this he is according to his principles a man of the strictest honour i would treat him sir as a valued confrère and equal  the prime minister smiled  dont look upon me as being too intensely parochial dorminster he said i know quite well that prince shan is a man of genius and that he is a representative of one of the worlds greatest families i am only the servant of a great power he is a great power in himself  and believe me nigel concluded fervently as he made his adieux the greatest autocrat that ever breathed if when you exchange farewells with him he saysthere will be no warwe are saved at any rate for the moment     chapter xxviii   maggie very cool and neat a vision of soft blue a wealth of colouring in the deep brown of her closely braided hair her lips slightly parted in a smile of welcome felt notwithstanding her apparent composure a strange disturbance of outlook and senses as prince shan was ushered into her flowerbedecked little sitting room that afternoon the unusual formality of his entrance seemed somehow to suit the man and his manner he bowed low as soon as he had crossed the threshold and bowed again over her fingers as she rose from her easychair  it makes me very happy that you receive me like this he told her simply it makes it so much easier for me to say the things that are in my heart  wont you sit down please maggie invited you are so tall and i hate to be completely dominated  he obeyed at once but he continued to talk with grave and purposeful seriousness  i wish he said to bring myself entirely into accord for these few minutes with your western methods and customs i address you therefore lady maggie with formal words while i keep back in my heart much that is struggling to express itself i have come to ask you to do me the great honour of becoming my wife  maggie sat for a few moments speechless the thing which she had half dreaded and half longed forthe low timbre of his caressing voicewas entirely absent yet somehow or other his simple formal words were at least as disturbing he leaned towards her a quiet dignified figure anxious yet in a sense confident he had the air of a man who has offered to share a kingdom  your wife maggie repeated tremulously  the thought is new to you perhaps he went on with gentle tolerance you have believed the stories people tell that in my youth i was vowed to celibacy and the priesthood that is not true i have always been free to marry but although today we figure as a great progressive nation many of the thousandyearold ideas of ancient china have dwelt in my brain and still sit enshrined in my heart the aristocracy of china has passed through evil times there is no princess of my own country whom i could meet on equal terms so you see although it develops differently there is something of the snobbishness of your western countries reflected in our own ideas  but i am not a princess maggie murmured  you are the princess of my soul he answered lowering his eyes for a moment almost reverently i cannot quite hope to make you understand but if i took for my wife a chinese lady of unequal mundane rank i should commit a serious offence against those who watch me from the other side of the grave and to whom i am accountable for every action of my life a lady of another country is a different matter  but i am an englishwoman maggie said and i love my country you know what that means  i know very well he admitted i had not meant to speak of those things until later but for your countrys sake what greater alliance could you seek today than to become the wife of him who is destined to be the ruler of asia  maggie caught hold of her courage she looked into his eyes unflinchingly though she felt the hot colour rise into her cheeks  you did not speak to me of these things prince shan when i came to your house last night she reminded him  his smile was full of composure it was as though the truth which sat enshrined in the mans soul lifted him above all the ordinary emotions of fear of misunderstandings  for those few minutes he confessed i was very angry it brings great pain to a man to see the thing he loves droop her wings flutter down to earth and walk the common highway it is not for you dear one to mingle with that crowd who scheme and cheat hide and deceive for any reward in the world whether it be money fame or the love of country you were not made for those things and when i saw you there so utterly in my power having deliberately taken your risk i was angry for a single moment i meant that you should realise the danger of the path you were treading i think that i did make you realise it  her eyes fell he seemed to have established some compelling power over her he had met her thoughts before they were uttered and answered even her unspoken question  i wish you didnt make life so much like a kindergarten she complained with an almost pathetic smile at the corners of her lips  it is a very different place he rejoined fervently that i desire to make of life for you listen please i have spoken to you first the formal words which make all things possible between us and now if i may i let my heart speak somewhere not far from pekin i have a palace where my lands slope to the river for five months in the year my gardens are starred with blue and yellow flowers sweetsmelling as the almond blossom and there are little pagodas which look down on the blue water pagodas hung with creepers not like your english evergreens but with blossoms pink and waxen which open as one looks at them and send out sweet perfumes when you are there with me dear one then i shall speak to you in the language of my ancestors which some day you will understand and you shall know that love has its cradle in the east you shall feel the flame of its birth the furnace of its accomplishment here my tongue moves slowly yet i stoop my knee to you i show you my heart and my lips tell you that i love what that love is you shall learn some day if you have the will and the confidence and the soul will you come back to china with me maggie  she rested her fingers on his hand  you are a magician she confessed i am very english and yet i want to go  he stood for a moment looking into her eyes then he stooped down and raised her hesitating fingers to his lips  i believe that you will come he said simply i believe that you will ride over the clouds with me back to the country of beautiful places so now i speak to you of serious things of money there shall be what you wish more than any woman even of your rank possesses in this country i shall give you too the sister of my great black dragon so that in five days if you wish you can pass from any of my palaces to london and further than that behold  he drew from his pocket a roll of papers maggie recognised it and her heart beat faster curiously enough just then she scarcely thought of its world importance she remembered only those few moments of strange thrills the wonder at finding him in that room as he stood watching her the horror and yet the thrill of his measured words he laid the papers upon the table  read them he invited you will understand then the net that has been closing around your country you will understand the better if i tell you this china and japan are one it was my first triumph when patriotism urged me into the field of politics we have a single motto and upon that is based all that you may read thereeurope for the europeans asia for us  maggie was conscious of a sudden sense of escape from her almost mesmeric state the change in his tone his calm references to things belonging to another and altogether different world had dissolved a situation against the charm of which she had found herself powerless even unwilling to struggle once more she was back in the world where for the last two years had lain her chief interests she took the papers in her hand and began reading them quickly through every now and then a little exclamation broke from her lips  you will observe her companion pointed out looking over her shoulder that on paper at any rate japan is the great gainer she takes australia new zealand and india china absorbs thibet and reëstablishes her empire of forty years ago the arrangement is based very largely on racial conditions china is a selfcentered country we have not the power of fusion of the japanese you will observe further as an interesting circumstance that the american foothold in asia disappears as completely as the british  but tell me she demanded how are these things to be brought about and where does immelan come in  prince shan smiled  immelans position he explained is largely a sentimental one yet on the other hand he saves his country from what might be a grave calamity the commercial advantages he gains under this treaty might seem to be inadequate although in effect they are very considerable the point is this he soothes his country of the pain which groans day by day in her limbs he gratifies her lust for vengeance against great britain without plunging her into any desperate enterprise  and france escapes she murmured  france escapes he assented rightly or wrongly the whole of germanys postwar animosity was directed against england she considered herself deceived by certain british statesmen she may have been right or wrong i myself find the evidence conflicting at this moment the matter does not concern us  and is great britain then maggie asked believed to be so helpless that she can be stripped of the greater part of her possessions at the will of china and japan  prince shan smiled  great britain he reminded her has taken the league of nations to her heart it was a very dangerous thing to do  still maggie persisted there remains the great thing which you have not told me these proposals i admit would strike a blow at the heart of the british empire but how are they to be carried into effect  if i had signed the agreement he replied they could very easily have been carried into effect you have heard already have you not through some of your agents of the three secret cities in the easternmost of them is the answer to your question  she smiled  is that a challenge to me to come out and discover for myself all that i want to know  if you come he answered you shall certainly know everything there is another little matter too which waits for your decision  tell me of it at once please she begged with a sudden conviction of his meaning  he obeyed without hesitation  i spoke just now he reminded her of the three secret cities they are secret because we have taken pains to keep them so one is in germany one in russia and one in china a casual traveller could discover little in the german one and little more perhaps in the russian one enough to whet his curiosity and no more but in china there is the whole secret at the mercy of a successful spy a man named jesson lady maggie  i telephoned you about him before luncheon today she interrupted  i had your message he replied and the man is safe for the moment at the same time lady maggie let me remind you that this is a game the rules of which are known the world over jesson has now in his possession the secret on which i might build if i chose plans to conquer the world he knew the penalty if he was discovered and he was discovered to spare his life is sentimentalism pure and simple yet if it is your will so be it  you are very good to me she declared gratefully all the more good because half the time i can see that you scarcely understand  that i do not admit he protested i understand even where i do not sympathise you make of life the greatest boon on earth we of my race and way of thinking are taught to take it up or lay it down if not with indifference at any rate with a very large share of resignation however jessons life is spared from what i have heard of the man i imagine he will be very much surprised  she gave a little sigh of relief  you have given me a great deal of your confidence she said thoughtfully  is it not clear he answered why i have done so i ask of you the greatest boon a woman has to give i do not seek to bribe but if you can give me the love that will make my life a dream of happiness then will it not be my duty to see that no shadow of misfortune shall come to you or yours china stands between japan and russia and i am china  she gave him her hands  you are very wonderful she declared remember that at a time like this it is not a womans will alone that speaks it is her soul which lights the way prince shan i do not know  he smiled gravely  i leave he told her on friday soon after dawn  she found herself trembling  it is a very short time she faltered  they had both risen to their feet he was close to her now and she felt herself caught up in a passionate wave of inertia an absolute inability to protest or resist his arms were clasped around her lightly and with exceeding gentleness he leaned down she found herself wondering even in that tumultuous moment at the strange clearness of his complexion the whiteness of his firm strong teeth the soft brilliance of his eyes which caressed her even before his lips rested upon hers  i think that you will come he whispered i think that you will be very happy     chapter xxix   the great house in curzon street awoke the following morning to a state of intense activity taxicabs and motorcars were lined along the street a stream of callers came and went that part of the establishment of which little was seen by the casual caller the rooms where half a dozen secretaries conducted an immense correspondence presided over by li wen was working overtime at full pressure in his reception room prince shan saw a selected few of the callers mostly journalists and politicians to whom li wen gave the entrée one visitor even this most astute of secretaries found it hard to place he took the card in to his master who glanced at it thoughtfully  the earl of dorminster he repeated i will see him  nigel found himself received with courtesy yet with a certain aloofness prince shan rose from his favourite chair of plain black oak heaped with green silk cushions and held out his hand a little tentatively  you are very kind to visit me lord dorminster he said i trust that you come to wish me fortune  that nigel replied depends upon how you choose to seek it  i am answered was the prompt acknowledgment one thing in your country i have at least learnt to appreciate and that is your love of candour what is your errand with me today have you come to speak to me as an ambassador from your cousin or in any way on her behalf  my business has nothing to do with lady maggie nigel assured him gravely  prince shan held out his hand  stop he begged do not explain your business if it is a personal request it is granted if on the other hand you seek my advice on matters of grave importance it is yours before other words are spoken however i myself desire to address you on the subject of lady maggie trent  as you please nigel answered  it is not the custom of my country or of my life prince shan continued to covet or steal the things which belong to another if fate has made me a thief i am very sorry i have proposed to lady maggie that she accompany me back to china it is my great desire that she should become my wife  nigel felt himself curiously tonguetied there was something in the others measured speech so fateful so assured that it seemed almost as though he were speaking of preordained things much that had seemed to him impossible and unnatural in such an idea disappeared from that moment  you tell me this nigel began  i announce it to you as the head of the family prince shan interrupted  you tell it to me also nigel persisted because you have heard the rumours which were at one time very prevalentthat lady maggie and i were or were about to become engaged to be married  i have heard such a rumour only very indirectly prince shan confessed and i cannot admit that it has made any difference in my attitude i think in my land and yours we have at least one common convention the woman who touches our heart is ours if we may win her love is unalterably selfish one must fight for ones own hand and for those who may suffer by our victory we may have pity but no consideration  am i to understand nigel asked bluntly that lady maggie has consented to be your wife  lady maggie has given me no reply i left her alone with her thoughts every hour it is my hope to hear from her she knows that i leave for china early tomorrow  so at the present moment you are in suspense  i am in suspense prince shan admitted and perhaps he went on with one of his rare smiles it occurred to me that it would be in one sense a relief to speak to a fellow man of the hopes and fears that are in my heart you are the one person to whom i could speak lord dorminster you have not wished my suit well but at least you have been clearsighted i think it has never occurred to you that a prince of china might venture to compete with a peer of england  on the contrary nigel assented i have the greatest admiration for the few living descendants of the worlds oldest aristocracy you have a right to enter the lists a right to win if you can  and what do you think of my prospects if i may ask such a delicate question prince shan enquired  i cannot estimate them nigel replied i only know that maggie is deeply interested  i think his companion continued softly that she will become my princess you have never visited china lord dorminster he went on so you have little idea perhaps as to the manner of our lives some day i will hope to be your host so until then as i may not speak of my own possessions may i go just so far as this your cousin will be very happy in china this is a great country but the very air you breathe is cloyed with your national utilitarianism mine is a country of beautiful thoughts of beautiful places of quietliving and sedate people i can give your cousin every luxury of which the world has ever dreamed wrapped and enshrined in beauty no person with a soul could be unhappy in the places where she will dwell  you are at least confident nigel remarked  it is because i am convinced was the calm rejoinder i shall take your cousins happiness into my keeping without one shadow of misgiving the last word however is with her it remains to be seen whether her courage is great enough to induce her to face such a complete change in the manner of her life  it will not be her lack of courage which will keep her in england nigel declared  prince shan bowed with a graceful little gesture of the hands the subject was finished  i shall now lord dorminster he said take advantage of your kindly presence here to speak to you on a very personal matter only this time it is you who are the central figure and i who am the dummy  i do not follow you nigel confessed with a slight frown  i speak in tones of apology prince shan went on but you must remember that i am one of reflective disposition nature has endowed me with some of the gifts of my great ancestors philosophers famed the world over it seems very clear to me that if i had not come from sheer force of affectionate propinquity you would have married lady maggie  nigels frown deepened  prince shan he began  again the outstretched hand seemed as though the fingers were pressed against his mouth he broke off abruptly in his protest  you would have lived a contented life because that is your province his companion continued you would have felt yourself happy because you would have been a faithful husband but the time would have come when you would both have realised that you had missed the great things  this is idle prophecy nigel observed a little impatiently i came to see you upon another matter  humour me the prince begged i am going to speak to you even more intimately i shall venture to do so because after all she is better known to me than to you i am going to tell you that of all the women in the world naida karetsky is the most likely to make you happy  nigel drew himself up a little stiffly  one does not discuss these things he muttered  may i call that a touch of insularity prince shan pleaded because there is nothing else in the world so wonderful to discuss in all respect and reverence as the women who have made us feel one last word lord dorminster the days of matrimonial alliances between the reigning families of europe have come to an end under the influence of a different form of government but there is a certain type of alliance the utility of which remains unimpaired i venture to say that you could not do your country a greater service apart from any personal feelings you might have than by marrying mademoiselle karetsky there you see now i have finished this is for your reflection lord dorminsterjust the measured statement of one who wears at least the cloak of philosophy by inheritance time passes your own reason for coming to see me has not yet been expounded  i have come to ask you to visit the prime minister before you leave england nigel announced  prince shan changed his position slightly his forehead was a little wrinkled he was silent for a moment  if i pay more than a farewell visit of ceremony he said that is to say if i speak with mr mervin brown on things that count i must anticipate a certain decision at which i have not yet wholly arrived  nigel had a sudden inspiration  you are seeking to bribe maggie he exclaimed  that is not true was the dignified reply  then please explain nigel persisted  prince shan rose to his feet he walked to the heavy silk curtains which led into his own bedchamber pushed them apart and looked for a moment at the familiar objects in the room then he came back glancing on his way at the ebony cabinet  one does not repeat ones mistakes he said slowly and although you and i lord dorminster breathe the common air of the greater world my instinct tells me that of certain things which have passed between your cousin and myself it is better that no mention ever be made i wish to tell you this however there is in existence a document my signature to which would without a doubt have a serious influence upon the destinies of this country that document unsigned would be one of my marriage gifts to lady maggieand as you know i have not yet had her answer however if you wish it i will go to the prime minister  li wen came silently in he spoke to his master for a few minutes in chinese a faint smile parted the latters lips  you can tell the person at the telephone that i will call within the next few minutes he directed you will not object he added turning courteously to nigel if i stop for a moment on the way to downing street at a small private hospital an acquaintance of mine lies sick there and desires urgently to see me  i am entirely at your service nigel assured him  prince shan with many apologies left nigel alone in the car outside a tall grey house in john street and preceded by the whitecapped nurse who had opened the door climbed the stairs to the first floor of the celebrated nursing home where after a moments delay he was shown into a large and airy apartment immelan was in bed looking very ill indeed he was pale and his chinablue eyes curiously protruding were filled with an expression of haunting fear a puzzled doctor was standing by the bedside a nurse who was smoothing the bedclothes glanced around at prince shans entrance the invalid started convulsively and clutching the pillows with his right hand turned towards his visitor  so youve come he exclaimed stay where yon are dont go doctornurseleave us alone for a moment  the nurse went at once the doctor hesitated  my patient is a good deal exhausted he said there are no dangerous symptoms at present but  i will promise not to distress him prince shan interrupted i am myself somewhat pressed for time and it is probable that your patient will insist upon speaking to me in private  the doctor followed the nurse from the room prince shan stood looking down upon the figure of quondam associate there was a leaven of mild wonder in his clear eyes a faintly contemptuous smile about the corners of his lips  so you are afraid of death my friend he observed afraid of the death you planned so skilfully for me  it is a lie immelan declared excitedly sen lu was never killed by my orders listen you have nothing against me my death can do you no good it is you who have been at fault youprince shanthe great diplomatist of the worldare gambling away your future and the future of a mighty empire for a womans sake you have treated me badly enough spare my life call in the doctor here and tell him what to do he can find nothing in my system he is helpless  the smile upon the princes lips became vaguer his expression more bland and indeterminate  my dear immelan he murmured you are without doubt delirious compose yourself i beg  a light that was almost tragic shone in the mans face he sat up with a sudden access of strength  for the love of god dont torture me he groaned the pains grow worse hour by hour if i die the whole world shall know by whose hand  the expression on prince shans face remained unchanged in his eyes however there was a little glint of something which seemed almost like foreknowledge  when you die he pronounced calmly it will be by your own handnot mine  for some reason or other immelan accepted these measured words of prophecy as a total reprieve the relief in his face was almost piteous he seized his visitors hand and would have fawned upon it prince shan withdrew himself a little farther from the bed  immelan he said during my stay in england i have studied you and your methods i have listened to all you have had to say and to propose i have weighed the advantages and the disadvantages of the scheme you have outlined to me and i only arrived at my decision after the most serious and unbiassed reflection your scheme itself was bold and almost splendid but as you yourself well know at the back of your mind it would lay the seeds of a world tumult i have studied history immelan perhaps a little more deeply than you and i do not believe in conquests for the restoration to china of such lands as belong geographically and rightly to the chinese empire i have my own plans you it seems to me would make a catspaw of all asia to gratify your hatred of england  a catspaw immelan gasped australia new zealand and india for japan new lands for her teeming population thibet for you all manchuria and the control of the siberian railway  these are dazzling propositions prince shan admitted and yetwhat about the other side of the pacific  america would be powerless immelan insisted  so you said before in 1917 was the dry reminder i did not come here however to talk world politics with you those things for the moment are finished i came in answer to your summons  immelan raised himself a little in the bed  you meant what you said he demanded with hoarse anxiety there was no poison swear that  prince shan moved towards the door his backward glance was coldly contemptuous  what i said i meant he replied extract such comfort from it as you may  he left the room closing the door softly behind him immelan stared after him holloweyed and anxious already the cold fears were seizing upon him once more  prince shan rejoined nigel and the two men drove off to downing street the former was silent for the first few minutes then he turned slightly towards his companion  the man immelan is a coward he declared it is he whom i have just visited  nigel shrugged his shoulders  so many men are brave enough in a fight he remarked who lose their nerve on a sick bed  bravery in battle prince shan pronounced is the lowest form of courage the blood is stirred by the excitement of slaughter as by alcohol with immelan i shall have no more dealings  speaking politically as well as personally nigel enquired  the other smiled  i think i might go so far as to agree he acquiesced but in a sense there are conditions you shall hear what they are i will speak before you to the prime minister see up above is the sign of my departure  out of a little bank of white fleecy clouds which hung down here and there from the blue sky came the black dragon her engines purring softly her movements slow and graceful both men watched her for a moment in silence  at six oclock tomorrow morning i start prince shan announced my pilot tells me that the weather conditions are wonderful all the way from here to pekin we shall be there on wednesday  you travel alone nigel enquired  i have passengers was the quiet reply i am taking the english chaplain to your church in pekin  the eyes of the two men met  it is an ingenious idea nigel admitted dryly  i wish to be prepared his companion answered it may be that he is my only companion in that case i go back to a life lonelier than i have ever dreamed of it is on the knees of the gods so far there has come no word but although i am not by nature an optimist my superstitions are on my side all the way over on my last voyage when i lay in my berth awake and we sailed over and through the clouds my star my own particular star seemed leaning always down towards me and for that reason i have faith  nigel glanced at his companion curiously but without speech the car pulled up in downing street the two men descended and found everything made easy for them in two minutes they were in the presence of the prime minister     chapter xxx   mr mervin brown was at his best in the interview to which he had as a matter of fact been looking forward with much trepidation he received prince shan courteously and reproached him for not having paid him an earlier visit to the latters request that nigel might be permitted to be present at the discussion he promptly acquiesced  lord dorminster and i have already had some conversation he said bearing upon the matter about which i desire to talk to you  i have found his lordship prince shan declared one of the few englishmen who has any real apprehension of the trend of events outside his own country  the prime minister plunged at once into the middle of things  our national faults are without doubt known to you prince shan he said they include amongst other things an overconfidence in the promises of others too great belief i fear in the probity of our friends we paid a staggering price in 1914 for those qualities lord dorminster would have me believe that there is a still more terrible price for us to pay in the future unless we change our whole outlook abandon our belief in the league of nations and once more acknowledge the supremacy of force  lord dorminster is right prince shan pronounced i have come here to tell you so mr mervin brown  you come here as a friend of england the latter asked  i come here as one who hesitates to become her enemy was the measured reply i will be perfectly frank with you sir i came to this country to discuss a project which with the acquiescence of china and japan would have resulted in the humiliation of your country and the gratification of germanys eagerly desired revenge  you believe in the existence of that sentiment then the prime minister enquired  any one short of a very insular englishman the prince replied would have realised it long ago there is a great society in germany scarcely even a secret society pledged to wipe out the humiliations of the last great war lord dorminster tells me that you are today without a secret service for that reason you have remained in ignorance of the mines beneath your feet germany has laid her plans well and carefully her first and greatest weapon has been your sense of security she has seen you contemplate with an illadvised smile of spurious satisfaction invincible france regaining her wealth more slowly than you for the simple reason that half the man power of the country is absorbed by her military preparations france is impregnable a direct invasion of your country is in all probability impossible those two facts have seemed to you allsufficient that is where you have been if i may say so sir very shortsighted  germany has no power to transport troops in other directions mr mervin brown observed  prince shan smiled  you have another enemy besides germany he pointed out a great democracy who has never forgiven your lack of sympathy at her birth your attempts to repress by force a great upheaval borne in agony and shame yet containing the germs of worthy things which your statesmen in those days failed to discern russia has never forgiven russia stands hand in hand with germany  but surely the prime minister protested you speak in the language of the past the league of nations still exists any directly predatory expedition would bring the rest of the world to arms  prince shan shook his head  one of the first necessities of a tribunal he expounded is that that tribunal should have the power to punish you yourself are one of the judges you might find your culprit guilty with what weapon will you chastise him the culprit has grown mightier than the judge  america  america prince shan interrupted can when she chooses strike a weightier blow than any other nation on earth but she will never again proceed outside her own sphere of influence  but she must protect her trade the prime minister insisted  she has no need to do so by force of arms take my own country for instance we need american machinery american goods locomotives and mining plants america has no need to force these things upon us we are as anxious to buy as she is to sell  i am to figure to myself then mr mervin brown reflected a combination of germany and russia engaged in some scheme inimical to great britain  there was such a scheme definitely arranged and planned prince shan assured him gravely if i had seen well to sign a certain paper you would have lost before the end of this month india your great treasure house australia and new zealand and eventually egypt you would have been as powerless to prevent it as either of us three would be if called upon unarmed to face the champion heavyweight boxer  it is hard for me to credit the fact that officially germany has any knowledge of this scheme the prime minister confessed  official germany would probably deny it prince shan answered dryly official russia might do the same official china would follow suit but the real china in my person assures you of the truth of what i have told you you have never heard i suppose of the three secret cities  i have heard stories about them which sounded like fairy tales mr mervin brown admitted grudgingly  nevertheless they exist prince shan continued and they exist for the purpose of supplying means of offence for the expedition of which i have spoken there is one in germany one in russia and one in china the three between them have produced enough armoured airships of a new design to conquer any country in the world  armoured airships mr mervin brown repeated  airships from which one fights on land as well as in the air prince shan explained on land they become moving fortresses no shell has ever been made which can destroy them i should be revealing no secret to you because i believe i am right in saying sir that a model of these amazing engines of destruction was first submitted to your government  i remember something of the sort the prime minister assented the inventor himself was an american i believe  precisely i believe he told you in plain words that whoever possessed his model might if they chose dominate the world  but who wants to dominate the world by force mr mervin brown demanded passionately we have passed into a new era an era of peace and the higher fellowship it is waste of time labour and money to create these horrible instruments of destruction the league of nations has decreed that they shall not be built  nevertheless prince shan declared with portentous gravity a thousand of these engines of destruction are now ready in a certain city of china each one of the three secret cities has done its quota of work in the shape of providing parts china alone has put them together i bought the secret and i alone possess it it rests with me whether the world remains at peace or moves on to war  you cannot hesitate then mr mervin brown exclaimed anxiously you yourself are an apostle of civilisation  prince shan smiled  it is because we are strong he said that we love peace it is because you are weak that you fear war i am not here to teach you statesmanship it is not for me to point out to you the means by which you can make your country safe and keep her people free call a meeting of what remains of the league of nations and compare your strength with that of the nations who have crept outside and lie waiting then take the advice of experts and set your house in order you sacrifice everything today to the god of commerce take a few men like dorminster here into your councils you are not a nation of fools speak the truth at the next meeting of the league of nations and see that it is properly reported help yourselves and i will help you  will you come into my cabinet lord dorminster the prime minister invited turning to nigel  if you will recreate the post of minister for war i will do so with pleasure was the prompt reply  prince shan held out his hand  there is great responsibility upon your shoulders mr mervin brown he said you will never know how near you have been to disaster try and wake up your nation gradually if you can call together your writers your thinking men your historians encourage the flagging spirit of patriotism in your public schools and universities is this presumption on my part that i give so much advice if so forgive me truth that sits in the heart will sometimes demand to be heard  at the prime ministers request nigel remained behind they both looked at the door through which prince shan had passed mr mervin brown metaphorically pinched himself he was still feeling a little dazed  is that man real flesh and blood he demanded  he is as real and as near the truth nigel replied solemnly as the things of which he has told us     chapter xxxi   that night nigel gave a dinner party on maggies account at the fashionable london hotel of the moment invitations had been sent out by telephone by hurried notes in one or two cases were delivered by word of mouth on the whole the acceptances considering the season was in full swing were a little remarkable every one was anxious to come because as one of her girl friends put it no one ever knew what maggie was going to be up to next one of the few refusals came from prince shan and even he made use of compromise       my dear lord dorminster will you forgive me if in this instance i      do not break a custom to which i have perhaps a little too rigidly      adhered the prime minister telephoned a few minutes after we left      him asking me to meet two of his colleagues from the foreign      office tonight and i doubt whether our conference will have      concluded at the hour you name       however if you will permit me i will give myself the pleasure of      joining you later in the evening to make my adieux to those of my      friends whom i am quite sure i shall find amongst your company       sincerely yours       shan  maggie passed the note back with a little smile she made no comment whatever nigel watched her thoughtfully  i have carried out your orders he observed everything has been attended to even to the colour of your table decorations now tell me what it all means  she looked him in the face quite frankly  how can i she answered i do not know myself  is this by way of being a farewell party he persisted  i do not know that she assured him the only thing is that if i do decideto gowell i shall have had a last glimpse of most of my friends  as your nearest male relative in fact your guardian nigel went on with a touch of his old manner i feel myself deeply interested in your present situation if a little advice from one who is considerably your senior would be acceptable  it wouldnt maggie interrupted quietly there are just two things in life no girl accepts advice uponthe way she does her hair and the man she means to marry you see both are decided by instinct i shall know before dawn tomorrow what i mean to do but until then nothing that anybody could say would make any difference besides your mind ought to be full of your own matrimonial affairs i hear that naida is talking of going back to russia next week  my own affairs are less complex nigel replied i am going to ask naida to marry metonight if i have the opportunity  maggie made a little grimace  there goes my second string she exclaimed nigel you are horribly callous i have never been in the least sure that i havent wanted to marry you myself  nigel lit a cigarette and pushed the box across to his companion  ive frequently felt the same way he confessed the trouble of it is that when the really right person comes along one hasnt any doubt about it whatever i should have made you a stodgy husband maggie  she sniffed  i think that considering the way youve flirted with me she declared you ought at least to have given me the opportunity of refusing you  if naida refuses me he began  and i decide that asia is too far away she interrupted  we may come together after all he said with a resigned little sigh  glib tongue and empty heart she quoted nigel i would never trust you i believe youre in love with naida  and im not quite so sure about you he observed watching the colour rise quickly in her cheeks off with you to dress young woman its past seven and we must be there early i still have the wine to order  the dinner party was in its way a complete success prince karschoff was there benign and distinguished chalmers and one or two other young men from the american embassy there was a sprinkling of maggies girl friends a leaven of the older world in nigels few intimatesand naida very pale but more beautiful than ever in a white velvet gown her hair brushed straight back and with no jewellery save one long rope of pearls nigel who in his capacity as host had found little time for personal conversation during the service of dinner deliberately led her a little apart when they passed out into the lounge for coffee and to watch the dancing  my duties are over for a time he said do you realise that i have not had a word with you alone since our luncheon at ciros  we have all been a little engrossed have we not she murmured i hope that you are satisfied with the way things have turned out  nothing shall induce me to talk politics or empiresaving tonight he declared with a smile i have other things to say  tell me why you asked us all to dine so suddenly she enquired i do not know whether it is my fancy but there seems to be an air of celebration about is there any announcement to be made  he shook his head  none the party was just a whim of maggies  they both looked across towards the ballroom where she was dancing with chalmers  maggie is very beautiful tonight naida said i could scarcely listen to my neighbours conversation at dinner time for looking at her yet she has the air all the time of living in a dream as though something had happened which had lifted her right away from us all i began to wonder she added whether after all oscar immelan had not told me the truth and whether we should not be drinking her health and yours before the evening was over  you could scarcely believe that he whispered if you have any memory at all  there was a faint touch of pink in her cheeks a tinge of colour as delicate as the passing of a gleam of sunshine over a seaglistening shell  but englishmen are so unfaithful she sighed  then i at least am an exception nigel answered swiftly the words which you checked upon my lips the last time we were alone together still live in my heart i think naida the time has come to say them  their immediate neighbours had deserted them he leaned a little towards her  you know so well that i love you naida he said will you be my wife  she looked up at him half laughing yet with tears in her eyes with an impulsive little gesture she caught his hand in hers for a moment  how horribly sure you must have felt of me she complained to have spoken here with all these people around supposing i had told you that my lifes work lay amongst my own people or that i had made up my mind to marry oscar immelan to console him for his great disappointment  i shouldnt have believed you he answered smiling  conceit she exclaimed  he shook his head  in a sense of course i am conceited he replied i am the happiest and proudest man here i really think that after all we ought to turn it into a celebration  the band was playing a waltz naidas head moved to the music and presently nigel rose to his feet with a smile and they passed into the ballroom karschoff and mrs bollington smith watched them with interest  naida is looking very wonderful tonight the latter remarked and nigel too i wonder if there is anything between them  the days of foreign alliances are past karschoff replied but a few intermarriages might be very good for this country  are you serious she asked  absolutely i would not suggest anything of the sort with germany but with this new russia the russia of which naida karetsky is a daughter why not although they will not have me back there russia is some day going to lay down the law to europe  i wonder whether maggie has any ideas of the sort in her mind mrs bollington smith observed she seems curiously abstracted tonight  chalmers came grumblingly up to mrs bollington smith with whom he was an established favourite  lady maggie is treating me disgracefully he complained she will scarcely dance at all she goes around talking to every one as though it were a sort of farewell party  perhaps it may be karschoff remarked quietly  she isnt going away is she chalmers demanded  who knows the prince replied lady maggie is one of those strange people to whom one may look with every confidence for the unexpected  she herself came across to them a few moments later  something tells me she declared that you are talking about me  you are always a very much discussed young lady karschoff rejoined with a little bow  she made a grimace and sank into a chair by her aunt she talked on lightly enough but all the time with that slight suggestion of superficiality which is a sign of strain she glanced often towards the entrance of the lounge yet no one seemed less disturbed when at a few minutes before eleven prince shan came quietly in he made his way at once to mrs bollington smith and bent over her fingers  it is so kind of you and lord dorminster he said to give me this opportunity of saying goodby to a few friends  you are leaving us so soon prince  tomorrow soon after dawn he replied his eyes wandering around the little circle i wish to be in pekin if possible by wednesday so my dragon must spread his wings indeed  he said a few words to almost everybody last of all he came to maggie and no one heard what he said to her there was no change in his face as he bent low over her fingers no sign of anything which might have passed between them as a few minutes later he turned to one side with nigel maggie held out her hand to chalmers the strain seemed to have passed her lips were parted in a wonderful smile her feet moved to the music  come and dance she invited  they moved a few steps away together when maggie came to an abrupt standstill the two stood for a moment as though transfixed their eyes upon the arched entrance which led from the restaurant into the lounge a man was standing there looking around a strange menacing figure a man dressed in the garb of fashion but with the face of a savage with eyes which burned in his head like twin dots of fire with drawn hollow cheeks and mouth a little open like a mad dogs as his eyes fell upon the group and he recognised them a look of horrible satisfaction came into his face he began to approach quite deliberately he seemed to take in by slow degrees every one who stood theremaggie herself and chalmers naida nigel and prince shan he moved forward all the time his right hand was behind him concealed underneath the tails of his dress coat  be careful maggie cried out it is oscar immelan he is mad  some of the party and many of the bystanders had shrunk away from the menacing figure naida stepped out from among the little group of those who were left  oscar she said firmly what is the matter with you you are not well enough to be here  he came to a standstill at close quarters his appearance was even more terrible although by some means he had gotten into his evening clothes he was only partly shaven and there were gashes in his face where the hand which had held his razor had slipped the pupils of his eyes were distended and the eyes themselves seemed to have shrunk back into their sockets his whole frame seemed to have suddenly lost vigour even substance he had the air of a man in clothes too large for him even his voice was shrillershriller and horrible with the slow and bestial satisfaction of his words  so here you are the whole nest of you together eh he exclaimed good very good indeed prince shan the poisoner dorminster enjoying your brief triumph eh and you naida karetsky traitress to your countrydeceiver  that will do immelan nigel interrupted sharply we are all here what do you want with us  that comes immelan replied soon you shall all know why i have come let me speak to my friend shan for a moment i carry your poison in my veins but there is a chancejust a chance he added slowly with a horrible smile upon his lips that you may go first after all  nigel made a stealthy but rapid movement forward drawing naida gently out of the way immelan was too quick however he swung around showing the revolver which he had been concealing behind him and moved to one side until his back was against one of the pillars by this time most of the other occupants of the ballroom had either rushed screaming away altogether or were hiding peering out in fascinated horror from the different recesses the chief maître dhôtel bravely held his ground and came to within a few paces of immelan  we cant have any brawling here he said put that revolver away  immelan took no notice of the intervener except that for a single moment the muzzle yawned in the latters face the maître dhôtel was a brave man but he had a wife and family and after all it was not his affair there were other men there to look after the ladies he hurried off to call for the police almost as he went prince shan stepped into the foreground his voice was calm and expressionless his eyes in which there shone no shadow of fear were steadily fixed upon immelan he spoke without flurry  so you carry your own weapons tonight immelan he said that at least is more like a man you seem to have a grievance against every one start with me what is it  there were some of them who wondered why at this juncture when he so clearly dominated his assailant prince shan whose courage was superb and whose sang froid absolutely unshaken did not throw himself upon this intruder and take his chance of bringing the matter to an end at the moment when the mans nerve was undoubtedly shaken then they looked towards the entrance and they understood creeping towards the little gathering came li wen and another of the princes suite a younger and even more active man the two came on tiptoe crouching and moving warily with the gleam of the tiger in their anxious eyes maggie caught a warning glance from nigel and looked away  you are my murderer immelan cried hoarsely it is through you i suffer these pains i am dying of your accursed poison  if that were true prince shan replied with the air of one willing to discuss the subject impartially might i remind you of sen lu who died in my box at the albert hall for whom was that dagger thrust meant immelan not for the man whom you had bought to betray me the only one of my suite who has ever been tempted with gold that dagger thrust was meant for me and the assassin was one of your creatures so even if your words were true immelan and the poison which you imagine to be in your body were planted there by me are we less than quits  immelans lie was unconvincing  i know nothing of sen lus death he declared i employ no assassins when there is killing to be done i can do it myself i am here tonight for that purpose you have deserted me at the last moment prince shanplayed me and my country false for the sake of the english woman whom you think to carry back with you to china and you he added turning with a sudden furious glance at naida you have deceived the man who trusted you the man who sent you here for one purpose and one purpose only you have done your best to ruin my scheme not only that but you have given the love which was minemine i sayto anotheran englishman i hate you all that is why i a dying man have crawled here to reap my little harvest of vengeanceyou naidayou shall be first  naida was suddenly swung on one side and the shot which rang out passed through nigels coat sleeve grazing his wristthe only shot that was fired prince shan watching for his moment as his two attendants threw themselves upon the madman from behind himself sprang forward knocked immelans right hand up with a terrible blow and sent the revolver crashing to the ground it was a matter of a few seconds immelan when he felt himself seized scarcely struggled the courage of his madness seemed to pass the venom died out of his face he shook like a man in an ague prince shan kicked the revolver on one side and looked scornfully down upon him now a nerveless wreck  immelan he said it is a pity that you did not wait until tomorrow morning you would then have known the truth you are no more poisoned than i am if you had been in chinawell who knows in england there is so much prejudice against the taking of a worthless life that as a guest i subscribed to it and mixed a little orrisroot tooth powder with your vermouth  the mans eyes suddenly opened he was feverishly frantically anxious  tell me that again he shrieked you mean it swear that you mean it  prince shans gesture as he turned away was one of supreme contempt  a shan he said never needs to repeat  there was the bustle of arriving police the story of a revolver which had gone off by accident a very puzzling contretemps expounded for their benefit the situation and the participants in it seemed to dissolve with such facility that it was hard for any one to understand what had actually happened prince shan with maggie on his arm was talking to the leader of the orchestra who had suddenly reappeared the former turned to his companion  it is not my custom to dance he said but the waltz that they were beginning to play seemed to me to have a little of the lure of our own music will you do me the honour  they moved away to the music chalmers stood and watched them with one hand in his pocket and the other on nigels shoulder he turned to naida who was on the other side  nothing like a touch of melodrama for the emotions he grumbled look at lady maggie her head might be touching the clouds and i never saw her eyes shine like that when she danced with me  you dont dance as well as prince shan old fellow nigel told him  and the prince sails for china at dawn naida murmured     chapter xxxii   prince shan stood in the tiny sitting room of his suite upon the black dragon and looked around him critically the walls were of black oak with white inlaid plaques on which a great artist had traced little fanciful figuresa quaint chinese landscape a temple a flowerhung pagoda there were hangings of soft blue silk tapestry brought from one of his northern palaces the cloth which covered the table was of the finest silk there were several bowls of flowers a couch and two comfortable chairs through the open doors of the two bedchambers came a faint glimpse of snowwhite linen a perfume reminiscent at once of almond blossom green tea and crushed lavender and in the little room beyond glistened a silver bath already attired for the voyage his pilot stood on the threshold  is all well your highness he asked  everything is in order prince shan replied ching su is a perfect steward  the reverend gentleman is in his room your highness the pilot went on all the supplies have arrived and the crew are at their stations at what hour will it please your highness to start  prince shan looked through the open window along the wooden platform out to the broad stretch of road which led to london  i announced the hour of my departure as six oclock he replied i cannot leave before in case of any farewell message is the woman of whom i spoke to you here  she is in attendance your highness  she understands that she will not be required unless my other passenger should desire to accompany us  she understands perfectly your highness  prince shan stepped through his private exit on to the narrow wooden platform already the mighty engines had started purring softly but deeply like the deepthroated murmurings of a giant soon to break into a roar it was a light silvery morning with hidden sunshine everywhere on the other side of the vast amphitheatre of flat cindercovered ground the downs crept upwards rolling away to the bluecapped summit of a distant range of hills northwards the pall of london darkened the horizon an untidy medley of houses and factories stretched almost to the gates of the vast air terminus listening intently one could catch the faint roar of the citys awakening traffic punctuated here and there by the shrill whistling of tugs in the river hidden from sight by a shroud of ghostly mist the dock on which prince shan stood was one apportioned to foreign royalty and visitors of note a hundred yards away the madrid boat was on the point of starting her whistles already blowing and her engines commencing to beat presently the great machinery which assisted her flight from the ground commenced its sullen roar there was a chorus of farewell shouts and she glided up into the air a long row of people waving farewells from the windows prince shan glanced at his watchtwenty minutes to six he paced the wooden boards and looked againten minutes to six then he stopped suddenly along that gleaming stretch of private road came a car driven at a rapid pace prince shan stood and watched it and as he watched it seemed almost as though the hidden sun had caught his face and transfigured it he stood as might stand a man who feels his feet upon the clouds his lips trembled there was no one there to seehis attendants stood respectfully in the backgroundbut in his eyes was a rare moisture and for a single moment a little choking at his throat the car turned in under the arched roof prince shans servants obeying his gesture hurried forward and threw open the gates the heavily laden limousine came to a standstill three people descended nigel and naida lingered watching the luggage being unloaded maggie came forward alone  they met a few yards from the entrance to the platform prince shan was bareheaded and maggie at least saw those wonderful things in his face he bent down and took her hands in his  dear and sweet soul he whispered as his lips touched her fingers may my god and yours grant that you shall find happiness  her own eyes were wet as she smiled up at him  i have been so long making up my mind she said and yet i knew all the time i am so gladso happy that i have come think too how wonderful a start we leave the earth for the clouds  it is a wonderful allegory he answered smiling we will take it into our hearts dear one it rests within the power of every human being to search for happiness and in searching to find it i am fortunate because i can take you to beautiful places i can spell out for you the secrets of a new art and a new beauty we can walk in fairy gardens i can give you jewels such as europe has never seen but i can give you maggie nothing so strange and wonderful even to me who know myself as the love which fills my heart  her laugh was like music  i am going to be so happy she murmured  the other two approached and they all shook hands they looked over the amazing little rooms watched the luggage stowed away in some marvellous manner saw the crew every one at his station like a motionless figure then a whistle was blown and once more they all clasped hands  very soon prince shan promised as he and maggie leaned from the window of the car i shall send the black dragon for you lord dorminster and for the one other whom i think you may wish to bring asia is not so far off these days and maggie will love to see her friends  almost imperceptibly the giant airship floated away  watch both of you maggie cried i am sending you down a farewell present she whispered to prince shan who handed her something from his pocket smiled and gave an order the great ship passed in a semicircle and hovered almost exactly above their heads a little shower of small scraps of paper came floating down nigel picked one up examined it and understood he waved his hat  it is maggies farewell gift to england he said the treaty which prince shan never signed  they stood side by side watching with incredible speed the black dragon passed into the clouds and out again then as it roared away eastwards the sun suddenly disclosed itself the airship mounted towards it shimmering and gleaming in every part naida passed her hand a little shyly through her companions arm  isnt that rather a wonderful way to depart in search of happiness she murmured  he smiled down at her  i do not think that we shall find the search very difficult dear he said though our feet may remain upon the earth  naidas lip quivered for a moment then she caught a glimpse of his face and gave a little sigh of content  there is heaven everywhere she whispered
