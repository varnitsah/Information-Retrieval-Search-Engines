95371655	how to fail in literature a lecture by andrew lang   preface   this lecture was delivered at the south kensington museum in aid of the college for working men and women  as the publishers perhaps erroneously believe that some of the few authors who were not present may be glad to study the advice here proffered the lecture is now printed  it has been practically rewritten and like the kiss which the lady returned to rodolphe is revu corrige et considerablement augmente  a l     how to fail in literature   what should be a mans or a womans reason for taking literature as a vocation what sort of success ought they to desire what sort of ambition should possess them  these are natural questions now that so many readers exist in the world all asking for something new now that so many writers are making their pens in running to devour the way over so many acres of foolscap  the legitimate reasons for enlisting too often without receiving the shilling in this army of writers are not far to seek  a man may be convinced that he has useful or beautiful or entertaining ideas within him he may hold that he can express them in fresh and charming language  he may in short have a vocation or feel conscious of a vocation which is not exactly the same thing  there are many thyrsus bearers few mystics many are called few chosen still to be sensible of a vocation is something nay is much for most of us drift without any particular aim or predominant purpose  nobody can justly censure people whose chief interest is in letters whose chief pleasure is in study or composition who rejoice in a fine sentence as others do in a well modelled limb or a delicately touched landscape nobody can censure them for trying their fortunes in literature  most of them will fail for as the booksellers young man told an author once they have the poetic temperament without the poetic power  still among these whom pendennis has tempted in boyhood to run away from school to literature as marryat has tempted others to run away to sea there must be some who will succeed  but an early and intense ambition is not everything any more than a capacity for taking pains is everything in literature or in any art  some have the gift the natural incommunicable power without the ambition others have the ambition but no other gift from any muse  this class is the more numerous but the smallest class of all has both the power and the will to excel in letters  the desire to write the love of letters may shew itself in childhood in boyhood or youth and mean nothing at all a mere harvest of barren blossom without fragrance or fruit  or again the concern about letters may come suddenly when a youth that cared for none of those things is waning it may come when a man suddenly finds that he has something which he really must tell  then he probably fumbles about for a style and his first fresh impulses are more or less marred by his inexperience of an art which beguiles and fascinates others even in their schooldays  it is impossible to prophesy the success of a man of letters from his early promise his early tastes as impossible as it is to predict from her childish grace the beauty of a woman  but the following remarks on how to fail in literature are certainly meant to discourage nobody who loves books and has an impulse to tell a story or to try a song or a sermon  discouragements enough exist in the pursuit of this as of all arts crafts and professions without my adding to them  famine and fear crouch by the portals of literature as they crouch at the gates of the virgilian hades  there is no more frequent cause of failure than doubt and dread a beginner can scarcely put his heart and strength into a work when he knows how long are the odds against his victory how difficult it is for a new man to win a hearing even though all editors and publishers are ever pining for a new man  the young fellow unknown and unwelcomed who can sit down and give all his best of knowledge observation humour care and fancy to a considerable work has got courage in no common portion he deserves to triumph and certainly should not be disheartened by our old experience but there be few beginners of this mark most begin so feebly because they begin so fearfully  they are already too discouraged and can scarce do themselves justice  it is easier to write more or less well and agreeably when you are certain of being published and paid at least than to write well when a dozen rejected manuscripts are cowering as theocritus says in your chest bowing their pale faces over their chilly knees outcast hungry repulsed from many a door  to write excellently brightly powerfully with these poor unwelcomed wanderers returned mss in your possession is difficult indeed  it might be wiser to do as m guy de maupassant is rumoured to have done to write for seven years and shew your essays to none but a mentor as friendly severe as m flaubert  but all men cannot have such mentors nor can all afford so long an unremunerative apprenticeship  for some the better plan is not to linger on the bank and take tea and good advice as keats said but to plunge at once in midstream and learn swimming of necessity  one thing perhaps most people who succeed in letters so far as to keep themselves alive and clothed by their pens will admit namely that their early rejected mss deserved to be rejected  a few days ago there came to the writer an old forgotten beginners attempt by himself  whence it came who sent it he knows not he had forgotten its very existence  he read it with curiosity it was written in a very much better hand than his present scrawl and was perfectly legible  but readable it was not  there was a great deal of work in it on an out of the way topic and the ideas were perhaps not quite without novelty at the time of its composition  but it was cramped and thin and hesitating between several manners above all it was uncommonly dull  if it ever was sent to an editor as i presume it must have been that editor was trebly justified in declining it  on the other hand to be egotistic i have known editors reject the attempts of those old days and afterwards express lively delight in them when they struggled into print somehow somewhere  these worthy men did not even know that they had despised and refused what they came afterwards rather to enjoy  editors and publishers these keepers of the gates of success are not infallible but their opinion of a beginners work is far more correct than his own can ever be  they should not depress him quite but if they are long unanimous in holding him cheap he is warned and had better withdraw from the struggle  he is either incompetent or he has the makings of a browning  he is a genius born too soon  he may readily calculate the chances in favour of either alternative  so much by way of not damping all neophytes equally so much we may say about success before talking of the easy ways that lead to failure  and by success here is meant no glorious triumph the laurels are not in our thoughts nor the enormous opulence about a fourth of a fortunate barristers gains which falls in the lap of a dickens or a trollope faint and fleeting praise a crown with as many prickles as roses a modest hardlygained competence a good deal of envy a great deal of gossipthese are the rewards of genius which constitute a modern literary success  not to reach the moderate competence in literature is for a professional man of letters of all work something like failure but in poetry today a man may succeed as far as his art goes and yet may be unread and may publish at his own expense or not publish at all he pleases himself and a very tiny audience i do not call that failure i regard failure as the goal of ignorance incompetence lack of common sense conceited dulness and certain practical blunders now to be explained and defined  the most ambitious may accept without distrust the following advice as to how to fail in literature  the advice is offered by a mere critic and it is an axiom of the arts that the critics are the fellows who have failed or have not succeeded  the persons who really can paint or play or compose seldom tell us how it is done still less do they review the performances of their contemporaries  that invidious task they leave to the unsuccessful novelists  the instruction the advice are offered by the persons who cannot achieve performance  it is thus that all things work together in favour of failure which indeed may well appear so easy that special instruction however competent is a luxury rather than a necessary  but when we look round on the vast multitude of writers who to all seeming deliberately aim at failure who take every precaution in favour of failure that untutored inexperience can suggest it becomes plain that education in illsuccess is really a popular want in the following remarks some broad general principles making disaster almost inevitable will first be offered and then special methods of failing in all special departments of letters will be ungrudgingly communicated  it is not enough to attain failure we should deserve it the writer by way of insuring complete confidence would modestly mention that he has had ample opportunities of study in this branch of knowledge  while sifting for five or six years the volunteered contributions to a popular periodical he has received and considered some hundredweights of manuscript  in all these myriad contributions he has not found thirty pieces which rose even to the ordinary dead level of magazine work  he has thus enjoyed unrivalled chances of examining such modes of missing success as spontaneously occur to the human intellect to the unaided ingenuity of men women and children 1  he who would fail in literature cannot begin too early to neglect his education and to adopt every opportunity of not observing life and character  none of us is so young but that he may make himself perfect in writing an illegible hand  this method i am bound to say is too frequently overlooked  most manuscripts by ardent literary volunteers are fairly legible  on the other hand there are novelists especially ladies who not only write a hand wholly declining to let itself be deciphered but who fill up the margins with interpolations who write between the lines and who cover the page with scratches running this way and that intended to direct the attention to afterthoughts inserted here and there in corners and on the backs of sheets  to pin in scraps of closely written paper and backs of envelopes adds to the security for failure and produces a rich anger in the publishers reader or the editor  the cultivation of a bad handwriting is an elementary precaution often overlooked  few need to be warned against having their mss typewritten this gives them a chance of being read with ease and interest and this must be neglected by all who have really set their hearts on failure  in the higher matters of education it is well to be as ignorant as possible no knowledge comes amiss to the true man of letters so they who court disaster should know as little as may be  mr stevenson has told the attentive world how in boyhood he practised himself in studying and imitating the styles of famous authors of every age  he who aims at failure must never think of style and should sedulously abstain from reading shakespeare bacon hooker walton gibbon and other english and foreign classics  he can hardly be too reckless of grammar and should always place adverbs and other words between to and the infinitive thus hubert was determined to energetically and on all possible occasions oppose any attempt to entangle him with such  here it will be noticed such is used as a pronoun a delightful flower of speech not to be disregarded by authors who would fail  but some one may reply that several of our most popular novelists revel in the kind of grammar which i am recommending  this is undeniable but certain people manage to succeed in spite of their own earnest endeavours and startling demerits  there is no royal road to failure  there is no rule without its exception and it may be urged that the works of the gentlemen and ladies who break priscians headas they would say themselvesmay be successful but are not literature  now it is about literature that we are speaking  in the matter of style there is another excellent way  you need not neglect it but you may study it wrongly  you may be affectedly self conscious you may imitate the ingenious persons who carefully avoid the natural word the spontaneous phrase and employ some other set of terms which can hardly be construed  you may use like a young essayist whom i have lovingly observed a proportion of eighty adjectives to every sixty five other words of all denominations  you may hunt for odd words and thrust them into the wrong places as where you say that a mans nose is beetling that the sun sank in a cauldron of daffodil chaos and the like 2  you may use common words in an unwonted sense keeping some private interpretation clearly before you  thus you may speak if you like to write partly in the tongue of hellas about assimilating the ethos of a work of art and so write that people shall think of the processes of digestion  you may speak of exhausting the beauty of a landscape and somehow convey the notion of sucking an orange dry  or you may wildly mix your metaphors as when a critic accuses mr browning of giving the irridescence of the poetic afflatus as if the poetic afflatus were blown through a pipe into soap and produced soap bubbles this is a more troublesome method than the mere picking up of every newspaper commonplace that floats into your mind but it is equally certain to leadwhere you want to go  by combining the two fashions a great deal may be done  thus you want to describe a fire at sea and you say the devouring element lapped the quivering spars the mast and the seashouldering keel of the doomed mary jane in one coruscating catastrophe  the sea deeps were incarnadined to an alarming extent by the flames and to escape from such many plunged headlong in their watery bier  as a rule authors who would fail stick to one bad sort of writing either to the newspaper commonplace or to the out of the way and inappropriate epithets or to the common word with a twist on it  but there are examples of the combined method as when we call the trees round a mans house his domestic boscage  this combination is difficult but perfect for its purpose  you cannot write worse than such  to attain perfection the young aspirant should confine his reading to the newspapers carefully selecting his newspapers for many of them will not help him to write ill and to those modern authors who are most praised for their style by the people who know least about the matter  words like fictional and fictive are distinctly to be recommended and there are epithets such as weird strange wild intimate and the rest which blend pleasantly with all the time for always back of for behind belong with for belong to live like i do for as i do  the authors who combine those charms are rare but we can strive to be among them  in short he who would fail must avoid simplicity like a sunken reef and must earnestly seek either the commonplace or the bizarre the slipshod or the affected the newfangled or the obsolete the flippant or the sepulchral  i need not specially recommend you to write in wardourstreet english the sham archaic a lingo never spoken by mortal man and composed of patches borrowed from authors between piers plowman and gabriel harvey  a few literal translations of icelandic phrases may be thrown in the result as furnituredealers say is a madeup article  on the subject of style another hint may be offered  style may be good in itself but inappropriate to the subject  for example style which may be excellently adapted to a theological essay may be but illsuited for a dialogue in a novel  there are subjects of which the poet says     ornari res ipsa vetat contenta doceri  the matter declines to be adorned and is content with being clearly stated  i do not know what would occur if the writer of the money article in the times treated his topic with reckless gaiety  probably that number of the journal in which the essay appeared would have a large sale but the author might achieve professional failure in the office on the whole it may not be the wiser plan to write about the origins of religion in the style which might suit a study of the life of ballet dancers the two mm halevy the learned and the popular would make a blunder if they exchanged styles  yet gibbon never denies himself a jest and montesquieus esprit des lois was called lesprit sur les lois  m renans histoire disrael may almost be called skittish  the french are more tolerant of those excesses than the english  it is a digression but he who would fail can reach his end by not taking himself seriously  if he gives himself no important airs whether out of a freakish humour or real humility depend upon it the public and the critics will take him at something under his own estimate  on the other hand by copying the gravity of demeanour admired by mr shandy in a celebrated parochial animal even a very dull person may succeed in winning no inconsiderable reputation  to return to style and its appropriateness all depends on the work in hand and the audience addressed  thus in his valuable essay on style mr pater says with perfect truth 3  the otiose the facile surplusage why are these abhorrent to the true literary artist except because in literary as in all other arts structure is all important felt or painfully missed everywherethat architectural conception of work which foresees the end in the beginning and never loses sight of it and in every part is conscious of all the rest till the last sentence does but with undiminished vigour unfold and justify the firsta condition of literary art which in contradistinction to another quality of the artist himself to be spoken of later i shall call the necessity of mind in style  these are words which the writer should have always present to his memory if he has something serious that he wants to say or if he wishes to express himself in the classic and perfect manner  but if it is his fate merely to be obliged to say something in the course of his profession or if he is bid to discourse for the pleasure of readers in the underground railway i fear he will often have to forget mr pater it may not be literature the writing of causeries of roundabout papers of rambling articles on a broomstick and yet again it may be literature  parallel allusion the allusive way generally the flowers in the gardenmr pater charges heavily against these  the true artist knows the narcotic force of these upon the negligent intelligence to which any diversion literally is welcome any vagrant intruder because one can go wandering away with it from the immediate subject    in truth all art does but consist in the removal of surplusage from the last finish of the gem engraver blowing away the last particle of invisible dust back to the earliest divination of the finished work to be lying somewhere according to michel angelos fancy in the roughhewn block of stone  excellent but does this apply to every kind of literary art  what would become of montaigne if you blew away his allusions and drove him out of the allusive way where he gathers and binds so many flowers from all the gardens and all the rosehung lanes of literature  montaigne sets forth to write an essay on coaches  he begins with a few remarks on seasickness in the common pig some notes on the pont neuf at paris follow and a theory of why tyrants are detested by men whom they have obliged a glance at coaches is then given next a study of montezumas gardens presently a brief account of the spanish cruelties in mexico and peru lastretombons a nos cocheshe tells a tale of the inca and the devotion of his guard another for hector  the allusive style has its proper place like another if it is used by the right man and the concentrated and structural style has also its higher province  it would not do to employ either style in the wrong place  in a rambling discursive essay for example a mere straying after the bird in the branches or the thorn in the way he might not take the safest road who imitated mr paters style in what follows  in this way according to the wellknown saying the style is the man complex or simple in his individuality his plenary sense of what he really has to say his sense of the world all cautions regarding style arising out of so many natural scruples as to the medium through which alone he can expose that inward sense of things the purity of this medium its laws or tricks of refraction nothing is to be left there which might give conveyance to any matter save that  clearly the author who has to write so that the man may read who runs will fail if he wrests this manner from its proper place and uses it for casual articles he will fail to hold the vagrom attention  thus a great deal may be done by studying inappropriateness of style by adopting a style alien to our matter and to our audience  if we haver discursively about serious and difficult and intricate topics we fail and we fail if we write on happy pleasant and popular topics in an abstruse and intent and analytic style  we fail too if in style we go outside our natural selves  the style is the man and the man will be nothing and nobody if he tries for an incongruous manner not naturally his own for example if miss yonge were suddenly to emulate the manner of lever or if mr john morley were to strive to shine in the fashion of uncle remus or if mr rider haggard were to be allured into imitation by the example so admirable in itself of the master of balliol  it is ourselves we must try to improve our attentiveness our interest in life our seriousness of purpose and then the style will improve with the self  or perhaps to be perfectly frank we shall thus convert ourselves into prigs throw ourselves out of our stride lapse into self consciousness lose all that is natural naif and instinctive within us  verily there are many dangers and the paths to failure are infinite  so much for style of which it may generally be said that you cannot be too obscure unnatural involved vulgar slipshod and metaphorical  see to it that your metaphors are mixed though perhaps this attention is hardly needed  the free use of parentheses in which a reader gets lost and of unintelligible allusions and of references to unread authorsthe kalevala and lycophron and the scholiast on apollonius rhodius is invaluable to this end  so much for manner and now for matter  the young author generally writes because he wants to write either for money from vanity or in mere weariness of empty hours and anxiety to astonish his relations  this is well he who would fail cannot begin better than by having nothing to say  the less you observe the less you reflect the less you put yourself in the paths of adventure and experience the less you will have to say and the more impossible will it be to read your work  never notice peoples manner conduct nor even dress in real life  walk through the world with your eyes and ears closed and embody the negative results in a story or a poem  as to poetry with a fine instinct we generally begin by writing verse because verse is the last thing that the public want to read  the young writer has usually read a great deal of verse however and most of it bad  his favourite authors are the bright lyrists who sing of broken hearts wasted lives early deaths disappointment gloom  without having even had an unlucky flirtation or without knowing what it is to lose a favourite cat the early author pours forth laments just like the laments he has been reading  he has too a favourite manner the old consumptive manner about the hectic flush the fatal rose on the pallid cheek about the ruined roof tree the empty chair the rest in the village churchyard  this is now a little rococo and forlorn but failure may be assured by travelling in this direction  if you are ambitious to disgust an editor at once begin your poem with only  in fact you may as well head the lyric only 4     only     only a spark of an ember       only a leaf on the tree    only the days we remember       only the days without thee    only the flower that thou worest       only the book that we read    only that night in the forest       only a dream of the dead    only the troth that was broken       only the heart that is lonely    only the sigh and the token       that sob in the saying of only  in literature this is a certain way of failing but i believe a person might make a livelihood by writing verses like thesefor music  another good way is to be very economical in your rhymes only two to the four lines and regretfully vague  thus     shadows     in the slumber of the winter       in the secret of the snow    what is the voice that is crying       out of the long ago     when the accents of the children       are silent on the stairs    when the poor forgets his troubles       and the rich forgets his cares     what is the silent whisper       that echoes in the room    when the days are full of darkness       and the night is hushed in gloom     tis the voice of the departed       who will never come again    who has left the weary tumult       and the struggle and the pain 5     and my heart makes heavy answer       to the voice that comes no more    to the whisper that is welling       from the far off happy shore  if you are not satisfied with these simple ways of not succeeding please try the grosvenor gallery style  here the great point is to make the rhyme arrive at the end of a very long word you should also be free with your alliterations     lullaby     when the sombre night is dumb    hushed the loud chrysanthemum       sister sleep    sleep the lissom lily saith    sleep the poplar whispereth       soft and deep     filmy floats the wild woodbine    jonquil jacinth jessamine       float and flow    sleeps the water wild and wan    as in far off toltecan       mexico     see upon the sundial    waves the midnights misty pall       waves and wakes    as in tropic timbuctoo    water beasts go plashing through       lilied lakes  alliteration is a splendid source of failure in this sort of poetry and adjectives like lissom filmy weary weird strange make or ought to make the rejection of your manuscript a certainty  the poem should as a rule seem to be addressed to an unknown person and should express regret and despair for circumstances in the past with which the reader is totally unacquainted  thus     ghosts     we met at length as souls that sit    at funeral feast and taste of it    and empty were the words we said    as fits the converse of the dead    for it is long ago my dear    since we two met in living cheer    yea we have long been ghosts you know    and alien ways we twain must go    nor shall we meet in shadow land    till times glass empty of its sand    is filled up of eternity    farewellenough for once to die    and far too much it is to dream    and taste not the lethaean stream    but bear the pain of loves unwed    even here even here among the dead  that is a cheerful intelligible kind of melody which is often practised with satisfactory results  every form of imitation imitating of course only the faults of a favourite writer is to be recommended  imitation does a double service it secures the failure of the imitator and also aids that of the unlucky author who is imitated  as soon as a new thing appears in literature many people hurry off to attempt something of the same sort  it may be a particular trait and accent in poetry and the public weary of the mimicries begin to dislike the original     most can grow the flowers now       for all have got the seed    and once again the people       call it but a weed  in fiction if somebody brings in a curious kind of murder or a study of religious problems or a treasure hunt or what you will others imitate till the world is weary of murders or theological flirtations or the search for buried specie and the original authors themselves will fail unless they fish out something new to be vulgarised afresh  therefore imitation is distinctly to be urged on the young author  as a rule his method is this he reads very little but all that he reads is bad  the feeblest articles in the weakliest magazines the very mildest and most conventional novels appear to be the only studies of the majority  apparently the wouldbe contributor says to himself or herself well i can do something almost on the level of this or that maudlin and invertebrate novel  then he deliberately sits down to rival the most tame dull and illiterate compositions that get into print  in this way bad authors become the literary parents of worse authors  nobody but a reader of mss knows what myriads of fiction are written without one single new situation original character or fresh thought  the most outworn ideas sudden loss of fortune struggles faithlessness of first lover noble conduct of second lover frivolity of younger sister excellence of mother naughtiness of one son virtue of another these are habitually served up again and again  on the sprained ankles the mad bulls the fires and other simple devices for doing without an introduction between hero and heroine i need not dwell  the very youngest of us is acquainted with these expedients which by this time of day will spell failure  the common novels of governess life the daughters and granddaughters of jane eyre still run riot among the rejected manuscripts  the lively large family all very untidy and humorous all wearing each others boots and gloves and making their dresses out of bedroom curtains and marrying rich men still rushes down the easy descent to failure  the sceptical curate is at large and is disbelieving in everything except the virtues of the young woman who has a history  mr swinburne hopes that one day the last unbelieving clergyman will disappear in the embrace of the last immaculate magdalen as the princess and the geni burn each other to nothingness in the arabian nights  on that happy day there will be one less of the roads leading to failure  if the pair can carry with them the selfsacrificing characters who take the blame of all the felonies that they did not do and the nice girl who is jilted by the poet and finds that the squire was the person whom she really loved so much the better  if not only monte carlo but the inevitable scene in the rooms there can be abolished if the riviera and italy can be removed from the map of europe as used by novelists so much the better but failure will always be secured while the huge majority of authors do not aim high but aim at being a little lower than the last domestic drivel which came out in three volumes or the last analysis of the inmost self of some introspective young girl which crossed the water from the states  these are general counsels and apply to the production of books  but when you have done your book you may play a number of silly tricks with your manuscript  i have already advised you to make only one copy a rough one as that secures negligence in your work and also disgusts an editor or reader  it has another advantage you may lose your copy altogether and as you have not another no failure can be more complete  the best way of losing it i think and the safest is to give it to somebody you know who has once met some man or woman of letters this somebody must be instructed to ask that busy and perhaps casual and untidy person to read your manuscript and place it that is induce some poor publisher or editor to pay for and publish it  now the man or woman of letters will use violent language on receiving your clumsy brown paper parcel of illegible wares because he or she has no more to do with the matter than the crossing sweeper  the ms will either be put away so carefully that it can never be found again or will be left lying about so that the housemaid may use it for her own domestic purposes like betty barnes the cook of mr warburton who seems to have burned several plays of shakespeare  the ms in short will go where the old moons go     and all dead days drift thither       and all disastrous things  not only can you secure failure thus yourself but you can so worry and badger your luckless victim that he too will be unable to write well till he has forgotten you and your novel and all the annoyance and anxiety you have given him  much may be done by asking him for introductions to an editor or publisher  these gentry dont want introductions they want good books and very seldom get them  if you behave thus the man whom you are boring will write to his publisher     dear brown     a wretched creature who knows my great aunt asks me to recommend his    rubbish to you  i send it by todays post and i wish you joy of it  this kind of introduction will do you excellent service in smoothing the path to failure  you can arrive at similar results by sending your ms not to the editor of this or that magazine but to some one who as you have been told by some nincompoop is the editor and who is not  he may lose your book or he may let it lie about for months or he may send it on at once to the real editor with his bitter malison  the utmost possible vexation is thus inflicted on every hand and a prejudice is established against you which the nature of your work is very unlikely to overcome  by all means bore many literary strangers with correspondence this will give them a lively recollection of your name and an intense desire to do you a bad turn if opportunity arises 6  if your book does in spite of all get itself published send it with your compliments to critics and ask them for favourable reviews  it is the publishers business to send out books to the editors of critical papers but never mind that  go on telling critics that you know praise is only given by favour that they are all more or less venal and corrupt and members of the something club add that you are no member of a coterie nor clique but that you hope an exception will be made and that your volume will be applauded on its merits  you will thus have done what in you lies to secure silence from reviewers and to make them request that your story may be sent to some other critic  this again gives trouble and makes people detest you and your performance and contributes to the end which you have steadily in view  i do not think it is necessary to warn young lady novelists who possess beauty wealth and titles against asking reviewers to dine and treating them as kindly almost as the fairy paribanou treated prince ahmed  they only act thus i fear in mr william blacks novels  much may be done by rewriting your book on the proof sheets correcting everything there which you should have corrected in manuscript  this is an expensive process and will greatly diminish your pecuniary gains or rather will add to your publishers bill for the odds are that you will have to publish at your own expense  by the way an author can make almost a certainty of disastrous failure by carrying to some small obscure publisher a work which has been rejected by the best people in the trade  their rejections all but demonstrate that your book is worthless  if you think you are likely to make a good thing by employing an obscure publisher with little or no capital then as some one in thucydides remarks congratulating you on your simplicity i do not envy your want of common sense  be very careful to enter into a perfectly preposterous agreement  for example accept half profits but forget to observe that before these are reckoned it is distinctly stated in your agreement that the publisher is to pay himself some twenty per cent on the price of each copy sold before you get your share  here is another way as the cookery books have it  in your gratitude to your first publisher covenant with him to let him have all the cheap editions of all your novels for the next five years at his own terms if in spite of the advice i have given you you somehow manage to succeed to become wildly popular you will still have reserved to yourself by this ingenious clause a chance of ineffable pecuniary failure  a plan generally approved of is to sell your entire copyright in your book for a very small sum  you want the ready money and perhaps you are not very hopeful  but when your book is in all mens hands when you are daily reviled by the small fry of paragraphers when the publisher is clearing a thousand a year by it while you only got a hundred down then you will thank me and will acknowledge that in spite of apparent success you are a failure after all  there are publishers however so inconsiderate that they will not leave you even this consolation  finding that the book they bought cheap is really valuable they will insist on sharing the profits with the author or on making him great presents of money to which he has no legal claim  some persons some authors cannot fail if they would so wayward is fortune and such a quixotic idea of honesty have some middlemen of literature  but of course you may light on a publisher who will not give you more than you covenanted for and then you can go about denouncing the whole profession as a congregation of robbers and clerks of st nicholas  the ways of failure are infinite and of course are not nearly exhausted one good plan is never to be yourself when you write to put in nothing of your own temperament manner characteror to have none which does as well  another favourite method is to offer the wrong kind of article to send to the cornhill an essay on the evolution of the hittite syllabary for only one author could make that popular or a sketch of cock fighting among the ancients to the monthly record or an essay on ayahs in india to an american magazine or a biography of washington or lincoln to any english magazine whatever  we have them every month in some american periodicals and our poor insular serials can get on without them have no use for them  it is a minor though valuable scheme to send poems on christmas to magazines about the beginning of december because in fact the editors have laid in their stock of that kind of thing earlier  always insist on seeing an editor instead of writing to him  there is nothing he hates so much unless you are very young and beautiful indeed when perhaps if you wish to fail you had better not pay him a visit at the office even if you do even if you were as fair as the golden helen he is not likely to put in your compositions if as is probable they fall much below the level of his magazine  a good way of making yourself a dead failure is to go about accusing successful people of plagiarising from books or articles of yours which did not succeed and perhaps were never published at all  by encouraging this kind of vanity and spite you may entirely destroy any small powers you once happened to possess you will besides become a person with a grievance and in the long run will be shunned even by your fellow failures  again you may plagiarise yourself if you can it is not easy but it is a safe way to fail if you can manage it  no successful person perhaps was ever in the strict sense a plagiarist though charges of plagiary are always brought against everybody from virgil to milton from scott to moliere who attains success  when you are accused of being a plagiarist and shewn up in double columns you may be pretty sure that all this counsel has been wasted on you and that you have failed to fail after all  otherwise nobody would envy and malign you and garble your book and print quotations from it which you did not write all in the sacred cause of morality  advice on how to secure the reverse of success should not be given to young authors alone  their kinsfolk and friends also can do much for their aid  a lady who feels a taste for writing is very seldom allowed to have a quiet room a quiet study  if she retreats to her chill and fireless bed chamber even there she may be chevied by her brothers sisters and mother  it is noticed that cousins and aunts especially aunts are of high service in this regard  they never give an intelligent woman an hour to herself  is miss mary in  yes maam but she is very busy  oh she wont mind me i dont mean to stay long  then in rushes the aunt  over your books again my dear  you really should not overwork yourself  writing something here the aunt clutches the manuscript and looks at it vaguely  well i dare say its very clever but i dont care for this kind of thing myself  wheres your mother  is jane better  now do tell me do you get much for writing all that  do you send it to the printers or where  how interesting and that reminds me you that are a novelist have you heard how shamefully miss baxter was treated by captain smith no well you might make something out of it  here follows the anecdote at prodigious length and perfectly incoherent  now write that and i shall always say i was partly the author  you really should give me a commission you know  well good bye tell your mother i called  why there she is i declare  oh susan just come and hear the delightful plot for a novel that i have been giving mary  and then she begins again only further back this time  it is thus that the aunts of england may and do assist their nieces to fail in literature  many and many a morning do they waste many a promising fancy have they blighted many a temper have they spoiled  sisters are rather more sympathetic the favourite plan of the brother is to say now mary read us your new chapter  mary reads it and the critic exclaims well of all the awful rot  now why cant you do something like bootless baby  fathers never take any interest in the business at all they do not count  the sympathy of a mother may be reckoned on but not her judgement for she is either wildly favourable or mistrusting her own tendencies is more diffident than need be  the most that relations can do for the end before us is to worry interrupt deride and tease the literary member of the family  they seldom fail in these duties and not even success as a rule can persuade them that there is anything in it but luck  perhaps reviewing is not exactly a form of literature  but it has this merit that people who review badly not only fail themselves but help others to fail by giving a bad idea of their works  you will of course never read the books you review and you will be exhaustively ignorant of the subjects which they treat  but you can always find fault with the title of the story which comes into your hands a stupid reviewer never fails to do this  you can also copy out as much of the preface as will fill your eighth of a column and add that the performance is not equal to the promise  you must never feel nor shew the faintest interest in the work reviewed that would be fatal  never praise heartily that is the sign of an intelligence not mediocre  be vague colourless and languid this deters readers from approaching the book  if you have glanced at it blame it for not being what it never professed to be if it is a treatise on greek prosody censure the lack of humour if it is a volume of gay verses lament the authors indifference to the sorrows of the poor or the wrongs of the armenians if it has humour deplore its lack of thoughtfulness if it is grave carp at its lack of gaiety  i have known a reviewer of half a dozen novels denounce half a dozen kinds of novels in the course of his two columns the romance of adventure the domestic tale the psychological analysis the theological story the detectives story the story of society he blamed them all in general and the books before him in particular also the historical novel  this can easily be done by dint of practice after dipping into three or four pages of your author  many reviewers have special aversions authors they detest  whatever they are criticising novels poems plays they begin by an attack on their pet aversion who has nothing to do with the matter in hand  they cannot praise a b c and d without first assailing e  it will generally be found that e is a popular author  but the great virtue of a reviewer who would be unreadable and make others unread is a languid ignorant lack of interest in all things a habit of regarding his work as a tedious task to be scamped as rapidly and stupidly as possible  you might think that these qualities would displease the reviewers editor  not at all look at any column of short notices and you will occasionally find that the critic has anticipated my advice  there is no topic in which the men who write about it are so little interested as contemporary literature  perhaps this is no matter to marvel at  by the way a capital plan is not to write your review till the book has been out for two years  this is the favourite dodge of the  that distinguished journal  if any one has kindly attended to this discourse without desiring to be a failure he has only to turn the advice outside in  he has only to be studious of the very best literature observant careful original he has only to be himself and not an imitator to aim at excellence and not be content with falling a little lower than mediocrity  he needs but bestow the same attention on this art as others give to the other arts and other professions  with these efforts and with a native and natural gift which can never be taught never communicated and with his mind set not on his reward but on excellence on style on matter and even on the not wholly unimportant virtue of vivacity a man will succeed or will deserve success  first of course he will have to find himself as the french say and if he does not find an ass then like saul the son of kish he may discover a kingdom  one success he can hardly miss the happiness of living not with trash but among good books and the mighty minds of old  in an unpublished letter of mr thackerays written before he was famous and a novelist he says how much he likes writing on historical subjects and how he enjoys historical research the work is so gentlemanly he remarks  often and often after the daily dreadful lines the bread and butter winning lines on some contemporary folly or frivolity does a man take up some piece of work hopelessly unremunerative foredoomed to failure as far as money or fame go some dealing with the classics of the world homer or aristotle lucian or moliere  it is like a bath after a days toil it is tonic and clean and such studies if not necessary to success are at least conducive to mental health and selfrespect in literature  to the enormous majority of persons who risk themselves in literature not even the smallest measure of success can fall  they had better take to some other profession as quickly as may be they are only making a sure thing of disappointment only crowding the narrow gates of fortune and fame  yet there are others to whom success though easily within their reach does not seem a thing to be grasped at  of two such the pathetic story may be read in the memoir of a scotch probationer mr thomas davidson who died young an unplaced minister of the united presbyterian church in 1869  he died young unaccepted by the world unheard of uncomplaining soon after writing his latest song on the first grey hairs of the lady whom he loved  and she miss alison dunlop died also a year ago leaving a little work newly published anent old edinburgh in which is briefly told the story of her life  there can hardly be a true tale more brave and honourable for those two were eminently qualified to shine with a clear and modest radiance in letters  both had a touch of poetry mr davidson left a few genuine poems both had humour knowledge patience industry and literary conscientiousness  no success came to them they did not even seek it though it was easily within the reach of their powers  yet none can call them failures leaving as they did the fragrance of honourable and uncomplaining lives and such brief records of these as to delight and console and encourage us all  they bequeath to us the spectacle of a real triumph far beyond the petty gains of money or of applause the spectacle of lives made happy by literature unvexed by notoriety unfretted by envy  what we call success could never have yielded them so much for the ways of authorship are dusty and stony and the stones are only too handy for throwing at the few that deservedly or undeservedly make a name and therewith about onetenth of the wealth which is ungrudged to physicians or barristers or stockbrokers or dentists or electricians  if literature and occupation with letters were not its own reward truly they who seem to succeed might envy those who fail  it is not wealth that they win as fortunate men in other professions count wealth it is not rank nor fashion that come to their call nor come to call on them  their success is to be let dwell with their own fancies or with the imaginations of others far greater than themselves their success is this living in fantasy a little remote from the hubbub and the contests of the world  at the best they will be vexed by curious eyes and idle tongues at the best they will die not rich in this worlds goods yet not unconsoled by the friendships which they win among men and women whose faces they will never see  they may well be content and thrice content with their lot yet it is not a lot which should provoke envy nor be coveted by ambition  it is not an easy goal to attain as the crowd of aspirants dream nor is the reward luxurious when it is attained  a garland usually fading and not immortal has to be run for not without dust and heat     footnotes   1  as the writer has ceased to sift editorially the contributions of the age he does hope that authors will not instantly send him their mss but if they do after this warning they will take the most direct and certain road to the waste paper basket  no mss will be returned even when accompanied by postage stamps  2  i have made a rich selection of examples from the works of living english and american authors  from the inextensive volumes of an eminent and fastidious critic i have culled a dear phrase about an oasis of style in a desert of literary limpness  but it were hardly courteous and might be dangerous to publish these exotic blossoms of art  3  appreciations p 18  4  it was the custom of longinus of the author of the bathos and other old critics to take their examples of how not to do it from the works of famous writers such as sir richard blackmore and herodotus  it seems altogether safer and more courteous for an author to supply his own awful examples  the musical rights in the following poems are reserved  5  or if you prefer the other rhyme read and the wilderness of men  6  it is a teachable public since this lecture was delivered the author has received many mss from people who said they had heard the discourse and enjoyed it so much
