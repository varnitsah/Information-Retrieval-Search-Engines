have left a chasm   and in the chasm are foam and yellow sands   beyond red roofs about a narrow wharf   in cluster then a moulderd church and higher   a long street climbs to one talltowerd mill   and high in heaven behind it a gray down   with danish barrows and a hazelwood   by autumn nutters haunted flourishes   green in a cuplike hollow of the down      here on this beach a hundred years ago   three children of three houses annie lee   the prettiest little damsel in the port   and philip ray the millers only son   and enoch arden a rough sailors lad   made orphan by a winter shipwreck playd   among the waste and lumber of the shore   hard coils of cordage swarthy fishingnets   anchors of rusty fluke and boats updrawn   and built their castles of dissolving sand   to watch them overflowd or following up   and flying the white breaker daily left   the little footprint daily washd away      a narrow cave ran in beneath the cliff   in this the children playd at keeping house   enoch was host one day philip the next   while annie still was mistress but at times   enoch would hold possession for a week   this is my house and this my little wife   mine too said philip turn and turn about   when if they quarrelld enoch strongermade   was master then would philip his blue eyes   all flooded with the helpless wrath of tears   shriek out i hate you enoch and at this   the little wife would weep for company   and pray them not to quarrel for her sake   and say she would be little wife to both      but when the dawn of rosy childhood past   and the new warmth of lifes ascending sun   was felt by either either fixt his heart   on that one girl and enoch spoke his love   but philip loved in silence and the girl   seemd kinder unto philip than to him   but she loved enoch tho she knew it not   and would if askd deny it  enoch set   a purpose evermore before his eyes   to hoard all savings to the uttermost   to purchase his own boat and make a home   for annie and so prosperd that at last   a luckier or a bolder fisherman   a carefuller in peril did not breathe   for leagues along that breakerbeaten coast   than enoch  likewise had he served a year   on board a merchantman and made himself   full sailor and he thrice had pluckd a life   from the dread sweep of the downstreaming seas   and all me lookd upon him favorably   and ere he touchd his oneandtwentieth may   he purchased his own boat and made a home   for annie neat and nestlike halfway up   the narrow street that clamberd toward the mill      then on a golden autumn eventide   the younger people making holiday   with bag and sack and basket great and small   went nutting to the hazels  philip stayd   his father lying sick and needing him   an hour behind but as he climbd the hill   just where the prone edge of the wood began   to feather toward the hollow saw the pair   enoch and annie sitting handinhand   his large gray eyes and weatherbeaten face   allkindled by a still and sacred fire   that burnd as on an altar  philip lookd   and in their eyes and faces read his doom   then as their faces drew together groand   and slipt aside and like a wounded life   crept down into the hollows of the wood   there while the rest were loud in merrymaking   had his dark hour unseen and rose and past   bearing a lifelong hunger in his heart      so these were wed and merrily rang the bells   and merrily ran the years seven happy years   seven happy years of health and competence   and mutual love and honorable toil   with children first a daughter  in him woke   with his first babes first cry the noble wish   to save all earnings to the uttermost   and give his child a better bringingup   than his had been or hers a wish renewd   when two years after came a boy to be   the rosy idol of her solitudes   while enoch was abroad on wrathful seas   or often journeying landward for in truth   enochs white horse and enochs oceanspoil   in oceansmelling osier and his face   roughreddend with a thousand winter gales   not only to the marketcross were known   but in the leafy lanes behind the down   far as the portalwarding lionwhelp   and peacockyewtree of the lonely hall   whose friday fare was enochs ministering      then came a change as all things human change   ten miles to northward of the narrow port   opend a larger haven thither used   enoch at times to go by land or sea   and once when there and clambering on a mast   in harbor by mischance he slipt and fell   a limb was broken when they lifted him   and while he lay recovering there his wife   bore him another son a sickly one   another hand crept too across his trade   taking her bread and theirs and on him fell   altho a grave and staid godfearing man   yet lying thus inactive doubt and gloom   he seemd as in a nightmare of the night   to see his children leading evermore   low miserable lives of handtomouth   and her he loved a beggar then he prayd   save them from this whatever comes to me   and while he prayd the master of that ship   enoch had served in hearing his mischance   came for he knew the man and valued him   reporting of his vessel chinabound   and wanting yet a boatswain  would he go   there yet were many weeks before she saild   saild from this port  would enoch have the place   and enoch all at once assented to it   rejoicing at that answer to his prayer      so now that the shadow of mischance appeard   no graver than as when some little cloud   cuts off the fiery highway of the sun   and isles a light in the offing yet the wife   when he was gonethe childrenwhat to do   then enoch lay longpondering on his plans   to sell the boatand yet he loved her well   how many a rough sea had he weatherd in her   he knew her as a horseman knows his horse   and yet to sell herthen with what she brought   buy goods and storesset annie forth in trade   with all that seamen needed or their wives   so might she keep the house while he was gone   should he not trade himself out yonder go   this voyage more than once yea twice or thrice   as oft as neededlast returning rich   become the master of a larger craft   with fuller profits lead an easier life   have all his pretty young ones educated   and pass his days in peace among his own      thus enoch in his heart determined all   then moving homeward came on annie pale   nursing the sickly babe her latestborn   forward she started with a happy cry   and laid the feeble infant in his arms   whom enoch took and handled all his limbs   appraised his weight and fondled fatherlike   but had no heart to break his purposes   to annie till the morrow when he spoke      then first since enochs golden ring had girt   her finger annie fought against his will   yet not with brawling opposition she   but manifold entreaties many a tear   many a sad kiss by day and night renewd   sure that all evil would come out of it   besought him supplicating if he cared   for here or his dear children not to go   he not for his own self caring but her   her and her children let her plead in vain   so grieving held his will and bore it thro      for enoch parted with his old seafriend   bought annie goods and stores and set his hand   to fit their little streetward sittingroom   with shelf and corner for the goods and stores   so all day long till enochs last at home   shaking their pretty cabin hammer and axe   auger and saw while annie seemd to hear   her own deathscaffold raising shrilld and rang   till this was ended and his careful hand   the space was narrowhaving orderd all   almost as neat and close as nature packs   her blossom or her seedling paused and he   who needs would work for annie to the last   ascending tired heavily slept till morn      and enoch faced this morning of farewell   brightly and boldly  all his annies fears   save as his annies were a laughter to him   yet enoch as a brave godfearing man   bowd himself down and in that mystery   where godinman is one with maningod   prayd for a blessing on his wife and babes   whatever came to him and then he said   annie this voyage by the grace of god   will bring fair weather yet to all of us   keep a clean hearth and a clear fire for me   for ill be back my girl before you know it   then lightly rocking babys cradle and he   this pretty puny weakly little one   nayfor i love him all the better for it   god bless him he shall sit upon my knees   and i will tell him tales of foreign parts   and make him merry when i come home again   come annie come cheer up before i go      him running on thus hopefully she heard   and almost hoped herself but when he turnd   the current of his talk to graver things   in sailor fashion roughly sermonizing   on providence and trust in heaven she heard   heard and not heard him as the village girl   who sets her pitcher underneath the spring   musing on him that used to fill it for her   hears and not hears and lets it overflow      at length she spoke o enoch you are wise   and yet for all your wisdom well know i   that i shall look upon your face no more      well then said enoch i shall look on yours   annie the ship i sail in passes here   he named the day get you a seamans glass   spy out my face and laugh at all your fears      but when the last of those last moments came   annie my girl cheer up be comforted   look to the babes and till i come again   keep everything shipshape for i must go   and fear no more for me or if you fear   cast all your cares on god that anchor holds   is he not yonder in those uttermost   parts of the morning if i flee to these   can i go from him and the sea is his   the sea is his he made it                                  enoch rose   cast his strong arms about his drooping wife   and kissd his wonderstricken little ones   but for the third sickly one who slept   after a night of feverous wakefulness   when annie would have raised him enoch said   wake him not let him sleep how should this child   remember this and kissed him in his cot   but annie from her babys forehead clipt   a tiny curl and gave it this he kept   thro all his future but now hastily caught   his bundle waved his hand and went his way      she when the day that enoch mentiond came   borrowd a glass but all in vain perhaps   she could not fix the glass to suit her eye   perhaps her eye was dim hand tremulous   she saw him not and while he stood on deck   waving the moment and the vessel past      evn to the last dip of the vanishing sail   she watchd it and departed weeping for him   then tho she mournd his absence as his grave   set her sad will no less to chime with his   but throve not in her trade not being bred   to barter nor compensating the want   by shrewdness neither capable of lies   nor asking overmuch and taking less   and still foreboding what would enoch say   for more than once in days of difficulty   and pressure had she sold her wares for less   than what she gave in buying what she sold   she faild and saddend knowing it and thus   expectant of that news that never came   gaind for here own a scanty sustenance   and lived a life of silent melancholy      now the third child was sicklyborn and grew   yet sicklier tho the mother cared for it   with all a mothers care nevertheless   whether her business often calld her from it   or thro the want of what it needed most   or means to pay the voice who best could tell   what most it neededhowsoeer it was   after a lingeringere she was aware   like the caged bird escaping suddenly   the little innocent soul flitted away      in that same week when annie buried it   philips true heart which hungerd for her peace   since enoch left he had not lookd upon her   smote him as having kept aloof so long   surely said philip i may see her now   may be some little comfort therefore went   past thro the solitary room in front   paused for a moment at an inner door   then struck it thrice and no one opening   enterd but annie seated with her grief   fresh from the burial of her little one   cared not to look on any human face   but turnd her own toward the wall and wept   then philip standing up said falteringly   annie i came to ask a favor of you      he spoke the passion in her moand reply   favor from one so sad and so forlorn   as i am half abashd him yet unaskd   his bashfulness and tenderness at war   he set himself beside her saying to her      i came to speak to you of what he wishd   enoch your husband i have ever said   you chose the best among usa strong man   for where he fixt his heart he set his hand   to do the thing he willd and bore it thro   and wherefore did he go this weary way   and leave you lonely not to see the world   for pleasurenay but for the wherewithal   to give his babes a better bringingup   than his had been or yours that was his wish   and if he come again vext will he be   to find the precious morning hours were lost   and it would vex him even in his grave   if he could know his babes were running wild   like colts about the waste  so annie now   have we not known each other all our lives   i do beseech you by the love you bear   him and his children not to say me nay   for if you will when enoch comes again   why then he shall repay meif you will   anniefor i am rich and welltodo   now let me put the boy and girl to school   this is the favor that i came to ask      then annie with her brows against the wall   answerd i cannot look you in the face   i seem so foolish and so broken down   when you came in my sorrow broke me down   and now i think your kindness breaks me down   but enoch lives that is borne in on me   he will repay you money can be repaid   not kindness such as yours                                 and philip askd   then you will let me annie                                  there she turnd   she rose and fixt her swimming eyes upon him   and dwelt a moment on his kindly face   then calling down a blessing on his head   caught at his hand and wrung it passionately   and past into the little garth beyond   so lifted up in spirit he moved away      then philip put the boy and girl to school   and bought them needful books and everyway   like one who does his duty by his own   made himself theirs and tho for annies sake   fearing the lazy gossip of the port   he oft denied his heart his dearest wish   and seldom crost her threshold yet he sent   gifts by the children gardenherbs and fruit   the late and early roses from his wall   or conies from the down and now and then   with some pretext of fineness in the meal   to save the offence of charitable flour   from his tall mill that whistled on the waste      but philip did not fathom annies mind   scarce could the woman when he came upon her   out of full heart and boundless gratitude   light on a broken word to thank him with   but philip was her childrens allinall   from distant corners of the street they ran   to greet his hearty welcome heartily   lords of his house and of his mill were they   worried his passive ear with petty wrongs   or pleasures hung upon him playd with him   and calld him father philip  philip gaind   as enoch lost for enoch seemd to them   uncertain as a vision or a dream   faint as a figure seen in early dawn   down at the far end of an avenue   going we know not where and so ten years   since enoch left his hearth and native land   fled forward and no news of enoch came      it chanced one evening annies children longd   to go with others nutting to the wood   and annie would go with them then they beggd   for father philip as they calld him too   him like the working bee in blossomdust   blanchd with his mill they found and saying to him   come with us father philip he denied   but when the children pluckd at him to go   he laughd and yielding readily to their wish   for was not annie with them and they went      but after scaling half the weary down   just where the prone edge of the wood began   to feather toward the hollow all her force   faild her and sighing let me rest she said   so philip rested with her wellcontent   while all the younger ones with jubilant cries   broke from their elders and tumultuously   down thro the whitening hazels made a plunge   to the bottom and dispersed and beat or broke   the lithe reluctant boughs to tear away   their tawny clusters crying to each other   and calling here and there about the wood      but philip sitting at her side forgot   her presence and rememberd one dark hour   here in this wood when like a wounded life   he crept into the shadow at last he said   lifting his honest forehead listen annie   how merry they are down yonder in the wood   tired annie for she did not speak a word   tired but her face had falln upon her hands   at which as with a kind anger in him   the ship was lost he said the ship was lost   no more of that why should you kill yourself   and make them orphans quite  and annie said   i thought not of it buti known not why   their voices make me feel so solitary      then philip coming somewhat closer spoke   annie there is a thing upon my mind   and it has been upon my mind so long   that tho i know not when it first came there   i know that it will out at last  o annie   it is beyond all hope against all chance   that he who left you ten long years ago   should still be living well thenlet me speak   i grieve to see you poor and wanting help   i cannot help you as i wish to do   unlessthey say that women are so quick   perhaps you know what i would have you know   i wish you for my wife  i fain would prove   a father to your children i do think   they love me as a father i am sure   that i love them as if they were mine own   and i believe if you were fast my wife   that after all these sad uncertain years   we might be still as happy as god grants   to any of his creatures  think upon it   for i am welltodono kin no care   no burthen save my care for you and yours   and we have known each other all our lives   and i have loved you longer than you know      then answerd annie tenderly she spoke   you have been as gods good angel in our house   god bless you for it god reward you for it   philip with something happier than myself   can one live twice can you be ever loved   as enoch was what is it that you ask   i am content he answerd to be loved   a little after enoch  o she cried   scared as it were dear philip wait a while   if enoch comesbut enoch will not come   yet wait a year a year is not so long   surely i shall be wiser in a year   o wait a little  philip sadly said   annie as i have waited all my life   i well may wait a little  nay she cried   i am bound you have my promisein a year   will you not bide your year as i bide mine   and philip answerd i will bide my year      here both were mute till philip glancing up   beheld the dead flame of the fallen day   pass from the danish barrow overhead   then fearing night and chill for annie rose   and sent his voice beneath him thro the wood   up came the children laden with their spoil   then all descended to the port and there   at annies door he paused and gave his hand   saying gently annie when i spoke to you   that was your hour of weakness  i was wrong   i am always bound to you but you are free   then annie weeping answerd i am bound      she spoke and in one moment as it were   while yet she went about her household ways   evn as she dwelt upon his latest words   that he had loved her longer than she knew   that autumn into autumn flashd again   and there he stood once more before her face   claiming her promise  is it a year she askd   yes if the nuts he said be ripe again   come out and see  but sheshe put him off   so much to look tosuch a changea month   give her a monthshe knew that she was bound   a monthno more  then philip with his eyes   full of that lifelong hunger and his voice   shaking a little like a drunkards hand   take your own time annie take your own time   and annie could have wept for pity of him   and yet she held him on delayingly   with many a scarcebelievable excuse   trying his truth and his longsufferance   till halfanother year had slipt away      by this the lazy gossips of the port   abhorrent of a calculation crost   began to chafe as at a personal wrong   some thought that philip did but trifle with her   some that she but held off to draw him on   and others laughd at her and philip too   as simple folks that knew not their own minds   and one in whom all evil fancies clung   like serpent eggs together laughingly   would hint a worse in either  her own son   was silent tho he often lookd his wish   but evermore the daughter prest upon her   to wed the man so dear to all of them   and lift the household out of poverty   and philips rosy face contracting grew   careworn and wan and all these things fell on her   sharp as reproach                       at last one night it chanced   that annie could not sleep but earnestly   prayd for a sign my enoch is he gone   then compassd round by the blind wall of night   brookd not the expectant terror of her heart   started from bed and struck herself a light   then desperately seized the holy book   suddenly set it wide to find a sign   suddenly put her finger on the text   under a palmtree  that was nothing to her   no meaning there she closed the book and slept   when lo her enoch sitting on a height   under a palmtree over him the sun   he is gone she thought he is happy he is singing   hosanna in the highest yonder shines   the sun of righteousness and these be palms   whereof the happy people strowing cried   hosanna in the highest  here she woke   resolved sent for him and said wildly to him   there is no reason why we should not wed   then for gods sake he answerd both our sakes   so you will wed me let it be at once      so these were wed and merrily rang the bells   merrily rang the bells and they were wed   but never merrily beat annies heart   a footstep seemd to fall beside her path   she knew not whence a whisper in her ear   she knew not what nor loved she to be left   alone at home nor ventured out alone   what aild her then that ere she enterd often   her hand dwelt lingeringly on the latch   fearing to enter philip thought he knew   such doubts and fears were common to her state   being with child but when her child was born   then her new child was as herself renewd   then the new mother came about her heart   then her good philip was her allinall   and that mysterious instinct wholly died      and where was enoch prosperously saild   the ship good fortune tho at setting forth   the biscay roughly ridging eastward shook   and almost overwhelmd her yet unvext   she slipt across the summer of the world   then after a long tumble about the cape   and frequent interchange of foul and fair   she passing thro the summer world again   the breath of heaven came continually   and sent her sweetly by the golden isles   till silent in her oriental haven      there enoch traded for himself and bought   quaint monsters for the market of those times   a gilded dragon also for the babes      less lucky her homevoyage at first indeed   thro many a fair seacircle day by day   scarcerocking her fullbusted figurehead   stared oer the ripple feathering from her bows   then followd calms and then winds variable   then baffling a long course of them and last   storm such as drove her under moonless heavens   till hard upon the cry of breakers came   the crash of ruin and the loss of all   but enoch and two others  half the night   buoyd upon floating tackle and broken spars   these drifted stranding on an isle at morn   rich but loneliest in a lonely sea      no want was there of human sustenance   soft fruitage mighty nuts and nourishing roots   nor save for pity was it hard to take   the helpless life so wild that it was tame   there in a seawardgazing mountaingorge   they built and thatchd with leaves of palm a hut   half hut half native cavern  so the three   set in this eden of all plenteousness   dwelt with eternal summer illcontent      for one the youngest hardly more than boy   hurt in that night of sudden ruin and wreck   lay lingering out a threeyears deathinlife   they could not leave him  after he was gone   the two remaining found a fallen stem   and enochs comrade careless of himself   firehollowing this in indian fashion fell   sunstricken and that other lived alone   in those two deaths he read gods warning wait      the mountain wooded to the peak the lawns   and winding glades high up like ways to heaven   the slender cocos drooping crown of plumes   the lightning flash of insect and of bird   the lustre of the long convolvuluses   that coild around the stately stems and ran   evn to the limit of the land the glows   and glories of the broad belt of the world   all these he saw but what he fain had seen   he could not see the kindly human face   nor ever hear a kindly voice but heard   the myriad shriek of wheeling oceanfowl   the leaguelong roller thundering on the reef   the moving whisper of huge trees that branchd   and blossomd in the zenith or the sweep   of some precipitous rivulet to the wave   as down the shore he ranged or all day long   sat often in the seawardgazing gorge   a shipwreckd sailor waiting for a sail   no sail from day to day but every day   the sunrise broken into scarlet shafts   among the palms and ferns and precipices   the blaze upon the waters to the east   the blaze upon his island overhead   the blaze upon the waters to the west   then the great stars that globed themselves in heaven   the hollowerbellowing ocean and again   the scarlet shafts of sunrisebut no sail      there often as he watchd or seemd to watch   so still the golden lizard on him paused   a phantom made of many phantoms moved   before him haunting him or he himself   moved haunting people things and places known   far in a darker isle beyond the line   the babes their babble annie the small house   the climbing street the mill the leafy lanes   the peacockyewtree and the lonely hall   the horse he drove the boat he sold the chill   november dawns and dewyglooming downs   the gentle shower the smell of dying leaves   and the low moan of leadencolord seas      once likewise in the ringing of his ears   tho faintly merrilyfar and far away   he heard the pealing of his parish bells   then tho he knew not wherefore started up   shuddering and when the beauteous hateful isle   returnd upon him had not his poor heart   spoken with that which being everywhere   lets none who speaks with him seem all alone   surely the man had died of solitude      thus over enochs earlysilvering head   the sunny and rainy seasons came and went   year after year  his hopes to see his own   and pace the sacred old familiar fields   not yet had perishd when his lonely doom   came suddenly to an end  another ship   she wanted water blown by baffling winds   like the good fortune from her destined course   stayd by this isle not knowing where she lay   for since the mate had seen at early dawn   across a break on the mistwreathen isle   the silent water slipping from the hills   they sent a crew that landing burst away   in search of stream or fount and filld the shores   with clamor  downward from his mountain gorge   stept the longhaird longbearded solitary   brown looking hardly human strangely clad   muttering and mumbling idiotlike it seemd   with inarticulate rage and making signs   they knew not what and yet he led the way   to where the rivulets of sweet water ran   and ever as he mingled with the crew   and heard them talking his longbounden tongue   was loosend till he made them understand   whom when their casks were filld they took aboard   and there the tale he utterd brokenly   scarce credited at first but more and more   amazed and melted all who listend to it   and clothes they gave him and free passage home   but oft he workd among the rest and shook   his isolation from him  none of these   came from his county or could answer him   if questiond aught of what he cared to know   and dull the voyage was with long delays   the vessel scarce seaworthy but evermore   his fancy fled before the lazy wind   returning till beneath a clouded moon   he like a lover down thro all his blood   drew in the dewy meadowy morningbreath   of england blown across her ghostly wall   and that same morning officers and men   levied a kindly tax upon themselves   pitying the lonely man and gave him it   then moving up the coast they landed him   evn in that harbor whence he saild before      there enoch spoke no word to anyone   but homewardhomewhat home had he a home   his home he walkd  bright was that afternoon   sunny but chill till drawn thro either chasm   where either haven opend on the deeps   rolld a seahaze and whelmd the world in gray   cut off the length of highway on before   and left but narrow breadth to left and right   of witherd holt or tilth or pasturage   on the nighnaked tree the robin piped   disconsolate and thro the dripping haze   the dead weight of the dead leaf bore it down   thicker the drizzle grew deeper the gloom   last as it seemd a great mistblotted light   flared on him and he came upon the place      then down the long street having slowly stolen   his heart foreshadowing all calamity   his eyes upon the stones he reachd the home   where annie lived and loved him and his babes   in those faroff seven happy years were born   but finding neither light nor murmur there   a bill of sale gleamd thro the drizzle crept   still downward thinking dead or dead to me      down to the pool and narrow wharf he went   seeking a tavern which of old he knew   a front of timbercrost antiquity   so propt wormeaten ruinously old   he thought it must have gone but he was gone   who kept it and his widow miriam lane   with dailydwindling profits held the house   a haunt of brawling seamen once but now   stiller with yet a bed for wandering men   there enoch rested silently many days      but miriam lane was good and garrulous   nor let him be but often breaking in   told him with other annals of the port   not knowingenoch was so brown so bowd   so brokenall the story of his house   his babys death her growing poverty   how philip put her little ones to school   and kept them in it his long wooing her   her slow consent and marriage and the birth   of philips child and oer his countenance   no shadow past nor motion anyone   regarding well had deemd he felt the tale   less than the teller only when she closed   enoch poor man was cast away and lost   he shaking his gray head pathetically   repeated muttering cast away and lost   again in deeper inward whispers lost        but enoch yearnd to see her face again    if i might look on her sweet face gain    and know that she is happy  so the thought    haunted and harassd him and drove him forth    at evening when the dull november day    was growing duller twilight to the hill    there he sat down gazing on all below    there did a thousand memories roll upon him    unspeakable for sadness  by and by    the ruddy square of comfortable light    farblazing from the rear of philips house    allured him as the beaconblaze allures    the bird of passage till he madly strikes    against it and beats out his weary life      for philips dwelling fronted on the street   the latest house to landward but behind   with one small gate that opend on the waste   flourishd a little garden square and walld   and in it throve an ancient evergreen   a yewtree and all round it ran a walk   of shingle and a walk divided it   but enoch shunnd the middle walk and stole   up by the wall behind the yew and thence   that which he better might have shunnd if griefs   like his have worse or better enoch saw      for cups and silver on the burnishd board   sparkled and shone so genial was the hearth   and on the right hand of the hearth he saw   philip the slighted suitor of old times   stout rosy with his babe across his knees   and oer her second father stoopt a girl   a later but a loftier annie lee   fairhaird and tall and from her lifted hand   dangled a length of ribbon and a ring   to tempt the babe who reard his creasy arms   caught at and ever missd it and they laughd   and on the left hand of the hearth he saw   the mother glancing often toward her babe   but turning now and then to speak with him   her son who stood beside her tall and strong   and saying that which pleased him for he smiled      now when the dead man come to life beheld   his wife his wife no more and saw the babe   hers yet not his upon the fathers knee   and all the warmth the peace the happiness   and his own children tall and beautiful   and him that other reigning in his place   lord of his rights and of his childrens love   then he tho miriam lane had told him all   because things seen are mightier than things heard   staggerd and shook holding the branch and feard   to send abroad a shrill and terrible cry   which in one moment like the blast of doom   would shatter all the happiness of the hearth      he therefore turning softly like a thief   lest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot   and feeling all along the gardenwall   lest he should swoon and tumble and be found   crept to the gate and opend it and closed   as lightly as a sick mans chamberdoor   behind him and came out upon the waste      and there he would have knelt but that his knees   were feeble so that falling prone he dug   his fingers into the wet earth and prayd      too hard to bear why did they take me hence   o god almighty blessed saviour thou   that didst uphold me on my lonely isle   uphold me father in my loneliness   a little longer aid me give me strength   not to tell her never to let her know   help me no to break in upon her peace   my children too must i not speak to these   they know me not  i should betray myself   never not fathers kiss for methe girl   so like her mother and the boy my son      there speech and thought and nature faild a little   and he lay tranced but when he rose and paced   back toward his solitary home again   all down the long and narrow street he went   beating it in upon his weary brain   as tho it were the burthen of a song   not to tell her never to let her know      he was not all unhappy  his resolve   upbore him and firm faith and evermore   prayer from a living source within the will   and beating up thro all the bitter world   like fountains of sweet water in the sea   kept him a living soul  this millers wife   he said to miriam that you told me of   has she no fear that her first husband lives   ay ay poor soul said miriam fear enow   if you could tell her you had seen him dead   why that would be her comfort and he thought   after the lord has calld me she shall know   i wait his time and enoch set himself   scorning an alms to work whereby to live   almost to all things could he turn his hand   cooper he was and carpenter and wrought   to make the boatmen fishingnets or helpd   at lading and unlading the tall barks   that brought the stinted commerce of those days   thus earnd a scanty living for himself   yet since he did but labor for himself   work without hope there was not life in it   whereby the man could live and as the year   rolld itself round again to meet the day   when enoch had returnd a languor came   upon him gentle sickness gradually   weakening the man till he could do no more   but kept the house his chair and last his bed   and enoch bore his weakness cheerfully   for sure no gladlier does the stranded wreck   see thro the gray skirts of a lifting squall   the boat that bears the hope of life approach   to save the life despaird of than he saw   death dawning on him and the close of all      for thro that dawning gleamd a kindlier hope   on enoch thinking after i am gone   then may she learn i loved her to the last   he calld aloud for miriam lane and said   woman i have a secretonly swear   before i tell youswear upon the book   not to reveal it till you see me dead   dead clamord the good woman hear him talk   i warrant man that we shall bring you round   swear add enoch sternly on the book   and on the book halffrighted miriam swore   then enoch rolling his gray eyes upon her   did you know enoch arden of this town   know him she said i knew him far away   ay ay i mind him coming down the street   held his head high and cared for no man he   slowly and sadly enoch answerd her   his head is low and no man cares for him   i think i have not three days more to live   i am the man  at which the woman gave   a halfincredulous halfhysterical cry   you arden you naysure he was a foot   higher than you be  enoch said again   my god has bowd me down to what i am   my grief and solitude have broken me   nevertheless know that i am he   who marriedbut that name has twice been changed   i married her who married philip ray   sit listen  then he told her of his voyage   his wreck his lonely life his coming back   his gazing in on annie his resolve   and how he kept it  as the woman heard   fast flowd the current of her easy tears   while in her heart she yearnd incessantly   to rush abroad all round the little haven   proclaiming enoch arden and his woes   but awed and promisebounded she forbore   saying only see your bairns before you go   eh let me fetch em arden and arose   eager to bring them down for enoch hung   a moment on her words but then replied      woman disturb me not now at the last   but let me hold my purpose till i die   sit down again mark me and understand   while i have power to speak  i charge you now   when you shall see her tell her that i died   blessing her praying for her loving her   save for the bar between us loving her   as when she laid her head beside my own   and tell my daughter annie whom i saw   so like her mother that my latest breath   was spent in blessing her and praying for her   and tell my son that i died blessing him   and say to philip that i blest him too   he never meant us any thing but good   but if my children care to see me dead   who hardly saw me living let them come   i am their father but she must not come   for my dead face would vex her afterlife   and now there is but one of all my blood   who will embrace me in the worldtobe   this hair is his she cut it off and gave it   and i have borne it with me all these years   and thought to bear it with me to my grave   but now my mind is changed for i shall see him   my babe in bliss wherefore when i am gone   take give her this for it may comfort her   it will moreover be a token to her   that i am he                    he ceased and miriam lane   made such a voluble answer promising all   that once again he rolld his eyes upon her   repeating all he wishd and once again   she promised                   then the third night after this   while enoch slumberd motionless and pale   and miriam watchd and dozed at intervals   there came so loud a calling of the sea   that all the houses in the haven rang   he woke he rose he spread his arms abroad   crying with a loud voice a sail a sail   i am saved and so fell back and spoke no more      so past the strong heroic soul away   and when they buried him the little port   had seldom seen a costlier funeral        aylmers field        1793        aylmers field       1793        dust are our frames and gilded dust our pride   looks only for a moment whole and sound   like that longburied body of the king   found lying with his urns and ornaments   which at a touch of light an air of heaven   slipt into ashes and was found no more      here is a story which in rougher shape   came from a grizzled cripple whom i saw   sunning himself in a waste field alone   old and a mine of memorieswho had served   long since a bygone rector of the place   and been himself a part of what he told      sir aylmer aylmer that almighty man   the county godin whose capacious hall   hung with a hundred shields the family tree   sprang from the midriff of a prostrate king   whose blazing wyvern weathercockd the spire   stood from his walls and wingd his entrygates   and swang besides on many a windy sign   whose eyes from under a pyramidal head   saw from his windows nothing save his own   what lovelier of his own had he than her   his only child his edith whom he loved   as heiress and not heir regretfully   but he that marries her marries her name   this fiat somewhat soothed himself and wife   his wife a faded beauty of the baths   insipid as the queen upon a card   her all of thought and bearing hardly more   than his own shadow in a sickly sun      a land of hops and poppymingled corn   little about it stirring save a brook   a sleepy land where under the same wheel   the same old rut would deepen year by year   where almost all the village had one name   where aylmer followd aylmer at the hall   and averill averill at the rectory   thrice over so that rectory and hall   bound in an immemorial intimacy   were open to each other tho to dream   that love could bind them closer well had made   the hoar hair of the baronet bristle up   with horror worse than had he heard his priest   preach an inverted scripture sons of men   daughters of god so sleepy was the land      and might not averill had he willd it so   somewhere beneath his own low range of roofs   have also set his manyshielded tree

year or two before   calld to the bar but ever calld away   by one low voice to one dear neighborhood   would often in his walks with edith claim   a distant kinship to the gracious blood   that shook the heart of edith hearing him      sanguine he was a but less vivid hue   than of that islet in the chestnutbloom   flamed his cheek and eager eyes that still   took joyful note of all things joyful beamd   beneath a manelike mass of rolling gold   their best and brightest when they dwelt on hers   edith whose pensive beauty perfect else   but subject to the season or the mood   shone like a mystic star between the less   and greater glory varying to and fro   we know not wherefore bounteously made   and yet so finely that a troublous touch   thinnd or would seem to thin her in a day   a

there when first   the tented winterfield was broken up   into that phalanx of the summer spears   that soon should wear the garland there again   when burr and bine were gatherd lastly there   at christmas ever welcome at the hall   on whose dull sameness his full tide of youth   broke with a phosphorescence cheering even   my lady and the baronet yet had laid   no bar between them dull and selfinvolved   tall and erect but bending from his height   with halfallowing smiles for all the world   and mighty courteous in the mainhis pride   lay deeper than to wear it as his ring   he like an aylmer in his aylmerism   would care no more for leolins walking with her   than for his old newfoundlands when they ran   to loose him at the stables for he rose   twofooted at the limit of his chain   roaring to make a third and how should love   whom the crosslightnings of four chancemet eyes   flash into fiery life from nothing follow   such dear familiarities of dawn   seldom but when he does master of all      so these young hearts not knowing that they loved   not she at least nor conscious of a bar   between them nor by plight or broken ring   bound but an immemorial intimacy   wanderd at will but oft accompanied   by averill his a brothers love that hung   with wings of brooding shelter oer her peace   might have been other save for leolins   who knows but so they wanderd hour by

a grasp   having the warmth and muscle of the heart   a childly way with children and a laugh   ringing like proved golden coinage true   were no false passport to that easy realm   where once with leolin at her side the girl   nursing a child and turning to the warmth   the tender pink fivebeaded babysoles   heard the good mother softly whisper bless   god bless em marriages are made in heaven      a flash of semijealousy cleard it to her   my ladys indian kinsman unannounced   with half a score of swarthy faces came   his own tho keen and bold and soldierly   seard by the close ecliptic was not fair   fairer his talk a tongue that ruled the hour   tho seeming boastful so when first he dashd   into the chronicle of a deedful day   sir aylmer half forgot his lazy smile   of patron good my ladys kinsman good   my lady with her fingers interlockd   and rotatory thumbs on silken knees   calld all her vital spirits into each ear   to listen unawares they flitted off   busying themselves about the flowerage   that stood from our a stiff brocade in which   the meteor of a splendid season she   once with this kinsman ah so long ago   stept thro the stately minuet of those days   but ediths eager fancy hurried with him   snatchd thro the perilous passes of his life   till leolin ever watchful of her eye   hated him with a momentary hate   wifehunting as the rumor ran was he   i know not for he spoke not only showerd   his oriental gifts on everyone   and most on edith like a storm he came   and shook the house and like a storm he went      among the gifts he left her possibly   he flowd and ebbd uncertain to return   when others had been tested there was one   a dagger in rich sheath with jewels on it   sprinkled about in gold that branchd itself   fine as iceferns on january panes   made by a breath  i know not whence at first   nor of what race the work but as he told   the story storming a hillfort of thieves   he got it for their captain after fight   his comrades having fought their last below   was climbing up the valley at whom he shot   down from the beetling crag to which he clung   tumbled the tawny rascal at his feet   this dagger with him which when now admired   by edith whom his pleasure was to please   at once the costly sahib yielded it to her      and leolin coming after he was gone   tost over all her presents petulantly   and when she showd the wealthy scabbard saying   look what a lovely piece of workmanship   slight was his answer welli care not for it   then playing with the blade he prickd his hand   a gracious gift to give a lady this   but would it be more gracious askd the girl   were i to give this gift of his to one   that is no lady  gracious  no said he   mebut i cared not for it  o pardon me   i seem to be ungraciousness itself   take it she added sweetly tho his gift   for i am more ungracious evn than you   i care not for it either and he said   why then i love it but sir aylmer past   and neither loved nor liked the thing he heard      the next day came a neighbor  blues and reds   they talkd of blues were sure of it he thought   then of the latest foxwhere startedkilld   in such a bottom peter had the brush   my peter first and did sir aylmer know   that great pockpitten fellow had been caught   then made his pleasure echo hand to hand   and rolling as it were the substance of it   between his palms a moment up and down   the birds were warm the birds were warm upon him   we have him now and had sir aylmer heard   nay but he mustthe land was ringing of it   this blacksmithborder marriageone they knew   raw from the nurserywho could trust a child   that cursed france with her egalities   and did sir aylmer deferentially   with nearing chair and lowerd accent think   for people talkdthat it was wholly wise   to let that handsome fellow averill walk   so freely with his daughter people talkd   the boy might get a notion into him   the girl might be entangled ere she knew   sir aylmer aylmer slowly stiffening spoke   the girl and boy sir know their differences   good said his friend but watch and he enough   more than enough sir  i can guard my own   they parted and sir aylmer aylmer watchd      pale for on her the thunders of the house   had fallen first was edith that same night   pale as the jepthas daughter a rough piece   of early rigid color under which   withdrawing by the counter door to that   which leolin opend she cast back upon him   a piteous glance and vanishd  he as one   caught in a burst of unexpected storm   and pelted with outrageous epithets   turning beheld the powers of the house   on either side the hearth indignant her   cooling her false cheek with a featherfan   him glaring by his own stale devil spurrd   and like a beast hardridden breathing hard   ungenerous dishonorable base   presumptuous trusted as he was with her   the sole succeeder to their wealth their lands   the last remaining pillar of their house   the one transmitter of their ancient name   their child  our child  our heiress  ours for          still   like echoes from beyond a hollow came   her sicklier iteration  last he said   boy mark me for your fortunes are to make   i swear you shall not make them out of mine   now inasmuch as you have practised on her   perplext her made her half forget herself   swerve from her duty to herself and us

not see her   no you shall write and not to her but me   and you shall say that having spoken with me   and after lookd into yourself you find   that you meant nothingas indeed you know   that you meant nothing  such as match as this   impossible prodigious  these were words   as meted by his measure of himself   arguing boundless forbearance after which   and leolins horrorstricken answer i   so foul a traitor to myself and her   never oh never for about as long   as the windhover hangs in the balance paused   sir aylmer reddening from the storm within   then broke all bonds of courtesy and crying   boy should i find you by my doors again   my men shall lash you from the like a dog   hence with a sudden execration drove   the footstool from before him and arose   so stammering scoundrel out of teeth that ground   as in a dreadful dream while leolin still   retreated halfaghast the fierce old man   followd and under his own lintel stood   storming with lifted hands a hoary face   meet for the reverence of the hearth but now   beneath a pale and unimpassiond moon   vext with unworthy madness and deformd      slowly and conscious of the rageful eye   that watchd him till he heard the ponderous door   close crashing with long echoes thro the land   went leolin then his passions all in flood   and masters of his motion furiously   down thro the bright lawns to his brothers ran   and foamd away his heart at averills ear   whom averill solaced as he might amazed   the man was his had been his fathers friend   he must have seen himself had seen it long   he must have known himself had known besides   he never yet had set his daughter forth   here in the womanmarkets of the west   where our caucasians let themselves be sold   some one he thought had slanderd leolin to him   brother for i have loved you more as a son   than brother let me tell you i myself   what is their pretty saying jilted is it   jilted i was i say it for your peace   paind and as bearing in myself the shame   the woman should have borne humiliated   i lived for years a stunted sunless life   till after our good parents past away   watching your growth i seemd again to grow   leolin i almost sin in envying you   the very whitest lamb in all my fold   loves you i know her the worst thought she has   is whiter even than her pretty hand   she must prove true for brother where two fight   the strongest wins and truth and love are strength   and you are happy let her parents be      but leolin cried out the more upon them   insolent brainless heartless heiress wealth   their wealth their heiress wealth enough was theirs   for twenty matches  were he lord of this   why twenty boys and girls should marry on it   and forty blest ones bless him and himself   be wealthy still ay wealthier  he believed   this filthy marriagehindering mammon made   the harlot of the cities nature crost   was mother of the foul adulteries   that saturate soul with body  name too name   their

it nobler fools   with such a vantageground for nobleness   he had known a man a quintessence of man   the life of allwho madly lovedand he   thwarted by one of these old fatherfools   had rioted his life out and made an end   he would not do it her sweet face and faith   held him from that but he had powers he knew it   back would he to his studies make a name   name fortune too the world should ring of him   to shame these mouldy aylmers in their graves   chancellor or what is greatest would he be   o brother i am grieved to learn your grief   give me my fling and let me say my say      at which like one that sees his own excess   and easily forgives it as his own   he laughd and then was mute but presently   wept like a storm and honest averill seeing   how low his brothers mood had fallen fetchd   his richest beeswing from a binn reserved   for banquets praised the waning red and told   the vintagewhen this aylmer came of age   then drank and past it till at length the two   tho leolin flamed and fell again agreed   that much allowance must be made for men   after an angry dream this kindlier glow   faded with morning but his purpose held      yet once by night again the lovers met   a perilous meeting under the tall pines   that darkend all the northward of her hall   him to her meek and modest bosom prest   in agony she promised that no force   persuasion no nor death could alter her   he passionately hopefuller would go   labor for his own edith and return   in such a sunlight of prosperity   he should not be rejected  write to me   they loved me and because i love their child   they hate me there is war between us dear   which breaks all bonds but ours we must remain   sacred to one another  so they talkd   poor children for their comfort the wind blew   the rain of heaven and their own bitter tears   tears and the careless rain of heaven mixt   upon their faces as they kissd each other   in darkness and above them roard the pine      so leolin went and as we task ourselves   to learn a language known but smatteringly   in phrases here and there at random toild   mastering the lawless science of our law   that codeless myriad of precedent   that wilderness of single instances   thro which a few by wit or fortune led   may beat a pathway out to wealth and fame   the jests that flashd about the pleaders room   lightning of the hour the pun the scurrilous tale   old scandals buried now seven decads deep   in other scandals that have lived and died   and left the living scandal that shall die   were dead to him already bent as he was   to make disproof of scorn and strong in hopes   and prodigal of all brainlabor he   charier of sleep and wine and exercise   except when for a breathingwhile at eve   some niggard fraction of an hour he ran   beside the riverbank and then indeed   harder the times were and the hands of power   were bloodier and the according hearts of men   seemd harder too but the soft riverbreeze   which fannd the gardens of that rival rose   yet fragrant in a heart remembering   his former talks with edith on him breathed   far purelier in his rushings to and fro   after his books to flush his blood with air   then to his books again  my ladys cousin   halfsickening of his pensiond afternoon   drove in upon the student once or twice   ran a malayan muck against the times   had golden hopes for france and all mankind   answerd all queries touching those at home   with a heaved shoulder and a saucy smile   and fain had haled him out into the world   and aird him there his nearer friend would say   screw not the chord too sharply lest it snap   then left alone he pluckd her dagger forth   from where his worldless heart had kept it warm   kissing his vows upon it like a knight   and wrinkled benchers often talkd of him   approvingly and prophesied his rise   for heart i think helpd head her letters too   tho far between and coming fitfully   like broken music written as she found   or made

how sweetly would she glide between your wraths   and steal you from each other for she walkd   wearing the light yoke of that lord of love   who stilld the rolling wave of galilee   and oneof him i was not bid to speak   was always with her whom you also knew   him too you loved for he was worthy love   and these had been together from the first   they might have been together till the last

hand in one of his he veild   his face with the other and at once as falls   a creeper when the prop is broken fell   the woman shrieking at his feet and swoond   then her own people bore along the nave   her pendent hands and narrow meagre face   seamd with the shallow cares of fifty years   and here the lord of all the landscape round   evn to its last horizon and of all   who peerd at him so keenly followd out   tall and erect but in the middle aisle   reeld as a footsore ox in crowded ways   stumbling across the market to his death   unpitied for he groped as blind and seemd   always about to fall grasping the pews   and oaken finials till he touchd the door   yet to the lychgate where his chariot stood   strode from the porch tall and erect again      but nevermore did either pass the gate   save under pall with bearers  in one month   thro weary and yet wearier hours   the childless mother went to seek her child   and when he felt the silence of his house   about him and the change and not the change   and those fixt eyes of painted ancestors   staring for ever from their gilded walls   on him their last descendant his own head   began to droop to fall the man became   imbecile his one word was desolate   dead for two years before his death was he   but when the second christmas came escaped   his keepers and the silence which he felt   to find a deeper in the narrow gloom   by wife and child nor wanted at his end   the dark retinue reverencing death   at golden thresholds nor from tender hearts   and those who sorrowd oer a vanishd race   pity the violet on the tyrants grave   then the great hall was wholly broken down   and the broad woodland parcelld into farms   and where the two contrived their daughters good   lies the hawks cast the mole has

announced the coming doom and fulminated   against the scarlet woman and her creed   for sideways up he swung his arms and shriekd   thus thus with violence evn as if he held   the apocalyptic millstone and himself   were that great angel thus with violence   shall babylon be cast into the sea   then comes the close  the gentlehearted wife   sat shuddering at the ruin of a world   he at his own but when the wordy storm   had ended forth they came and paced the shore   ran in and out the long seaframing caves   drank the large air and saw but scarce believed   the sootflake of so many a summer still   clung to their fancies that they saw the sea   so now on sand they walkd and now on cliff   lingering about the thymy promontories   till all the sails were darkend in the west   and rosed in the east then homeward and to bed   where she who kept a tender christian hope   haunting a holy text and still to that   returning as the bird returns at night   let not the sun go down upon your wrath   said love forgive him but he did not speak   and silenced by that silence lay the wife   remembering her dear lord who died for all   and musing on the little lives of men   and how they mar this little by their feuds      but while the two were sleeping a full tide   rose with groundswell which on the foremost rocks   touching upjetted in spirts of wild seasmoke   and scaled in sheets of wasteful foam and fell   in vast seacataractsever and anon   dead claps of thunder from within the cliffs   heard thro the living roar  at this the babe   their margaret cradled near them waild and woke   the mother and the father suddenly cried   a wreck a wreck then turnd and groaning said      forgive  how many will say forgive and find   a sort of absolution in the sound   to hate a little longer  no the sin   that neither god nor man can well forgive   hypocrisy i saw it in him at once   is it so true that second thoughts are best   not first and third which are a riper first   too ripe too late they come too late for use   ah love there surely lives in man and beast   something divine to warn them of their foes   and such a sense when first i fronted him   said trust him not but after when i came   to know him more i lost it knew him less   fought with what seemd my own uncharity   sat at his table drank his costly wines   made more and more allowance for his talk   went further fool and trusted him with all   all my poor scrapings from a dozen years   of dust and deskwork there is no such mine   none but a gulf of ruin swallowing gold   not making  ruind ruind the sea roars   ruin a fearful night                            not fearful fair   said the good wife if every star in heaven   can make it fair you do but bear the tide   had you ill dreams                          o yes he said i dreamd   of such a tide swelling toward the land   and i from out the boundless outer deep   swept with it to the shore and enterd one   of those dark caves that run beneath the cliffs   i thought the motion of the boundless deep   bore through the cave and i was heaved upon it   in darkness then i saw one lovely star   larger and larger  what a world i thought   to live in but in moving i found   only the landward exit of the cave   bright with the sun upon the stream beyond   and near the light a giant woman sat   all over earthy like a piece of earth   a pickaxe in her hand then out i slipt   into a land all of sun and blossom trees   as high as heaven and every bird that sings   and here the nightlight flickering in my eyes   awoke me                that was then your dream she said   not sad but sweet                          so sweet i lay said he   and mused upon it drifting up the stream   in fancy till i slept again and pieced   the broken vision for i dreamd that still   the motion of the great deep bore me on   and that the woman walkd upon the brink   i wonderd at her strength and askd her of it   it came she said by working in the mines   o then to ask her of my shares i thought   and askd but not a word she shook her head   and then the motion of the current ceased   and there was rolling thunder and we reachd   a mountain like a wall of burs and thorns   but she with her strong feet up the steep hill   trod out a path i followd and at top   she pointed seaward there a fleet of glass   that seemd a fleet of jewels under me   sailing along before a gloomy cloud   that not one moment ceased to thunder past   in sunshine right across its track there lay   down in the water a long reef of gold   or what seemd gold and i was glad at first   to think that in our oftenransackd world   still so much gold was left and then i feard   lest the gay navy there should splinter on it   and fearing waved my arm to warn them off   an idle signal for the brittle fleet   i thought i could have died to save it neard   touchd clinkd and clashd and vanishd and i woke   i heard the clash so clearly  now i see   my dream was life the woman honest work   and my poor venture but a fleet of glass   wreckd on a reef of visionary gold      nay said the kindly wife to comfort him   you raised your arm you tumbled down and broke   the glass with little margarets medicine it it   and breaking that you made and broke your dream   a trifle makes a dream a trifle breaks      no trifle groand the husband yesterday   i met him suddenly in the street and askd   that which i askd the woman in my dream   like her he shook his head  show me the books   he dodged me with a long and loose account   the books the books but he he could not wait   bound on a matter he of life and death   when the great books see daniel seven and ten   were opend i should find he meant me well   and then began to bloat himself and ooze   all over with the fat affectionate smile   that makes the widow lean  my dearest friend   have faith have faith  we live by faith said he   and all things work together for the good   of thoseit makes me sick to quote himlast   gript my hand hard and with godblessyou went   i stood like one that had received a blow   i found a hard friend in his loose accounts   a loose one in the hard grip of his hand   a curse in his godblessyou then my eyes   pursued him down the street and far away   among the honest shoulders of the crowd   read rascal in the motions of his back   and scoundrel in the supplesliding knee      was he so bound poor soul said the good wife   so are we all but do not call him love   before you prove him rogue and proved forgive   his gain is loss for he that wrongs his friend   wrongs himself more and ever bears about   a silent court of justice in his breast   himself the judge and jury and himself   the prisoner at the bar ever condemnd   and that drags down his life then comes what comes   hereafter and he meant he said he meant   perhaps he meant or partly meant you well      with all his conscience and one eye askew   love let me quote these lines that you may learn   a man is likewise counsel for himself   too often in that silent court of yours   with all his conscience and one eye askew   so false he partly took himself for true   whose pious talk when most his heart was dry   made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye   who never naming god except for gain   so never took that useful name in vain   made him his catspaw and the cross his tool   and christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool   nor deeds of gift but gifts of grace he forged   and snakelike slimed his victim ere he gorged   and oft at bible meetings oer the rest   arising did his holy oily best   dropping the too rough h in hell and heaven   to spread the word by which himself had thriven   how like you this old satire                                    nay she said   i loathe it he had never kindly heart   nor ever cared to better his own kind   who first wrote satire with no pity in it   but will you hear my dream for i had one   that altogether went to music  still   it awed me                  then she told it having dreamd   of that same coast                 but round the north a light   a belt it seemd of luminous vapor lay   and ever in it a low musical note   swelld up and died and as it swelld a ridge   of breaker issued from the belt and still   grew with the growing note and when the note   had reachd a thunderous fullness on those cliffs   broke mixt with awful light the same as that   living within the belt whereby she saw   that all those lines of cliffs were cliffs no more   but huge cathedral fronts of every age   grave florid stern as far as eye could see   one after one and then the great ridge drew   lessening to the lessening music back   and past into the belt and swelld again   slowly to music ever when it broke   the statues king or saint or founder fell   then from the gaps and chasms of ruin left   came men and women in dark clusters round   some crying set them up they shall not fall   and others let them lie for they have falln   and still they strove and wrangled and she grieved   in her strange dream she knew not why to find   their wildest wailings never out of tune   with that sweet note and ever as their shrieks   ran highest up the gamut that great wave   returning while none markd it on the crowd   broke mixt with awful light and showd their eyes   glaring and passionate looks and swept away   the men of flesh and blood and men of stone   to the waste deeps together                                  then i fixt   my wistful eyes on two fair images   both crownd with stars and high among the stars   the virgin mother standing with her child   high up on one of those dark minsterfronts   till she began to totter and the child   clung to the mother and sent out a cry   which mixt with little margarets and i woke   and my dream awed mewellbut what are dreams   yours came but from the breaking of a glass   and mine but from the crying of a child      child  no said he but this tides roar and his   our boanerges with his threats of doom   and loudlungd antibabylonianisms   altho i grant but little music there   went both to make your dream but if there were   a music harmonizing our wild cries   spheremusic such as that you dreamd about   why that would make our passions far too like   the discords dear to the musician  no   one shriek of hate would jar all the hymns of heaven   true devils with no ear they howl in tune   with nothing but the devil                                  true indeed   one of our town but later by an hour   here than ourselves spoke with me on the shore   while you were

found for it was close beside   and half embraced the basket cradlehead   with one soft arm which like the pliant bough   that moving moves the nest and nestling swayd   the cradle while she sang this baby song               what does the little birdie say              in her nest at peep of day              let me fly says little birdie              mother let me fly away              birdie rest

you say little         anne   ruddy and white and strong on his legs he looks         like a man   and willys wife has written she never was         overwise   never the wife for willy he would nt take my advice                            ii   for annie you see her father was not the man to        save   had nt a head to manage and drank himself into his        grave   pretty enough very pretty but i was against it for        one   ehbut he would nt hear meand willy you say        is gone                            iii   willy my beauty my eldestborn the flower of the          flock   never a man could fling him for willy stood like a          rock   heres a leg for a babe of a week says doctor and          he would be bound   there was not his like that year in twenty parishes          round                             iv   strong of his hands and strong on his legs but still of          his tongue   i ought to have gone before him i wonder he went          so young   i cannot cry for him annie i have not long to          stay   perhaps i shall see him the sooner for he lived far          away                              v   why do you look at me annie you think i am hard          and cold   but all my children have gone before me i am so          old   i cannot weep for willy nor can i weep for the          rest   only at your age annie i could have wept with the          best                             vi   for i remember a quarrel i had with your father my          dear   all for a slanderous story that cost me many a          tear   i mean your grandfather annie it cost me a world          of woe   seventy years ago my darling seventy years          ago                            vii   for jenny my cousin had come to the place and i          knew right well   that jenny had tript in her time i knew but i          would not tell   and she to be coming and slandering me the base          little liar   but the tongue is a fire as you know my dear the          tongue is a fire                            viii   and the parson made it his text that week and he          said likewise   that a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of          lies   that a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought          with outright   but a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to          fight                             ix   and willy had not been down to the farm for a week          and a day   and all things lookd halfdead tho it was the middle          of may   jenny to slander me who knew what jenny had          been   but soiling another annie will never make oneself          clean                              x   and i cried myself wellnigh blind and all of an          evening late   i climbd to the top of the garth and stood by the          road at the gate   the moon like a rick on fire was rising over the          dale   and whit whit whit in the bush beside me chirrupt          the nightingale                             xi   all of a sudden he stopt there past by the gate of          the farm   willyhe did nt see meand jenny hung on his          arm   out into the road i started and spoke i scarce knew          how   ah theres no fool like the old oneit makes me          angry now                            xii   willy stood up like a man and lookd the thing that          he meant   jenny the viper made me a mocking courtesy and          went   and i said let us part in a hundred years itll all          be the same   you cannot love me at all if you love not my good          name                            xiii   and he turnd and i saw his eyes all wet in the sweet          moonshine   sweetheart i love you so well that your good name          is mine   and what do i care for jane let her speak of you well          of ill   but marry me out of hand we two shall be happy          still                             xiv   marry you willy said i but i needs must speak          my mind   and i fear youll listen to tales be jealous and hard          and unkind   but he turnd and claspt me in his arms and answerd          no love no   seventy years ago my darling seventy years          ago                              xv   so willy and i were wedded i wore a lilac          gown   and the ringers rang with a will and he gave the          ringers a crown   but the first that ever i bare was dead before he was          born   shadow and shine is life little annie flower and          thorn                             xvi   that was the first time too that ever i thought of          death   there lay the sweet little body that never had drawn          a breath   i had not wept little anne not since i had been a          wife   but i wept like a child that day for the babe had          fought for his life                             xvii   his dear little face was troubled as if with anger or          pain   i lookd at the still little bodyhis trouble had all          been in vain   for willy i cannot weep i shall see him another          morn   but i wept like a child for the child that was dead          before he was born                            xviii   but he cheerd me my good man for he seldom said me          nay   kind like a man was he like a man too would have          his way   never jealousnot he we had many a happy          year   and he died and i could not weepmy own time          seemd so near                             xix   but i wishd it had been gods will that i too then          could have died   i began to be tired a little and fain had slept at his          side   and that was ten years back or more if i dont          forget   but as to the children annie theyre all about me          yet                             xx   pattering over the boards my annie who left me at          two   patter she goes my own little annie an annie like          you   pattering over the boards she comes and goes at her          will   while harry is in the fiveacre and charlie ploughing          the hill                            xxi   and harry and charlie i hear them toothey sing          to their team   often they come to the door in a pleasant kind of a          dream   they come and sit by my chair they hover about my          bed   i am not always certain if they be alive or          dead                           xxii   and yet i know for a truth theres none of them          left alive   for harry went at sixty your father at sixtyfive   and willy my eldest born at nigh threescore and          ten   i knew them all as babies and now theyre elderly          men                          xxiii   for mine is a time of peace it is not often i          grieve   i am oftener sitting at home in my fathers farm          at eve   and the neighbors come and laugh and gossip and          so do i   i find myself often laughing at things that have long          gone by                           xxiv   to be sure the preacher says our sins should make          us sad   but mine is a time of peace and there is grace to          be had   and god not man is the judge of us all when life          shall cease   and in this book little annie the message is one of          peace                           xxv   and age is a time of peace so it be free from          pain   and happy has been my life but i would not live          it again   i seem to be tired a little thats all and long for          rest   only at your age annie i could have wept with the          best                          xxvi   so willy has gone my beauty my eldestborn my          flower   but how can i weep for willy he has but gone for          an hour   gone for a minute my son from this room into the          next   i too shall go in a minute  what

tills the field and lies beneath   and after many a summer dies the swan   me only cruel immortality   consumes i wither slowly in thine arms   here at the quiet limit of the world   a whitehaird shadow roaming like a dream   the eversilent spaces of the east   farfolded mists and gleaming halls of morn      alas for this gray shadow once a man   so glorious in his beauty and thy choice   who madest him thy chosen that he seemd   to his great heart none other than a god   i askd thee give me immortality   then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile   like wealthy men who care not how they give   but thy strong hours indignant workd their wills   and beat me down and marrd and wasted me   and tho they could not end me left me maimd   to dwell in presence of immortal youth   immortal age beside immortal youth   and all i was in ashes  can thy love   thy beauty make amends tho even now   close over us the silver star thy guide   shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears   to hear me  let me go take back thy gift   why should a man desire in any way   to vary from the kindly race of men   or pass beyond the goal of ordinance   where all should pause as is most meet for all      a soft air fans the cloud apart there comes   a glimpse of that dark world where i was born   once more the old mysterious glimmer steals   from thy pure brows and from thy shoulders pure   and bosom beating with a heart renewd   thy cheek begins to redden thro the gloom   thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine   ere yet they blind the stars and the wild team   which love thee yearning for thy yoke arise   and shake the darkness from their loosend manes   and beat the twilight into flakes of fire      lo ever thus thou growest beautiful   in silence then before thine answer given   departest and thy tears are on my cheek      why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears   and make me tremble lest a saying learnt   in days faroff on that dark earth be true   the gods themselves cannot recall their gifts      ay me ay me with what another heart   in days faroff and with what other eyes   i used to watchif i be he that watchd   the lucid outline forming round thee saw   the dim curls kindle into sunny rings   changed with thy mystic change and felt my blood   glow with the glow that slowly crimsond all   thy presence and thy portals while i lay   mouth forehead eyelids growing dewywarm   with kisses balmier than halfopening buds   of april and could hear the lips that kissd   whispering i knew not what of wild and sweet   like that strange song i heard apollo sing   while ilion like a mist rose into towers      yet hold me not for ever in thine east   how can my nature longer mix with thine   coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me cold   are all thy lights and cold my wrinkled feet   upon thy glimmering thresholds when the steam   floats up from those dim fields about the homes   of happy men that have the power to die   and grassy barrows of the happier dead   release me and restore me to the ground   thou seest all things thou wilt see my grave   thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn   i earth in earth forget these empty courts   and thee returning on thy silver wheels        the voyage                          i   we left behind the painted buoy     that tosses at the harbormouth   and madly danced our hearts with joy     as fast we fleeted to the south   how fresh was every sight and sound     on open main or winding shore   we knew the merry world was round     and we might sail for evermore                   ii   warm broke the breeze against the brow     dry sang the tackle sang the sail   the ladyshead upon the prow     caught the shrill salt and sheerd the gale   the broad seas swelld to meet the keel     and swept behind so quick the run   we felt the good ship shake and reel     we seemd to sail into the sun                      iii   how oft we saw the sun retire     and burn the threshold of the night   fall from his oceanlane of fire     and sleep beneath his pillard light   how oft the purpleskirted robe     of twilight slowly downward drawn   as thro the slumber of the globe     again we dashd into the dawn                       iv   new stars all night above the brim     of waters lightend into view   they climbd as quickly for the rim     changed every moment as we flew   far ran the naked moon across     the houseless oceans heaving field   or flying shone the silver boss     of her own halos dusky shield                        v   the peaky islet shifted shapes     high towns on hills were dimly seen   we past long lines of northern capes     and dewy northern meadows green   we came to warmer waves and deep     across the boundless east we drove   where those long swells of breaker sweep     the nutmeg rocks and isles clove                       vi   by peaks that flamed or all in shade     gloomd the low coast and quivering brine   with ashy rains that spreading made     fantastic plume or sable pine   by sands and steaming flats and floods     of mighty mouth we scudded fast   and hills and scarletmingled woods     glowd for a moment as we past                      vii   o hundred shores of happy climes     how swiftly streamd ye by the bark   at times the whole sea burnd at times     with wakes of fire we tore the dark   at times a carven craft would shoot     from havens hid in fairy bowers   with naked limbs and flowers and fruit     but we nor paused for fruit nor flowers                     viii   for one fair vision ever fled     down the waste waters day and night   and still we followd where she led     in hope to gain upon her flight   her face was evermore unseen     and fixt upon the far sealine   but each man murmurd o my queen     i follow till i make thee mine                       ix   and now we lost her now she gleamd     like fancy made of golden air   now nearer to the prow she seemd     like virtue firm like knowledge fair   now high on waves that idly burst     like heavenly hope she crownd the sea   and now the bloodless point reversed     she bore the blade of liberty                        x   and only one among ushim     we please nothe was seldom pleased   he saw not far his eyes were dim     but ours he swore were all diseased   a ship of fools he shriekd in spite     a ship of fools he sneerd and wept   and overboard one stormy night     he cast his body and on we swept                       xi   and never sail of ours was furld     nor anchor dropt at eve or morn   we loved the glories of the world     but laws of nature were our scorn   for blasts would rise and rave and cease     but whence were those that drove the sail   across the whirlwinds heart of peace     and to and thro the countergale                      xii   again to colder climes we came     for still we followd where she led   now mate is blind and captain lame     and half the crew are sick or dead   but blind or lame or sick or sound     we follow that which flies before   we know the merry world is round     and we may sail for evermore        in the valley of cauteretz                   all along the valley stream that flashest white   deepening thy voice with the deepening of the night   all along the valley where thy waters flow   i walkd with one i loved two and thirty years ago   all along the valley while i walkd today   the two and thirty years were a mist that rolls away   for all along the valley down thy rocky bed   thy living voice to me was as the voice of the dead   and all along the valley by rock and cave and tree   the voice of the dead was a living voice to me        the flower          once in a golden hour     i cast to earth a seed   up there came a flower     the people said a weed    to and fro they went     thro my gardenbower   and muttering discontent     cursed me and my flower    then it grew so tall     it wore a crown of light   but thieves from oer the wall     stole the seed by night    sowd it far and wide     by every town and tower   till all the people cried     splendid is the flower    read my little fable     he that runs may read   most can raise the flowers now     for all have got the seed    and some are pretty enough     and some are poor indeed   and now again the people     call it but a weed        requiescat          fair is her cottage in its place     where yon broad water sweetly slowly glides   it sees itself from thatch to base     dream in the sliding tides    and fairer she but ah how soon to die     her quiet dream of life this hour may cease   her peaceful being slowly passes by     to some more perfect peace        the sailor boy          he rose at dawn and fired with hope     shot oer the seething harborbar   and reachd the ship and caught the rope     and whistled to the morning star    and while he whistled long and loud     he heard a fierce mermaiden cry   o boy tho thou art young and proud     i see the place where thou wilt lie    the sands and yeasty surges mix     in caves about the dreary bay   and on thy ribs the limpet sticks     and in thy heart the scrawl shall play    fool he answerd death is sure     to those that stay and those that roam   but i will nevermore endure     to sit with empty hands at home    my mother clings about my neck     my sisters crying stay for shame   my father raves of death and wreck     they are all to blame they are all to blame    god help me save i take my part     of danger in the roaring sea   a devil rises in my heart     far worse than any death to me           the islet             whither o whither love shall we go   for a score of sweet little summers or so   the sweet little wife of the singer said   on the day that followd the day she was wed   whither o whither love shall we go   and the singer shaking his curly head   turnd as he sat and struck the keys   there at his right with a sudden crash   singing and shall it be over the seas   with a crew that is neither rude nor rash   but a bevy of eroses applecheekd   in a shallop of crystal ivorybeakd   with a satin sail of a ruby glow   to a sweet little eden on earth that i know   a mountain islet pointed and peakd   waves on a diamond shingle dash   cataract brooks to the ocean run   fairilydelicate palaces shine   mixt with myrtle and clad with vine   and overstreamd and silverystreakd   with many a rivulet high against the sun   the facets of the glorious mountain flash   above the valleys of palm and pine    thither o thither love let us go    no no no   for in all that exquisite isle my dear   there is but one bird with a musical throat   and his compass is but of a single note   that it makes one weary to hear    mock me not mock me not love let us go    no love no   for the bud ever breaks into bloom on the tree   and a storm never wakes on the lonely sea   and a worm is there in the lonely wood   that pierces the liver and blackens the blood   and makes it a sorrow to be           the ringlet             your ringlets your ringlets     that look so goldengay   if you will give me one but one     to kiss it night and day   then never chilling touch of time     will turn it silvergray   and then shall i know it is all true gold   to flame and sparkle and stream as of old   till all the comets in heaven are cold     and all her stars decay   then take it love and put it by   this cannot change nor yet can i                     2   my ringlet my ringlet     that art so goldengay   now never chilling touch of time     can turn thee silvergray   and a lad may wink and a girl may hint     and a fool may say his say   for my doubts and fears were all amiss   and i swear henceforth by this and this   that a doubt will only come for a kiss     and a fear to be kissd away   then kiss it love and put it by   if this can change why so can i                   ii   o ringlet o ringlet     i kissd you night and day   and ringlet o ringlet     you still are goldengay   but ringlet o ringlet     you should be silvergray   for what is this which now im told   i that took you for true gold   she that gave yous bought and sold               sold sold                    2   o ringlet o ringlet     she blushd a rosy red   when ringlet o ringlet     she clipt you from her head   and ringlet o ringlet     she gave you me and said   come kiss it love and put it by   if this can change why so can i   o fie you golden nothing fie               you golden lie                    3   o ringlet o ringlet     i count you much to blame   for ringlet o ringlet     you put me much to shame   so ringlet o ringlet     i doom you to the flame   for what is this which now i learn   has given all my faith a turn   burn you glossy
