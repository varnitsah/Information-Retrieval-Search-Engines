2668397	literary friends and acquaintancesoliver wendell holmes  by william dean howells    oliver wendell holmes  elsewhere we literary folk are apt to be such a common lot with tendencies here and there to be a shabby lot we arrive from all sorts of unexpected holes and corners of the earth remote obscure and at the best we do so often come up out of the ground but at boston we were of ascertained and noted origin and good part of us dropped from the skies instead of holding horses before the doors of theatres or capping verses at the ploughtail or tramping over europe with nothing but a flute in the pocket or walking up to the metropolis with no luggage but the ms of a tragedy or sleeping in doorways or under the arches of bridges or serving as apothecaries prenticeswe were good society from the beginning i think this was none the worse for us and it was vastly the better for good society  literature in boston indeed was so respectable and often of so high a lineage that to be a poet was not only to be good society but almost to be good family if one names over the men who gave boston her supremacy in literature during that unitarian harvesttime of the old puritanic seedtime which was her augustan age one names the people who were and who had been socially first in the city ever since the selfexile of the tories at the time of the revolution to say prescott motley parkman lowell norton higginson dana emerson channing was to say patrician in the truest and often the best sense if not the largest boston was small but these were of her first citizens and their primacy in its way was of the same quality as that say of the chief families of venice but these names can never have the effect for the stranger that they had for one to the manner born i say had for i doubt whether in boston they still mean all that they once meant and that their equivalents meant in science in law in politics the most famous if not the greatest of all the literary men of boston i have not mentioned with them for longfellow was not of the place though by his sympathies and relations he became of it and i have not mentioned oliver wendell holmes because i think his name would come first into the readers thought with the suggestion of social quality in the humanities  holmes was of the brahminical caste which his humorous recognition invited from its subjectivity in the new england consciousness into the light where all could know it and own it and like longfellow he was allied to the patriciate of boston by the most intimate ties of life for a long time for the whole first period of his work he stood for that alone its tastes its prejudices its foibles even and when he came to stand in his second period for vastly for infinitely more and to make friends with the whole race as few men have ever done it was always i think with a secret shiver of doubt a backward look of longing and an eye askance he was himself perfectly aware of this at times and would mark his several misgivings with a humorous sense of the situation he was essentially too kind to be of a narrow world too human to be finally of less than humanity too gentle to be of the finest gentility but such limitations as he had were in the direction i have hinted or perhaps more than hinted and i am by no means ready to make a mock of them as it would be so easy to do for some reasons that he has himself suggested to value aright the affection which the old bostonian had for boston one must conceive of something like the patriotism of men in the times when a mans city was a mans country something athenian something florentine the war that nationalized us liberated this love to the whole country but its first tenderness remained still for boston and i suppose a bostonian still thinks of himself first as a bostonian and then as an american in a way that no newyorker could deal with himself the rich historical background dignifies and ennobles the intense public spirit of the place and gives it a kind of personality     ii  in literature doctor holmes survived all the bostonians who had given the city her primacy in letters but when i first knew him there was no apparent ground for questioning it i do not mean now the time when i visited new england but when i came to live near boston and to begin the many happy years which i spent in her fine intellectual air i found time to run in upon him while i was there arranging to take my place on the atlantic monthly and i remember that in this brief moment with him he brought me to book about some vaunting paragraph in the nation claiming the literary primacy for new york he asked me if i knew who wrote it and i was obliged to own that i had written it myself when with the kindness he always showed me he protested against my position to tell the truth i do not think now i had any very good reasons for it and i certainly could urge none that would stand against his i could only fall back upon the saving clause that this primacy was claimed mainly if not wholly for new york in the future he was willing to leave me the connotations of prophecy but i think he did even this out of politeness rather than conviction and i believe he had always a sensitiveness where boston was concerned which could not seem ungenerous to any generous mind whatever lingering doubt of me he may have had with reference to boston seemed to satisfy itself when several years afterwards he happened to speak of a certain character in an early novel of mine who was not quite the kind of bostonian one could wish to be the thing came up in talk with another person who had referred to my bostonian and the doctor had apparently made his acquaintance in the book and not liked him i understood of course he said that he was a bostonian not the bostonian and i could truthfully answer that this was by all means my own understanding too  his fondness for his city which no one could appreciate better than myself i hope often found expression in a burlesque excess in his writings and in his talk perhaps oftener still hard upon my return from venice i had a halfhour with him in his old study on charles street where he still lived in 1865 and while i was there a young man came in for the doctors help as a physician though he looked so very well and was so lively and cheerful that i have since had my doubts whether he had not made a pretext for a glimpse of him as the autocrat the doctor took him upon his word however and said he had been so long out of practice that he could not do anything for him but he gave him the address of another physician somewhere near washington street and if you dont know where washington street is he said with a gay burst at a certain vagueness which had come into the young mans face you dont know anything  we had been talking of venice and what life was like there and he made me tell him in some detail he was especially interested in what i had to say of the minute subdivision and distribution of the necessaries the small coins and the small values adapted to their purchase the intensely retail character in fact of household provisioning and i could see how he pleased himself in formulating the theory that the higher a civilization the finer the apportionment of the demands and supplies the ideal he said was a civilization in which you could buy two cents worth of beef and a divergence from this standard was towards barbarism  the secret of the man who is universally interesting is that he is universally interested and this was above all the secret of the charm that doctor holmes had for every one no doubt he knew it for what that most alert intelligence did not know of itself was scarcely worth knowing this knowledge was one of his chief pleasures i fancy he rejoiced in the consciousness which is one of the highest attributes of the highly organized man and he did not care for the consequences in your mind if you were so stupid as not to take him aright i remember the delight henry james the father of the novelist had in reporting to me the frankness of the doctor when he had said to him holmes you are intellectually the most alive man i ever knew i am i am said the doctor from the crown of my head to the sole of my foot im alive im alive any one who ever saw him will imagine the vivid relish he had in recognizing the fact he could not be with you a moment without shedding upon you the light of his flashing wit his radiant humor and he shone equally upon the rich and poor in mind his gaiety of heart could not withhold itself from any chance of response but he did wish always to be fully understood and to be liked by those he liked he gave his liking cautiously though for the affluence of his sympathies left him without the reserves of colder natures and he had to make up for these with careful circumspection he wished to know the character of the person who made overtures to his acquaintance for he was aware that his friendship lay close to it he wanted to be sure that he was a nice person and though i think he preferred social quality in his fellowman he did not refuse himself to those who had merely a sweet and wholesome humanity he did not like anything that tasted or smelt of bohemianism in the personnel of literature but he did not mind the scent of the newploughed earth or even of the barnyard i recall his telling me once that after two younger brothersinletters had called upon him in the odor of an habitual beeriness and smokiness he opened the window and the very last time i saw him he remembered at eightyfive the offence he had found on his first visit to new york when a metropolitan poet had asked him to lunch in a basement restaurant     iii  he seemed not to mind however climbing to the little apartment we had in boston when we came there in 1866 and he made this call upon us in due form bringing mrs holmes with him as if to accent the recognition socially we were then incredibly young much younger than i find people ever are nowadays and in the consciousness of our youth we felt to the last exquisite value of the fact what it was to have the autocrat come to see us and i believe he was not displeased to perceive this he liked to know that you felt his quality in every way that first winter however i did not see him often and in the spring we went to live in cambridge and thereafter i met him chiefly at longfellows or when i came in to dine at the fieldses in boston it was at certain meetings of the dante club when longfellow read aloud his translation for criticism and there was supper later that one saw the doctor and his voice was heard at the supper rather than at the criticism for he was no italianate he always seemed to like a certain turn of the talk toward the mystical but with space for the feet on a firm ground of fact this side of the shadows when it came to going over among them and laying hold of them with the band of faith as if they were substance he was not of the excursion it is well known how fervent i cannot say devout a spiritualist longfellows brotherinlaw appleton was and when he was at the table too it took all the poets delicate skill to keep him and the autocrat from involving themselves in a cataclysmal controversy upon the matter of manifestations with doctor holmes the inquiry was inquiry to the last i believe and the burden of proof was left to the ghosts and their friends his attitude was strictly scientific he denied nothing but he expected the supernatural to be at least as convincing as the natural  there was a time in his history when the popular ignorance classed him with those who were once rudely called infidels but the world has since gone so fast and so far that the mind he was of concerning religious belief would now be thought religious by a good half of the religious world it is true that he had and always kept a grudge against the ancestral calvinism which afflicted his youth and he was through all rises and lapses of opinion essentially unitarian but of the honest belief of any one i am sure he never felt or spoke otherwise than most tolerantly most tenderly as often as he spoke of religion and his talk tended to it very often i never heard an irreligious word from him far less a scoff or sneer at religion and i am certain that this was not merely because he would have thought it bad taste though undoubtedly he would have thought it bad taste i think it annoyed it hurt him to be counted among the iconoclasts and he would have been profoundly grieved if he could have known how widely this false notion of him once prevailed it can do no harm at this late day to impart from the secrets of the publishing house the fact that a supposed infidelity in the tone of his story the guardian angel cost the atlantic monthly many subscribers now the tone of that story would not be thought even mildly agnostic i fancy and long before his death the author had outlived the error concerning him  it was not the best of his stories by any means and it would not be too harsh to say that it was the poorest his novels all belonged to an order of romance which was as distinctly his own as the form of dramatized essay which he invented in the autocrat if he did not think poorly of them he certainly did not think too proudly and i heard him quote with relish the phrase of a lady who had spoken of them to him as his medicated novels that indeed was perhaps what they were a faint faint odor of the pharmacopoeia clung to their pages their magic was scientific he knew this better than any one else of course and if any one had said it in his turn he would hardly have minded it but what he did mind was the persistent misinterpretation of his intention in certain quarters where he thought he had the right to respectful criticism in stead of the succession of sneers that greeted the successive numbers of his story and it was no secret that he felt the persecution keenly perhaps he thought that he had already reached that time in his literary life when he was a fact rather than a question and when reasons and not feelings must have to do with his acceptance or rejection but he had to live many years yet before he reached this state when he did reach it happily a good while before his death i do not believe any man ever enjoyed the like condition more he loved to feel himself out of the fight with much work before him still but with nothing that could provoke illwill in his activities he loved at all times to take himself objectively if i may so express my sense of a mental attitude that misled many as i have said before he was universally interested and he studied the universe from himself i do not know how one is to study it otherwise the impersonal has really no existence but with all his subtlety and depth he was of a make so simple of a spirit so naive that he could not practise the feints some use to conceal that interest in self which after all every one knows is only concealed he frankly and joyously made himself the startingpoint in all his inquest of the hearts and minds of other men but so far from singling himself out in this and standing apart in it there never was any one who was more eagerly and gladly your fellowbeing in the things of the soul     iv  in the things of the world he had fences and looked at some people through palings and even over the broken bottles on the tops of walls and i think he was the loser by this as well as they but then i think all fences are bad and that god has made enough differences between men we need not trouble ourselves to multiply them even behind his fences however holmes had a heart kind for the outsiders and i do not believe any one came into personal relations with him who did not experience this kindness in that long and delightful talk i had with him on my return from venice i can praise the talk because it was mainly his we spoke of the status of domestics in the old world and how fraternal the relation of high and low was in italy while in england between master and man it seemed without acknowledgment of their common humanity yes he said i always felt as if english servants expected to be trampled on but i cant do that if they want to be trampled on they must get some one else he thought that our american way was infinitely better and i believe that in spite of the fences there was always an instinctive impulse with him to get upon common ground with his fellowman i used to notice in the neighborhood cabman who served our block on beacon street a sort of affectionate reverence for the autocrat which could have come from nothing but the kindly terms between them if you went to him when he was engaged to doctor holmes he told you so with a sort of implication in his manner that the thought of anything else for the time was profanation the good fellow who took him his drives about the beverly and manchester shores seemed to be quite in the joke of the doctors humor and within the bounds of his personal modesty and his functional dignity permitted himself a smile at the doctors sallies when you stood talking with him or listening to him at the carriageside  the civic and social circumstance that a man values himself on is commonly no part of his value and certainly no part of his greatness rather it is the very thing that limits him and i think that doctor holmes appeared in the full measure of his generous personality to those who did not and could not appreciate his circumstance and not to those who formed it and who from lifelong association were so dear and comfortable to him those who best knew how great a man he was were those who came from far to pay him their duty or to thank him for some help they had got from his books or to ask his counsel or seek his sympathy with all such he was most winningly tender most intelligently patient i suppose no great author was ever more visited by letter and in person than he or kept a faithfuler conscience for his guests with those who appeared to him in the flesh he used a miraculous tact and i fancy in his treatment of all the physician native in him bore a characteristic part no one seemed to be denied access to him but it was after a moment of preparation that one was admitted and any one who was at all sensitive must have felt from the first moment in his presence that there could be no trespassing in point of time if now and then some insensitive began to trespass there was a slidingscale of dismissal that never failed of its work and that really saved the author from the effect of intrusion he was not bored because he would not be  i transfer at random the impressions of many years to my page and i shall not try to observe a chronological order in these memories vivid among them is that of a visit which i paid him with osgood the publisher then newly the owner of the atlantic monthly when i had newly become the sole editor we wished to signalize our accession to the control of the magazine by a stroke that should tell most in the public eye and we thought of asking doctor holmes to do something again in the manner of the autocrat and the professor at the breakfast table some letters had passed between him and the management concerning our wish and then osgood thought that it would be right and fit for us to go to him in person he proposed the visit and doctor holmes received us with a mind in which he had evidently formulated all his thoughts upon the matter his main question was whether at his age of sixty years a man was justified in seeking to recall a public of the past or to create a new public in the present he seemed to have looked the ground over not only with a personal interest in the question but with a keen scientific zest for it as something which it was delightful to consider in its generic relations and i fancy that the pleasure of this inquiry more than consoled him for such pangs of misgiving as he must have had in the personal question as commonly happens in the solution of such problems it was not solved he was very willing to take our minds upon it and to incur the risk if we thought it well and were willing to share it  we came away rejoicing and the new series began with the new year following it was by no means the popular success that we had hoped not because the author had not a thousand new things to say or failed to say them with the gust and freshness of his immortal youth but because it was not well to disturb a form associated in the public mind with an achievement which had become classic it is of the autocrat of the breakfast table that people think when they think of the peculiar species of dramatic essay which the author invented and they think also of the professor at the breakfast table because he followed so soon but the poet at the breakfast table came so long after that his advent alienated rather than conciliated liking very likely if the poet had come first he would have had no second place in the affections of his readers for his talk was full of delightful matter and at least one of the poems which graced each instalment was one of the finest and greatest that doctor holmes ever wrote i mean homesick in heaven which seems to me not only what i have said but one of the most important the most profoundly pathetic in the language indeed i do not know any other that in the same direction goes so far with suggestion so penetrating the other poems were mainly of a cast which did not win the metaphysics in them were too much for the human interest and again there rose a foolish clamor of the creeds against him on account of them the great talent the beautiful and graceful fancy the eager imagination of the autocrat could not avail in this third attempt and i suppose the poet at the breakfast table must be confessed as near a failure as doctor holmes could come it certainly was so in the magazine which the brilliant success of the first had availed to establish in the high place the periodical must always hold in the history of american literature lowell was never tired of saying when he recurred to the first days of his editorship that the magazine could never have gone at all without the autocrat papers he was proud of having insisted upon holmess doing something for the new venture and he was fond of recalling the authors misgivings concerning his contributions which later repeated themselves with too much reason though not with the reason that was in his own mind     v  he lived twentyfive years after that selfquestion at sixty and after eighty he continued to prove that threescore was not the limit of a mans intellectual activity or literary charm during all that time the work he did in mere quantity was the work that a man in the prime of life might well have been vain of doing and it was of a quality not less surprising if i asked him with any sort of fair notice i could rely upon him always for something for the january number and throughout the year i could count upon him for those occasional pieces in which he so easily excelled all former writers of occasional verse and which he liked to keep from the newspapers for the magazine he had a pride in his promptness with copy and you could always trust his promise the printers toe never galled the authors kibe in his case he wished to have an early proof which he corrected fastidiously but not overmuch and he did not keep it long he had really done all his work in the manuscript which came printperfect and beautifully clear from his pen in that flowing graceful hand which to the last kept a suggestion of the pleasure he must have had in it like all wise contributors he was not only patient but very glad of all the queries and challenges that proofreader and editor could accumulate on the margin of his proofs and when they were both altogether wrong he was still grateful in one of his poems there was some latinquarter french which our collective purism questioned and i remember how tender of us he was in maintaining that in his parisian time at least some ladies beyond the seine said eh ben instead of eh bien he knew that we must be always on the lookout for such little matters and he would not wound our ignorance i do not think any one enjoyed praise more than he of course he would not provoke it but if it came of itself he would not deny himself the pleasure as long as a relish of it remained he used humorously to recognize his delight in it and to say of the lecture audiences which in earlier times hesitated applause why dont they give me three times three i can stand it he himself gave in the generous fulness he desired he did not praise foolishly or dishonestly though he would spare an open dislike but when a thing pleased him he knew how to say so cordially and skilfully so that it might help as well as delight i suppose no great author has tried more sincerely and faithfully to befriend the beginner than he and from time to time he would commend something to me that he thought worth looking at but never insistently in certain cases where he had simply to ease a burden from his own to the editorial shoulders he would ask that the aspirant might be delicately treated there might be personal reasons for this but usually his kindness of heart moved him his tastes had their geographical limit but his sympathies were boundless and the hopeless creature for whom he interceded was oftener remote from boston and new england than otherwise  it seems to me that he had a nature singularly affectionate and that it was this which was at fault if he gave somewhat too much of himself to the celebration of the class of 29 and all the multitude of boston occasions large and little embalmed in the clear amber of his verse somewhat to the disadvantage of the amber if he were asked he could not deny the many friendships and fellowships which united in the asking the immediate reclame from these things was sweet to him but he loved to comply as much as he loved to be praised in the pleasure he got he could feel himself a prophet in his own country but the country which owned him prophet began perhaps to feel rather too much as if it owned him and did not prize his vaticinations at all their worth some polite bostonians knew him chiefly on this side and judged him to their own detriment from it     vi  after we went to live in cambridge my life and the delight in it were so wholly there that in ten years i had hardly been in as many boston houses as i have said i met doctor holmes at the fieldses and at longfellows when he came out to a dante supper which was not often and somewhat later at the saturday club dinners one parlous time at the publishers i have already recalled when mrs harriet beecher stowe and the autocrat clashed upon homeopathy and it required all the tact of the host to lure them away from the dangerous theme as it was a battle waged in the courteous forms of fontenoy went on pretty well through the dinner and it was only over the coffee that a truce was called i need not say which was heterodox or that each had a deep and strenuous conscience in the matter i have always felt it a proof of his extreme leniency to me unworthy that the doctor was able to tolerate my own defection from the elder faith in medicine and i could not feel his kindness less caressing because i knew it a concession to an infirmity he said something like after all a good physician was the great matter and i eagerly turned his clemency to praise of our family doctor  he was very constant at the saturday club as long as his strength permitted and few of its members missed fewer of its meetings he continued to sit at its table until the ghosts of hawthorne of agassiz of emerson of longfellow of lowell out of others less famous bore him company there among the younger men in the flesh it must have been very melancholy but nothing could deeply cloud his most cheerful spirit his strenuous interest in life kept him alive to all the things of it after so many of his friends were dead the questions which he was wont to deal with so fondly so wisely the great problems of the soul were all the more vital perhaps because the personal concern in them was increased by the translation to some other being of the men who had so often tried with him to fathom them here the last time i was at that table he sat alone there among those great memories but he was as gay as ever i saw him his wit sparkled his humor gleamed the poetic touch was deft and firm as of old the serious curiosity the instant sympathy remained to the witness he was pathetic but to himself he could only have been interesting as the figure of a man surviving in an alien but not unfriendly present the past which held so vast a part of all that had constituted him if he had thought of himself in this way it would have been without one emotion of selfpity such as more maudlin souls indulge but with a love of knowledge and wisdom as keenly alert as in his prime  for three privileged years i lived all but nextdoor neighbor of doctor holmes in that part of beacon street whither he removed after he left his old home in charles street and during these years i saw him rather often we were both on the water side which means so much more than the words say and our library windows commanded the same general view of the charles rippling out into the cambridge marshes and the sunsets and curving eastward under long bridge through shipping that increased onward to the sea he said that you could count fourteen towns and villages in the compass of that view with the three conspicuous monuments accenting the different attractions of it the tower of memorial hall at harvard the obelisk on bunker hill and in the centre of the picture that bulk of tufts college which he said he expected to greet his eyes the first thing when he opened them in the other world but the prospect though generally the same had certain precious differences for each of us which i have no doubt he valued himself as much upon as i did i have a notion that he fancied these were to be enjoyed best in his library through two oval panes let into the bay there apart from the windows for he was apt to make you come and look out of them if you got to talking of the view before you left in this pleasant study he lived among the books which seemed to multiply from case to case and shelf to shelf and climb from floor to ceiling everything was in exquisite order and the desk where he wrote was as scrupulously neat as if the sloven disarray of most authors desks were impossible to him he had a number of ingenious little contrivances for helping his work which he liked to show you for a time a revolving bookcase at the corner of his desk seemed to be his pet and after that came his fountainpen which he used with due observance of its fountain principle though he was tolerant of me when i said i always dipped mine in the inkstand it was a merit in his eyes to use a fountain pen in anywise after you had gone over these objects with him and perhaps taken a peep at something he was examining through his microscope he sat down at one corner of his hearth and invited you to an easy chair at the other his talk was always considerate of your wish to be heard but the person who wished to talk when he could listen to doctor holmes was his own victim and always the loser if you were well advised you kept yourself to the question and response which manifested your interest in what he was saying and let him talk on with his sweet smile and that husky laugh he broke softly into at times perhaps he was not very well when you came in upon him then he would name his trouble with a scientific zest and accuracy and pass quickly to other matters as i have noted he was interested in himself only on the universal side and he liked to find his peculiarity in you better than to keep it his own he suffered a visible disappointment if he could not make you think or say you were so and so too the querulous note was not in his most cheerful register he would not dwell upon a specialized grief though sometimes i have known him touch very lightly and currently upon a slight annoyance or disrelish for this or that as he grew older he must have had of course an old mans disposition to speak of his infirmities but it was fine to see him catch himself up in this when he became conscious of it and stop short with an abrupt turn to something else with a real interest which he gave humorous excess he would celebrate some little ingenious thing that had fallen in his way and i have heard him expatiate with childlike delight upon the merits of a new razor he had got a sort of mower which he could sweep recklessly over cheek and chin without the least danger of cutting himself the last time i saw him he asked me if he had ever shown me that miraculous razor and i doubt if he quite liked my saying i had seen one of the same kind  it seemed to me that he enjoyed sitting at his chimneycorner rather as the type of a person having a good time than as such a person he would rather be up and about something taking down a book making a note going again to his little windows and asking you if you had seen the crows yet that sometimes alighted on the shoals left bare by the ebbtide behind the house the reader will recall his lovely poem my aviary which deals with the winged life of that pleasant prospect i shared with him in the flock of wildducks which used to come into our neighbor waters in spring when the ice broke up and stayed as long as the smallest space of brine remained unfrozen in the fall he was graciously willing i should share in them and in the cloud of gulls which drifted about in the currents of the sea and sky there almost the whole year round i did not pretend an original right to them coming so late as i did to the place and i think my deference pleased him     vii  as i have said he liked his fences or at least liked you to respect them or to be sensible of them as often as i went to see him i was made to wait in the little receptionroom below and never shown at once to his study my name would be carried up and i would hear him verifying my presence from the maid through the opened door then there came a cheery cry of wellcome is that you come up come up and i found him sometimes halfway down the stairs to meet me he would make an excuse for having kept me below a moment and say something about the rule he had to observe in all cases as if he would not have me feel his fence a personal thing i was aware how thoroughly his gentle spirit pervaded the whole house the irish maid who opened the door had the effect of being a neighbor too and of being in the joke of the little formality she apologized in her turn for the receptionroom there was certainly nothing trampled upon in her manner but affection and reverence for him whose gate she guarded with something like the sentiment she would have cherished for a dignitary of the church but nicely differenced and adjusted to the autocrats peculiar merits  the last time i was in that place a visitant who had lately knocked at my own door was about to enter i met the master of the house on the landing of the stairs outside his study and he led me in for the few moments we could spend together he spoke of the shadow so near and said he supposed there could be no hope but he did not refuse the cheer i offered him from my ignorance against his knowledge and at something that was thought or said he smiled with even a breath of laughter so potent is the wont of a lifetime though his eyes were full of tears and his voice broke with his words those who have sorrowed deepest will understand this best  it was during the few years of our beacon street neighborhood that he spent those hundred days abroad in his last visit to england and france he was full of their delight when he came back and my propinquity gave me the advantage of hearing him speak of them at first hand he whimsically pleased himself most with his derbyday experiences and enjoyed contrasting the crowd and occasion with that of forty or fifty years earlier when he had seen some famous race of the derby won nothing else in england seemed to have moved him so much though all that royalties dignities and celebrities could well do for him had been done of certain things that happened to him characteristic of the english and interesting to him in their relation to himself through his character of universally interested man he spoke freely but he has said what he chose to the public about them and i have no right to say more the thing that most vexed him during his sojourn apparently was to have been described in one of the london papers as quite deaf and i could truly say to him that i had never imagined him at all deaf or heard him accused of it before oh yes he said i am a little hard of hearing on one side but it isnt deafness  he had indeed few or none of the infirmities of age that make themselves painfully or inconveniently evident he carried his slight figure erect and until his latest years his step was quick and sure once he spoke of the lessened height of old people apropos of something that was said and they will shrink you know he added as if he were not at all concerned in the fact himself if you met him in the street you encountered a spare carefully dressed old gentleman with a cleanshaven face and a friendly smile qualified by the involuntary frown of his thick senile brows well coated lustrously shod well gloved in a silk hat latterly wound with a mourningweed sometimes he did not know you when he knew you quite well and at such times i think it was kind to spare his years the fatigue of recalling your identity at any rate i am glad of the times when i did so in society he had the same vagueness the same dimness but after the moment he needed to make sure of you he was as vivid as ever in his life he made me think of a bed of embers on which the ashes have thinly gathered and which when these are breathed away sparkles and tinkles keenly up with all the freshness of a newly kindled fire he did not mind talking about his age and i fancied rather enjoyed doing so its approaches interested him if he was going he liked to know just how and when he was going once he spoke of his lasting strength in terms of imaginative humor he was still so intensely interested in nature the universe that it seemed to him he was not like an old man so much as a lusty infant which struggles against having the breast snatched from it he laughed at the notion of this with that impersonal relish which seemed to me singularly characteristic of the selfconsciousness so marked in him i never heard one lugubrious word from him in regard to his years he liked your sympathy on all grounds where he could have it selfrespectfully but he was a most manly spirit and he would not have had it even as a type of the universal decay possibly he would have been interested to have you share in that analysis of himself which he was always making if such a thing could have been  he had not much patience with the unmanly craving for sympathy in others and chiefly in our literary craft which is somewhat ignobly given to it though he was patient after all he used to say and i believe he has said it in printholmes said it in print many times in his three novels and scattered through the breakfast table series dwthat unless a man could show a good reason for writing verse it was rather against him and a proof of weakness i suppose this severe conclusion was something he had reached after dealing with innumerable small poets who sought the light in him with verses that no editor would admit to print yet of morbidness he was often very tender he knew it to be disease something that must be scientifically rather than ethically treated he was in the same degree kind to any sensitiveness for he was himself as sensitive as he was manly and he was most delicately sensitive to any rightful social claim upon him i was once at a dinner with him where he was in some sort my host in a company of people whom he had not seen me with before and he made a point of acquainting me with each of them it did not matter that i knew most of them already the proof of his thoughtfulness was precious and i was sorry when i had to disappoint it by confessing a previous knowledge     viii  i had three memorable meetings with him not very long before he died one a year before and the other two within a few months of the end the first of these was at luncheon in the summerhouse of a friend whose hospitality made it summer the year round and we all went out to meet him when he drove up in his open carriage with the little sunshade in his hand which he took with him for protection against the heat and also a little i think for the whim of it he sat a moment after he arrived as if to orient himself in respect to each of us beside the gifted hostess there was the most charming of all the american essayists and the autocrat seemed at once to find himself singularly at home with the people who greeted him there was no interval needed for fanning away the ashes he tinkled up before he entered the house and at the table he was as vivid and scintillant as i ever saw him if indeed i ever saw him as much so the talk began at once and we had made him believe that there was nothing egotistic in his taking the word or turning it in illustration from himself upon universal matters i spoke among other things of some humble ruins on the road to gloucester which gave the wayside a very aged look the tumbled foundationstones of poor bits of houses and ah he said the cellar and the well he added to the company generally do you know what i think are the two lines of mine that go as deep as any others in a certain direction and he began to repeat stragglingly certain verses from one of his earlier poems until he came to the closing couplet but i will give them in full because in going to look them up i have found them so lovely and because i can hear his voice again in every fondly accented syllable       who sees unmoved a ruin at his feet      the lowliest home where human hearts have beat      its hearthstone shaded with the bistre stain      a centurys showery torrents wash in vain      its starving orchard where the thistle blows      and mossy trunks still mark the broken rows      its chimneyloving poplar oftenest seen      next an old roof or where a roof has been      its knotgrass plantainall the social weeds      mans mute companions following where he leads      its dwarfed pale flowers that show their straggling heads      sown by the wind from grasschoked gardenbeds      its woodbine creeping where it used to climb      its roses breathing of the olden time      all the poor shows the curious idler sees      as lifes thin shadows waste by slow degrees      till naught remains the saddening tale to tell      save homes last wrecksthe cellar and the well  the poets chanting voice rose with a triumphant swell in the climax and there he said isnt it so the cellar and the wellthey cant be thrown down or burnt up they are the human monuments that last longest and defy decay he rejoiced openly in the sympathy that recognized with him the divination of a most pathetic most signal fact and he repeated the last couplet again at our entreaty glad to be entreated for it i do not know whether all will agree with him concerning the relative importance of the lines but i think all must feel the exquisite beauty of the picture to which they give the final touch  he said a thousand witty and brilliant things that day but his pleasure in this gave me the most pleasure and i recall the passage distinctly out of the dimness that covers the rest he chose to figure us younger men in touching upon the literary circumstance of the past and present as representative of modern feeling and thinking and himself as no longer contemporary we knew he did this to be contradicted and we protested affectionately fervently with all our hearts and minds and indeed there were none of his generation who had lived more widely into ours he was not a prophet like emerson nor ever a voice crying in the wilderness like whittier or lowell his note was heard rather amid the sweet security of streets but it was always for a finer and gentler civility he imagined no new rule of life and no philosophy or theory of life will be known by his name he was not constructive he was essentially observant and in this he showed the scientific nature he made his reader known to himself first in the little and then in the larger things from first to last he was a censor but a most winning and delightful censor who could make us feel that our faults were other peoples and who was not wont       to bait his homilies with his brother worms  at one period he sat in the seat of the scorner as far as reform was concerned or perhaps reformers who are so often tedious and ridiculous but he seemed to get a new heart with the new mind which came to him when he began to write the autocrat papers and the light mocker of former days became the serious and compassionate thinker to whom most truly nothing that was human was alien his readers trusted and loved him few men have ever written so intimately with so much dignity and perhaps none has so endeared himself by saying just the thing for his reader that his reader could not say for himself he sought the universal through himself in others and he found to his delight and theirs that the most universal thing was often if not always the most personal thing  in my later meetings with him i was struck more and more by his gentleness i believe that men are apt to grow gentler as they grow older unless they are of the curmudgeon type which rusts and crusts with age but with doctor holmes the gentleness was peculiarly marked he seemed to shrink from all things that could provoke controversy or even difference he waived what might be a matter of dispute and rather sought the things that he could agree with you upon in the last talk i had with him he appeared to have no grudge left except for the puritanic orthodoxy in which he had been bred as a child this he was not able to forgive though its tradition was interwoven with what was tenderest and dearest in his recollections of childhood we spoke of puritanism and i said i sometimes wondered what could be the mind of a man towards life who had not been reared in its awful shadow say an english churchman or a continental catholic and he said he could not imagine and that he did not believe such a man could at all enter into our feelings puritanism he seemed to think made an essential and ineradicable difference i do not believe he had any of that false sentiment which attributes virtue of character to severity of creed while it owns the creed to be wrong  he differed from longfellow in often speaking of his contemporaries he spoke of them frankly but with an appreciative rather than a censorious criticism of longfellow himself he said that day when i told him i had been writing about him and he seemed to me a man without error that he could think of but one error in him and that was an error of taste of almost merely literary taste it was at an earlier time that he talked of lowell after his death and told me that lowell once in the fever of his antislavery apostolate had written him urging him strongly as a matter of duty to come out for the cause he had himself so much at heart afterwards lowell wrote again owning himself wrong in his appeal which he had come to recognize as invasive he was ten years younger than i said the doctor  i found him that day i speak of in his house at beverly farms where he had a pleasant study in a corner by the porch and he met me with all the cheeriness of old but he confessed that he had been greatly broken up by the labor of preparing something that might be read at some commemorative meeting and had suffered from finding first that he could not write something specially for it even the copying and adapting an old poem had overtaxed him and in this he showed the failing powers of age but otherwise he was still young intellectually that is there was no failure of interest in intellectual things especially literary things some new book lay on the table at his elbow and he asked me if i had seen it and made some joke about his having had the good luck to read it and have it lying by him a few days before when the author called i do not know whether he schooled himself against an old mans tendency to revert to the past or not but i know that he seldom did so that morning however he made several excursions into it and told me that his youthful satire of the spectre pig had been provoked by a poem of the elder danas where a phantom horse had been seriously employed with an effect of anticlimax which he had found irresistible another foray was to recall the oppression and depression of his early religious associations and to speak with moving tenderness of his father whose hard doctrine as a minister was without effect upon his own kindly nature  in a letter written to me a few weeks after this time upon an occasion when he divined that some word from him would be more than commonly dear he recurred to the feeling he then expressed fiftysix years agomore than half a centuryi lost my own father his age being seventythree years as i have reached that period of life passed it and now left it far behind my recollections seem to brighten and bring back my boyhood and early manhood in a clearer and fairer light than it came to me in my middle decades i have often wished of late years that i could tell him how i cherished his memory perhaps i may have the happiness of saying all i long to tell him on the other side of that thin partition which i love to think is all that divides us  men are never long together without speaking of women and i said how inevitably mens lives ended where they began in the keeping of women and their strength failed at last and surrendered itself to their care i had not finished before i was made to feel that i was poaching and yes said the owner of the preserve i have spoken of that and he went on to tell me just where he was not going to have me suppose i had invented those notions and i could not do less than own that i must have found them in his book and forgotten it  he spoke of his pleasant summer life in the air at once soft and fresh of that lovely coast and of his drives up and down the country roads sometimes this lady and sometimes that came for him and one or two habitually but he always had his own carriage ordered if they failed that he might not fail of his drive in any fair weather his cottage was not immediately on the sea but in full sight of it and there was a sense of the sea about it as there is in all that incomparable region and i do not think he could have been at home anywhere beyond the reach of its salt breath  i was anxious not to outstay his strength and i kept my eye on the clock in frequent glances i saw that he followed me in one of these and i said that i knew what his hours were and i was watching so that i might go away in time and then he sweetly protested did i like that chair i was sitting in it was a gift to him and he said who gave it with a pleasure in the fact that was very charming as if he liked the association of the thing with his friend he was disposed to excuse the formal look of his bookcases which were filled with sets and presented some phalanxes of fiction in rather severe array  when i rose to go he was concerned about my being able to find my way readily to the station and he told me how to go and what turns to take as if he liked realizing the way to himself i believe he did not walk much of late years and i fancy he found much the same pleasure in letting his imagination make this excursion to the station with me that he would have found in actually going  i saw him once more but only once when a day or two later he drove up by our hotel in magnolia toward the cottage where his secretary was lodging he saw us from his carriage and called us gayly to him to make us rejoice with him at having finally got that commemorative poem off his mind he made a jest of the trouble it had cost him even some sleeplessness and said he felt now like a convalescent he was all brightness and friendliness and eagerness to make us feel his mood through what was common to us all and i am glad that this last impression of him is so one with the first i ever had and with that which every reader receives from his work  that is bright and friendly and eager too for it is throughout the very expression of himself i think it is a pity if an author disappoints even the unreasonable expectation of the reader whom his art has invited to love him but i do not believe that doctor holmes could inflict this disappointment certainly he could disappoint no reasonable expectation no intelligent expectation what he wrote that he was and every one felt this who met him he has therefore not died as some men die the remote impersonal sort but he is yet thrillingly alive in every page of his books the quantity of his literature is not great but the quality is very surprising and surprising first of all as equality from the beginning to the end he wrote one man of course in his successive consciousnesses perhaps every one does this but his work gives the impression of an uncommon continuity in spite of its being the effect of a later and an earlier impulse so very marked as to have made the later an astonishing revelation to those who thought they knew him     ix  it is not for me in such a paper as this to attempt any judgment of his work i have loved it as i loved him with a sense of its limitations which is by no means a censure of its excellences he was not a man who cared to transcend he liked bounds he liked horizons the constancy of shores if he put to sea he kept in sight of land like the ancient navigators he did not discover new continents and i will own that i for my part should not have liked to sail with columbus i think one can safely affirm that as great and as useful men stayed behind and found an america of the mind without stirring from their thresholds     etext editors bookmarks     appeal which he had come to recognize as invasive    appeared to have no grudge left    could make us feel that our faults were other peoples    hard of hearing on one side but it isnt deafness    harriet beecher stowe and the autocrat clashed upon homeopathy    he was not bored because he would not be    he was not constructive he was essentially observant    his readers trusted and loved him    mens lives ended where they began in the keeping of women    not a man who cared to transcend he liked bounds    not much patience with the unmanly craving for sympathy    old mans disposition to speak of his infirmities    old mans tendency to revert to the past    person who wished to talk when he could listen    reformers who are so often tedious and ridiculous    secret of the man who is universally interesting    sought the things that he could agree with you upon    spare his years the fatigue of recalling your identity    study in a corner by the porch    those who have sorrowed deepest will understand this best    times when a mans city was a mans country    turn of the talk toward the mystical    work gives the impression of an uncommon continuity
