its result   “land sakes alive daniel look at that boy”  “where is he marthy”  “up there on the old apple tree ahangin’ down by his toes my gracious does he wanter kill himself”  “thet’s wot he does marthy” grumbled old daniel hawkins “he’ll do it jest so ez we kin pay his funeral expenses never seen sech a boy before in my born days”  “go after him with the horsewhip daniel oh goodness gracious look at thet now”  and the woman or rather tartar mrs martha hawkins held up her hands in terror as the boy on the apple tree suddenly gave a swing released his feet and with a graceful turn forward landed on his feet on the ground  “wot do yer mean by sech actions yer young goodfernothin’” cried daniel hawkins rushing forward his face full of sudden rage “do yer want ter break yer wuthless neck”  “not much i don’t” replied the boy with a little smile creeping over his sunburned handsome face “i’m afraid if i did that i would never get over it mr hawkins”  “don’t try ter joke me leo dunbar or i’ll break every bone in your worthless body”  “i’m not joking i mean what i say”  “did yer put the cattle out in the cherry pasture”  “yes sir”  “feed the pigs”  “yes sir”  “mend thet barn door as i told yer to yesterday”  “mended it last night”  “wot about fixin’ thet scythe yer broke tudder day”  “i can’t fix that i’ll have to take it down to joe marks’ blacksmith shop”  “o’ course an’ who’s goin’ ter pay fer it” demanded daniel hawkins  “you can take it out of my wages mr hawkins”  “out o’ yer wages”  “that’s what i said sir”  the old farmer’s face grew darker than ever “ain’t no wages comin’ to yer you spile more than yer earn”  “according to my reckoning there are about twentyeight dollars coming to me” returned leo dunbar quickly “i have kept the tally ever since i came to live with you”  “ain’t a cent boy not a penny”  “i beg to differ with you and now while we are at it mr hawkins supposing we settle up”  “eh”  “i say supposing we settle up”  “settle up” repeated the miserly farmer in amazement  “yes you can pay me what you owe me my month will be up tomorrow and i don’t intend to stay here any longer”  “but yer will stay boy i’ve got a right on yer the poorhouse folks signed the papers”  “squire dobb signed the papers but to me that doesn’t count he never had any claim on me”  “he settled yer father’s estate”  “i know it—and kept me out of my money too”  “you—you——”  “no more compliments mr hawkins i say he kept me out of my money and i mean it and now he and you are doing about all you can to make me commit suicide” “oh jest to hear thet boy” burst in mrs hawkins who had just come up “daniel why don’t yeou birch him”  “i will ef he gives me any more sass” replied her husband “he shan’t talk about me an’ the squire”  the old farmer was getting red in the face he knew that leo dunbar was telling the truth  a year before leo’s parents had died leaving the boy alone in the world  mr dunbar’s property had been very much involved and squire dobb the most rascally lawyer in hopsville had taken the matter in charge  at the end of six months he had announced to leo that there was no money coming to him then as manager of the poorhouse of the district the lawyer had bound leo over to daniel hawkins at four dollars a month and found  “i will talk” cried leo spiritedly “i think it about time that i received my rights”  this remark made daniel hawkins’ wrath boil over he ran toward the barn and presently returned carrying a heavy hidebound whip  “you ain’t had a dressing down in a month an’ now i’m agoin’ ter give it to yer good” he exclaimed as he raised the whip and rushed at leo  whiz the heavy whip came down the blow aimed for the boy’s shoulder  but leo was not hit like a flash he moved to one side at the last instant and the whip only circled through the empty air  more enraged than before daniel hawkins rushed forward again and caught the boy by the arm  “you whelp i’ll show you” he snarled  again the whip was raised but it never struck the blow intended for an interruption came as terrorizing as it was unexpected  there was a fearful roar out in the dusty road beyond the house a roar that echoed and reechoed among the hills around and then a huge beast bounded over the stone fence landing directly at leo dunbar’s feet  it was a lion that had escaped from “the greatest show on earth” the circus that was to perform at hopsville that afternoon and evening     chapter ii—capturing a runaway lion   if leo dunbar was startled at the sudden appearance of this mighty monarch of the forest what shall be said of daniel hawkins and his wife martha  the farmer and his spouse gave one look and then stood fairly paralyzed with fear  they were unable to utter a word and to tell the truth they both felt as if judgment was about to fall on them for illtreating leo and that the ends of their miserable lives were at hand  the lion crouched low moving his heavy tail slowly from side to side  he had escaped from his steel cage but an hour before and as yet hardly knew what to do with his freedom  from the road he had not been able to see the persons in the yard but he had heard their voices and his brute nature had caused him to leap the stone fence that he might rend some living creature limb from limb  that the lion was in an ugly humor was easy to see his mane was ruffled his immense claws unsheathed and his eyes were full of bloodcurdling ferocity  at first he gazed at leo but then swiftly turned toward mrs hawkins taking a single leap that brought him at the woman’s very feet  “oh daniel save me” she managed to gasp  “can’t nohow marthy” spluttered the old farmer  and then recovering just sufficiently to move he made a wild dash for the farmhouse leaving his wife to her fate  “you coward” cried leo but daniel hawkins paid no heed to the remark it is likely that in his terror he did not hear it  “save me leo” went on the woman “the beast is goin’ ter eat me up”  the sound of her voice appeared to anger the lion still more  his tail moved quicker and leo saw that he was on the point of leaping on the woman  the leap once made it would be impossible to do anything for mrs hawkins the lion would simply rend and devour her  leo gazed about him for some weapon he realized that if anything was to be done it must be done instantly  his eyes fell on the whip the old farmer had dropped with a rapid movement he picked up the article and whirling around struck the lion fairly and squarely across the eyes  it was a telling blow and smarting with pain the brute let out a roar ten times louder than before  then he turned about and faced leo  “run for your life” sang out the youth to the woman “run i tell you”  she stared at him but when he gave her a shove she realized what he was saying and made such a spurt as had never before been seen in that dooryard  the lion watched her go but made no attempt to follow his mind was on leo and on the blow the boy had given him  he was an ugly brute and around the circus was known to be the most difficult to manage trainer after trainer had tried to break him in but without effect instead of getting more docile he grew worse  in his former days he had killed a man and evidently he was longing for a chance to repeat this bloody tragedy  he took several steps and tried to get behind leo  but the boy was on the alert and ran backward toward the apple tree  then the lion crouched for a leap his immense body was bent low his tail gave a quiver and forward he shot toward the very spot where leo was standing  but as the lion leaped so did the boy he turned a graceful curve to the left out of the brute’s reach and caught the lowest branch of the tree behind him  the lion’s nose struck the tree trunk and he let out another roar of mingled pain and disappointment  “didn’t do it that time” muttered leo “what’s the use of banging your nose like that”  another roar was the only answer and then the lion left the vicinity of the tree and moved back several yards beyond the branch to which leo clung  the boy knew what was coming and immediately stood up on the limb  he was none too soon  again the lion made a leap upward  he reached the limb but only to find that leo had taken a spring to the next above  but now an accident happened which neither the boy nor the brute was expecting  the apple tree was old and somewhat rotted at the roots the weight of the boy and the sudden shock from the heavy body of the lion were too much for it to stand  there was a crack and a loud snap and then the tree went over on the ground carrying leo and the lion with it  the lion was completely bewildered by the fall and moreover he was entrapped for the moment by several limbs which came down on his back and neck  as the tree went over leo turned around and landed on his feet directly beside the lion  he saw how mixed up the brute was amid the branches and this gave him a sudden idea  with a lightness of foot that was surprising in a mere farm lad he ran to the woodshed  soon he reappeared carrying a washline a wellrope and half a dozen leather straps  he fastened an end of the washline to one of the limbs of the tree and then to another and so on all around the lion  then he crossed the wellrope over the line and even fastened it around the lion’s left hind leg  then making a noose of the longest strap he watched his chance and dropped it over the brute’s neck  of course the lion roared and struggled to free himself but leo was too quick for him  the noose around his neck leo tightened it considerably and then fastened the end of the strap to the tree trunk  “now if you move you’ll take the whole tree with you” thought the boy     chapter iii—leo leaves the farm   the savage lion was a prisoner  in vain he tried to release himself turning over merely tangled him up tighter and in his struggle he almost broke a hind leg and choked himself to death  he tried to run and succeeded in carrying the whole apple tree several yards  but the load was too much for him and with a roar of pain and rage he at length became quiet  in the meanwhile daniel hawkins and his wife had gone into the farmhouse and locked all the doors and lower windows  they were now at an upper window watching proceedings  “he’s got him daniel” cried mrs hawkins  “the apple tree is down” groaned the old farmer in reply “plague take the pesky critter”  “leo hez tied him fast”  “maybe he might git away an’ chew him up wish he would” continued daniel hawkins  “it must be a lion from thet circus at hopsville daniel an’ if so they’ll come after him”  “well they better take him away” growled the old farmer  while they were talking a loud shouting was heard on the road and presently half a dozen men on horseback came into view  all were heavily armed and several carried lassoes and ropes  they were a party from the circus on the search for the lion  leo heard them coming and ran down the road to meet them  “hi boy seen anything of a lion around here” asked the leader  “indeed i have” laughed leo  “where is he” demanded another of the crowd quickly  “over in the dooryard of that farmhouse”  “has he hurt any one”  “he has scared the wits out of that man and his wife” and leo pointed to daniel hawkins and his spouse  “he’s enough to scare the wits out of any one” put in another of the crowd “come boys now for a tussle with old nero”  “we ought to shoot him at once we can’t capture him alive” growled a rear man  “you won’t have to shoot him” said leo with a twinkle in his eye  “why not you don’t mean to say he’s dead already”  “oh no he’s alive enough”  “is it possible he has been captured”  “yes i captured him and tied him to a tree”  “nonsense boy this is no time for fooling the lion may eat somebody up”  “i’m not fooling sir i have captured him if you don’t believe me come and see for yourself”  still incredulous the party of men followed leo into the dooryard  when they saw the lion under the fallen apple tree they did not know whether to laugh or praise leo the most  “by jove but this is the greatest feat yet”  “old nero has a cage around him now and no mistake”  “he can’t move a step unless he drags the whole tree with him”  “say boy who helped you do this”  “no one”  “you did it entirely alone”  “yes sir” was the modest reply  “thet ain’t so it wuz me as captured yer lion fer yer” came from daniel hawkins who had joined the party in the yard  “mr hawkins how can you say that” exclaimed leo in amazement “you ran for your life and locked yourself in the house even before your wife got away”  “tain’t so i captured the lion an’ if there’s any reward it comes to me”  “we have offered no reward but we are willing to pay for the capture” replied the leader of the circus men “but if you caught the lion how is it you were up in the house when we rode up”  “daniel daniel” shrieked mrs hawkins still in the window “come up again leo didn’t fasten him tight enough an’ he’s gettin’ away”  the alarm again terrorized daniel hawkins  forgetting all about his assumed bravery he made a wild dash for the cottage leaving leo and the men alone in the yard  “does that look as if he had much to do with catching him” laughed leo  “no it does not but the woman is right nero is getting ready to struggle for freedom come boys put the harness over him while we have the chance”  the three circus men set to work it was a dangerous proceeding but at last it was finished and the escaped lion was a prisoner  then one of the men rode back to the circus grounds to return with the cage in which the brute belonged  while this was going on daniel hawkins again came out this time followed by his wife  he tried to convince the circus men that he had captured the lion but no one would believe him  “i reckon the credit goes to this boy” said barton reeve the manager of the menagerie attached to the “greatest show on earth”  “no sech thing he only got the ropes fer me”  “if you were so brave what made you run just now”  “i—i—went ter help my wife she—she sometimes hez fits an’ i was afraid she would git one and fall from the winder”  all the circus men laughed at this explanation but not one believed it true  “an’ another thing thet apple tree hez got ter be paid for” continued the farmer  “we’ll pay for that if the lion pulled it down”  “he certainly did” put in mrs hawkins  “well what was the old tree worth”  “fifty dollars an’ more”  “hardly” put in leo “you said only day before yesterday you were going to cut it down for firewood because it was so rotted”  “shet up boy” howled daniel hawkins “the tree is wuth fifty dollars an’ more”  “i’ll pay you ten dollars” said barton reeve  “you’ll pay fifty”  “not a cent over ten the tree is not worth five”  “i’ll have the law on yer fer trespass”  “all right if you want to sue i guess we can stand it” was the circus man’s cool response  daniel hawkins talked and threatened but all to no purpose  at last he agreed to take ten dollars and two tickets for the evening performance and the bargain was settled on the spot  it was not long after that that the steelcaged circus wagon came along followed by a crowd of men and boys all eager to see the strange sights connected with an escaped lion  it was noised about that leo dunbar had captured the savage brute and the boys gazed at the farm lad enviously  “he’s a brave one eh” said one  “i wouldn’t do it for a thousand dollars would you” added another  “i always knew he was a cool one and there isn’t a fellow around as limber as he is” put in a third  and so the talk ran  when the lion was safe in the cage once more barton reeve turned to leo  “can you come with me to the circus grounds” he asked “i would like to talk with you”  “certainly” replied leo quickly “i was going up there at the first chance i got to get away from the farm anyway”  “going up to see the show”  “not only that but to see the manager”  “what do you want to see the manager for”  “i want to strike him for a job”  “what sort of a job”  “as a gymnastic clown”  “a clown and a gymnast” said barton reeve slowly “well you might be a clown if you got funny but what do you know about gymnastics”  “quite a bit sir if i do say it myself i have liked the exercise all my life and it seems to me i was cut out for that sort of life”  leo’s earnestness kept barton reeve from smiling  he had often had boys and even men come to him full of silly notions about joining the circus  he saw that leo was a levelheaded youth and he noted too that the boy’s body was finely formed and well developed  “see here what do you think of this” suddenly cried leo  running forward he turned several handsprings and ended with a clear air somersault  “that’s all right” in fact it was firstrate  “if i had the apparatus i would like to show you what i can do on the bar and with the rings” went on leo  “you can do that at the grounds come on”  barton reeve rode off with leo behind him on the horse  daniel hawkins tried to call the boy back but all to no purpose  “has he any claim on you leo” asked the man  “not a bit of a claim he treated me like a dog and now i’m going to leave him whether i get in with the circus or not”     chapter iv—leo joins the greatest show on earth   on the way to the circus grounds leo told reeve much about himself  he was seventeen years old and for years had had a nice home with his parents and it was during this time that he had taken a thorough course of gymnastics  his father had been a retired officer of the united states army and was supposed to be well to do at the time of his death  but leo had never gotten a cent out of the estate and since becoming an orphan had known nothing but hard work  the boy was satisfied that squire dobb was keeping him out of his money but he had no proofs to use in bringing a case against the rascally lawyer  life on the farm he could not endure and it was only the hope of getting some money out of daniel hawkins which had kept him so long at the drudgery there  now he was satisfied there was no money to be had and he intended to leave at the first chance  by the time leo’s story was told the party had arrived at the circus grounds  it was afternoon and already the great white tents were up covering an entire block in the southern end of the town  the cage was properly placed in the menagerie department and then barton reeve led the way between numerous empty wagons to the rear of a large affair used as a ticket office  this was not yet open but a knock on the door brought a quick response  two men were in the wagon the treasurer mr giles and adam lambert the traveling manager of the show  “here is a young man who would like to see you mr lambert” said barton reeve and he introduced leo  “what is it” asked the manager shortly “my time is valuable”  “he would like a job in the ring”  and then reeve told about what leo had done and what the boy’s aspirations were  ordinarily the manager would not have listened to such an application having hundreds of such made to him every week  but he liked leo’s looks and besides a boy who could capture a lion was certainly worth talking to  “don’t you know it’s a hard life my boy” he said  “i’ll warrant it is no harder than life on the hawkins’ farm sir”  “it’s not as rosy as it looks from a seat outside of the oval”  “i know that but i am willing to put up with the roughness just for the chance to make something of myself” returned leo  adam lambert thought for a moment  “come with me into the ring” he said  leo followed him gladly  the rings two in number were empty and so were the hundreds of seats making the tent look vast and gloomy  “now show me what you can do”  “yes sir”  off came leo’s coat vest and shoes then followed a number of handsprings forward backward and sideways and somersaults and curious attitudes  “can i use that bar up there”  “certainly but there is no rope to get to it”  “never mind sir”  as he spoke leo ran to the centerpole and up this he went like a flash  then he gave a sudden leap and sat down on the bar several yards off  “by jove there is something in that boy” murmured adam lambert to reeve “he has just daring enough to succeed”  “so i would say mr lambert hullo look there”  leo was turning rapidly on the bar  he went through a dozen gymnastic movements and then slid down the center pole  “that will do” shouted the manager “i’ll give you a trial you can place yourself under dick pomeroy the head tumbler and bar man mr reeve take him to dick”  adam lambert had scarcely spoken when a tall finelybuilt fellow rushed into the ring from one of the dressingrooms  “mr lambert”  “well dick”  “broxton is intoxicated again”  “indeed didn’t you warn him as i told you”  “yes but it did no good he is so intoxicated he can’t stand”  “then he can’t do his brother clown act with snipper”  “no sir we’ll have to cut it out”  “too bad with nash on the sick list too”  “see here” put in barton reeve “this boy wanted to do clown as well as acrobatics”  “is that so dunbar”  “yes sir if i can help you out i’ll do my best”  “it’s short notice” mused adam lambert  “snipper can instruct him and cut out anything difficult” suggested barton reeve  he had taken a strong liking to leo and wished to get the boy a place  “well fix it up dick the best you can” said the manager “i must go back and see about those stolen tickets”  and off went the manager followed a minute later by barton reeve leaving leo alone with dick pomeroy who had charge of the clowns and tumblers connected with the “greatest show on earth”  pomeroy at once led leo around to a dressingroom in a corner sat jack snipper a clown and gymnast his face drawn down  “here’s a man to take broxton’s place” explained pomeroy  “why he’s a boy” exclaimed snipper  “never mind you must drill him in the best you can”  “can he do anything on the bar”  “i reckon so”  “i don’t like this drilling in new fellows every couple of weeks” growled snipper who was not a man of cheerful disposition  as a matter of fact he was what is commonly called a crank and very jealous of his reputation  he told leo where he could obtain a pair of tights and a clown’s outfit and made up the boy’s face for him  then he gave leo a long lesson  the two were to do a clown act and then while on the bars throw off their clown dresses and go in for a brothers’ gymnastic act  leo worked hard and by the time the circus commenced he was ready to go on although it must be admitted he was extremely nervous  the grand entrée was the first thing on the programme it included the rulers of all nations savage tribes elephants camels chariots and a hundred and one other things impossible to mention  “come on now” suddenly said snipper and then he and leo ran out into the ring and fell down and bounced up as if they were a couple of rubber balls  “ho ho look at those two clowns” shouted the crowd  the tumble over the clowns chased each other around the ring knocked each other down and did a dozen other funny things  while the two clowns were cutting their capers a young lady bareback rider rode into the ring  her name was natalie sparks but she was known on the bills as natalie the fire queen  her great act was to dive through numerous hoops of fire while on horseback  as she began to perform leo commenced to climb the centerpole of the tent doing so in a way that nearly choked the crowd with laughter  “see him twisting like a monkey”  “he ain’t a clown at all see he is throwing off his clown dress”  “now he is dressed in tights”  it was true leo was in full gymnastic costume and was swinging gracefully from the high bar  as leo began to do his best on the bar natalie the fire queen started to leap through rings of fire held up by several ringmen  the performances of the young gymnast and the fire queen were in full swing when a cry of horror arose  in some unaccountable manner the fire from the hoops had communicated to the tarred ropes running up by the centerpole to the roof  the great canvas had taken fire in several places  before leo could realize what had happened a cloud of smoke seemed to envelop him  the fire had reached the ropes supporting the very bar upon which he was performing  his escape in that direction was cut off and the distance to the ring below was fully half a hundred feet     chapter v—a leap of great peril   leo fully understood his great peril  the entire canvas above him was in flames and in a very short while the ropes which supported the bar upon which he had been performing would be burned through  and then leo hardly dared to think of the consequences the sawdust ring below seemed a terrible distance away  a leap to it would mean broken limbs perhaps death  a panic arose among the audience  “he can’t escape”  “he must fall or jump”  a rope and a net were sent for but long before they arrived leo had made a move to save himself  the smoke rolled around him a second time  it was fearfully thick and made him close his mouth and eyes for fear of being either blinded or suffocated  as the smoke swept back in another direction there was a snap above  one of the ropes which held the bar had parted  the end of the bar hung down and below it the end of the burned rope  as quick as a flash leo slid down to the very end of the rope  thus suspended he began to swing himself back and forth  soon he gave an extra swing just as the smoke again came down  like a curving ball he passed through the cloud past the centerpole and on to the rings on the other side of the tent  he caught hold of one of the rings and hung fast  then after a pause in which to catch his breath he let himself down to the ground  a deafening cheer arose  leo had actually saved himself from death for as he touched the sawdust the heavy ash bar high above fell with a crash just missing those who came on with the net  “he’s safe”  the ushers and others now ran around asking the vast audience to leave the tent as quietly as possible  but every one was afraid of the falling of the huge centerpole and all made a great rush for the openings  in this stampede many women and children were knocked down and it was a wonder that some of them were not killed  the fire brigade of the circus went to work as speedily as possible the nearest hydrant of water was some distance away but soon a hose was attached and a stream poured on the burning canvas  in less than half an hour the excitement was over without delay the canvasmen went to work to repair the damage done  a good many people grumbled at not having seen a full performance to these were given tickets of admission to the evening performance  with the others from the ring leo hurried to the dressing tent it was not long before he was joined by barton reeve  “a great leap my boy” said the manager of the menagerie “i never saw anything so neat”  “it was a big undertaking” smiled leo “i don’t think i would care to try it at every performance—at least not yet”  “it would be the hit of your life to have that on the bills” put in natalie sparks   illustration the fire swept dangerously close to leo   “oh that wasn’t so very wonderful” remarked jack snipper the brother clown and gymnast  “it wasn’t eh” cried reeve he could easily see how jealous snipper was of the attention bestowed upon leo “i’ll wager you a round hundred dollars you can’t make the leap with the rings ten feet closer”  “stuff and nonsense” cried snipper but all noticed that he did not take up the offer and moved away a second later  “you want to keep one eye on snipper” was natalie’s caution to leo  “why”  “can’t you see he doesn’t fancy the attention you are getting”  “oh i’m sure i don’t want to cut short his popularity” exclaimed the boy gymnast quickly  “popularity” the fire queen burst into a laugh “you can’t leo”  “why”  “because he never was popular why they used to call him sour snipper”  it was now announced that the afternoon performance would not go on and the different people separated to take off their ring dresses and put on their everyday clothes  leo was rather slow to make the change he began to practice around the tent on several turns which as yet were difficult for him to do gracefully  “you must love to work” growled snipper on seeing him  “i love the exercise” returned leo shortly  “you won’t catch me doing any more of that than i have to”  “i want to become perfect”  “do you mean to say by that that i am not perfect” growled snipper  “we never get really perfect snipper”  “oh pshaw don’t preach to me do you know what i think you are”  “i do not”  “a country greeny with a swelled head”  leo’s face flushed at this a laugh came from behind the canvas where other performers were undressing  “thanks for the compliment snipper i may be a little green but at the same time i’ll tell you what you can’t do”  “what”  “you can’t stunt me i’ll do everything you do and go you one better”  “oh you’re talking through your hat” growled snipper  “am i take me up and see”  “i won’t bother with you you greenhorn”  “because you are a braggart and nothing else” retorted leo stung by the insolent acrobat’s manner  with a cry of rage jack snipper leaped toward the boy picking up a heavy indian club as he did so     chapter vi—leo asserts his rights   at once a crowd of performers surrounded the pair very few of them liked jack snipper and they wondered what leo would do should the gymnast attack the boy  “call me a braggart will you” roared snipper  “don’t you dare to touch me with that club” replied leo calmly  “i’ll teach you a lesson”  and swinging the indian club over his head jack snipper made a savage blow at the young gymnast  had the stick struck leo the boy’s head would have sustained a severe injury  but as quick as a flash leo dodged and the indian club merely circled through the empty air  “for shame snipper”  “do you want to kill the boy”  “what harm has he done”  and so the cries ran on  “mind your own affairs” shouted the maddened gymnast “i’m going to teach the boy a lesson”  again he sprang at leo  but now suddenly the indian club was caught a dexterous twist and it went flying out of reach across the dressing tent  then before snipper could recover he received a stinging slap full in the face that sent him staggering backward on the grass  a shout of approval went up  “good for leo”  “that’s right boy stand up for your rights”  the shout brought adam lambert the general manager to the scene  no sooner had he appeared than all the performers walked away it was against the rules to fight and every one present was liable to a heavy fine  with the crowd went snipper who rolled over and over until a neighboring canvaswall hid him from view  “who is fighting here” demanded lambert severely  “jack snipper attacked me with an indian club and i knocked him down” replied leo  “why did he attack you”  “snipper’s jealous of the lad” came from behind a side canvas  “yes the boy only stood up for his rights” said another voice  “we want no fighting here leo dunbar” said lambert “another such scene and you may be discharged”  and off went the general manager to inspect the mending of the tent  he might have spoken even more severely but he had seen leo’s wonderful leap and realized what fine mettle there was in the lad  snipper remained out of sight nor did he appear again until the evening performance  having finished changing his clothing leo walked outside and mingled with the crowd of town people  he knew but few of them as since he had worked on daniel hawkins’ farm he had been to hopsville but seldom  he wandered around to the museum or side show and while looking at the gigantic pictures displayed was rather taken aback to see daniel hawkins and his wife standing not two yards away  “my gracious” murmured leo to himself and he lost no time in moving back  as will be remembered daniel hawkins had received two tickets for the show from the men who had come after the escaped lion  under pretense of looking for leo the old couple who generally spoke of all shows as works of the evil one attended the afternoon performance  they saw the young gymnast but the paint on his face as a clown so disguised him that neither recognized their bound boy  they were much disappointed to have the fire cut short what proved to be so entertaining to them but the extra tickets for the evening performance soothed their feelings greatly  “we’ll take in this ’ere side show and then git a bite an’ wait fer the next openin’” said daniel “it’s better’n goin’ over to the county fair”  and mrs hawkins agreed with him  as soon as leo saw the old couple an idea entered his head  at the hawkins’ farmhouse he had several things which he wished to get not clothing—he was too poor to own more than what was on his back—but mementos of former days when he had had as nice a home as any lad in the hopsville district  these mementos were secreted in the garret of the old farmhouse in a corner behind the wide chimney where daniel hawkins had never looked for them  “i’ll visit the house while they are here and get those things” leo said to himself and off he started  as we know it was quite a distance leo looked around for some sort of a vehicle which might give him a “lift” but unfortunately none appeared in sight  at last he reached the place to find it tightly locked up below  in a twinkle leo was up on the kitchen shed from there he clambered along the gutter of the addition until he reached the window of a middle room  as he had surmised this window was unlocked and he crawled inside although not without difficulty and danger of breaking his neck by a fall  no sooner had he entered than a most appetizing smell greeted his nose  “huckleberry pie” he cried “by criminy but i must have a piece”  down the stairs went leo the pies set on the kitchen table two in number a third partly gone rested close at hand  at first leo thought just out of mischief to cut a fresh pie but then he reflected that this might cause suspicion and trouble and he let the whole pies alone and satisfied himself on a juicy portion of that which was cut  a glass of milk washed down the pie and then feeling much refreshed the boy hurried upstairs to the garret  the mementos were done up in a flat pasteboard box there were pictures of his mother and father and other relatives and half a dozen letters and other things including a silver watch  daniel hawkins had always wanted the watch but leo had never let on that he possessed it  with the articles in his pockets leo started downstairs once more  he had just reached the second story and was on the point of descending the lower flight of stairs when an unexpected sound greeted his ears  daniel and martha hawkins had returned  “so much cheaper ter git supper ter hum” he heard mrs hawkins say speaking from the kitchen  “it’s a pity though yer aunt mariah wasn’t hum” returned daniel hawkins  leo was startled  “caught” he muttered to himself and then added “not much”  with great caution he left the hallway and entered the side bedroom  as noiselessly as possible he opened the window again  the distance to the ground was at least twelve feet but there was heavy grass below and leo did not mind such a drop  “it’s nothing to that leap i had to take in the circus” he said to himself and crawled out on the windowsill  “hi hi you young rascal what are you doing up there”  leo looked down beneath the window stood old daniel hawkins     chapter vii—leo gains his liberty   daniel hawkins had just come out to care for his horse by sheer accident he had glanced up at the window and beheld leo in the act of dropping out  the young gymnast was as much surprised as was his tormentor but he knew enough to cling fast to the sill and not to drop into daniel hawkins’ clutches  “goin’ ter drop out eh” went on the old farmer  “i rather think not” replied leo and popped into the room again  at once daniel hawkins called his wife  “marthy marthy”  “wot daniel”  “leo’s up in the house atryin’ ter climb out o’ the winder”  “you don’t say”  “run up an’ catch him”  “why don’t you go”  “i want ter watch out here fer him if i go up he’ll drop anyway”  “drat the boy” muttered mrs hawkins and she went for her oldtime weapon the broom  armed with this she ascended the stairs she entered the side bedroom to which her husband had pointed only to find it empty  “he ain’t here” she cried from the window  “he’s somewhere root him out” shouted daniel hawkins  so mrs hawkins ran around from room to room  but she did not find leo for the simple reason that the young gymnast had by running through two rooms reached the stairs and gone down to the front door  he opened this and ran outside just as daniel hawkins appeared around the corner of the porch whip in hand  “stop leo”  “not today” retorted the boy  and away he went daniel hawkins lumbering after him  the farmer was no match for the young gymnast soon leo was out of his sight and he returned to the farmhouse to talk the matter over with his spouse  “i’ll fix him yet see ef i don’t” he said to martha  soon his bony nag was hitched up to a buckboard and away went the farmer in pursuit of the lad who was doing his best to get away  “i’ll teach him a lesson he won’t forget in a hurry when i collar him” thought the miserly man savagely  on went the boy until nearly half the distance to lendham the next town was covered wishing to throw the farmer off the scent leo did not head for the circus grounds  as it was a hot day he was soon pretty well winded and he dropped into a walk  on looking back he was chagrined to see the buckboard approaching  “he means to catch me after all” he thought  the young gymnast hardly knew what to do  it was useless to think of going on for his pursuer would sooner or later overtake him  on both sides of the road were open fields offering no place where he might conceal himself  suddenly an idea struck him  he was approaching the inclosed grounds of the county agricultural society  the county fair was in progress and thousands of people were in and about the inclosure  could he not lose himself in the crowd  he resolved to make the attempt  but he had not the price of admission even though it was but twentyfive cents  yet this did not stop the youth  “necessity knows no law” and just as daniel hawkins drove up within a hundred feet of him he ran in among the carriages at the gateway and entered the grounds before the gatekeeper could stop him  “hi boy stop where is your ticket”  the policeman near the gatekeeper made a dash after leo  but the boy was not to be collared  he sprang into the midst of a crowd and that ended the chase so far as the guardian of the law went  leo did not remain near the gates but following the crowd he walked to one of the main buildings and then to the large field beyond  here was a small racecourse and local horsemen were running races for small purses and side bets  at once something in the center of the racetrack attracted leo’s attention  it was a very large balloon swaying gracefully to and fro in the light breeze that was blowing  the boy was interested on the instant as he had not seen a balloon since he was a small boy  “father once went up in one of those things” he mused as he moved forward “i would like to try it once myself”  around the balloon were half a dozen men preparing for the ascension to take place half an hour later  professor williams the aeronaut had not yet put in appearance  the balloon was about filled with hot air and the men were merely keeping the air warm until the professor should arrive  as leo stood by watching the arrangements an outsider came up  “too bad” he said  “what’s too bad”  “the professor can’t get here today”  “why not”  “he has been taken sick and is at the hotel in new haven”  “that will be a big disappointment to this crowd”  “i admit it but it can’t be helped”  the boy listened to the conversation with interest  he pushed his way to where the man in charge of the balloon stood  “i’ll go up in the balloon for you if you’ll pay me” he said  “you” the man looked at him in astonishment  “yes”  “it won’t do my lad the crowd want somebody who will make a parachute jump and all that”  “i’ll make the parachute jump if you’ll give me a few instructions”  the man laughed  “you’re a daring youngster to say the least” he remarked “why you might break your neck”  “no i wouldn’t” returned leo confidently  “well i’m much obliged but i can’t use your services”  “let me get in the basket and see how it feels will you” asked the boy after a pause  “well seeing as you are so anxious i’ll oblige you” laughed the man  the basket rested on the ground directly to one side of the fire with which the air in the swaying monster was kept hot  hardly had the man given permission than leo entered the wicker inclosure  it was about six feet in diameter and filled with bags of sand for ballast  to one side of the basket was attached a parachute this the balloonist used in making his daring jumps from the clouds  as leo sat in the basket the crowd gathered around him  “hullo leo dunbar what are you doing in that basket” asked ben barkley one of the rich boys of hopsville  “going to make an ascension” returned leo jokingly  “bet you ten dollars you are not” laughed ben  “all right i’ll take you up but you must loan me the money ben”  “how is it old hawkins gave you a day off” went on ben “thought he was too mean to give anybody a holiday”  “so he is ben i took a day off and i’m going to take more”  “phew what do you mean have you and the old man parted company”  “we have”  “it is a wonder he would let you go—he got so much work out of you”  “he didn’t let me go i ran away”  ben barkley’s eyes opened widely  “you don’t mean it”  “i do i’m tired of being his slave”  “i don’t blame you a bit for leaving” was ben’s decided reply “i know what a hardhearted man he is”  “i’m going to carve my own way to fortune”  “what are you going to do”  leo was about to answer when ben was pushed to one side and the portly form of daniel hawkins appeared  “ha ha so i have found you at last you scamp” he cried in a rage “a pretty run you have given me and made me pay out twentyfive cents too to come in the fair after you”  leo was taken completely aback he had not dreamed that the farmer would follow him into the grounds  “i’ll skin you” stormed the man seeing the boy did not immediately answer him  “not much you won’t” put in ben barkley  “what have you to do with this” howled daniel turning to the rich boy  “you have no right to abuse leo” responded ben  “this is none of your business”  “hold him a minute ben” suddenly shouted leo “hold him”  as the boy spoke he drew from his pocket a claspknife  quickly he opened the largest blade  slash slash slash  he was cutting the ropes which held the balloon  “here what are you doing” screamed the man in charge  “i’m going to escape a tyrant” responded leo as he cut the last rope  for an instant the balloon continued to sway from side to side  daniel hawkins fought off ben barkley and leaped forward  too late  up shot the balloon dragging the basket after it  in less time than it takes to tell it leo dunbar was five hundred feet up in the air     chapter viii—among the clouds in a thunderstorm   a cry arose  “the balloon has gone up”  “why the balloonist is nothing but a boy”  “my but ain’t it going up fast”  daniel hawkins could do nothing but stare after the balloon  “foolish boy he will be killed” he gasped  ben barkley was also amazed  “he said he would go up” he murmured “but i never supposed that he meant it”  the crowd continued to shout they wondered what it all meant and some asked the men who had had the balloon in charge but those individuals had no time to explain  they sprang into a wagon and prepared to follow the direction of the balloon supposing it would come down as soon as the hot air began to cool off  meanwhile what of leo  so sudden was the upward rush of the balloon that the boy was thrown to the bottom of the basket ere he was aware  he clutched the sides and then ventured to look down the earth seemed to be fading away beneath him  for a few minutes he was deadly sick at the stomach and there was a strange ringing in his ears  the balloon was moving in the direction of hopsville soon it passed over the town  leo could see the few streets and the brook laid out like a map beneath him  he was growing accustomed to his novel situation  on and on went the balloon  the wind appeared to blow stronger the higher he went  then he looked ahead and saw he was rushing rapidly toward a dense mass of clouds to the southeast  the boy had noticed the clouds while running toward lendham  they betokened a thunderstorm and already the mutterings of thunder came to his ears  “a storm would be more than i bargained for” he thought “i wonder if i can’t get away from it”  leo had heard tell of going up above a storm when the latter hung low  he did not know if he could make a hotair balloon go up but he resolved to try  with great rapidity he threw out one sandbag after another  lightened of a great part of its load the balloon shot up a hundred feet or more  then the boy noticed a large sponge tied to the side of the basket and beside a can labeled alcohol  at once he saturated the sponge and placed it on the stick for that purpose  when the sponge was lit he held it up to the mouth of the balloon  the cooling air began to grow hot again and once more the balloon went up slowly but steadily  but now the wind made the basket rock violently from side to side  soon leo had to extinguish the sponge and put it away  a gust sent the basket almost over to one side and he had to let everything go in order to cling fast  sizz a jagged streak of lightning crossed directly in front of the balloon  he was now in the very midst of the storm and all grew black around him  the change from the bright sunshine was terrible to the boy and he almost gave himself up for lost  back and forth rocked the balloon and the basket and many were the times that he was in danger of being hurled to death  then the balloon began to descend  the clouds were left behind and there followed a deluge of rain which drenched leo to the skin  he fell so rapidly that a new danger presented itself  where or how would he land  would he break his neck or a limb  down down he went there were trees or bushes under him he could not tell which  crash the basket settled in the top of a tree  down came the folds of the balloon on top of it and the boy was nearly smothered  yet he was exceedingly thankful that his life had been spared  he crawled from the basket and carefully made his way down the tree to the ground  the storm still raged but gradually it moved onward and the sun broke from beneath the scattering clouds  leo had traveled at least eight or ten miles and he wondered what he should do next  he had half a mind to run off and leave the balloon men to find their property as best they might  but he soon changed his mind on that point  “i’ll aid them all i can” he said to himself  the boy knew there was a road through the woods which ran almost directly to the fair grounds  he made his way to this and walked on through the mud and wet  it was not long before he came up to the men in the wagon  at first they were inclined to be abusive and they thought to have the boy locked up  but leo soon changed all this  “your balloon is all right” he said “and by going up i reckon i saved you the amount you were to get from the fair people you wouldn’t get a cent if somebody hadn’t gone up”  this was a new way of looking at it  “well we won’t get paid for a parachute jump” said the balloon manager “but we can claim half money true enough”  the boy showed the men where the balloon was and helped them load it on their wagon  the men took to leo and as he helped them at the hardest work they readily answered his questions about the circus and gave him full directions by which he could take a short cut to the grounds  “that was a narrow escape” murmured leo to himself as he made his way back to the “greatest show on earth”  arriving there he had another long talk with barton reeve who as before stated had taken a sudden and strong fancy to the brave lad  the upshot of the matter was that reeve bought leo a trunk and advanced him money for several changes of clothing  the next day at lendham the circus tents were jammed with people  everything was again in order and all the acts went off with a dash that drew round after round of applause  snipper was as sour as ever but he took good care not to interfere with leo  as for the boy he appeared perfectly at home so much so that many said he was a born circus performer  as a clown he caused the people to laugh heartily and when he threw off his trunks and performed on the bars and rings he got more than a share of the applause  as soon as the performance was over the circus packed up and at halfpast eleven began to move from lendham to middletown seven miles distant  leo spent the night at the middletown hotel with barton reeve the boy was now a protégé of the menagerie manager  before going to bed leo told reeve much about his former life and showed the manager the pictures of his folks  reeve became interested  “i’ll tell you what i’ll do leo” he said “i’ll go to this squire dobb and get him to release you in a lawful way then you will have nothing to fear from daniel hawkins”  “but supposing hawkins won’t let the squire release me”  “i don’t believe he has any claim on you that would hold good in a court of law i’ll make the squire show his authority over you first”  “i wish you could get squire dobb to make a settlement of my parents’ estate” went on leo earnestly  “you think he is holding money from you”  “i know he is”  “well i’ll investigate”  bright and early the next day the young lad and barton reeve drove over to the home of nathan dobb  they found the squire busy in his office looking over some legal papers  without preliminaries barton reeve introduced himself the squire listened in silence at the same time scowling at leo  “want to quit the farm and become a circus performer eh” said dobb at last “can’t let you do it you’ll have to go back to daniel hawkins’ farm”  “i never will” returned leo warmly “i’ll run away entirely first”  “we’ll see” sniffed squire dobb  barton reeve had sized up the lawyer at a glance he saw that the man was a crafty villain not to be trusted  “squire would you mind showing me your authority over this boy” he remarked firmly  “whwhat” was the surprised exclamation  “i would like to learn your legal authority over leo”  “it’s none of your business”  “i shall make it my business”  “going to pry into matters eh”  “yes unless you consent to release leo he has been misused on the hawkins’ place”  the face of nathan dobb was a study if there was one thing he feared it was the exposure of the past why he feared this will be explained later  “i’ll have to see hawkins first” he said at last  “when will you see him”  “today but what is leo to do”  “he is going to travel with me and perform in the circus”  “he can’t do anything”  “never mind i’ll teach him a thing or two” replied barton reeve  he was afraid if he told squire dobb what leo could really do that the miserly lawyer would want money for the release  after a little more talk leo and reeve left the squire’s house  on the next day reeve got a short note from dobb it read  “i have given up all claim to leo dunbar and so has daniel hawkins”  leo was much pleased barton reeve smiled to himself  “there is something in all this leo” he said “next week when i get time i’ll look into your past and squire dobb’s doings”     chapter ix—the mad elephant   from middletown the circus went to dover and then to grasscannon  at each of these places a big business was done and at every performance leo did better  the young gymnast became a great favorite with all but two people in the “greatest show on earth”  these two people were jack snipper who remained as overbearing as ever and jack broxton the fellow discharged for intoxication  broxton had been following up the circus ever since his discharge in the vain hope of being reinstated  but the rules in the “greatest show on earth” are very strict and no intoxication is allowed  after leaving grasscannon the circus struck up through new york state and at the end of the week arrived at buffalo  it was while at this place that broxton tried to play a dangerous trick upon leo  he met the young gymnast on the street one night after the performance  he was under the influence of liquor at the time and in his pocket he carried what is known by the boys as a giant torpedo  as leo turned a corner he threw the torpedo at leo’s feet  luckily the torpedo failed to explode  had it gone off the young gymnast would have been sadly crippled  “you rascal” cried leo and he made for broxton and landed him in the gutter  some of the other performers then came up  “what’s the row leo”  “look what broxton threw at me” he replied and handed the torpedo around for inspection  while the explosive was being examined broxton sneaked off and it was well for him that he did so for otherwise the crowd would have pounced upon him and given him the greatest warming up of his life  but that ended broxton’s hope of rejoining the circus the story of his attempt on leo circulated and he did not dare to show his face anywhere around the dressing tents  after leaving buffalo the circus turned southward toward pennsylvania  one night they arrived at harmony falls  “tomorrow if all goes right i am going to take a train for hopsville and see squire dobb” said barton reeve to leo  “i hope you have luck” replied the boy “if he is keeping any of my property back from me i want to know it”  the day in harmony falls opened very warm a haze hung over the mountains to the westward  “we’ll have a storm by night” said natalie sparks to leo  the two were now warm friends  “that will make it bad for the ticketwagon” laughed the young gymnast  “oh i hate a storm during a performance” went on the girl “especially if it thunders and lightens”  “well that’s what it’s going to do”  “how do you know”  “oh didn’t i live on a farm”  “that’s so” natalie laughed merrily “you don’t look much like a farm hand now”  “thanks for the compliment” and leo blushed  during the afternoon it grew hotter and hotter under the big tents it was suffocating  “dandy weather for lemonade” said the owner of the main drinking stand but he was about the only person who appreciated the sudden rise in the thermometer  at seven o’clock the circus tents were again crowded and amid the general excitement but few noticed the flashes of lightning over in the west the low rumblings of thunder they attributed to the lions in the cages  at last the grand entrée was over and then the performance settled down to the various specialties  then as leo and snipper came on a louder peal of thunder attracted every one’s attention  to quiet fears the band struck up of course leo and snipper could not talk against the music and so they tumbled around instead leo casting himself into the most awkward of shapes  the rain began to fall but as the canvases were waterproof this did no great harm  then the wind freshened up and every one realized that a big storm was at hand  leo had just thrown off his clown’s dress and mounted up to a pair of rings when a fearful crack of thunder caused every one to leap up in terror  the lightning had struck a pole in the menagerie tent  down came the heavy stick straight across the backs of three of the largest elephants   illustration the elephant made for the crowd   the thunder and the fall of the pole frightened the huge beasts they roared and plunged and finally broke from their fastenings  two of them were secured without much difficulty but the third the largest could not be managed  with a fearful roar he rushed into the main circus tent under the spot where leo was performing and directly in the faces of the crowd which tried in vain to flee from his path     chapter x—capturing the elephant   for the moment it looked as if the mad elephant would crush a dozen or more of the audience  he was making straight for the crowd which tried in vain to clear a path for him to pass  the uproar was terrible but it was nothing compared to the trumpeting of the gigantic beast  several attendants rushed toward the elephant with prods but he was too angry to notice them  “turn him back”  “he’ll walk right over the crowd”  “lasso him”  “shoot him”  and so the cries went on  the uproar had caused leo to stop his performance indeed it had stopped everything but the stampede of the audience  suddenly the elephant ran directly under the young gymnast  as he did so there came another crash of thunder  the elephant raised up on his rear legs and his trunk went up to where leo swung  and then a startling thing happened  leo dropped directly upon the beast’s head with remarkable rapidity he slid back on to the neck  “throw me a rope” he yelled to the nearest attendant and the fellow did so  then the end of the elephant’s trunk came up angrily he intended to catch hold of the young gymnast and hurl him to the earth there to trample on him  but leo slipped further back and at the same time threw the noose of the rope over the uplifted proboscis  he hauled it taut and with the end of the rope in his hand sprang down and ran at lightning speed to the nearest centerpole  around this he went half a dozen times  “now keep him back with your prods” he sang out  more enraged than ever the elephant tried to pull himself free  but the rope held and he was forced on his knees roaring with pain for an elephant’s trunk is his most sensitive organ  a shout of approval went up and the crowd paused in its hasty flight  but the elephant was not yet a prisoner he pulled and tugged and had the centerpole not been so strong and so deeply set in the ground he would surely have either broken it off or pulled it up  but now he hesitated and in that moment more attendants came up one began to soothe him while the others slipped a leather and iron harness over him soon he was a complete prisoner and realizing this he shambled back to the menagerie tent as mildly as a lamb  the rain was now coming down in a perfect deluge and the audience would not remain in less than a quarter of an hour the circus grounds were deserted saving for those who had to remain on duty and the performers in the dressingtents  every one praised leo for what he had done every one that is but snipper he had not a word to say but looked more morose than ever  leo did not wait however to hear all that the others had to say he donned his regular clothing just as quickly as he could and with natalie sparks rode from the grounds to the hotel at which they were stopping  barton reeve was nowhere around he had gone off to hopsville to see nathan dobb  he came in about halfpast ten and then leo and he had a long discussion concerning the boy’s past and future  “the squire is a sly one” said the menagerie manager “it was about as easy to get information out of him as it is to get milk out of a stone”  “then you learned nothing” returned leo much disappointed  “i did and i didn’t he admitted that your folks were once wealthy but he said the money was lost in speculations before you were left an orphan”  “i don’t believe that”  “nor i i asked him for some proofs but he would give me none then i asked him flatly how much there was coming to you when your folks died and he said not more than a couple of hundred dollars i wanted to see the papers but he wouldn’t show them”  “didn’t you tell him we would take the matter to court”  “i did and it worried him a good bit that is what makes me think there is considerable at stake if he had nothing to hide what is he so scared about”  “just wait till i have money enough i’ll stir him up” cried leo  he had not yet forgotten how nathan dobb and daniel hawkins had mistreated him  “we’ll both stir him up leo but i guess before we go much further we had better get a lawyer’s advice in a few weeks the circus will make two threeday stops and that will give us a little time certainly more than we get when we go to a new town every day”  they talked the matter over for some time longer and when leo went to bed it was with the fixed determination to make squire dobb “toe the mark”  and while the young gymnast was meditating thus nathan dobb was walking up and down his office his face dark and full of cunning  “the boy’s getting too big and he’s making too many friends” he muttered to himself “why couldn’t he remain a simple farm hand without trying to rake up the past and make a place for himself” he took a turn or two and clenched his bony hands “i wish i had stuck to my original idea and sent him to africa on that freight steamer without a cent in his pocket”  then nathan dobb dropped into the chair beside his safe and from the strong box took a package of documents these he looked over for nearly half an hour  “ten thousand dollars” he muttered “it would be a fortune to him but he shan’t have it i’ve worked too hard for it to have it slip through my fingers at this late day i had better burn all these papers and then concoct some scheme for getting him out of the way”  nathan dobb’s soliloquy was interrupted by a crash in the rear of the house some one had broken into the kitchen most likely a burglar     chapter xi—a criminal compact   there had been several robberies in hopsville lately so the squire was certain the burglar had now come to his house  instantly he turned out the light in the office then opening the door to the hall he listened attentively  he was right some one was moving cautiously about the kitchen  moving back to his desk the squire secured his pistol and also a club  when he came out into the hall on tiptoe he heard the wouldbe burglar moving around the diningroom  presently the fellow struck a light which he set on the table  then he began an examination of the silverware on the sideboard  by the light the squire got a good look at the wouldbe burglar he was astonished beyond measure  “hank griswold” he muttered halfaloud  the man whose name he mentioned had formerly been a tavernkeeper in hopsville  but he had been sent to jail for robbing and beating a drunken man his discharge had taken place but two weeks before  as squire dobb spoke the wouldbe burglar turned swiftly  “collared” he muttered laconically  then he tried to escape by a rear door but nathan dobb covered him with the pistol  “stop griswold”  “confound the luck the game is up”  “it is stop where you are”  “don’t be hard on me squire”  “so you were going to rob me eh”  “let me go this time squire” went on the man pleadingly  “what for so you can rob somebody else”  “i ain’t got a cent to my name squire”  “i can’t help that”  suddenly a thought flashed over squire dobb’s mind  “griswold step into my office”  “don’t lock me up squire”  “i won’t—if you will do as i wish you to”  “i’ll do anything you say only don’t arrest me again”  “step into the office and see to it that you don’t wake up the whole household”  hank griswold complied the squire followed him still however keeping his pistol ready for use  but when the office was reached and the door shut nathan dobb’s manner changed he took griswold’s hand  “griswold you are just the man i want to see”  “i—i—don’t understand” was the confused reply  “i’ll explain sit down and take it easy you love to smoke have a cigar” and a box was shoved toward him  “see here nathan dobb what’s your game now”  “i want to throw some work in your hands work that will pay well”  “what kind of work” asked griswold suspiciously he was halfinclined to believe nathan dobb was out of his mind  “you just said you would do anything for me if i didn’t have you arrested”  “so i will” “supposing i put a job in your way that will pay you an even hundred dollars——”  “you’re foolin’ me squire”  “i mean it griswold a hundred dollars would you do the work and say nothing”  “yes”  “it’s a—a—job that isn’t strictly—ah—all right you know”  “i don’t care what it is” returned griswold recklessly “i’ll do anything you say you can trust me”  “will you” cried nathan dobb eagerly he hesitated “i want to get a boy out of my way”  “who”  “leo dunbar who used to live with dan hawkins”  “i know him didn’t his father once have my tavern shut up as a disorderly house”  “well as i said i want to get that boy out of my way”  “where is he now”  “he is traveling as an acrobat with that circus which performed here a week or so ago”  “and you want me to—to—” griswold hesitated  “i want him removed from my path i never want to see him around here again” “and you’ll give me a hundred for the job”  “i will”  “it’s not enough make it two hundred”  “well i will”  “in cash”  “yes”  “when can i get the money”  “you can get it right here as soon as—well i’m sure dunbar won’t bother me any more”  “you’re a cool one dobb but i said i’d go you and i will but say”  “well”  “you must let me have fifty dollars on account i’ll have to hang around the circus for awhile and lay my plans it’s no fool of a job to do as you wish”  “here are thirty dollars and one word more hank never mention my name in this and if i were you don’t ever let leo dunbar see you”  “i’ll remember” replied griswold  ten minutes later he left nathan dobb’s house as secretly as he had entered it     chapter xii—the stolen circus tickets   on the following week the circus moved down through pennsylvania fine weather favored the show and the crowd at each performance was very large  “this is going to be a banner season” said giles the treasurer “unless we get tripped up as we were last season”  he referred to a serious matter namely that of thousands of stolen tickets which during the previous summer had been secured and sold by outside speculators  this season a few tickets had thus far been missing but the number was not sufficient to cause a serious loss  leo’s performances in the ring improved every day already was he as good as jack snipper and soon he would outrival the other acrobat in every way  leo’s acts while disguised as a clown were highly amusing even better than some of the regular clowns of which there were eight  “he could do clown and get big wages even if he didn’t know a thing about gymnastics” remarked natalie sparks  natalie was now a warm friend to leo much to snipper’s disgust  the secondrate gymnast had always been enamored of the fire queen but he could make no progress in his suit  one day he met natalie in the dressingtent when no one else was present  he began to talk familiarly to her and then attempted to kiss her  “don’t you dare” she cried angrily  “i guess you won’t mind very much” said snipper and then despite her struggles he bent over and stuck his repulsive face close to her fair cheek  but just then leo came on the scene for a moment he stood in amazement  “leo make the horrid fellow go away” panted natalie  “do as miss sparks wishes snipper” cried the young gymnast  “mind your own business” grumbled snipper  “this is my business” returned leo warmly  and rushing up he collared the secondrate gymnast and hurled him halfway across the tent  snipper was clearly in the wrong and as natalie had called on leo for assistance he did not dare raise a row  he sneaked out shaking his fist at leo as he did so  “oh leo i am very thankful you came in” panted natalie as soon as she could recover  “so am i” went on the boy honestly and then as he looked at the beautiful girl both blushed  following the scene just recorded jack snipper was more ugly than ever whenever he met or passed leo he would mutter something under his breath  “look out for him leo” said dick pomeroy the tumbler one day “he’s cutting a club for you”  “i’ve got my optics peeled” laughed leo  that afternoon after the performance leo was walking around outside near the sideshow  presently he saw something that at once interested him  a “flimflam worker” as such criminals around a circus are called was trying to swindle a countryman out of twenty dollars  he was working an old game which consists in getting an outsider to hold the stakes in a bet with another flimflammer  the game is to mix the stakeholder up and make him put up his own money and then secure all the cash in sight  leo was interested for two reasons  in the first place he did not wish to see the countryman swindled  in the second place he knew that swindlers of any kind were not allowed to work in the vicinity of the “greatest show on earth”  the flimflam man was about to receive the countryman’s money when leo stepped up  “drop this” he said quietly  “wot yer givin’ us sonny” came in a hoarse growl from the swindler  “i say drop the game” leo turned to the countryman “put away your money or you will be swindled out of it”  “by gum is thet so” ejaculated the farmer and he at once thrust the cash out of sight  at this the wouldbe swindler turned on leo  “i’ll thrash you for that” he howled and rushed at the young gymnast while the two partners in the deal did the same  leo knew it would be foolish to attempt to stand up against all three so he gave a peculiar whistle known to all circus hands  a cry of “hi rube” arose and soon several circus detectives reached the spot but the swindlers vanished before they could be captured  the countryman whose name was adam slocum was much pleased over what leo had done and insisted on shaking hands he invited leo to call on him when the circus came to the next town  “thank you i’ll call” said leo  snipper had witnessed the scene between the swindlers and leo when the three men went off he followed them  all four met at a low resort half a dozen blocks from the circus grounds  snipper knew the men as a matter of fact he would have left the circus and joined them in their work but he had his reasons for remaining as an employee of the “greatest show on earth” as will be seen later  the four men had a conference which lasted over an hour  then snipper and one of them called on a local locksmith  the swindler told a long story of having lost the keys to his trunk and he ordered the locksmith to make him three keys from impressions furnished by snipper  with these keys in his possession snipper went back to the circus grounds  on the following day toward evening there was a commotion at the entrance to the main tent of the circus one of the managers of the great aggregation had discovered that hundreds of circus tickets had been sold throughout the district at a discount from the regular price fifty cents  a hurried examination was made and then it was learned that two thousand tickets had been stolen from one of the boxoffice wagons  these tickets were now either sold to individuals or in the hands of the outside speculators  who could have stolen the tickets was a mystery until a slip of paper was handed to giles the treasurer which read      “leo dunbar was hanging around the ticket wagon last night     better watch and search him                                                            “a friend”   giles lost no time in acting upon the suggestion given in the note he ran to the dressingtent and finding a key to fit leo’s trunk opened it  a first examination of the contents revealed nothing but then the treasurer brought to light three heavy strips of red paper each marked 100—50s  they were the strips used around bundles of tickets  this was sufficient proof against leo for giles he told several of the others including mr lambert the general manager and then waited for the boy to come in from his performance in the ring  amid a generous round of applause the young gymnast finished his turn and bowed himself out  on his appearance in the dressingtent giles at once placed his hand on our hero’s shoulder  “consider yourself under arrest leo dunbar” he said sternly  leo was much startled  “what for”  “for stealing two thousand circus tickets”     chapter xiii—leo makes a change   leo stared at the circus treasurer in amazement  “for stealing two thousand circus tickets” he repeated  “exactly young man”  “i am innocent”  “i don’t believe leo would steal a pin” put in natalie sparks who had just come up  “that’s not for you to decide miss sparks” said giles sharply “we found evidence against you in your trunk young man you may as well confess”  “what evidence” asked leo bewildered  the circus treasurer mentioned the red strips  “i never placed them there” declared leo “somebody has been tampering with that trunk”  “that’s too thin” sneered giles  “of course it’s too thin” put in snipper who was watching the scene with an illconcealed smile of triumph on his face  leo looked at the gymnast sharply then he suddenly bounded toward snipper and ran him up against a pile of boxes  “you scoundrel this is some of your work i can see it in your face”  he choked snipper until the man was red in the face  “let—let me go” gasped the secondrate gymnast finally  “let him go dunbar” ordered giles and caught leo by the collar  the noise of the trouble had spread and now barton reeve appeared on the scene  “what’s the meaning of all this” he demanded  he was quickly told by natalie sparks  “i do not believe leo is guilty in spite of the red strips found in the trunk” he said  he talked the matter over with giles and finally leo giles and barton reeve went off to interview the manager  they found adam lambert in the main ticket wagon counting tickets and cash he was much disturbed  “i don’t know much about you dunbar” he said coldly “the thing looks very black and——”  “mr lambert i am innocent” cried leo “i believe this is only a plot against me”  “a plot whose plot”  “this man snipper——”  “you and snipper seem to be fighting continually” broke in the manager  “it is not my fault he——”  “he always got along well enough before you came dunbar i won’t have this continual quarreling around the show it sets a bad example for the others” the manager pulled at his mustache for a few seconds “can you prove you are innocent of the theft of the tickets”  “perhaps i can”  “aren’t you sure you can”  “no sir i hope to be able to do so later on though”  “well then until that time arrives you can consider yourself suspended from duty i am going to get to the bottom of this affair”  “i am discharged” gasped leo  “mr lambert aren’t you a bit hard on the lad” put in barton reeve  “i don’t think so most men would have him arrested but i’ll let him go and that will give him a chance to clear himself—if he can”  there was a sneer in the last words which cut leo to the quick he drew a long breath  “very well sir i’ll go” he said in a strained voice “but sir let me tell you that you are doing me a great injustice”  unable to control his feelings any longer leo left the ticket wagon and hurried to the dressing tent  here his friends surrounded him and tried to pour words of sympathy into his ears but he would not listen sick at heart yet burning with indignation he packed his trunk and prepared to leave  “where are you going” asked natalie sparks with something like a tear in her eye  “i don’t know natalie—i’m too upset to think” responded leo and that was all he could say  just before he left barton reeve brought him the wages due him which leo thrust into his pocket without counting  “lambert has got ’em on today” he said “in a day or two when he cools down he’ll be sorry he let you go”  “it was a mean way to act” answered the boy bitterly and then he walked away from the circus grounds a few blocks off he met a man with an empty wagon and hired him to go and fetch his trunk when the man came back he asked if there was any hotel or boardinghouse on the other side of town conscious in a way that he must put up somewhere  “yes there’s the eagle hotel” said the man “a good place and very reasonable”  “all right take me there”  this was done and then leo sent the man to the other hotel at which the higher class of circus performers were stopping for the valise which contained his ordinary clothing  he was still so upset in mind that he knew not what to do having engaged his room he entered it and locked the door and gave himself up to his reflections  what should he do ah that was the question he had said that perhaps he could clear himself how should he go to work to do it  for fully an hour leo pondered over the situation then he walked downstairs left the hotel and sauntered back to the circus grounds  he kept his eyes and ears open in a vain endeavor to learn something to his advantage the ticket thieves had taken warning and not the slightest clew to them could be unearthed  leo passed a sleepless night at the hotel before he arose the “greatest show on earth” had left the town  “i’m out of it now” he sighed “out of it too with a stain upon my name” he bit his quivering lip until the blood came “i can’t keep on following the circus around trying to clear myself for i haven’t money enough”  yet leo was not willing to give up and that afternoon he took the stage to the next town where the “greatest show on earth” was stopping once more he hung around and again nothing came of it sick at heart he returned to the eagle hotel wondering what he should do next  at the hotel he found a man awaiting him—a sharp shrewd individual who introduced himself as nathan wampole  “this is leo dunbar”  “that is my name” replied the young gymnast  “i am the proprietor of ‘wampole’s transcontinental specialty company’ which opens in this place tonight i was over to cokeville this afternoon where i met a friend of mine jack giles who belongs to the circus he told me that you were out of a position and as i need an extra performer or two i thought i would call around and see you”  “did mr giles send you to me” queried leo  “well not exactly but he said that probably you would be glad to obtain a position on the stage he said you were a very fair gymnast and tumbler”  “they used to think so at the circus”  “i’ve no doubt you could do a very good turn or two” nathan wampole coughed slightly and lowered his voice “i heard of your trouble on account of some circus tickets but of course that makes no difference to me” and he looked at leo suggestively  “i had trouble but i’m not guilty of any crime” replied the boy quickly  “of course not of course not i merely thought to mention it what do you say would you like to join my company we have a splendid route laid out and consequently we are sure of a very successful season”  “what would you pay me mr wampole if i joined you” asked leo cautiously he did not like the man’s looks but still thought it would be foolish to throw a chance of work aside  “i might pay you ten dollars per week”  “that would be a very small amount for a performer like myself”  “well if you can do two good turns at each performance i’ll give you fifteen dollars come what do you say”  “i’ll take a look at the show first” replied leo  in a few minutes more the pair were on the way to the theater in which “wampole’s transcontinental specialty company” was to perform that evening     chapter xiv—leo makes a new friend   leo found that the specialty company numbered fifteen people the performers were for the most part of very ordinary ability there were several song and dance men a number of musicians who drew tunes out of a variety of articles several lady vocalists a comical fat man and a magician  the magician was a young fellow hardly older than leo his name was carl ross and he had such a smiling face and gentlemanly manner that leo took to him instantly  “we want a good allaround gymnast and tumbler” said carl ross “as it is the show is lopsided—too much singing and dancing”  leo was asked to give an exhibition of what he could do and readily complied performing at first on the floor of the stage and then on a bar let down from the flies  “very good” said nathan wampole highly pleased and carl ross also smiled his approval  at the conclusion of the show that evening leo decided to join the company and from that moment on he and carl ross became warm friends  from cokeville the company proceeded to lumbertown and then to wimblerun for the time being leo lost track of the circus and devoted himself entirely to his new position his acts on the stage were well received yet carl ross remained as heretofore the star of the combination  “i wish i could do tricks” said leo as he watched the young magician at practice “but i don’t believe i could learn”  “you could learn as easily as i could learn to act on the trapeze” laughed carl “if i tried that i would get dizzy and fall sure”  “every one to his own line” concluded leo “i can go up any distance into the air and not be afraid”  “up in a balloon”  “yes even up in a balloon” and leo told of his adventures along that line  for several weeks matters ran smoothly but then they took a turn leo found out that nathan wampole loved dearly to play cards and every dollar the manager could raise was staked and lost at the gamingtable for two weeks he could not get a cent of salary  “i don’t like this” he said to carl ross when the pair talked the matter over  “i don’t like it myself leo but what can we do about it”  “that is what i would like to know i am halfinclined to go on a strike”  “i doubt if he has any money business was poor last week on account of the rain i imagine we are lucky to get our traveling expenses and board bills paid”  “you don’t know if the board bills really are paid” was the suggestive response “i haven’t seen wampole pay mrs gerston a cent”  “well if he doesn’t pay we’ll have trouble that’s a foregone conclusion” said carl “he ought—here he comes now and two strange men with him”  carl broke off short as nathan wampole entered the dressingroom of the little country theater at which the company had been performing for the past two nights  “i’ve got to have my money and that’s all there is to it” one of the men was saying “you agreed to pay for the theater after the first performance and you haven’t paid a cent”  “i will pay tomorrow” replied the owner of the organization uneasily he was naturally a closefisted man and bad business had made him more miserly than ever  “that don’t go you pay this afternoon or this theater will be dark tonight”  a long war of words followed and it soon transpired that the second stranger was a constable brought to enter an attachment on the scenery and other things should nathan wampole fail to come to terms  “i’ll tell you what i’ll do” said the proprietor finally “i’ll pay you twenty dollars on account and the other fifty as soon as the money is taken in at the boxoffice tonight”  he held out the twenty dollars temptingly as he spoke and the landlord took it with but little hesitation  “come on yentley” he said to the constable “remember i’ll be on hand for the balance” he called to nathan wampole and departed  nathan wampole growled something under his breath and was about to pass on to the empty stage when carl and leo stopped him  “well what do you fellows want” he demanded angrily “be quick for lanning is sick and i’ve got to get up an act to fill in his time”  “we want to know about our pay mr wampole” said carl  “your pay as if i didn’t have enough to worry me with all this bad weather”  “but we must have some money” pleaded leo “i’ve been promising to buy myself a new suit and——”  “i can’t help it i can’t give you any now” snapped nathan wampole  “then i can’t go on any more”  “neither can i” added carl quietly  “what do you mean to say you’ll leave me in the lurch” howled nathan wampole  “we want our money that’s all”  “you shall have it” nathan wampole paused for a minute “i’ll pay you both twentyfive dollars on account tomorrow morning”  “if you’ll do that i’ll be satisfied” said leo  “so will i” added carl boss  “good” said nathan wampole but as he turned away a cunning smile crossed his wrinkled features  it needed but an hour to the time for the performance for the evening to begin and soon after carl and leo separated to fit themselves out for their separate “turns” as specialty performers call their performances  carl ross was an orphan having lost both of his parents six years before in a terrible railroad disaster in the west  carl’s father had in his time been a juggler and magician and it was but natural that the son should take up the same calling  when left an orphan carl had been placed under the care of a wellknown conjuror who had taught the youth many of the finest stage tricks ever performed a number of these wonderful tricks will be mentioned and explained as our story progresses  after the conjuror had had carl under his care for four years the man had been called to germany he had left the youth with nathan wampole who had agreed to give him a good position in his traveling company  it did not take carl and leo long to shed their street costume and don their stage dress this done they began to practice several new “turns” for the stage  outside of the small theater a “barker” was collecting quite a goodsized crowd  “walk up ladies and gentlemen the show is just about to begin nowhere on the face of the earth can you get so much for your money as right here remember it costs you but half or quarter of a dollar to see our great company of sixty highpriced and talented artists walk up and get your tickets without delay”  the barker succeeded in getting several scores of people to enter the building nathan wampole was in the boxoffice taking the money for the tickets he smiled as the cash came in  “the more the better” he muttered to himself “won’t somebody be knocked out when they learn the truth”     chapter xv—an act not on the bills   the performance had been going on for half an hour leo had done some very clever acts and been well received and now it was time for carl to make his bow  the little orchestra struck up a grand flourish and suddenly the young magician bounded upon the stage bringing with him a small square box  he came down to the front made a bow and threw the square box into the air down it came into his hands and as he whirled around on his heel the box disappeared from view  “my look at that”  “where did that box go to”  “must have gone up in smoke”  such were some of the remarks passed  the trick was a decidedly clever one yet as simple as could be when explained  true to our promise we will let our readers into the secret  the box consisted of nothing but six perfectly square and thin boards all hinged together in such a manner that it would collapse into a perfectly flat mass when pressed on any two sides with a little study any boy can make such a box  as the box entered carl’s hands he flattened it and as he whirled around he slipped it into the bosom of his costume  this trick performed the young magician brought out several other tricks and then began to juggle ten teacups throwing them over his head and under his arms there was a perfect stream of teacups in the air and not a one was so much as cracked  “he’s certainly cleverhanded”  “he’s the best part of the show”  hearty handclapping followed and then carl threw the teacups to leo in the wings and started to do a great balancing act on four chairs  he had just arranged the chairs in position when he heard a commotion in the wings  “i say the hall ain’t paid for and the show can’t go on” he heard in the angry tones of the theater owner  “where is wampole” several asked  “i can’t find him”  “he was taking the money at the boxoffice”  “well he’s not there now”  “he must be somewhere around”  “i’ll give you five minutes to produce him if you can’t out go the lights”  realizing that matters had reached a crisis the young magician proceeded with his act as quickly as he could the orchestra struck up a lively air but scarcely had they played half a dozen bars when the proprietor of the theater came out on the stage and silenced them  “this show can’t go on ladies and gentlemen” he said “i haven’t been paid for the hall and the head man of this company has skipped out with all of the funds”  “what’s that”  “skipped out”  “no more of the show”  “that’s a shame give me my money back”  a hundred other cries arose on the air the owner of the place prudently retired and in wonder the orchestra did the same a second later the curtain came down and the lights were lowered  “is it true that wampole has skipped” asked carl of leo hurriedly  “yes and he took every cent of the receipts with him” was the bitter answer  carl said no more he followed leo to the dressingroom and hurried into his street clothing  overhead the pair could hear the tramp of many feet presently came the crash of a breaking bench  “some of the audience are getting mad” leo muttered to himself “i fancy——”  “we must run for it” gasped carl in a low voice “hark some of the toughs that were in the gallery have threatened to mob the entire company”  “i am ready to go” said leo as he picked up his valise  he turned to go out into the hallway then he leaped back and slammed the door shut and locked it  “too late they are coming they are here”  the young gymnast spoke the truth heavy footsteps came up to the door a hand tried the knob  “open that door you confounded fakirs or we’ll smash it down” was the cry “you can’t escape us we are bound to get square with you”  “shall i open for them” whispered leo  “no no” cried carl “they would half kill us they are so enraged over the loss of their admission money”  “but what’s to be done”  “here i have it—the window out you go”  “and you”  “i’ll follow quick”  leo leaped for the window a small affair opening on a narrow and dirty alley  the opening was barred but he easily wrenched the irons from their rotted fastenings and crawled through the opening  as carl followed there was a crash and the door fell in  half a dozen young men the worst in the town swarmed into the apartment only to find it empty  up the alleyway sped leo and his companion nor did they stop until the theater had been left several blocks behind  deeming themselves now safe they dropped into a walk and began to discuss the situation  soon they met several other members of the company from these they learned that nathan wampole had indeed run away carrying every cent of the boxoffice receipts with him  “the scoundrel” burst out carl “what are we going to do here penniless and over two hundred miles from new york”  no one could answer that question and as there was nothing else to do leo and carl turned their steps toward the boardinghouse at which they had been stopping     chapter xvi—an unpleasant position   the bad news had preceded leo and carl ross and they found mrs gerston the landlady waiting at the front door  “so mr wampole has run away eh” she said sharply  “it seems so” said carl soberly  “and who is to pay me”  “he is responsible madam” replied leo  “well you’ll not come in this night unless you pay” cried the landlady blocking up the doorway with her portly form “i’m not running a boardinghouse for fun”  “i have no money to pay with”  “neither have i” added carl  “then you can just leave”  “very well give us our baggage and we will”  “i’ll not give up a thing until i’m paid” was the determined reply  both carl and leo were nonplussed they could not blame the woman yet it was a hard situation to face  “we have lost more than you” said carl “mr wampole owes us both three weeks’ salary”  “that’s not my affair when you pay the ten dollars due me you can both have your traveling bags and not before”  and with this the boardinghousekeeper shut the door in their faces  “knocked out all around” said leo with a grin  it was not in his nature to grieve over misfortune  “where shall we go for the night”  “i don’t know let us look around for wampole”  the two set out on a search it availed nothing and by midnight they were worn out  fortunately the night was warm and coming to a deserted mill on the outskirts of the town they determined to remain there and rest they found some old sacks and on these made their bed  carl awoke with a start the next morning looking up he saw a young man of eighteen standing near him the young man had a pleasant face and he was smiling  “thought i’d wake you up” he said “how is it you are bunking here for the night”  “we are out of funds” replied the young magician  “tramping”  “hardly that but we may be soon”  “we belonged to the specialty company that went to pieces last night” explained leo who had roused up  “oh were you on the stage” the young man asked of carl  “yes”  “are you the magician”  “yes”  “and he is the gymnast isn’t he”  “i am” replied leo  “i saw you both you did finely so you are out of money and out of a job”  “we are”  “it’s strange do you know i intended to call on you today”  “on us” cried carl in wonder  “yes you see i am from raymondsville the next town my name is walter raymond and my father owns about half the place my brothers and sisters are going to give a lawn party this afternoon and i promised to see if i couldn’t get some of the members of your company over to liven things up”  “i would like to appear for you first rate” said carl quickly thinking he saw a chance to make a few dollars  “so will i appear” added leo  “how much will you charge for an entertainment lasting say an hour”  carl looked at leo they did not wish to ask too much and at the same time wanted to make all they could  “two city performers generally get twenty dollars” said leo “but we might go a bit cheaper”  “i wouldn’t mind giving twelve dollars” replied walter raymond “if you can come for that i’ll drive you over as soon as you can get ready”  a bargain was struck and then the two performers returned to the vicinity of the theater nothing could be learned of nathan wampole and an hour later they left for raymondsville  they found walter raymond very kind he treated them to a liberal dinner and aided them to get their stage things into proper shape  “it’s lucky we got our stuff from the theater” said leo “we may pick up quite a little money by giving private performances throughout this district”  “that twelve dollars will help us to get our baggage from mrs gerston” said carl  the raymond homestead was surrounded by beautifully laid out grounds and directly after the noonday hour the guests began to arrive to the number of a dozen or more carl and leo had been given a dressingroom in the mansion and here they prepared for their acts  leo was the first to perform and at the conclusion of his initial act he was loudly applauded  then carl appeared followed by one of the house servants who brought his paraphernalia  “isn’t he handsome” whispered several of the girls  carl began to juggle with several balls and a hoop he threw the balls through the hoop and around it then he brought forth several daggers and juggled them in one hand while he kept the balls going with the other the hoop he balanced on a stick set on the end of his nose and placed a ball on top of all  this was a remarkable feat requiring great delicacy of touch and a keen eye the boys and girls watched him breathlessly and then began to clap their hands  “wonderful wonderful”  “i never saw anything to equal that”  “it’s as good as a performance in a circus or a theater”  the juggling continued carl getting down on one knee and also on his back without making a miss of anything that was in motion  at the very height of the act came a loud cry from the house  “help help”  “look out for jack darrow’s dog”  “the brute is mad”  the cry was taken up on all sides the boys and girls looked around in terror  and well they might for a few seconds later an uglylooking bulldog with glaring eyes and mouth dripping with white foam leaped into their very midst  for an instant he stared at the spectators—the next he turned toward carl and with a loud snarl leaped straight for the young performer’s throat     chapter xvii—carl shows his bravery   “a mad dog”  “he is going to bite the young juggler”  shriek after shriek arose on the air and several of the boys and girls fled from the scene  it was truly a thrilling moment and a youth with less nerve than carl ross would have been paralyzed with terror  but in knocking around during the past few years of his life the boy juggler and magician had more than once been thrown into a position of peril and he realized that to lose his nerve would perhaps cost him his life  as the mad beast leaped for his throat carl dodged to one side and caught the animal by the left hind leg  he whirled the body in the air and flung it with great force against a neighboring tree  the shock was such that for the moment the enraged beast was stunned it lay panting upon the grass its glassy eyes rolling frightfully  “get into the house all of you” cried leo and picked up a wee bit of a girl that was standing near she was too young to realize her peril and gazed at him in wonder  the crowd started pellmell with leo and his burden in the rear  scarcely had leo moved when the dog recovered and stood up he had his eyes on carl and leaped once more for him  carl ran to where he had been performing the four daggers he had used were still on the ground and he picked them up  swish one of the daggers flew through the air with lightninglike rapidity it struck the brute in the forehead inflicting a telling injury  “he has knifed the dog”  “that was a clever throw”  seriously wounded the bulldog with the tenacity of his race still showed fight he crouched down then made another leap for our hero  as he did this his breast became exposed and launching forth a second dagger the young magician struck him fairly between the ribs the shining blade sank deep into the flesh and with a snarl and a yelp the mad bulldog rolled over—dead  a shout went up from the neighborhood of the mansion nearly all who had attended the party had seen the skillful way in which the dangerous animal had been dispatched leo was the first to reach carl’s side  “by jove carl that was great” he ejaculated “you did him up in jig time”  “you are a brave young man and no mistake” put in walter raymond “not one man in a hundred would have tackled that dog i wouldn’t have done it for a thousand dollars”  “i don’t want any more of it” answered the young magician as he wiped the perspiration from his forehead “shall i go on with the performance” he continued to the young man of the house  “i don’t know as the folks are in the humor” replied walter raymond  “we’ll do a double act and make them forget the dog incident” said leo quickly  the gardener was called and he removed the body of the canine as soon as this was accomplished leo and carl set to work to do some sleightofhand performances of a humorous nature  taking leo by the nose carl pretended to extract from his mouth a handkerchief a baseball cap and then a live frog  to those wishing to know how this was accomplished he would say they were purely tricks of dexterity carl had the articles mentioned about his person and concealed them in his hand as he reached for leo’s mouth a handkerchief and a baseball cap can be rolled into very small balls when it is necessary and even a frog is small when tightly held  then because leo would not let him get anything else out of his mouth carl pretended to get angry  “i’ll bang myself against the tree” he cried and rushing up to the nearest hardwood tree he brought his forehead up against the bark a thump was heard and each time his head went forward another thump followed  “oh he’ll hurt his head” shrieked several of the girls  but carl did not hurt his head a bit his head struck the tree very lightly the thump was made by his fist which however was kept concealed from the audience  in the meantime leo did some funny work on the ground bending himself into an odd shape backward and hopping around after the released frog  by this time a crowd had assembled in the grounds for the grown folks were not supposed to come in until late seeing this carl stepped up on a little bench  “now ladies and gentlemen i will give you an exhibition of one of my most wonderful tricks” he said “is any one of you a good shot with a horsepistol”  there was a pause and then an elderly gentleman with but one arm stepped forward  “i fancy i can accommodate you” he said with a smile “i am considered a crack shot and was an officer in the cavalry”  “very well sir i will give you the pleasure of shooting me”  as carl spoke he brought out a long pistol  “please examine this” he went on and as the pistol went the round of the crowd he opened his valise and brought forth a horn of powder and a goodsized ball  “i wish you would mark this bullet so you will know it again” he continued “and will somebody bring me a nice ripe apple”  the apple was brought and walter raymond marked the bullet with his knife then with great gravity carl proceeded to load the pistol  “there goes the powder here the paper here the ball and here more paper did you all see it loaded”  “yes yes”  “good thanks for the apple—i’ll eat it after i am shot now then mr cavalry officer kindly take your station over there aim straight for my heart and fire”  “but—but i might kill you” suggested the onearmed man nervously  “never mind—i’m like a cat that has nine lives go ahead ready”  “yes”  carl took the apple given him and held it on his palm at arm’s length  “now aim for my heart ready fire”  bang with a loud explosion the pistol went off and for a moment the spectators were enveloped in smoke  as it cleared away the young magician was seen to be standing as before there was a smile on his face  “i am much obliged to you for shooting me” he said “but what has become of the bullet”  thus speaking he bit into the apple  “hullo what’s this the bullet i declare look”  he was right the bullet with the mark still upon it was embedded in the heart of the apple     chapter xviii—a wonderful trick explained   “wonderful”  “that’s the best trick i’ve seen yet”  “really a remarkable performance” said the old cavalry officer who had done the firing “how did you do it”  to this question carl of course made no reply he was not in the habit of giving away his secrets  but we will let our curious readers into the mystery the way the trick was worked was as follows  when carl received the marked bullet back from walter raymond he substituted in its stead a similarlooking one made of amalgam of tinfoil and quicksilver this bullet was rammed into the pistol so forcibly that it went to pieces beneath the paper even if it had not gone to pieces the firing of the weapon would have shattered it  when carl received the apple he split it partly open and dropped the marked bullet inside on the sly the rest of the trick will now be readily understood  the remarkable performance with the pistol and some additional acrobatic feats from leo brought the entertainment to a close and the two performers hurried to the house to get into their street dress  “you must have dinner here before you leave” said walter raymond as he paid them off “it is but a slight return for killing that mad bulldog and saving the children”  the performers were hungry and readily accepted the invitation while they were eating walter raymond sat close by  “i wouldn’t mind knowing how to do some tricks” he said “it must be lots of fun”  “not so much when one performs for a living” returned carl “to do tricks for your friends is amusing”  “can you show me some simple ones” walter pleaded  carl smiled  “let me have a cent” he said and after it was produced he took a knife and cut a little nick in one edge turning the shaving of metal outward  “now this cent will stick on any door you place it” he said and illustrated by sticking it up with the metal shaving clinging to the woodwork “any boy can do this with ease”  “that’s a nice trick”  after this carl explained a number of other simple tricks with coins and cards and then he and leo departed with a cheer from the young people as they walked away  “well what’s to do now” questioned leo as they hurried on  “i move we get our baggage from mrs gerston i need some of my clothing especially if we are to give garden exhibitions”  “that’s true all right mrs gerston’s it is”  the walk back to town did not take long at first the boardinghouse mistress frowned on them but when they explained that they intended to settle up her expression changed  it was too late to go anywhere that night so a bargain was struck whereby she agreed to let them remain and have breakfast for one dollar more or eleven dollars in all  “that leaves us with just a dollar capital” laughed leo “not much but a good deal better than nothing the question is what shall we do tomorrow”  “we had better try to work our way from town to town” replied carl “perhaps we’ll be fortunate enough to give exhibitions on the way even if we can’t strike garden parties we can show at country hotels and take up a collection it’s not a nice way to do but it’s better than begging”  the next morning found the pair up bright and early their baggage—two satchels belonging to each for their trunks had been lost—were soon strapped up and after breakfast they set out to shake the dust of the town from their feet  hardly had the last house in the place been passed than leo noticed that they were being followed by a burly fellow who carried in his hand an uglylooking rawhide whip  the fellow soon caught up to them  “stop there do yer hear” he called out  “what do you want” asked carl coming to a halt  “i want ter talk to yer ain’t you the chap as killed the dog over ter raymond’s place”  “i am”  “i thought so do yer know i was the owner of that dog an’ that he was a valuable beast”  “if he was valuable it’s too bad he was mad and had to be killed” put in leo  “he wasn’t mad—he only had a fit he gits ’em often i want yer to pony up twentyfive dollars fer him if yer don’t i’ll fix ye see”  “i’ll not pay a cent” cried carl “he was mad and we can easily prove it”  “no sech thing boy are yer goin’ ter pay”  “no”  “then take that”  the fellow raised the rawhide whip and brought it down with a whir over carl’s head  had the rawhide descended as intended the young magician would have been seriously injured  but carl was not to be caught unawares  he leaped aside and before the man could raise the whip again leo wrenched it from his grasp  “give me that whip or i’ll fix yer as sure as my name is jack darrow” fumed the fellow  “stand back” ordered the young gymnast “you have no right to attack my friend”  “i’ll show ye” yelled jack darrow and leaped upon carl  the young magician was on guard and in a twinkle he put out his foot and sent the fellow on his back  “now leave me alone or i’ll shoot you” he said sternly and walked away leo threw the whip over a fence and followed  darrow got up and stood still he shook his fist after them then disappeared in search of his whip  the next village was four miles distant and when they reached the place carl who had lamed his foot on a stone was glad enough to sit down he entered a tavern and took a seat by a corner table  “i’ll be with you in a few minutes” said leo “i want to see what the prospects are here”  “all right i’ll wait” replied the young magician and taking up a paper that lay handy he glanced it over  presently a man came in and dropped in a chair opposite to him carl glanced over the paper and saw it was nathan wampole     chapter xix—wampole’s new scheme   “some ale” said wampole to the waiter and it was quickly brought and set before him  “what’s your order” asked the waiter of carl  “i’ll wait till my friend comes back” said carl quietly  wampole had not yet seen him but he heard the youth’s voice and now looked around the edge of the paper  “carl ross” he murmured as he fell back in his seat  “yes mr wampole you didn’t expect to see me here”  “well—er—not exactly but it’s very fortunate very fortunate indeed” went on nathan wampole gathering himself together with an effort  “why do you want to pay me off”  “well—er—not exactly that carl” with a reproachful glance “but the fact of it is i’m thinking of reorganizing i’ve seen four of our company already”  as he spoke nathan wampole drew a folded document from his pocket and thrust it across the table  “there’s my new scheme” he said earnestly “a grand thing too we’ll make money hand over fist of course you’ll go in”  carl looked at the paper  “hardly sir i don’t care to work for nothing but fame”  “but this is dead sure carl dead sure a fortune——”  “the other company was to bring me a fortune mr wampole no henceforth i’m going to travel with a responsible manager or on my own hook”  “do you mean to insinuate i’m not responsible” cried nathan wampole bristling up  “you haven’t proved yourself to be”  “i’ve had a misfortune that’s all but i’ll get on my feet again and—hullo here’s my friend leo dunbar”  “nathan wampole” ejaculated the young gymnast  “i want you for my newly organized company” commenced the old manager but leo cut him short  “i overheard your offer to carl wampole my answer is the same as his”  “you won’t join me”  “no”  nathan wampole’s face grew dark and bitter  “you’ll regret it—mark my words you’ll regret it” he hissed and gulping down the liquor set before him he arose and hurried from the place  “the fraud” murmured leo “i’ll never perform for him again”  “nor will i” added carl  a little later they were eating dinner not an elaborate meal for they had little to spend  “i’ve struck luck” went on the young gymnast  “i met a gentleman who was at mr raymond’s yesterday and he has hired us to perform at his house this evening from eight o’clock to nine he is going to pay us the same amount twelve dollars”  this was good news and on the strength of it carl ordered some dessert which cost him five cents additional  they hired a room at the tavern and leaving their baggage there took a walk out to see the sights they walked further than they had intended and it was dark when they returned the landlord of the place met them in surprise  “hullo i thought you had changed your mind about coming back” he said  “changed our minds” queried carl puzzled  “yes”  “why so”  “didn’t you send for your baggage”  “no”  “what why a man came here not an hour ago and took all your things off”  carl and leo gave a simultaneous whistle of surprise here was a pretty state of affairs  “who was the man”  “i don’t know he had a wagon and said you had sent him”  carl gave a groan  “we have been robbed leo”  “it looks like it carl what are we to do we must get our things back and that quickly or we won’t be able to perform tonight”  “do you mean to say that man was a thief” demanded the landlord of the tavern with intense astonishment  “that’s just what he was” answered carl “we never sent him here”  “what sort of a looking man was he” asked leo  “tall and dark with a cast in one eye” was the reply “i’ve seen him in these parts before”  “a cast in his eye” repeated carl “it must have been that jack darrow” he burst out  “that’s so” returned the young gymnast “he said he would get square”  “who is jack darrow” questioned the landlord  matters were quickly explained  “you had no right to let our baggage go” said leo severely  “can’t we go after the fellow i’ll drive you to his house if you know where it is”  the landlord was very anxious to help them realizing that he had “put his foot into it” the matter was talked over for several minutes and it was decided to take a fast team of horses and drive back to raymondsville and ascertain where jack darrow resided  five minutes later found leo carl and mr cook on the way they made fast time and soon drove up to the first of the line of stores in the next town  “jack darrow is a worthless scamp” said the storekeeper “he hasn’t any regular home but i fancy you can find him hanging around budd’s livery stable most any time”  “we can if he’s not in hiding” said carl in a low voice as they drove off again  the town being a small one it was easy to find the livery stable mentioned outside of the building sat two hostlers talking and smoking  “is jack darrow anywhere around” questioned mr cook  “yes just went over to yonder stable” called back one of the hostlers “want to see him”  “yes”  “i’ll call him” went on the hostler thinking there might be a chance to earn a dime  “never mind” put in carl “come on leo we won’t give him a chance to run away”  “that’s so we won’t” returned leo and followed the young juggler to the ground  the stable pointed out was but a short distance down a lane back of which flowed a goodsized brook making their way rapidly to the building which was old and much out of repair they entered the open doorway  a sound in the rear greeted them  “there he goes” yelled carl “stop jack darrow”  a muttered exclamation was the only response they saw the goodfornothing leave the barn and run for the brook  “he’s going to leg it” burst out the young gymnast “well three can play at that game”  through the barn rushed leo and carl down by the brook the bushes grew to a height of several feet reaching the water’s edge nothing was to be seen of the man they were after  “he’s hiding somewhere that’s certain” said carl “you go up and i’ll go down the bank”  this advice was followed and both covered a distance of fifty feet when a faint splash was heard  “he’s crossing over” cried out the young magician “this way quick”  regardless of the wetting he plunged into the brook which luckily was hardly a foot deep and leo came too the young man they were after had gone over in full view he was running down a country road on the opposite side at top speed  he was a good runner and once having gained the road leo and carl felt they had a lively chase before them  but the thought of losing their baggage nerved them to do their best and over the ground they flew in good shape gradually closing the gap between them and the man they were after  evidently jack darrow was getting winded for when a quarter of a mile had been passed he slowed up and turned around  “keep back or i’ll fire on yer” he howled making a suggestive movement toward his hip pocket  the two pursuers slowed up but did not come to a halt  “do you think he’s got a pistol” asked leo  “no if he has he won’t dare to use it arm yourself with a stick or stone” were carl’s words  as he spoke he picked up a stick lying near and leo followed his example in another moment they were within ten feet of jack darrow who had started to run once more  “stop” cried carl “stop or i’ll fire”  “you ain’t got no pistol” roared darrow  “no but i’ve got this” was the retort the stick whirled through the air launched with the young juggler’s aim and struck the thief in the back between the shoulders it was a heavy blow and darrow fell flat on his face  before he could get up carl and leo were on top of him in vain he tried to fight them off carl held him fast while the young gymnast produced a stout cord and tied his hands behind him  the two heroes of the occasion had scarcely finished their work when carriage wheels were heard approaching and mr cook and his turnout hove into sight  “hullo you’ve got him” cried out the tavernkeeper “that’s a good job done what are you going to do with him”  “lemme go” whined darrow all his bravery oozing away “lemme go i ain’t done nuthin’”  “where are our things” demanded carl  “wot things i ain’t got nuthin’ belongin’ to you”  “that’s a falsehood” put in mr cook “you are the man that took their baggage from my hotel i have witnesses to prove it the best thing we can do is to take him to the village lockup”  “don’t yer do it—i’ll fix yer if yer do” bellowed darrow “let me go an’ i’ll tell yer where the satchels are every one of em”  “i’ve an idea he hid them in that stable” said leo “it seems to me he was coming down from the loft when we entered”  “we’ll soon find out” said carl “dump him into the carriage and drive back”     chapter xx—another stop on the road   in vain jack darrow protested against the proceedings he was lifted into the carriage without ceremony and the horses’ heads were turned back along the road to where a bridge crossed the brook  the stable reached leo and carl went upstairs the loft was filled with loose hay  “i’ll pitch it over with this fork” said carl and took up the implement he had mentioned  he had proceeded but a short distance into the hay when one of leo’s valises came to light his own followed and soon all their baggage was recovered  “well” called the tavernkeeper from below  “we have it” replied the young gymnast  “good enough this fellow is good for a term in the state prison”  at this darrow began to whine and beg but mr cook was obdurate and told him to shut up  as soon as the two performers came below again the party drove off for the squire’s office situated over the general store and post office here a formal complaint was lodged by mr cook and jack darrow was locked up to await the sitting of the grand jury at the county seat  “he’ll be indicted—i’ll see to it myself” said the tavernkeeper as he and our heroes drove back to charlotting  leo and carl were anxious to get to the place where they were to perform that night and as it was some distance out mr cook drove them directly to the spot—a fine country seat at which a party of over forty were stopping  a round of applause greeted their appearance in the drawingroom some time later the drawingroom opened into a conservatory and the latter was used by the pair for a stage  as usual leo was the first to appear doing a number of feats which were watched with close attention as the space was limited he did not confine himself to acrobatics but in addition performed several tricks with fire which carl had taught him  among other things he did was to stuff his mouth with burning cotton  “he’ll burn himself up” cried several but leo only smiled his mouth had been washed with a strong solution of alum and was to a certain degree fireproof of course he had to be very careful in doing the fire tricks for at the best such tricks are highly dangerous  “i will next swallow a redhot knife” he announced and brought in an iron blade heated to a red heat he faced the audience sideways and it looked as if the knife slid down into his open mouth which was thrown back but in reality it slipped close to the outside of his mouth on the side from the spectators and into a sheath inside his collar placed there to receive it as the knife disappeared the sheath followed and he faced the audience to show that all was fair and square  this concluded leo’s single act and then carl came on after giving a number of the tricks previously mentioned he came forward smilingly  “i have in my hand a box given me by the prince of wales” he said holding up an oblong object four inches wide by four high and eight inches long “this box the prince insisted was the most wonderful box he had ever possessed see i open the box and find it contains nothing but an empty sliding drawer will somebody be kind enough to put a quarter into the box”  he held the open drawer out and a young lady threw a piece of silver into it then carl shut the box up and blew upon it when he opened the box again the silver was gone  the company applauded while the young lady looked glum carl smiled upon her  “never mind we’ll try to get the silver back” he said and struck the box on the bottom then he opened the drawer and out tumbled the coin into the lady’s lap  “good good very neat”  carl turned around to put the box on the table leaving it there he came forward again  “now ladies and gentlemen” he began when of a sudden the box on the table began to dance finally dancing to the floor  “well i declare” cried the young magician “something has surely gotten into that box and yet we left it empty did we not”  there was a nod from the young lady who had looked into the box when the coin came out  holding the box before him carl gave the knob to the drawer a jerk out it came and a shower of small candies flew all over the audience some fell into the young lady’s lap and all present sent up a shout of laughter in the midst of which carl temporarily withdrew  now no doubt our young readers are as usual anxious to know how it was all done the explanation is simple  the box was not exactly what it appeared to be instead of having one drawer it had two one that worked inside of the other the outside drawer was a mere shell without a back to allow the inner box to slide back and forth within it there was a little spring outside at the end which held the inner drawer when desired  when the box was opened first the coin was placed in the second or inner drawer when it was opened again the second drawer was held back by the catch and out came the shell or empty drawer the third time the second drawer came with the coin as described  after the young ladies and the others had seen the box was empty carl turned toward the table and while so doing slyly poured the candy from his bosom into the open box and after closing the article stuck a bent pin into one corner to which was attached a long black horsehair the other end of the horsehair being pinned to his leg  as he began to talk he pulled in jerks on the horsehair which caused the box to dance and fall then bringing it forward he opened it and released a spring that held the bottom thus causing the candy to fly in all directions when he retired the horsehair was removed and he prepared for his next trick  carl now came out in a new rôle—that of a mesmerist and after drawing the curtains over the door for an instant requested the company to draw around that they might get a good view of the top of the table which was covered with a smooth cloth which reached to the floor  “you have all played tiddledewinks and such games” he said “i have my own way of playing them see i place three circles on the table and also this shining bit of metal—my mascot i call it i name the circles 1 2 and 3 now will somebody kindly designate a circle to which the bit of metal shall pass”  “to circle no 2” said an interested boy  “advance and do as bidden” cried carl making some passes at the metal and slowly but surely the piece moved across the table until it reached the center of the circle where it stopped  “again” said carl impressively  “to circle 3” said a lady  slowly but surely the mesmerized metal turned in the direction then circle 1 was called out and the others again wherever commanded the metal went  “and now who will keep the mascot for a keepsake” cried carl  the little girl of the house spoke first and as she was sitting close to the table the metal moved to the edge and fell into her lap     chapter xxi—an unexpected bath   soon after this the young performers brought their performance to a close  but the last trick—how was it performed we hear some of our readers say  it was very simple when the curtains were closed leo came forward and concealed himself under the table he had a powerful magnet and wherever he pushed the magnet under the table the bit of metal on top of the table was sure to follow  leo knew where the circles were to be placed and made his movements accordingly a swift motion at the finish dropped the metal into the little girl’s lap  “i would like to see you” said a gentleman at the close of the engagement “i belong across the river about ten miles north of here the folks are going to give a sociable as we call it i will give you twenty dollars if you can give us a firstclass entertainment to last two hours”  “we’ll try to suit you” said the young gymnast and the engagement was duly entered on a passbook he had purchased  “we are getting famous” cried carl when the mansion was left behind “we are making money faster than we ever did with nathan wampole’s combination”  “the trouble is these snaps may not last carl by the way i wonder if wampole will really succeed in getting our people together again”  “he won’t get me i am done with him”  “so am i”  the two partners as they now called themselves slept soundly that night and did not get up until late their hotel bill paid they found themselves eight dollars and a half ahead  “we’ll have to open a bank account soon” laughed carl “we’ll be waylaid for our wealth”  “wait awhile my boy wait awhile” sang out leo “but tell me how do we get over to point snoker”  mr cook was appealed to and told them to take the road to the river  “you’ll come to jack hazlett’s landing and he’ll ferry you across in his sloop we haven’t got any regular ferry on the river closer than the town of perryskill”  a colored man suggested that they let him wheel their baggage in his barrow for a quarter and they accepted the offer and the start was made immediately after breakfast  on the way carl had considerable fun with the colored man he played a number of clever tricks on that individual and when the river was reached conjured a quarter from his coatsleeve and pretended to wring the money from the old fellow’s nose  “here’s your quarter uncle”  “fo’ de law’s sake chile” cried the darkey and his eyes rolled around in intense surprise  “easy way to get the money uncle”  “yo’ must be in wid de ole boy hisself” was the darkey’s comment “much obliged”  and off he went with a side glance at carl as if halfexpecting the young juggler might conjure the quarter from the pocket in which he had placed it  leo and carl found that jack hazlett was out on the river but would soon return they sat down and waited while doing so they noticed a large steamboat coming up the river crowded with people  “an excursion of some sort” said carl “see the flags flying”  “they are going to land up at yonder island” said leo “see they are turning into the landing”  while the steamboat was discharging its passengers jack hazlett returned and took them on board the passage across the river took them close to the steamboat  “she seems to be an old ferryboat fixed up” observed the young gymnast as they came up “see several people have remained on board”  “what is the matter with that young girl” cried carl pointing to a young lady hanging over the rail “can she be seasick”  “there she goes” yelled leo “my gracious”  with a loud splash the young lady had dropped over the rail into the river  “she’ll be drowned”  “my daughter save her she has a fit” suddenly cried an old man rushing from his seat in the shade  “a fit—that accounts for it” said leo “i’ll save her”  in another moment he was on the boat’s rail—the next he was over the side he struck out boldly  “take care—she may fight you if she has a fit” called his partner  soon leo reached the girl’s side she was about to sink when he came to her support she lay like one dead  “i guess the fit’s gone” he thought when suddenly she gave a frightful scream and began to tear at his face like an enraged tigress  it was a position he had not bargained for and what to do the young gymnast did not know  “look out for her” yelled carl as the girl in the water began her attack  “keep quiet please” gasped leo to his charge “i will take you to the boat”  but the girl paid no attention her eyes rolled horribly and she continued to clutch at his throat  realizing that something must be done the young gymnast resolved to duck the girl he did so and when she came up again she lay as limp as before ere she could recover he struck out for the boat  carl and jack hazlett were waiting for him and quickly assisted him on board here the girl dropped upon the deck unconscious  “my gracious that’s the worst experience i ever had in my life” panted leo as soon as he could speak “i thought she was going to chew me up”  “she’s got fits the worst way” put in the boatman “i’ll take her back to that steamboat”  this was done the girl’s father was anxiously awaiting their arrival and taking his daughter in his arms he carried her into the cabin where a stewardess waited upon her  “i had her in a hospital” he explained “but they discharged her last week as being cured you are a brave lad to save her”  leo smiled faintly  “thanks but i don’t want the job again come on carl”  he was about to go aboard the small boat again when the fond father stopped him taking a tendollar bill from his pocketbook he pressed it into the young gymnast’s hand  “don’t say you won’t take it” he said “you deserve more but it’s all i have with me”  and he made the youth keep the amount     chapter xxii—wampole shows his hand   after this adventure the river was soon crossed and an hour later leo and carl found themselves installed at another hotel but a short distance from the mansion at which they were to perform  while they were taking a stroll through the village carl’s eyes were suddenly arrested by a huge poster stuck on the side of a barn  “look leo what do you think of that” he cried  the poster referred to ran as follows      wampole’s transcontinental     specialty company     reorganized     better and brighter than ever     see leo the wonderful clown and gymnast     don’t miss carl ross     the greatest juggler and magician     the world has ever produced     30—other artists—30     at pelham’s hall tonight     admission 15 and 25 cents  “if that ain’t cheeky” burst out leo “what right has he to advertise us when we are no longer with him”  “that is what i would like to know” returned carl  “we ought to stop him”  “we certainly can” said the young juggler “he hasn’t any more right to use our names than the president’s”  “what shall we do”  “i wonder where we can find him”  “most likely at pelham’s hall wherever that is”  the two made inquiries and soon located the hall which was situated over the general store  going upstairs they met a toughlooking individual coming down  it was bill gormley one of the wampole company  he was put down on the bills as ricardo the great german impersonator he could do one or two things fairly well but the majority of his acts were decidedly poor more than that he was a heavy drinker and had on several occasions appeared on the stage when he could hardly stand  “hullo ross” he called out “hullo dunbar so you’ve decided to rejoin eh”  “hardly” replied carl “where is wampole”  “back of the stage but you ain’t going to join us you say”  “we are not” answered leo  “you had better we are going to make a big thing of the show now”  “wampole was always going to do that” laughed carl  they passed up the dingy stairs and into the hall nathan wampole stood on the empty stairs rehearsing a boy of twelve in a funny dialect part  “that ain’t right” he roared “do it this way you ain’t worth your salt come now or i’ll crack you with this club”  “wampole” called out the young gymnast  “leo and you too carl delighted to see you” nathan wampole’s face took on a smile and the boy was forgotten “so you thought you would join us again i was on the point of sending for you”  “we are not going to join and we want to know by what right you are advertising us” said carl firmly  nathan wampole’s face instantly took on an ugly look  “not going to join eh” he muttered  “no”  “and we demand that you take our names from your bills” added leo  “what not much”  “then we’ll compel you”  nathan wampole’s face grew white  “you will not on the other hand i’ll compel you to perform in my company i have your signatures remember”  “that old contract doesn’t count—you broke it yourself” returned carl  “it was never broken” nathan wampole smiled maliciously “i’ve been to a lawyer and he says you must perform with me”  “the lawyer that said that is a fool” cried leo  “no he’s not—he’s a smart man you will perform with me and nowhere else if you don’t——”  “if we don’t” queried carl  “if you don’t i’ll have you arrested”  “you can’t do that”  “yes i can”  “on what charge pray” asked leo  “on a charge of breaking up my former company and running off with some of my things” replied nathan wampole triumphantly “i’ve got witnesses to prove that you two fellows are thieves”  scarcely had he uttered the words when both leo and carl leaped forward two quick blows landed nathan wampole flat on his back  “you contemptible cur” cried carl  “take that for calling us thieves” added the young gymnast  “whow” spluttered nathan wampole as he struggled to rise “wha—what do you mean by attacking me in this fashion” he howled  “what do you mean by insulting us” said carl sternly  “i—i told the tru——”  “stop or we’ll give you another dose” ejaculated leo “now let us come to an understanding nathan wampole you broke your agreement with us and that ended our engagement as to the things we took we can prove our property your talk doesn’t go”  this plain talk had its effect on nathan wampole he was naturally a coward and he at once began to cringe  “well i—perhaps i was mistaken gentlemen but—ah—really you ought to join our company it will be the chance of a lifetime and——”  “we won’t waste words with you” said carl “but understand our names come off your bills if they don’t we’ll tear the bills down and have you up in court for false pretense we are done with you”  thus speaking carl left followed by leo walking down the street they tore their names from every bill to be found  nathan wampole followed and expostulated but in vain he had to rebill the town and this time took good care that their names did not appear wampole never bothered either of them again  at the proper time leo and carl made their appearance at the mansion where they were to perform the partners had a new trick which they called “samson’s strength”  “any one can have the strength of a samson if he so desires” said carl on coming forward “please to look at these dumbbells”  he produced a pair of iron dumbbells each weighing about ten pounds  “now if you will observe i handle these dumbbells with ease” he gave them a flourish “over they go—high in the air—around and around—easy enough is it not bang”  down went the dumbbells on a large flat stool he had provided  “will the strongest man present pick them up”  a tall wellformed man came forward and caught hold of one of the dumbbells  he thought he could lift it with ease  he was sadly mistaken  in vain he tugged at the dumbbell it refused to budge  “you have fastened it down in some way” he said  “fastened it nonsense” cried carl and leaning forward he picked up the dumbbell with only his forefinger and his thumb  “try the other dumbbell” he said  the man did so and found it equally hard to raise  “why a little girl can pick them up” said carl and he motioned for a young miss of twelve to come forward “i will strengthen your arms” he added and made several mysterious signs over her wrists  the little girl took hold of the dumbbells sure enough she raised them without trouble  this trick was a grand success and the audience wondered how it was accomplished  the explanation was simple under the stool carl had a powerful magnet connected with the electric current which served the mansion with lights by applying this magnet to the dumbbells the attraction was so strong they could not be moved leo controlled the current from below the floor and certain movements which carl made with his foot told the young gymnast when to turn the attractive force off or on     chapter xxiii—the greatest show on earth once more   the performance at the mansion lasted longer than had been anticipated many visitors were present and the whole affair was voted a big success  but though leo and carl both tried they failed to secure another engagement anywhere in the vicinity  “never mind we can’t expect to earn twelve or twenty dollars every night” said the young gymnast “if we did that we would be millionaires in no time”  when they arrived at the hotel at which they were to stop they found several gentlemen talking about eggs and how columbus had stood one on end  “yes but he cracked the shell” said carl “i will agree to stand an egg on end without cracking the shell wait till i put my traps away”  he disappeared upstairs but soon returned  “i’ll bet a dollar you can’t stand an egg up on end” said one of the gentlemen and produced an egg brought from the kitchen  carl took it and waved it over his head several times  “you have to daze the chick inside” he explained “now it will stand up all right”  he put the egg down on the smooth table sure enough it stood up as nicely as one would please then he took the egg up and making several passes handed it to the man  but the egg wouldn’t stand for the man try as hard as he could  “you’ve won the bet”  “keep your money it was only a trick” smiled carl  “and how was it done”  “ah that’s one of our professional secrets” laughed carl “goodnight” and he and leo retired  “how was the trick done” the reader asks we will tell them when carl went out he procured another egg and put in one end a bit of quicksilver this egg he substituted for the original egg when he waved the latter in the air the egg with the quicksilver could of course be set on end with ease for the quicksilver’s weight would balance the other end  leaving the town the next day leo and carl struck out for a city five miles away having heard that it was a good place in which to perform there was no stage running to the city so the pair walked the distance when they reached the outskirts leo suddenly stopped short and pointed to several billboards fastened to the side of a barn  “what’s the matter” asked carl “i don’t see anything but circus bills and the circus won’t be here until the day after tomorrow”  “it’s the ‘greatest show on earth’—the circus i used to travel with” said the young acrobat  “oh that’s so well we needn’t come in contact with the crowd if you don’t care to do so” said carl  for leo had told his friend the whole story of the stolen circus tickets and carl sympathized with him over the fact that he was under suspicion  “if only i could get at the bottom of that affair” murmured leo as they walked along one of the city streets  “those ticket thieves are sure to be run down some day” put in carl “and then your name will be cleared”  “they can’t be run down any too quick for me” answered leo  since leaving the circus he had often thought of barton reeve natalie sparks and his other friends no communications had passed between them for the reason that none of those traveling with the circus knew where leo was  in chalburgh for such was the city’s name leo and carl were lucky enough to strike an engagement with a fat men’s association the association gave a picnic in a large grove and the pair performed on one end of the dancing platform this engagement brought in eight dollars more and when they were paid off the head man of the committee asked if they intended to remain in the city long  “that depends” said carl “we’ll stay if we can find another opening”  “i might be able to find you an engagement with another society” said the fat man who tipped the scales at three hundred and ten pounds “i can let you know by tomorrow night if you can wait that long”  leo and carl consulted together and agreed to remain in chalburgh and the fat man took down their hotel address  so the time went by until the day came when the circus was to perform in the city long before daybreak the wagons arrived and also the canvas and ring men leo could not resist the temptation to take a walk down to the circusgrounds for a look at the familiar scene  while he stood there somebody touched him on the shoulder it was barton reeve  “how are you leo” said the menagerie manager heartily as he held out his hand  “i am pretty well thank you” replied the young gymnast  “where have you been all this time”  “knocking around on my own hook” and leo smiled faintly he was glad to see reeve still considered him a friend  “i heard you had joined wampole’s specialty company”  “i did but i had to get out” answered the boy and told of the theatrical manager’s doings and of how he was now giving private exhibitions with carl  “i wish you were back in our show” said barton reeve “all of us miss you”  “has mr lambert discovered the ticket thieves yet”  “no but he’s got his eyes on several fellows who are following us around”  “is snipper still with you”  “yes but nobody likes him natalie sparks thinks snipper may be in with the ticket thieves—that’s between you and me of course” added barton reeve quickly  “i have the same kind of an idea mr reeve but the thing is to prove it”  “of course until you can do that you had better remain silent”  while conversing the two had been skirting the circus grounds and now they came to a halt near a lemonade stand leo looked up to see jack snipper not over fifty feet away  “there is snipper now” he exclaimed “who are those two men with him”  barton reeve gave a look  “i declare they are two of the crowd that lambert has under suspicion” he ejaculated  “the three are going somewhere” said leo quickly “if you have the time to spare let us follow them”  barton reeve looked at leo and saw what was passing in the young gymnast’s mind  “i have the whole morning on my hands and will go willingly” he replied  they set off side by side taking care that snipper should not notice them  a half dozen blocks were covered and the old gymnast and his two companions turned into a lowlooking drinking resort  passing the place leo and barton reeve saw the men take a drink and then walk into a back room  at once leo led the way through a side yard belonging to the drinking resort  here was a window opening into the back room and standing close to this the two could hear and see all that was going on  the men were counting over several bags of money  this finished one of them brought out several bundles of unsold tickets  “when can you get more for us snipper” asked one of the circus swindlers  “i don’t know they have discovered this loss already” replied the secondrate gymnast  “didn’t you put it off on the boy as you said you would”  “certainly but they think the boy is too good to steal” growled snipper  then one of the other men began to figure up profits and mentioned how the money was to be divided  “hurry up” said snipper “i don’t want to stay away too long it might excite suspicion”  at this barton reeve motioned to leo to walk a distance away  “run for a couple of policemen” he whispered “i’ll keep an eye on the crowd”  the young gymnast needed no second bidding but went off swiftly  at the first corner he ran across a bluecoat and hurriedly related his story  at once the policeman rapped for an assistant  then the three joined barton reeve  snipper and the swindlers were just preparing to leave the saloon  the back window was wide open and with a bound barton reeve leaped into the apartment  leo came close behind and the policemen followed  jack snipper turned as pale as death when he saw how he was trapped  he started to sneak out through the drinking resort but leo caught him and threw him down on the sawdust floor  then a struggle took place between the swindlers and barton reeve and the policemen  but at last the swindlers were overcome and handcuffed  snipper was also made a prisoner and the whole crowd marched down to the police station  the excitement was great at the circus when it was learned that leo was innocent and jack snipper was guilty  in her joy natalie sparks actually hugged leo while the boy blushed most furiously  in due course of time snipper and the swindlers were tried and each was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment     chapter xxiv—in the circus ring again   “leo mr lambert wants to see you” said barton reeve after the excitement of the arrest was over  “what about” questioned the young gymnast  “oh he wants to see you that’s all” added reeve with a peculiar wink of his eye  the circus manager was at the main ticket wagon as usual as leo entered he held out his hand  “dunbar i did you a great wrong and i am sorry for it” he said frankly  “i am glad that my name is cleared mr lambert” said leo as he took the extended hand  “we owe you something for what you have done for the show” went on the manager “you did what the detectives failed to do and i feel i ought to pay you a reward”  “you can reward me well enough by taking me back mr lambert—that is if you will take my present side partner too” leo added for he did not intend to desert carl who had done so much for him  “i don’t understand who is your partner”  “carl ross a magician and juggler he is very clever and i think would make a hit with the show we have been traveling around giving private exhibitions“  “in that case i will be pleased to see what your partner can do can he come around to the dressingtent just before the evening performance begins”  “yes sir”  “very well then have him bring what apparatus he possesses with him and remember your old place is open whenever you care to step into it again”  “i’ll be on hand as soon as you settle with carl ross” smiled leo  he lost no time in hunting up carl who was close at hand having heard of the arrest of the ticket thieves at the hotel  “the manager of the circus says my old position is open for me” said leo  “are you going to leave me leo” asked carl with an anxious look on his face  “no i said i would rejoin if he would give you an opening too”  “oh”  “he wants you to show what you can do at the dressing tent a little before seven o’clock” and leo went into a few particulars “do your best carl and you are sure of a steady place at a good salary”  “that would certainly be far better than knocking around as we have been doing on an uncertainty”  that evening carl presented himself in company with leo and gave an exhibition of his finest tricks and of his most dexterous juggling mr lambert was greatly pleased  “you’ll do first rate” he said when carl had concluded “if you wish you can join us and i’ll pay you the same wages that i was paying dunbar”  carl accepted on the spot and the next day found him and leo traveling with the other performers of the “greatest show on earth”  leo’s friends were glad to see him back and doubly glad that they had gotten rid of snipper  “i never want to see that man again” declared natalie sparks and nobody blamed her  the next two weeks were busy ones for leo not only had he to practice up himself in his old acts but he had also to instruct a new gymnast who came to take snipper’s place  the newcomer was named harry ray he was a firstclass fellow and soon he and leo and carl became warm friends  the “greatest show on earth” moved nearly every day its course was westward something which did not suit the young gymnast but which was also something he could not help  for during all his adventures he had not forgotten about the old life at hopsville and how barton reeve had promised when he got the chance to look up his monetary affairs for him one day he spoke to reeve about it  “i haven’t forgotten leo don’t think that but at present i can do nothing”  “when will we move eastward again”  “that i can’t say either it will depend to a great extent on how matters pan out in the west if we don’t take in much money we’ll turn back again as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made”  “well i want the show to make all the money possible but i want my rights too”  “and you shall get them never fear of that” concluded barton reeve  “i reckon nathan dobb is glad to get rid of the care of me” thought leo as he walked away “and yet it seems to me he has been acting very queerly”  never for an instant did the young gymnast dream that nathan dobb had placed hank griswold on his track to do him harm  why griswold had not put in an appearance ere this will be related later     chapter xxv—another balloon trip   in the middle of the ring the circus men usually built a large tank in which several celebrated swimmers and divers used to give a special performance  this was something new in the circus line and it made a hit with the audience  one morning one of the swimmers a lad named delbier was trying a new act  this was to turn in the air in a peculiar way and land in the water on his side with his body tied up in a knot  it was a very difficult feat and leo watched delbier with interest  “that’s dangerous” he said  “i know it but orders are for something new and it’s the only thing i can think of” was the reply  leo was practicing on the rings close at hand and for some minutes all went along well  then delbier did the new trick down he went into the tank but failed to come up  leo waited for nearly half a minute and then growing alarmed dropped from the rings and hurried to the edge of the tank  in the clear water he beheld delbier at the bottom  the fellow had disjointed himself in some way and could not straighten out  he was in great danger of drowning  without hesitation leo leaped into the tank intending to raise the doubledup body  he made an alarming discovery  delbier had a cramp and his right hand and left foot were tightly twisted about a corner brace in the bottom of the waterbox  in vain leo tugged to free the diver he could not break that deathlike hold  in less than half a minute leo was out of breath  it looked as if he must arise to the surface and leave poor delbier to his fate  but then he clinched his teeth  “i’ll save him” he thought grimly  catching the brace in both hands he planted his feet against the side of the tank  then he strained and tugged for dear life  at first the brace which was screwed on would not budge  but finally it parted with a snap which sounded unusually loud in the water  delbier still clung to it and so leo brought both brace and drowning man to the surface together  by this time a crowd of helpers and performers had gathered  “what’s the matter”  “hello delbier has a cramp”  “see how he holds to the brace”  “leo dunbar saved him he tore the brace loose”  meanwhile a doctor was sent for he quickly came and after an hour’s hard work succeeded in bringing delbier around all right  leo’s wonderful nerve was much commented upon  “he’s a plucky chap” said pomeroy the head of the tumblers and all agreed with him  delbier was very thankful to our hero for what he had done for him and from that day he was added to leo’s growing list of friends  about this time the “greatest show on earth” was joined by a balloonist named professor ricardo and his assistant larry greson the professor gave ascensions in the afternoon previous to the circus performance and thereby attracted large crowds  professor ricardo was a jovial sort of fellow and he and leo were soon on good terms  “how would you like to go up some day with me dunbar” he asked one afternoon  “firstrate”  “it’s a peculiar sensation when you go up for the first time”  the young gymnast smiled  “it wouldn’t be my first trip” he said “i went up once before—in a big hurry”  and he told of his adventure while trying to escape from daniel hawkins  about a week after this leo went up with the professor taking the place of the assistant he rather enjoyed the trip and was not at all afraid  “i’m used to swinging around in the air you know” he explained  the circus was going still further west and one day it struck a town around which the forest fires were raging rather extensively on this same day larry greson came to the manager of the show and said that professor ricardo was sick and could not give his customary exhibition  “that’s too bad” replied adam lambert “it has been advertised and i hate to disappoint the crowds”  leo heard about the trouble and presently he volunteered to go up with greson  “i’ll do a turn or two on the bar and the country folks won’t know the difference” he said  and so it was arranged that the young gymnast should go up  “but be mighty careful leo” cautioned barton reeve “we can’t afford to lose you”  at the appointed time leo was on hand the big balloon was inflated and up the monster went with greson in the tiny basket and leo clinging to a bar beneath  the wind was blowing rather strongly and as they shot up it increased in velocity before leo had time to make a dozen turns on the bar the balloon had left the circus grounds far behind and was sailing rapidly over the outskirts of the town  far ahead could be seen the burning forests  it being useless to remain on the bar leo hastily clambered into the basket  “we had better come down” he cried  “we can’t come down fast enough” gasped greson  “what do you mean greson”  “we are sailing along too fast we’ll land right in the center of the fire”  “then what is best to do”  “sail over it and land on the other side of the woods”  “can we do that”  “oh yes”  “then go ahead” returned leo much relieved “put some more alcohol on your sponge” he added referring to the sponge which was blazing beneath the balloon opening to keep the air hot  leo kept a sharp lookout ahead while greson tended to the lighted sponge  they kept well up in the air  it was not long before the burning forest could be seen plainly  “gosh but we don’t want to get down in that” cried greson with a shudder “we would never come out alive”  “look to your sponge” called out the young gymnast sharply  a puff of wind had blown the flame in an opposite direction  greson turned to comply but at that moment the wind took a piece of the lighted sponge from the holder and carried it upward  it caught on the balloon there was a puff of smoke and a tiny flame  the balloon was on fire  white with terror greson sank down on the floor of the basket too overcome to think or act  leo’s heart leaped into his throat  they were speeding with terrible swiftness directly toward the forest of fire     chapter xxvi—adventures amid the flames   there was no escape for the burning balloon was going down in the very midst of the crackling forest  already the atmosphere was thick with smoke and flaming pieces of wood and brush  it was with difficulty that leo breathed and he could scarcely see a dozen feet before him  larry greson the assistant lay on the floor of the basket too frightened to move  “out with the sandbags” cried the young gymnast “it is our one hope”  “what’s the use the balloon is on fire” gasped greson hopelessly  “we must do something—i won’t give up” was leo’s response  he began to cast out the heavy bags one after the other greson at last consented to help him  the burning balloon shot up into the air fifty or sixty feet but only for a few seconds  yet this space of time was enough to carry them over the worst of the burning forest  then they began to settle again the smoke rolling blackly on all sides of them  “we’re goners” groaned greson “goodby”  splash what was this both could scarcely believe the evidence of their senses  they had dropped into the very center of a little lake in the midst of the forest down they went with the burning balloon settling over them both knew enough to leap from the basket and dive under it was well they did so otherwise they would have been caught in the folds of the ignited monster and drowned like rats in a trap  leo took a long dive and when he came up he was fully fifty feet away from what was left of the once valuable balloon now partly above and partly below water and still burning and hissing  “larry where are you” he called out  he received no reply but a moment later perceived his assistant puffing and blowing not a dozen feet away  “this is awful” spluttered greson “we’ve escaped from fire to be drowned”  “nonsense come let us swim ashore”  “how can we do that when the fire is on all sides of the lake” was greson’s dismayed answer  “i’ll find some spot to land never fear” was leo’s confident reply  he led the way and greson being a good swimmer easily followed  the firebrands were thick about them and often they had to duck to get out of the way of being burned it was with difficulty that they could get any fresh air  to one side of the lake which was not over three hundred feet in diameter leo beheld a number of high rocks comparatively free from burning brush hither he directed his course  “we can get on the rocks if nothing else” he said  “yes and have our feet blistered” growled greson “i’ll bet the stones are as hot as pepper”  “we’ll try them anyway”  the young gymnast swam around with great care before he essayed to land  presently he discovered a little cove and further on a split in the rocks several feet in width  “just the spot come” he shouted to greson  he led the way into the narrow opening fifteen feet further on was a bit of a cave and into this the pair crawled on hands and knees  it was much cooler in the cave than it had been outside by lying flat on the flooring they managed to get a current of fresh air there was also a little pool there and both washed the sweat and smoke from their faces and procured a drink they were exhausted and only too glad to about lie down and rest in their safe retreat  “a narrow escape truly” said leo with a shiver  “we ain’t out of it yet” returned greson  “i know that”  “we may have to stay here a week and without food that won’t be very pleasant”  slowly the day wore on  overhead the flames crackled and roared as if delighted to hold sway over such an immense area of woods  once the wind changed a bit and blew the smoke directly down upon them but just as they had about made up their minds that they would have to seek new quarters it went back and they were molested no more on that score  toward evening both began to feel hungry  “there ought to be lots of dead birds and small animals around” said the young gymnast “but the thing is to get hold of them”  “i’m not going to venture out—at least not yet” said greson  “all right—let’s wait till empty stomachs drive us out”  “i have an idea the lake—it must have fish in it”  “that’s right” cried leo  he had some line in his pocket soon he had made a hook with a big bent pin  in the meantime greson dug around among some dirt near the pool for worms he brought out several  the line was baited a stone put on for a sinker and thrown into the water then they went back to the cave  twice they found the line as they had left it but the third time something was on it they hauled in the catch  it was a fat spotted fish weighing nearly two pounds  “good” shouted greson “now to cook him heaven knows there is fire enough”  half an hour later the fish was done to a turn they ate him with a big relish and at once threw out the line again in hope of catching something for the morning meal     chapter xxvii—escape from the burning forest   the night passed and half of the next day  the two remained in the cave living on fish alone  it looked as if they would have to remain in the cave a week perhaps longer  “i’m sick of it from my hair to my toes” growled greson  “so am i but i am thankful we are alive” returned leo grimly  the noon hour passed slowly  it was furiously hot  “wouldn’t you think the fire would burn itself out leo” remarked the assistant  “there are a good many thousands of cords of wood to consume and that takes time larry”  about the middle of the afternoon it began to grow dark  “more smoke coming this way” announced greson  “no it’s clouds”  “clouds yes and—hark”  they listened intently a low rumble was heard  “a thunderstorm if it only rains hard enough”  the sky kept growing blacker and blacker then came a flash of lightning through the smoke and the patter of rain  as the rain came down the smoke grew thicker and soon it drifted into the cave and they were all but driven out  “we can’t stand this let us get out” said greson  “no no wait awhile larry see the wind is changing”  the young gymnast was right the wind swerved around and at once the smoke left them  another hour passed and still the rain came down steadily it had full effect on the burning forest for the fire died out in spot after spot  “we’ll be able to get out by morning” said leo  that night they thought it safe to sleep and lay down utterly exhausted  in the morning it was still raining all around the lake the burned trunks of tall trees were left standing every bush was reduced to ashes  they had not even a compass by which to make their course out of the forest but this did not stop them from departing  “here is a stream that flows from the lake” said leo “it must lead to some river or larger lake we will follow it for a few miles and see where it brings us”  “that’s right keep near the water we may need it if the rain stops and the fire starts up again” replied greson  they picked their way slowly along the bank of the brook sometimes walking directly in the water where the dirt and stones became too hot for their feet  “hurrah” cried the young gymnast at the end of a long turn in the stream  he pointed ahead there beyond a stretch of prairie grass lay a small village  evidently it had entirely escaped the ravages of the fierce forest fire  the prairie grass was burned in spots but that was all  the village could be distinctly seen but they knew it was nevertheless several miles off  one can see a long distance over a prairie the same as over the water  the middle of the afternoon saw them safe in the village of rallings footsore and weary  the people were astonished to hear their tale  “it’s lucky ye escaped with your lives” said one old inhabitant and leo and larry greson agreed with him  to keep the circus folks from worrying leo sent barton reeve a telegram stating they were both safe that very day they started back to join the “greatest show on earth”  when they returned it was found that professor ricardo was still sick he had another balloon but this would be of no use unless somebody was found to take his place  “i’ll become balloonist for awhile” said leo “that is if you don’t ask me to go up near any burning forests again”  “that’s right” put in greson “no more such adventures for me besides burning up balloons is rather expensive”  the matter was talked over and it was decided that for the next few weeks leo should take the old balloonist’s place     chapter xxviii—the rival balloonists   “we’re going to have fun today leo” said his assistant two days later  “how so larry”  “there is a rival here”  “who”  “porler from new orleans”  “you don’t mean to say he is going to give an exhibition here” said the young gymnast with much interest  “so he says and he adds that he will show up in a way that will throw the circus exhibition away in the shade”  leo smiled he had heard that porler was a very conceited man who had been in the business for a dozen years or more  once he had wanted to become professor ricardo’s partner but the professor refused to go into the deal  this made porler angry with the professor and also with the circus folks  when leo arrived at the circus lot he found that the two balloons had been located side by side  porler was to exhibit at one o’clock while leo usually went up an hour later  the young gymnast cautioned larry to be on guard so that no harm should come to his outfit and he likewise cautioned his men to keep away from porler’s inclosure and thus avoid trouble  the backs of the two tents used by leo and porler were almost together and while leo was in his own looking over his things he heard quarreling in the tent beyond  “oh don’t ask me to do that mr porler” pleaded a boyish voice “anything but that”  “you must do it mart keene” responded the gruff voice of the balloonist  “i can’t—really i can’t” pleaded the boyish voice again  “you can do it and you will my reputation is at stake and you must go up with me and do the fairy act”  “i will fall and break my neck”  “no you won’t—not unless you get too confoundedly nervous which you haven’t any right to do”  “let me do my own act” pleaded mart keene for such was the boy’s name  “no you’ll do as i want you to we must show up at our best”  the boy began to cry  he was a street waif from new orleans porler had picked him up in the french quarter one day and adopted him he had promised him a good living and some money but he got neither he had often abused him and at times made him do acts in connection with his exhibitions which imperiled mart’s limbs and life he did not care what became of the boy as long as he made money  porler flew into a rage when mart started to cry  “shut up” he cried in a low tone that was full of passion “do you want the crowd outside to hear your sniveling’  “i will stop when you promise not to make me do the fairy act” sobbed mart  “you’ll do that act i say and that ends it” howled porler  he looked around the tent and espying a whip lying near a trunk picked it up  “do you see this” he demanded  “oh don’t whip me please”  “promise to do as i wish you to or i’ll break this whip over your bare back you rascal”  “no no”  mart tried to shrink back from the man but he sprang forward and clutched him by the arm  yet the upraised whip never descended  the back canvas of the tent was pushed up and leo appeared  he caught the whip and twisted it from porler’s hand  “you coward let that poor boy alone” he cried  porler was thunderstruck he had not dreamed of being interrupted his face grew dark as he whirled around and faced the young gymnast  “what right have you to come in here” he hissed  “the right any one has to save a defenseless boy from a brute” retorted leo “i want you to leave him alone”  “he is my ward”  “i don’t care if he is you evidently treat him worse than you would a dog”  “he won’t do as i order him to”  “you want him to risk his neck in the fairy act an act that can’t be accomplished except by long and careful training it isn’t right”  “you are jealous and afraid we are going to outdo you” sneered porler  leo’s face flushed  “i am not” he said calmly “i wish to stick up for the lad that is all leave him alone and i won’t bother you”  “supposing i don’t choose to leave him alone”  “then i’ll make you and not only that i’ll go outside and let the crowd know just how matters stand—that you want to force him to do an act that he can’t do and which may cause him to lose his life”  hardly had leo uttered the words than with a muttered imprecation porler sprang upon him and bore him to the ground     chapter xxix—porler’s move   porler was angry enough to give leo a good beating  he struck at the boy as he sent him down to the ground but the young gymnast avoided the blow  then leo let out and porler received a blow on the nose  this brought blood and he grew more enraged than ever  like an eel leo squirmed from his grasp and panting the two faced each other  “i’ll fix you” howled porler  he ran to his trunk to get a weapon for he was in his balloon costume but suddenly stopped short  “where is he”  he referred to mart keene who had disappeared  fearful that the boy was running away porler forgot all about leo for the time being and ran outside  the young gymnast ran to his own tent and came out  he saw porler looking around anxiously  the lad had certainly escaped  “i hope he doesn’t find him” thought leo  porler whispered to his assistant a man named murphy and the latter hurried off to ascertain if possible what had become of mart  then porler reentered his tent the band was playing and it was time for him to make his ascension  he delayed as long as possible but at last the crowd got impatient  “a little hole in the balloon that is all gentlemen” said porler “i am ready now”  he did not dare to speak of mart for fear an investigation would be started  he came out smiling falsely at the crowd and walked over to where his balloon swayed in the air  at a given signal the balloon shot up with porler in the basket  when the balloon was scarcely two hundred feet in the air porler got out his parachute and leaped overboard  as he came floating down he made several turns about the double handle of the parachute  the crowd applauded this for it was something new to them  leo saw the exhibition from a hole in the top of his tent and smiled to himself  “there are twenty balloonists in the united states who can do as good as that and better” he thought  porler had expected to make mart go up with him  the boy was to leave the balloon with him on the parachute and then when within fifty feet of the ground fly away by himself on an immense pair of white wings filled with gas  the band continued to play after porler landed  “now for the circus balloonist” was the cry  a flourish from the band and leo came running out  he was dressed in a suit of white and gold the gold sparkled in the sunshine and made a beautiful appearance quite in contrast to porler’s dirty costume of plain white and red  “let go”  up shot the circus balloon with a rush  there was leo not in a basket but clinging to a slender trapeze a shout of approval arose  up and up went the balloon until it became to the human eye about as large as a dinner plate  the young gymnast was making a great ascension  as he went up he began to perform on the trapeze he turned over and over and hung by his toes  the crowd could scarcely believe its eyes porler was completely outdone  at last both balloon and balloonist passed out of sight of those on the fair grounds  leo landed in a field several miles from the city  he hired the farmers who came out to see what was the matter to help him pack up the balloon  about an hour later greson came along and the outfit was packed on a wagon and carted back to the circus grounds when leo came in for supper he found a note awaiting him  it was from mart keene and ran like this      “dear mr dunbar i must thank you for your bravery and great     kindness to me i am alone in the world and need a friend if     you will help me kindly call at the address given on the     inclosed card”  the young gymnast looked at the card it bore the address of a boardinghouse on a side avenue half a dozen blocks from the grounds  he at once departed for the place     chapter xxx—mart keene’s story   it did not take leo long to reach the boardinghouse advertised on the card  “i wish to see mart keene” he said to the lady who answered his summons  “oh yes please walk into the parlor”  in a few minutes the lad came in  he wore an old suit one he had caught up when escaping from porler he blushed as he took leo’s hand  “you will have to excuse my appearance” he said “but you are aware it cannot be helped”  “yes mart i understand it all i am glad you escaped from porler”  “i must thank you for what you did for me” went on mart “you are as brave as you are daring”  “don’t mention that mart it was a pleasure to be of service to you let me know how i can serve you further”  there was a silence and the lad cast down his eyes  “i must be frank with you” he said at last “i am without a friend in the world and likewise without a dollar”  the young gymnast smiled faintly  “my boy allow me to contradict you” he said “neither statement is true i am your friend”  the boy’s face lit up  “i thought you would be my friend you seemed so generous and i wanted a small loan so that i might get away from mr porler i never want to see that man again”  “as i said before what i have is at your service”  “will you loan me ten dollars”  “yes and more here are twenty dollars accept them as a loan to be paid back at any time that suits you”  and leo handed out the amount  mart blushed as he accepted the bills  “i shall never forget you never” he murmured and put the money away “i will repay you as soon as i am able”  “be in no hurry what are you going to do if i may ask”  “i am going to try to hunt up an uncle of mine” said mart “if i can only find him i think he will give me a home if i am not mistaken he is holding some property which belongs to me”  “where does your uncle live” questioned leo with interest  “that i do not know i will have to advertise for information i presume”  “uphill work that what is your uncle’s name”  “daniel hawkins”  “daniel hawkins” repeated leo leaping to his feet in astonishment  “yes why you act as if you knew him” returned mart  “know him well i rather guess i do” returned the young gymnast bitterly  “oh i am so glad”  “and i’m sorry”  “sorry why”  “you need expect nothing from your uncle mart”  “oh don’t say that” and the boy grew pale  “i might as well be plain with you even if it does hurt there is no use in building up false hopes”  “you must know my uncle well”  “i worked for him for a long while—he acted as if he owned me he is a miserable skinflint nothing less if you go to him he will work you to death and treat you worse than a slave he never lets up on anybody not even his own relations”  and then and there leo sat down again and told his story—how he had slaved for the farmer and run away and become a professional circus performer  mart listened with interest his face growing paler as he proceeded  “you are right i have nothing to expect from him even though he was my mother’s own halfbrother”  “won’t you tell me your story” asked leo  “willingly if you care to listen to it”  and then mart told how he had been an orphan for ten years his father had been an actor and his mother a comicopera singer  “the hawkinses never had much to do with us after mother went on the stage” he said “that is how i lost track of my uncle”  then he told of his mother’s death in new orleans and how he had been cast out on the streets by an old woman with whom they boarded he had danced down in the french quarter and there porler had picked him up  “he promised me so many things that i went with him willingly” he said “but it was a great mistake”  the two talked matters over for a long while—until nearly midnight—and then leo made a proposition  “i am sure you will not find living with daniel hawkins agreeable” he said “so i am going to make you an offer if you wish to travel with the circus i will try to arrange it for you i think i can get you a place at eight or ten dollars a week to go up in the balloon with me”  “thank you i’d like that” replied mart keene     chapter xxxi—a fall from the clouds   the next day leo lost no time in interviewing adam lambert concerning mart  “he is clever and will in time make a good acrobat and balloonist” he said  the matter was talked over and that afternoon mart joined the “greatest show on earth” on trial he was to assist leo in the balloon larry greson having now to spend much of his time with professor ricardo who was worse in health  a week later found the circus in denver in the meantime nothing had been heard of porler but one night leo came face to face with him  the balloonist scowled and was about to speak but suddenly changed his mind and walked away  “you must be on guard against that man” said leo to mart  “i will be” was the reply  the ascension from the circus grounds in denver attracted great attention  when the time came for the balloon to go up leo and mart entered the basket  up and up went the great monster gayly decorated on every side  below hung several swinging bars and a rope ladder  mart began to perform on the ladder while the young gymnast leaped from one trapeze to another  it was a marvelous sight and the crowd went wild with enthusiasm  but suddenly when the balloon was well up over the buildings near by a cry of horror arose  a man was seen to lean out of a window not far away  he held a rifle in his hand and the weapon was pointed at the balloon  crack  the weapon spoke and the ball pierced the silken sides of the floating monster  leo heard the sound of the rifle and he at once felt that something was wrong  suddenly mart keene gave a cry of terror  “oh mr dunbar look out there is a man in one of the buildings who is aiming a gun at the balloon”  crack  the rifle spoke again and the people looking upward saw leo make a leap  the trapeze had been struck  leo had leaped to where hung his parachute  he caught it with his left hand  down he came the parachute in his grasp  the catch gave way and out shot the ribs of the parachute and the young gymnast’s headlong flight to earth was stayed  a cheer went up  “he is safe”  the crowd gathered around to where leo had reached the earth in the center of a field of grass  “he was struck”  “is he badly hurt”  the youth lay unconscious on the grass his face as pale as a sheet  a few thought him dead and the report that he had been killed quickly circulated  the police ran into the building in search of the rascal who had done the firing but could not find their man  taking advantage of the excitement porler for it was he had left the grounds as fast as possible  he knew that if caught the crowd might be incensed enough to lynch him on the spot  luckily two physicians were present and both hurried to leo’s side  it was found that he was suffering quite a little from his fall  an ambulance was summoned and the young gymnast was conveyed to a hospital  here he was given every attention and by the following morning he felt nearly as well as ever although his breast was still sore and had to be kept tightly bandaged  in the meanwhile the balloon had sailed away from the fair grounds with mart clinging to the ropes  the boy was terribly frightened over what had occurred  he became faint and felt for a minute that he must fall from his lofty perch  but he recovered and held fast and thus the balloon drifted far away  he imagined the man who had fired the shots was porler but was not certain  on and on went the balloon over the city and then across a wide stretch of farming land  finally it began to settle in a neighborhood full of brush and trees  mart looked out anxiously and it was with much satisfaction that he saw the balloon was about to fall in a cleared spot where no damage would come to it and from which he could easily escape  down and down came the monster until it touched the ground as lightly as would a drifting feather  the lad leaped away to escape the great mass of falling silk and ropes soon the balloon lay a flat mass where it had struck  mart wondered if it would be safe to leave the thing until some one came for it  usually greson attended to such matters but now he might have his hands full with leo dunbar  as mart thought of leo his eyes filled with tears  he thought a good deal of his champion  he was the first person in the world who had really befriended him  “oh i hope he isn’t seriously hurt” he murmured to himself  while he stood by the fallen balloon wondering what was best to do he heard the sound of wagon wheels  they came from a country road a few hundred feet to his right  “it must be greson or one of the others coming for the balloon” he said to himself  the wagon came to a stop and he ran forward to meet the newcomer that he might inquire about leo  then of a sudden his heart seemed to stop beating  the man approaching from the wagon was porler     chapter xxxii—mart a prisoner   mart was nearly dumfounded  it was so unexpected this meeting that he was almost too paralyzed to move  he gave a faint cry of alarm porler heard it and looked in his direction  “ah so there you are” he sang out “i thought i would find you somewhere in the vicinity”  he ran toward the lad  instinctively mart turned to flee  “stop” he cried and he made after the boy at a greater speed  mart did not answer him but ran the faster  but the boy was no match for the old balloonist who in his day had been a swift runner  he kept gaining on mart and seeing this the lad ran toward a clump of bushes  mart dived into the midst of these and thus managed to get out of his sight  “you can’t escape me” cried porler in a rage “you might as well stop right where you are”  mart made no reply but kept on  presently he came to a tall tree  this gave him an idea mart could climb like a monkey and up the tree he went with great speed  when porler reached the spot he was out of sight and the old balloonist went on  “oh how i hope he will go far enough away” said mart to himself  soon he could hear no more of porler  thinking him gone he cautiously descended the tree  barely had his feet touched the ground than he felt a rough hand on his shoulder  “i thought you were here” cried the old balloonist in his harsh tone “you can’t get away from me now mart keene”  “let me go” he panted “don’t you dare touch me”  “touch you well i guess that’s cool as if you didn’t belong to me”  “i don’t belong to you you haven’t the first claim on me”  “we’ll see about that didn’t i take you out of the street and feed and clothe you and——”  “made me work like a horse to pay for it” finished the boy “you have got more out of me than i ever cost you ten times over so there”  “you’ll come along with me—willingly or unwillingly” growled porler “give me your hand”  he tried to catch hold of mart he snatched his arm away  filled with rage he struck the lad a cruel blow full in the face  it staggered mart and he nearly went to the ground  then he picked mart up and put him over his shoulder  at once the boy began to scream for help  “shut up” growled porler  for reply mart screamed louder  then porler threw him down poured some chloroform he had in a bottle on his handkerchief and applied it to mart’s nose  the boy struggled vainly for a few minutes and then became limp in his arms  “ah that did the business” porler murmured to himself “glad i brought the chloroform along”  he took mart to his carriage and placed him inside covering him with several robes  when mart came to his senses he found himself in a little room the door was locked and the one window was nailed up tightly he was a close prisoner  the boy had been placed on a cot in the corner and now sat up and gazed around in bewilderment  “where am i” he thought  then the full realization of what had happened burst upon the boy and he gave way to tears  “that bad man what does he intend to do with me”  hour after hour went by and no one came to mart  there was a pitcher of water in the room and a loaf of bread both on a stand close at hand  he drank some of the water but could not eat  he knew it was night slowly the hours dragged by until morning  not long after this the door was unlocked and porler came into the room  “awake are you” he said “hope you slept well”  “you monster” mart cried “what are you going to do with me”  “i’ll tell you i am going to make you promise on your bended knees that you will travel with me as you used to do and obey all my commands”  “i’ll never promise anything like that” exclaimed mart recoiling with horror  “you will or else—” the old balloonist paused  “or else what”  “i will keep you here and starve you into submission”     chapter xxxiii—leo to the rescue   leo’s first care after leaving the hospital was to ask about mart  he was astonished to learn at the hotel at which the party was stopping that nothing had been seen of the lad since the balloon had left the exhibition grounds  greson had gone for the balloon late the day before  “found the balloon all right but didn’t see a single trace of the boy” said the assistant  “that is queer” mused leo “can it be that he tumbled down in some outoftheway place and was killed”  he at once learned the course the balloon had taken and then got a buggy and horse and went over every inch of the ground  a little later he found himself at the spot where the balloon had come down  he walked around in much perplexity  if mart had escaped injury where was he  “all this must be porler’s work” said the young gymnast to himself “i would just like to come across that man”  satisfied that nothing was to be gained by remaining near the woods leo started back to the road  in doing this he came across the bottle which had contained the chloroform porler had used  he picked up the bottle and smelled of what remained in it  “my gracious”  like a flash the truth burst upon him  “it’s that rascal’s work he fired on me and then came out here after mart he has abducted the boy”  as we know leo was partly right and partly wrong  the young gymnast realized that if he was to act he must do so without delay  it made him very angry to think of the young lad being in the old balloonist’s power  that he would illuse mart he felt certain  from where he had found the bottle leo traced porler’s footsteps to the carriage  the marks of the carriage wheels were still fresh and they ran straight into the city  on the pavements they were of course lost  leo was in a quandary  he told greson of what he had discovered and then both of them began a systematic search for mart  greson started from where the carriage had entered the city  the young gymnast went to the exhibition grounds and attempted to trace up the man who had fired the shots at the balloon  from one and another the young gymnast was able to trace up porler to a thirdrate boardinghouse on one of the side streets  he was about to enter the place when he saw a fellow named danny murphy who was porler’s assistant leaving in a great hurry  “perhaps he is going to join porler at some place where mart is being kept” said leo to himself “i’ll follow him”  and follow murphy he did  all unconscious of being watched porler’s tool walked half a dozen blocks until he came to the residence in which mart was kept a close prisoner he walked around to the rear through an alleyway  close behind him leo heard him give a peculiar knock on the door  a moment passed and murphy was admitted the back door was locked and bolted after him  when the door had been opened leo had caught a momentary glimpse of porler’s face  “that settles it” he thought “mart is kept a prisoner right here”  leo had armed himself and now he walked to one of the kitchen windows  he opened the blinds the window itself was locked but bringing out his pocketknife he shoved back the catch  another moment and the lower sash was raised and the young gymnast leaped into the house  he did not care if his enemies were present he was prepared to fight if need be  but as he surmised the lower floor of the residence was deserted  with cautious steps leo left the kitchen and walked toward the stairs leading to the next floor  as he did so he heard the murmur of voices from above  he went up and listened with strained ears  “mr porler starve me or not i will never do as you wish”  it was mart who was speaking  “and i say you will do so” growled porler  “that’s right” put in murphy “make the boy toe the mark”  “i will not only starve you” went on porler “but i will give you a taste of your old friend the strap”  “you will not dare to touch me” exclaimed the lad  “wait and see”  “my friend mr dunbar will have the law on you for it”  “dunbar will never help you again”  “i think he will”  the voice came from the doorway and the three in the room found themselves confronted by leo     chapter xxxiv—the end of porler   porler and murphy were taken completely by surprise when confronted by leo  on seeing the young gymnast mart gave a cry of joy  “oh thank heaven you have come”  “get into the corner boy” howled porler  “don’t you speak to him again” said leo sharply “he is no longer your prisoner”  “ain’t he we’ll soon see about that”  as porler spoke he advanced upon leo  but when the young gymnast brought his weapon up within range of the rascal’s head the latter quickly recoiled  “you see porler i am armed”  murphy who was completely dumfounded to see leo now came forward  “we are two to one young feller” he said warningly “yer better go slow”  “i know my own business” was leo’s quiet reply “mart”  “well”  “will you go down and summon help”  “but you are alone——”  “never mind get a policeman or somebody else i am going to have these rascals arrested”  “not much” howled porler  “let’s down him” yelled murphy  “back both of you”  the two men however ran forward dodging behind mart as they came on and closed in on him  it was an unequal fight  but leo fought well and the boy was not idle  mart caught up a chair and raising it over his head brought it down on porler’s back  “oh oh you have broken my back” yelled the old balloonist  scarcely had he spoken when leo tripped him up  but now murphy leaped on the young gymnast and the pair rolled over on the floor  he was in a high rage and he meant to do leo a serious injury if such a thing was possible  in the meanwhile porler arose and pushed mart from him  “help help” cried mart  he ran out of the room and into the next the window of which was not fastened and opening the window continued to cry out  then of a sudden he saw a sight that gladdened his heart  larry greson was in sight  he had followed up the trail from the other end  “hurry hurry” screamed mart  “mart” burst out greson  “come up and help mr dunbar”  “who is in there”  “porler and murphy”  greson ran up on the piazza of the house and at the same time mart flew below to let him in  “confound the luck” howled porler who had heard mart speaking to greson  “the neighborhood will be in alarm” added murphy  both men leaped to their feet  greson was mounting the stairs three steps at a time and close behind him came mart  the two rascals thought a crowd was advancing to capture them  dodging leo who gave each a heavy blow as he passed the two villains rushed out into the hallway  porler was too quick for greson but murphy was tripped up  before he could arise leo and his assistant had the fellow a prisoner  they bound him so that he could not escape  then they went after hank porler but he could not be found  he had dropped out of a rear window on to a shed and disappeared  in the meantime a policeman arrived  when he heard the particulars of the affair he willingly took murphy into custody and later on the man was sent to jail  steps were taken to attach porler’s balloons and other property but it was found he had sold all his things  “he knew he was taking big chances when he went into that underhanded work” laughed greson  “oh i trust i shall never see that man again” said mart with a shudder  strange to say the boy’s wish was gratified fearful of prosecution porler fled to south america and that was the last heard of him  leo and mart rejoined the circus at a place called wheatlands and their friends were heartily glad to see them back safe and sound  there was news for both professor ricardo was much better and on the week following was to return to work this would put leo back among the acrobats again and for this the young gymnast was not sorry  he did not forget to put in a good word for mart to professor ricardo and consequently the boy remained in his old place and larry greson was given a situation among the menagerie men something which suited him better than did ballooning     chapter xxxv—a cowardly attack   in the meantime it must not be supposed that hank griswold had forgotten his compact with nathan dobb  the man had been anxious to put his plot against leo into operation at once but providence willed otherwise griswold was taken down with rheumatism and for several months could scarcely walk  but now he was better and one day started west to earn the money the squire of hopsville had promised him  as has been related delbier the expert swimmer and leo had become warm friends one morning the performer called leo aside  “say leo have you any enemies besides that porler” he asked  “i don’t know but what i have” laughed the young gymnast  “don’t laugh i am serious”  “why what’s up”  “for the past two days i have noticed an uglylooking man hanging around watching you” went on delbier earnestly  “watching me”  “yes and if i’m not mistaken he follows you wherever you go”  “what kind of a looking man”  as well as he could delbier described the individual but leo was not thinking of hank griswold—indeed he hardly knew the man—and he shook his head  “you must imagine it delbier”  “i guess not better be on your guard”  “all right” and leo laughed  when in the country leo had grown tired of the quietness but now when every day brought fresh bustle and confusion he was glad enough to escape the crowd and go for a quiet walk  his course took him along a country road which presently followed the bank of a mountain stream  it was a clear stream and full of fish and leo much regretted not having brought along a line and hook  he wandered on and on until the town was left a good two miles behind  then he sat down on a rock overlooking the stream to rest  as he did so he fancied he saw somebody following him  the individual drew behind some bushes  leo at once thought of what delbier had said  he resolved to be on his guard and so kept his eyes open  but nearly half an hour went by and as no one appeared leo began to think he was mistaken  a little later the boy started across an open field not far from the brook  then from out of the bushes crawled a man it was hank griswold  cautiously he came behind leo  presently our hero soon stumbled across the opening to an old well  “hullo this is dangerous” he murmured “it ought to be closed”  a footstep sounded near at hand he turned and on the instant received a shove that hurled him backward into the opening  for the minute leo felt that his end must be at hand  down he went into the dark and deep well with the dirt and brush on top of him  had he fallen to the rocky bottom he would most certainly have been killed  but fortunately when less than ten feet had been passed his clothing caught on some projecting rocks  instantly he grasped the rocks with his hands  the dirt falling on him nearly choked him  he steadied himself with difficulty and managed to kick himself clear from what was above  the dirt and brush sliding past him he felt safer although his position was still an extremely perilous one  he looked up and saw the evil face of hank griswold peering down into the well  it was too dark for the villain to see the boy and the young gymnast remained perfectly quiet  griswold heard the dirt strike the bottom of the well with a loud sound  he laughed softly to himself  “done for that trip” he muttered to himself “good enough”  hank griswold waited for a few minutes and then apparently satisfied hurried off  as soon as he disappeared leo looked about for some means by which to get out of his present position  to an ordinary individual this would have been an impossible undertaking for the sides of the well were very slippery  leo’s gymnastic training now stood him in good stead  cautiously he made his way from rock to rock taking chances more than once that would have made many a boy shudder grow dizzy and fall  at last the top of the well was reached once more  griswold had disappeared but he resolved to follow the man’s trail if the thing could be done  “ought to have one of our indians along” he thought there were sixteen of the redmen traveling with the “greatest show on earth”  but the path through the brush was plain enough it led to the road which leo had originally pursued when coming out for a walk  when our hero reached the road he saw an old farmer driving along evidently the old man was just coming from town  “hold on sir i want to talk to you” cried leo  “what’s the matter” asked the farmer surveying our hero’s torn and muddy clothing in curiosity  “did you meet a man on his way to town—a man with a queer walk”  “i did”  “take me to that man and i’ll give you a five dollar bill”  the old farmer was greatly astonished  “who be you” he questioned cautiously  leo told him  the farmer at once agreed to run down hank griswold if it could be done  leo jumped into the wagon and off they went  the chase however was a useless one griswold had taken to a side road and could not be found  “but i’ll catch him some day” said leo to carl “and then i’ll make him tell why he attacked me”  “perhaps he was hired to do it” ventured the young magician  “that is what i think” returned leo with a grave shake of his head  carl was doing very well he had several new tricks some of which he thought would please the children one was called “milk or water” and was brought out the day after leo had the adventure just described  “i will now show you how easy it is to change water into milk” said the young magician as he mounted the platform in the circus ring “will some one kindly hand me a glass of water i have the milk here” and he took up a small pitcher and passed it around for inspection  the glass of water was brought and he placed it on the table and covered it with a handkerchief then he tapped the glass and also the pitcher  removing the handkerchief he held up the glass sure enough there was the white milk as plain as day taking up the pitcher carl turned it upside down to show it was empty  “now we’ll change them back” he said another tap and lo the glass was full of water and the milk was in the pitcher again  a burst of applause followed  this trick was simplicity itself the pitcher really had milk in it and the glass was full of water all the time  when carl covered the glass with a handkerchief he slipped into the water a bit of white cardboard which standing upright made the water look like milk  while the audience were inspecting the glass as he held it up he pressed over the top of the pitcher inside a circular card which exactly fitted the opening this enabled him to turn the pitcher over for a second without spilling any milk  to turn the milk in the glass to water again he had but to remove the card the card in the pitcher was also removed as the receptacle was handed around for inspection after the trick was done     chapter xxxvi—on the elevated tracks   ten days later the circus reached the great lakes and settled in chicago for a week  on the following day leo was strolling down state street when happening to glance up he saw hank griswold coming from a building with a large letter in his hand  as quick as a flash he made after the man  leo was almost up to griswold when the latter saw him coming and started up the street on a run  coming to a side street he turned up that thoroughfare and continued on his way for a dozen blocks or more  leo tried to keep him in sight but was unsuccessful and after a search lasting half an hour he mounted to the elevated road to take a train to jackson park  as he went up he did not imagine that hank griswold was watching him  there was a crowd at the station and this kept increasing as the train was late  leo stood close to the edge of the platform just in front and below him were the glistening tracks  with a rumble the train came in sight  when it was but a few yards away the young gymnast felt a sudden shove from behind  he lost his balance and fell from the platform directly in front of the oncoming locomotive  to the onlookers it seemed that the boy must surely be killed  he rolled fairly and squarely upon the railroad tracks and the oncoming locomotive was barely a dozen feet from him  the engineer who was preparing to stop jerked the lever to come to an instantaneous halt but it was of no avail  on and on rolled the heavy engine with its long train of cars  “the boy will be killed”  “oh oh isn’t that awful”  many turned away unable to endure the awful sight  but the crowd made one mistake  they did not know that leo as an acrobat was used to making lightninglike movements whenever necessary  his profession now stood him in good stead  as he came down he had no chance to use his feet  but his hands and arms were ready and like a flash he turned a handspring and swept out of the way just as the ponderous locomotive rolled past  the monster brushed his left leg but he was unharmed and in a second more had reached the platform on the opposite side of the street  although attacked so unexpectedly leo did not lose his presence of mind  “that was that rascal’s work” he muttered to himself  reasoning that the man would try to escape from the scene the young gymnast rushed down the stairs into the street  he was right for scarcely was the pavement touched than he beheld griswold on the opposite side walking along at a rapid gait  “stop”  griswold looked around in horror his intended victim was not dead in abject fear he took to his heels as though leo’s ghost was on his track  up one side street and down another dashed man and boy until coming to an avenue the man boarded a street car and was lost to view  “the villain” muttered leo as he slowed up to catch his breath “i must be on my guard in the future”  he hunted around and brushed up his clothes then as there seemed nothing else to do he walked to where he had left his friends  here he told his story to carl who listened in amazement  “he is certainly after your life” said carl “in the future you ought to go armed”  “i wonder if he can be hired by any one in hopsville” mused leo  “that remains to be seen”  “i’m going to capture him the next time we meet” concluded leo with a determined look in his outspoken face  mart also heard about the attack and came to leo full of fear  “oh leo do be careful in the future” he pleaded “what if that bad man should take your life”  two days passed and as the young gymnast neither saw nor heard of griswold he began again to feel a bit easier in mind  but one afternoon while walking in the vicinity of the lake leo’s attention was attracted to a small steam tug which was tying up at a wharf  “look look” he shouted to carl who was with him “it is griswold and broxton who was discharged from the circus for drunkenness is with him”  “shall i call a policeman”  “yes i’ll watch them”  carl hurried off ere he had taken a dozen steps griswold caught sight of leo and whispered something the young gymnast could not catch  both rascals were on the point of leaving the steam tug but now they changed their minds and ordered the captain to cut loose and move on  “stop” called out leo and ran to the edge of the wharf  “go to thunder” muttered broxton  “we’re not to be caught today” added hank griswold  in another second the steam tug was clear of the stringpiece of the wharf  leo hesitated not a moment but taking a flying leap landed on her forward deck with angry yells griswold and broxton rushed on him  “we’ve got him now” said the former “down the lake with you captain and be quick”  “stop the tug those men are criminals” said leo  the tug captain paid no attention he was in the pay of the other men  griswold had a stick in his hand and now he aimed a savage blow at leo’s head  the young gymnast warded it off as well as he was able but he was no match for both men and soon they had him down  “a rope” roared griswold and when it was brought he and broxton and one of the tug hands proceeded to bind leo’s hands and feet  this accomplished the young gymnast was thrown into a dark locker the door was shut and locked upon him and the tug proceeded on her way at full steam     chapter xxxvii—the capture of griswold   “what will you do with him”  it was broxton who asked the question  he and griswold with whom he had struck up an acquaintanceship by accident sat in the little cabin of the steam tug which was flying down lake michigan at her utmost speed  the rascally fellow referred of course to leo who still lay bound in the dark locker  “i’ve got a good mind to tie a weight to his neck and heave him overboard” growled griswold  “it won’t do to let him go free that’s certain he would have us both locked up at the first chance”  “certainly”  “who was with him on the wharf”  “i don’t know”  the two rascals talked the matter over for some time but could come to no conclusion regarding the young gymnast  they wished to get him out of the way but hardly dared to undertake such a highhanded proceeding before the captain and crew of the tug  “i have it” said griswold half an hour later “see that town over there”  “yes”  “let us tie up there i’ll go ashore and hire a close coach and drive it myself we can take him inside and——”  he did not finish but his halfdrunken companion understood  their victim should never get away from them alive  the tug captain was given orders and soon a landing was approached  after tying up hank griswold hurried ashore he procured a coach with difficulty and it was some time before he appeared on the box whip in hand  then the two men went to the locker intending to drag leo forth gag him and roll him up as though he were a bundle of clothes  “gone” burst from griswold’s lips  he spoke the truth the locker was empty  “how did he manage it” queried broxton in deep perplexity  griswold looked dumfounded for a moment then he grated his teeth in rage  “fools that we are” he shouted “to forget that he is a gymnast why he must have freed himself within a minute after we locked him in”  “by thunder that’s so but how did he get out of the locker”  “i don’t know”  “the door was locked wasn’t it”  “yes”  an examination followed but the two men could not solve the mystery connected with leo’s escape  we will let our reader into the secret  as griswold said the boy slipped from his bonds with ease  this done he lit a match he had in his pocket and began an examination of his cramped prison  the sides of the locker were solid but in the flooring a board was loose and he pulled it up  underneath was a small opening and into this he crawled the board was put in place again and finding a nail leo succeeded in fastening it  crawling around in the dark and wet the young gymnast soon came to an opening leading up near the engineroom of the tug  he came up and finding a sheltering nook proceeded to secrete himself  he could easily have dropped overboard and swum ashore but by so doing he would have lost track of the rascals he had determined to bring to justice  after leaving the locker griswold and broxton made an examination of the tug from end to end  several times they came close to where leo was lying and he fairly held his breath until they passed on  at last the two rascals gave up the hunt in disgust  “he has slipped us” said broxton “better return that coach and move on”  this was done and soon the steam tug was ten miles away  a landing was made that night at another place and the two evilminded men put up at the leading hotel  leo had followed them ashore and now he felt he had them just where he wanted them  he hurried to the nearest telegraph office and sent a message to carl to come on at once  this done he called on the chief of police and a long talk followed  without delay the party accompanied by two policemen hurried to the hotel at which the rascals were stopping they ascended the stairs and leo knocked on the proper door  “what’s wanted” came from hank griswold  “there’s a fire next door” said leo in an assumed voice “please dress and leave the hotel as soon as possible”  “a fire” came from broxton as he leaped out of bed  in three minutes the two men had their clothes on and then they threw open the door  “who—what—leo dunbar”  the men were dumfounded at the sight of the young gymnast carl and the police  “the game is up” cried leo “officers arrest them”  “you rat” cried griswold  he struck leo in the face and then tried to dash past the youth  he was successful and reached the stairs before the policemen could stop him  like a flash leo recovered and made after the man  as he reached the top of the stairs griswold struck the bottom steps  whizz leo took a flying leap and landed on the rascal’s shoulders  down went the fellow in a heap he gave a groan and then a yell of pain  “you have broken my leg” he screamed “oh my ribs are all caved in”  he spoke the truth in one particular—his left leg was broken and he was unable to make further resistance  in the meantime carl and the policeman had captured broxton and handcuffed him  a little later before the guests in the hotel could ascertain the cause of the disturbance the two prisoners were taken to jail  then barton reeve appeared on the scene  “i am satisfied griswold was hired to attack me” said leo  “can’t you get him to confess”  “he pretends it is all a mistake”  “let us both talk to him”  “oh wait i wonder if the police searched him” went on the young gymnast suddenly  “we can soon find out” rejoined barton reeve  they questioned the captain in charge yes griswold had been searched and his stuff quite a heap lay in a lump on a nearby desk  there was some money a knife several keys and a notebook leo began to search through the notebook he uttered a wild cry  “look here” he ejaculated  he had found an entry concerning the money griswold was to get from nathan dobb for his dastardly work  “come with me” he went on and led the way to hank griswold’s cell  at first they could not make the rascal talk at all  but after awhile griswold began to think he was in a terrible dilemma  “look here supposing i confess” he said “will you be easy on me”  “perhaps i will” replied leo “one thing is certain i won’t be easy if you don’t confess”  “i was coaxed into this job” growled the villain  “and who coaxed you to do it” asked leo quickly  “nathan dobb the squire at hopsville”  “why does he want to get leo out of the way” questioned barton reeve  “so as he can keep the thousands coming to the boy” was hank griswold’s reply which filled leo with astonishment and pleasure     chapter xxxviii—goodby to the circus boy   having said so much hank griswold made a complete confession only holding back the fact that he and nathan dobb had come together through his trying to rob the squire’s house  the confession was taken down in writing and then griswold signed it in the presence of several outside witnesses  by this time it was late in the evening but leo was too excited to sleep  “can’t we take the first train east” he asked of barton reeve “i am anxious to let squire dobb know what i think of him”  “i will see lambert and see if we can get off” replied the menagerie manager  they sought out the general manager and after putting the whole case to him got permission to leave the “greatest show on earth” for three days  there was a midnight train eastward and this they boarded  barton reeve had secured sleeping accommodations but leo was too excited to rest  the following noon found them in hopsville  from the railroad station they walked to nathan dobb’s house  “hullo there is daniel hawkins’ wagon standing in front” cried leo “he must be calling on the squire”  the servant girl ushered them in as they sat in the hall waiting for nathan dobb they heard a loud dispute in the office of the justice  hawkins and nathan dobb were having a quarrel about some money the latter was to pay the former for releasing leo  in the midst of the discussion leo walked in followed by barton reeve  both squire dobb and old hawkins were much astonished at the unexpected appearance  “by gum leo” cried daniel hawkins “you goodfernothin’ where did you come from”  nathan dobb turned slightly pale  “why—er—i didn’t look to see you so soon leo” he stammered  “i know it in fact you didn’t look to see me over again” retorted the young gymnast bitterly  “what—er—that is i don’t understand you leo”  “you soon will understand me squire dobb i have come back to show you up as a villain”  “by gum” it was all daniel hawkins could say it took away his breath to hear a boy talk like that to the principal man in hopsville  “you young rascal” began nathan dobb growing red in the face  “hold on there” put in barton reeve  “who are you”  “you know well enough i am here to help leo obtain his rights”  “what rights”  “to all the money you are trying to rob him of”  “me”  “exactly”  “i haven’t a cent belonging to him”  “we know better”  “hank griswold has been caught and has made a confession” put in leo “so your game is up nathan dobb i always thought there was something wrong about your doings concerning my parents’ estate and now i know it”  nathan dobb had risen to his feet the shot from leo told and he sank back in his chair  “griswold under arrest” he gasped  “yes and you will be soon too” added barton reeve  “by gum” came faintly from daniel hawkins  “i—i—it is all a mistake” stammered nathan dobb “i—er—never intended to defraud leo out of a cent”  “i will never believe that” replied our hero warmly  “get an officer” said barton reeve quietly  “no no don’t arrest me for the sake of my family have mercy” groaned nathan dobb breaking down utterly  “will you promise to restore every cent due leo”  “yes yes he shall have it all”  “i only want what is due me” said leo  “you shall have every cent—i swear it”  after this nathan dobb was easy to handle he told the whole story of the estate and how the money was invested  all the necessary papers were turned over to barton reeve to be put into the hands of the court  “a good day’s work” said reeve when he and leo left the squire’s house “you are now free and rich”  “i hardly know myself” replied leo and he told the plain truth  it was not long after this that leo came into possession of property which later on when times became better proved to be worth nearly fifteen thousand dollars  barton reeve was appointed his guardian until he should become of age the great friendship between the man and the boy so strangely begun was never broken  a few weeks after the exposure and after daniel hawkins had carried the news far and wide nathan dobb sold out his household effects and went west whatever became of him is not known  several years have passed  on his stony farm daniel hawkins worries out a miserable existence his wife is more of a tartar than ever and together they make one of the most wretched couples living in the hopsville district  mart keene is still with the “greatest show on earth” and is earning a good salary he has called once or twice upon the hawkinses but he has nothing in common with the mean farmer and his wife  carl ross is likewise still on the road and is getting a large salary he has married pretty natalie sparks and both are well and happy  leo has given up the circus profession and is now at college he is a diligent scholar and expects to become a doctor he has a score of friends who wish him well and who predict for him a brilliant future but no matter how successful he may be in years to come it is not likely that he will forget the stirring times when he was simply leo the circus boy                                   the end                                     ————  always ask for
