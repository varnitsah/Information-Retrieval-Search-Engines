angeles     introduction   a vindication of the press is one of defoes most characteristic pamphlets and for this reason as well as for its rarity deserves reprinting besides the new york public library copy here reproduced i know of but one copy which is in the indiana university library neither the bodleian nor the british museum has a copy  like many items in the defoe canon this tract must be assigned to him on the basis of internal evidence but this evidence though circumstantial is convincing wp trent included a vindication in his bibliography of defoe in the chel and later bibliographers of defoe have followed him in accepting it since the copy here reproduced was the one examined by professor trent the following passage from his ms notes is of interest       the tract was advertised for this day in the st james      evening post april 1922 1718 it is not included in the      chief lists of defoes writings but it has been sold as      his and the only copy i have seen one kindly loaned me by      dr je spingarn once belonged to some eighteenth century      owner who wrote defoes name upon it i was led by the      advertisement mentioned above to seek the pamphlet thinking      it might be defoes but i failed to secure a sight of it      until professor spingarn asked me whether in my opinion the      ascription to defoe was warranted and produced his copy  perhaps the most striking evidence for defoes authorship of a vindication is the extraordinary reference to his own natural parts and to the popularity of the trueborn englishman some seventeen years after that topical poem had appeared pp 29f defoe was justly proud of this verse satire one of his most successful works and referred to it many times in later writings it is hard to believe however that anyone but defoe would have praised it in such fulsome terms in 1718  the general homeliness and facility of the style together with characteristic phrases which occur in his other writings indicate defoes hand likewise homely similitudes and comparisons specific parallels with his known work and characteristic treatment of matter familiar in his other works all furnish evidence of his authorship of this pamphlet  just what motive caused defoe to write a vindication of the press is not clear unlike his earlier an essay on the regulation of the press 1704 a vindication does not seem to have been occasioned by a specific situation and in it defoe is not alone concerned with freedom of the press but writes on a more general and discursive level his opening paragraph states that the very great clamour against some late performances of authorship and the unprecedented criticisms introducd make such an essay as he writes absolutely necessary yet there is no clear indication of just what works occasion this necessity the ironic reference to mr dennis at the end of the first paragraph taken together with the praise of mr popes translation of homer and the allusion to the malicious and violent criticisms of a certain gentleman in its disfavour p 23 might suggest that defoe had in mind dennis remarks upon mr popes translation of homer but even the entire body of writings attacking popes homer would hardly seem sufficient to give point to this somewhat omnibus and unfocused essay  equally suggestive perhaps are defoes references to the bangorian controversy and to bishop hoadley pp 10 23 this controversy raged from 1717 to 1720 and produced a spate of pamphlets to which defoe contributed many of which were marked by heated argument and acrimony defoe with his liking for moderation no doubt intended to make an oblique criticism of the license of many of the bangorian tracts but these tracts are certainly not advanced as the prime occasion for a vindication  defoe points out in the first section of his essay how important is freedom of the press as the foundation of the valuable liberties of englishmen i have been unable to find any reference to a specific threat of regulation of the press at this time that might have occasioned a vindication nevertheless it is possible that sentiment for control of the press perhaps incited by the bangorian controversy was felt in 1718 and may have been a contributing motive to the composition of this tract whatever the immediate motives for writing it may have been the variety of its contents suggests that defoe saw an opportunity to turn a penny to express himself on a number of his pet subjects and to defend his own position as a professional writer  a vindication is made up of three clearly marked sections in the first the author vindicates the usefulness of writing in the second he discusses the usefulnessit would be more exact to say the harmfulnessof criticism in the third he expatiates upon the qualifications of authors one may admit at once the comparative worthlessness of the pamphlet as a contribution to criticism or critical theory defoes comments upon specific writers are thoroughly conventional and commonplace as may be seen from a glance at his remarks about milton chaucer spenser shakespeare and others on p 12  of more interest is his very high praise of dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has producd p l5 and his comment upon the critical detraction from which he suffered he compares pope interestingly enough with dryden remarking that pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poets translation of homer one may note that defoe avoids the shortcomings of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party he distributes his praise indiscriminately between whig and tory writers in short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the authors taste  of particular interest for students of defoe is the paragraph p 2l in which defoe defends the hackwriters who must write for subsistence one should not expect their writings which are necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be after comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality he claims in a halfironic tone for both authors and booksellers the liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without ignominy after all they must write and print to live such practice is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in exchangealley  this paragraph gains point when one remembers that defoe had served both whig and tory governments in 1718 as letters written to lord stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps dubious business of masquerading as a tory while actually in the service of the whig ministry to take the sting out of the more violent tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position in december of 1717 he had been identified as a writer for mists weekly journal the leading tory paper and was subjected to growing attacks in the whig press one can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist  it is no surprise to find the author of a vindication in discussing the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and natural parts above mere learning he instances the author of the trueborn englishman and shakespeare the former characterizd as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the latter having but a small share of literature the further example of the literary achievements of the fair sex who had of course no university education reminds one of defoes championship elsewhere of women the business of a writer is to please and inform and the general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than learning  also characteristic of defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an author of conversation the aliment of genius the life of all airy performances p32 likewise his digression upon education pp 34f his charge that people of quality in england all too often neglect their childrens education his remarks upon the advantages of travel and the need of training in the vernacular all will be familiar to readers of defoe  a vindication of the press is chiefly important for the corroboration of our knowledge of daniel defoe it presents nothing that is new but it gives further evidence of his pride in authorship of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist and of his belief in the importance of a free press many of his characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point of view although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments and reveal defoe as a wellinformed man of moderation and commonsense though certainly not as a profound critic in the catholicity of his tastes and interests defoe is far ahead of his puritan fellows and his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of the middleclasses for whom he wrote in the greater world of literature as professor trent remarks in his ms notes defoe rarely wrote a tract without introducing something worthy of attention and comment and the present pamphlet is no exception to the rule  i should like to thank dr henry c hutchins for his generosity in making available to me professor trents ms notes on a vindication and dr john robert moore for his kindness criticisms and suggestions   otho clinton williams san jose state college   vindication of the press  or an essay on the usefulness of writing on criticism and the  qualification of authors  wherein is shewn  that tis for the advantage of all governments to encourage writing otherwise a nation would never be secure from the attempts of its most secret enemies barbarous and prejudicd criticisms on writings are detected and criticism is justly stated with an examination into what geniuss and learning are necessary for an author in all manner of performances  london  printed for t warner at the blackboy in paternosterrow mdccxviii  price sixpence  illustration     a vindication of the press  or an essay on the usefulness of writing c  the very great clamour against some late performances or authorship and the unpresidented criticisms introducd render a treatise on the usefulness of writing in general so absolutely necessary that the author of this essay has not the least apprehensions of displeasure from the most inveterate but on the contrary doubts not an approbation even of the great mr dennis  for the usefulness of writing in the church i shall trace back to the annals of our saviour and his apostles had not writing been at that time in use what obscurity might we reasonably have expected the whole world would have labourd under at this day when notwithstanding the infidels possess such vast regions and religion in its purity shines but in a small quarter of the globe tis easyto imagine that without the newtestament every person of excellency in literature and compleat in hypocrisy either out of interest or other worldly views would have taken the liberty to deny the most sacred traditions and to have imposd upon the populace as many religions as they pleasd and that the ignorant multitude would easily acquiesce as they do in turkey and other distant parts of the world which deny the divinity of our saviour  what fatal errors schisms and concomitant evils would have been introducd must be apparent to all persons of the least penetration the quakers might at this time possibly have been our national church and our present happiness with regard to those considerations can no way be more lively and amply demonstrated than in taking a step at once from mr penns conventicle to the cathedral church of st pauls  the regularity and heavenly decorum of the latter give an awe and transport to the audience at the same time they ornament religion and the confusion of the former fully shews that as it only serves to amuse a crowd of ignorant wretches unless meerly with temporal views sectarists generally calculating religion for their interests so it gives a license to all manner of indecencies and the congregations usually resort thither with the same regard as a rake of the town would do to mother wybourns or any publick place of diversion  whether it be not natural to have expected a confusion in the church equal to that of the worst sectaries in the world had not the use of waiting been early attaind and practisd i appeal to the breast of every unprejudicd reader and if so how infinitely happy are we by the use of our sacred writings which clear up the cloud of ignorance and error and give a sanction to our religion besides the satisfaction we of the church of england have in this felicitous contemplation that our religion since the reformation strictly observd is the nearest that of our saviour and his apostles of any profession of faith upon earth  tis owing to writing that we enjoy the purest religion in the world and exclusive of it there would have been no possibility of transmitting down entirely those valuable maxims of solomon and the sufferings of the righteous job in the old testament which are so extensive to all parts and stations of life that as they are infinitely preferable to all other writings of the kind so they afford the greatest comfort and repose in the vicisitudes incident to humane nature  how far theology is improvd from those inestimable writings i need not to enlarge since it is highly conspicuous that they are the foundation of all divine literature and how ignorant and imperfect we should have been without them is no great difficulty to explain and who can sufficiently admire the psalter of david which fills the soul with rapture and gives an anticipation of sublimest joys  besides the advantages of sacred writings in the cause of religion tis chiefly owing to writing that we have our most valuable liberties preservd and tis observable that the liberty of the press is no where restraind but in roman catholick countries or kingdoms or states exercising an absolute power  in the kingdom of france writings relating to the church and state are prohibited upon the severest penalties and the consequences of those laws are very obvious to all persons of discernment here they serve to secure the subject in the utmost obscurity and as it were effect an entire ignorance whereby an exorbitant power is chearfully submitted to and a perfect obedience paid to tyranny and the ignorance and superstition of these people so powerfully prevail that the greatest oppressor is commonly the most entirely belovd which i take to be sufficiently ently illustrated in the late lewis the fourteenth whose arbitrary government was so far from diminishing the affections of his subjects that it hightend their esteem for their grand monarch  but of late the populace of france are not so perfectly enclouded with superstition and if a young author can pretend to divine i think it is easy to foresee that the papal power will in a very short space be considerably lessend if not in a great measure disregarded in that kingdom by the intestine jarrs and discords of their parties for religion and the desultory judgments of the most considerable prelates  the best support of an arbitrary power is undoubtedly ignorance and this cannot be better cultivated than by an absolute denial of printing the oppressions of the popularity cannot be thoroughly stated or liberty in general propagated without the use of the press in some measure and therefore the subjects must inevitably submit to such ordinances as an ambitious or ignorant monarch and his tyrannical council shall think fit to impose upon them how arbitrary soever and the hands of the patriots and men of eminence who should illuminate the age and open the eyes of the deluded people are thereby tied up and the infelicity of the populace so compleat that they are incapable of either seeing their approaching misery or having a redress of present grievances  in constantinople i think they have no such thing as printing allowd on any account whatsoever all their publick acts relating to the church and state are recorded in writing by expert amanuensiss so very strict are the divan and great council of the sultan in prohibiting the publication of all manner of writings they are very sensible had persons a common liberty of stating their own cases they might influence the publick so far that the yoke of tyranny must sink if not be rendred insupportable and this is regarded in all kingdoms and countries upon earth governd by a despotick power  to what i have already offerd in favour of the press there may be exceptions taken by some persons in the world and as it is my intentions to solve all objections that may be raisd to what i advance as i proceed i think i cannot too early make known that i am apprehensive the following observations may be made viz that a general license of the press is of such a fatal tendency that it causes uneasinesses in the state confusions in the church and is destructive sometimes even to liberty by putting the ruling powers upon making laws of severity on a detection of ill designs against the state otherwise never intended  in answer to which i shall give the following particulars in respect to uneasinesses in the state it may not be amiss to premise that it is esteemd by men of penetration no small wisdom in the present administration to bestow preferments on the brightest and most enterprising authors of the age but whether it be so much out of a regard to the service they are capable of to the state in their employs as to their writing for the government and to answer treasonable pamphlets poisond pens c i do not take upon me to determine i must confess where a faction prevails it gives a sensible monarch some pain to see disafection propagated by the press without any manner of restraint but then on the other hand such a ruler is thereby let into the secrets of the faction he may with facility penetrate into their deepest intrigues and be enabled to avert an impending storm upon approach of a rebellion he will be thoroughly sensible from what quarter his greatest danger is to be expected whereby it will be entirely his own fault if he be without a sufficient guard against it which he could not be apprizd of with any certainty without a general liberty of writing and tho slander must occasion a great deal of uneasiness to a crownd head the power of bestowing favours on friends only is no small satisfaction to the prince and a sufficient punishment to his enemies and it is my opinion that the grand sultan and other eastern potentates would be in a great deal less danger of deposing a practice very frequent of late if in some measure a liberty of writing was allowd for the eyes of the people would be open as well for as against their prince and their fearing a worse evil should succeed might make them easy under a present oppression  as for confusion in the church i look upon this to be the greatest objection that can be raised but then it must be allowd that without writing the reformation the glory of our religion could never have been effected and in respect to religious controversies tho i own they are seldom attended with good consequences yet i must beg leave to observe that as the age we now live in is more bright and shining in substantial literature than any preceding century so the generality of mankind are capable of judging with such an exactness as to avoid a bad not but i confess i think many of the persons concernd in the controversy lately on foot with relation to the bishop of bangors sermon preachd before his majesty deserve to be stigmatizd as well for their indecent heat as for the latitude taken with regard to the holy scriptures and for the last objection i never knew that writing was any ways destructive to liberty unless it was in a pamphlet entitled kingkilling no murder which tis said occasiond the death of oliver cromwel  these are the uses of writings in the church and the state with answers to such objections as may be made against them not to mention particularly in respect to the former the writings of the fathers and even of some heathen philosophers such as seneca c and besides the valuable performances of our most eminent divines in all ages as dr taylor bishop usher tillotson beveridge c and the whole duty of man c in our private devotions i now proceed to the uses in arts and sciences  how much posterity will be obligd to the great sir isaac newton and doctor flamstead for their mathematical writings is more easy to imagine than the improvements which may be made from thence theres a great deal of reason to believe that if a future age produces a successor to sir isaac at present i take it theres none in the world that not only the longitude at sea will be discoverd but the perpetual motion so many ages sought after found out  how much are the gentlemen of the law obligd to my lord littletons institutes and cokes commentaries thereupon writing in this profession is esteemd so essential that theres seldom a judge quits the stage of life without a voluminous performance as a legacy to the world and theres rarely a term without some production of the press the numbers of these writings are very much augmented by the various reports of cases from time to time made and these seem to be entirely necessary by way of precedent as a discreet and cautious justice will not take upon him to determine a cause of difficulty without the authority of a precedent  and in the practice of physick are not the present professors infinitely obliged to the discoveries and recipes of aristotle galen c how much the world is obligd to the declamations of tully cicero for oratory to the famous writings of milton for the foundation of divine poetry poetry in general is improvd from the writings of chaucer spencer and others dramatick entertainments perfected by shakespear our language and poetry refind by dryden the passions raisd by otway the inclination movd by cowley and the world diverted by hudibras not to mention the perfections of mr addison and several others of this age i leave to the determination of every impartial reader  tis by writing that arts and sciences are cultivated navigation and commerce by which alone wealth is attaind to the most distant parts of the world improvd geography compleated the languages customs and manners of foreign nations known and there is scarce any one mechanick calling of note or signification but treatises have been written upon to transmit the valuable observations of ingenious artificers to the latest posterity  there might be innumerable instances given of the advantages of writings in all cases but i shall satisfy my self with the particulars already advancd and proceed to such objections as i am apprehensive may be made relating to the writings last mentioned first it may be objected that the numerous writings tend more to confound the reader than to inform him to this i answer that it is impossible there can be many writings produced but there must be some valuable informations communicated easy to be collected by a judicious reader tho there may be a great deal superfluous and notwithstanding it is a considerable charge to purchase a useful library the greatest grievance yet we had better be at that expence than to have no books publishd and consequently no discoveries the same reason may be given where books in the law physick c are imperfect in some part and tend to the misleading persons for of two evils the old maxim is always chuse the least the only objection that i do not take upon me to defend is that against lewd and obscene poetry in general for sometimes the very great wit may make it excuseable which in my opinion will admit of but a slender apology in its defence  the use of writing is illustrated in the following lines which conclude my first head of this essay    by ancient writing knowledge is conveyd   of famous arts the best foundation laid   by these the cause of liberty remains   are nations freed from arbitrary chains   from errors still our church is purified   the state maintained with justice on its side  i now advance to my second particular criticism  the fatal criticism or damnation which the writings of some authors meet with thro their obscurity want of friends and interest in the world c is very discouraging to the productions of literature it is the greatest difficulty immaginable for an obscure person to establish a reputation in any sort of writing hes a long time in the same condition with sisyphus rolling a heavy stone against an aspiring mount which perpetually descends again it must be to his benign stars some lucky subject suiting the humour of the times more than the beauty of his performance which he will be obligd for his rise and in this age persons in general are so estrangd from bare merit that an author destitute of patronage will be equally unsuccessful to a person without interest at court and youll as rarely find the friendship of an orestes as the chastity of penelope when a man of fortune has no other task than to give out a stupid performance to be of his own composing and hes immediately respected as a celebrated writer and if a man has the good fortune to hit the capricious humour of the age after he has attained a reputation with the utmost difficulty hes sure to meet with the severest treatment from a herd of malicious and implacable scriblers  this was the case of the late mr dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has producd he was persecuted by envy with the utmost inveteracy for many years in succession and is the misfortune at this juncture of mr pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age from these considerations it is evident tho it seems a paradox that it is a reputation to be scandalizd as a person in all cases of this nature is allowd some merit when envy attacks him and the world might not be sensible of it in general without a publick encounter in criticism and many authors would be buried in oblivion were they not kept alive by clamours against their performances  the criticks in this age are arrivd to that consummate pitch of illnature that theyll by no means permit any person the favour to blunder but their mighty selves and are in all respects except the office of a critick in some measure ill writers i have known an unnatural brother of the quill causless condemn language in the writings of other persons when his own has really been the meanest to accuse others of inconsistency with the utmost vehemence when his own works have not been without their Æras and to find fault with every line in a poem when he has been wholly at a loss to correct or at least not capable of writing one single page of it  there are another sort of criticks which are equally illnaturd to these i have mentiond tho in all other respects vastly inferior to them they are such as no sooner hear of a performance composd by a juvenile author or one not hitherto known in the way of writing he has undertaken but immediately without reading a line give it a stamp of damnation not considering that the first performance of an author in any way of writing done carefully is oftentimes the best and if they had thoroughly perusd it they were no ways capable of judging of either the sense language or beauty of any one paragraph and what is still worse these ignorant slanderers of writings frequently take what other persons report for authority who know as little or perhaps are more ignorant than themselves so little regard have they to the reputation of an author  and sometimes youll find a pert bookseller give himself the airs of judging a performance so far as to condemn the correctness of what he knows nothing of these theres a pretender to authorship in the city who rules the young fry of biblioples about the royalexchange  but the booksellers in general tho they commonly judge of the goodness of writings by the greatness of the sale are very sensible that their greatest security in respect to the performance of any work is the qualification of the person that composes it the confidence they can repose in him his capacity industry and veracity and the authors reputation is so far concernd in a performance which he owns that the bookseller will sooner rely upon that than his own judgment  to descend still to a lower order of criticks youll find very few coffeehouses in this opulent city without an illiterate mechanick commenting upon the most material occurrences and judging the actions of the greatest councils in europe and rarely a victualing house but you meet with a tinker a cobler or a porter criticizing upon the speeches of majesty or the writings of the most celebrated men of the age  this is entirely owing to party and there is such a contagion diffuses it self thro the greatest part of the world at this time that it is impossible for a man to acquire a universal character in writing as it is inconsistent for him to engage in writings for both parties at one and the same time whatever he may do alternately without which such a character is not attainable and these contending parties carry things to that extremity that theyll by no means allow the least merit in the most perfect author who adheres to the opposite side his performances will be generally unheeded if not blasted and frequently damnd as if like coelus he were capable of producing nothing but monsters he shall be in all respects depressd and debasd at the same time an illiterate scribler an auspicious ideot of their own with whose nonsense they are never sated shall be extolld to the skies herein if a man has all the qualifications necessary in poetry as an elegance of style an excellency of wit and a nobleness of thought were master of the most surprizing turns fine similies and of universal learning yet he shall be despisd by the criticks and rangd amongst the damnd writers of the times  the question first askd is whether an author is a whig or a tory if he be a whig or that party which is in power his praise is resounded hes presently cried up for an excellent writer if not hes markd as a scoundrel a perpetual gloom hangs over his head if he was master of the sublime thoughts of addison the easy flowing numbers of pope the fine humour of garth the beautiful language of rowe the perfection of prior the dialogue of congreve and the pastoral of phillips he must nevertheless submit to a mean character if not expect the reputation of an illitterate  writings for the stage are of late so very much perverted by the violence of party that the finest performance without scandal cannot be supported shakespear and ben johnson were they now living would be wholly at a loss in the composure of a play suitable to the taste of the town without a promiscuous heap of scurrility to expose a party or what is more detestable perhaps a particular person no play will succeed and the most execrable language in a comedy producd at this time shall be more applauded than the most beautiful turns in a love for love such are the hardships a dramatickpoet has to struggle with that either obscenity party or scandal must be his theme and after he has performed his utmost in either of these ways without a powerful interest hell have more difficulty in the bringing his play upon the theatre than in the writing and sometimes never be able to accomplish it  these are the inconveniencies which writers for the stage labour under besides tis observable that an obsequious prolifick muse generally meets with a worse reception than a petulant inanimate author and when a poet has finished his labours so that he has brought his play upon the stage the best performance has oftentimes the worst success for which i need only instance mr congreves way of the world a comedy esteemd by most persons capable of judging no way inferior to any of his other performances  a choice of actors next to interest and popularity is the greatest advantage to a new play if a stagepoet has the misfortune not to have a sufficient influence over the managers of the theatres to make a nomination his performance must very much suffer and if he cannot entirely command his theatre and season for bringing it on it will be perfectly slaughterd and a certain theatre has lately acquird the name of a slaughterhouse but whether more for the stupidity of its poets than its actors i do not pretend to determine but certain it is that acting is the life of all dramatickperformances and tho an indifferent play may appear tolerable with good acting it is impossible a bad one can afford any entertainment when performd by an incompleat set of comedians  in respect to writings in general there is an unaccountable caprice in abundance of persons to condemn or commend a performance meerly by a name the names of some writers will effectually recommend without making an examination into the merit of the work and the names of other persons equally qualified for writing and perhaps of greater learning than the former shall be sufficient to damn it and all this is owing either to some lucky accident of writing apposite to the humour of the town wherein an agreeable season and a proper subject are chiefly to be regarded or to prejudice but most commonly the former  it is a misfortune to authors both in prose and verse who are reducd to a necessity of constant writing for a subsistence that the numerous performances publishd by them cannot possibly be so correct as they might be could more time be afforded in the composure by this means there is sometimes just room for criticism upon the best of their productions and these gentlemen notwithstanding it be never so contrary to their inclinations are entirely obligd to prostrate their pens to the town as ladies of pleasure do their bodies tho herein in respect to party it is to be observd that a bookseller and an author may very well be allowd occasionally to be of either party or at least that they should be permitted the liberty of writing and printing of either side for bread free from ignominy and as getting money is the chief business of the world so these measures cannot by any means be esteemd unjust or disreputable with regard to the several ways of accumulating wealth introducd in exchangealley and at the other end of the town  it is a common practice with some persons in the world either to prefix the name of a mecanas in the front of their performances or to obtain recommendatory lines from some person of excellency in writing as a protection against criticism and there is nothing more frequent than to see a mean performance especially if it be done by a man of figure with this guard  tis true the worst performances have the greatest occasion of these ramparts but then the person who takes upon him to recommend must have such an absolute authority and influence over the generality of mankind as to silence all objections or else it will have a contrary turn by promoting a criticism as well upon the author as upon himself for which reason it is very hazardous for a person in a middle station tho he have never so great a reputation in writing to engage in the recommendation of the writings of others  the severe treatment which the brightest men of the age have met with from the criticks is sufficient to deter all young gentlemen from entring the lists of writing and was not the world in general more goodnaturd and favourable to youthful performances than the criticks there would be no such thing as a succession of writings whereas by that means and his present majestys encouragement literature is in a flourishing condition and poetry seems to improve more at this time than it has done in any preceding reign except that of king charles ii when there was a rochester a sidley a buckingham c and setting aside party what the world may hope from a generous encouragement of polite writing i take to be very conspicuous from mr popes translation of homer notwithstanding the malicious and violent criticisms of a certain gentleman in its disfavour  in the religious controversy of late depending criticisms have been carried to that height that some persons have pretended to fix false grammer on one of the most celebrated writers perhaps at this time in europe but how justly i leave to the determination of those who have perused the bishops incomparable answer but admitting his lordship had permitted an irregularity of grammer to pass unobserd typo for unobservd he is not the first of his sacred character that has done it and small errors of this kind are easily looked over where the nominative case is at a distance from the verb or a performance is done in haste the case of the bishop against so many powerful adversaries besides it is apparent and well known that a certain person mr lessey now with the chevalier in the world who has a very great reputation in writing never regards the strict rules of grammer in any of his performances  it is a satisfaction to authors of tender date to see their superiors thus roughly handled by the criticks a young writer in divinity will not think his case desperate when the shining bangor has met with such malevolent treatment neither must a youthful poet be uneasy at a severe criticism when the great mr addison rowe and pope have been treated with the utmost scurrility  these men of eminence sitting easy with a load of calumny is a sufficient consolation to inferiors under the most despicable usage and there is this satisfactory reflection that perhaps the most perfect work that ever was composd if not so entirely correct but there may be some room for criticism by a man of consummate learning for there is nothing more common than to find a man if not wholly blind over opiniated in respect to his own performances and too exact in a scrutiny into the writings of others  the ill nature attending criticism i take to be greater now than in any age past a mans defects in writing shall not only be exposd but all the personal infamy heapd upon him that is possible his descent and education shall be scandalizd as if a fine performance was the worse for the authors parentage his good name villified a history of the transactions of his whole life and oftentimes a great deal more shall be written as if the were a candidate setting up in a burough for member of parliament not an airy or loose action shall be omitted and neither the sacred gown nor the greatest dignity shall be exempted but there is this consideration which sways the sensible part of mankind viz a man of excellency in writing his being generally a person of more vivacity than the common herd and consequently the more extraordinary actions in him are allowable yet nevertheless i think it consistent with prudence for an author when he has the good fortune to compose a piece which hes assurd will occasion envy and criticism to write his own life at the same time with it tho it be a little extravagant and the method is unusual to prevent an illnaturd doing thereof by the hand of another person  according to the old maxim get a reputation and lye a bed not to mention how many lye a bed before they can attain it according to the humorous turn of the late ingenious mr farqubar but theres at this time a greater necessity for a man to be wakeful when he has acquird a reputation than at any time before hell find abundantly more difficulty attend the securing than the attaining of the greatest reputation hell meet with envy from every quarter malice will pursue him in all his undertakings and if he makes any manner of defence he cannot commence it too soon tho it is not always prudential to shew an open resentment even to the utmost ill treatment  if a man be so considerable as to be thought worthy of criticism a luducrous reprimand is always preferable to a serious answer returning scurrility with comicsatyr will gaul an illnaturd adversary beyond any treatment whatsoever his spleen will encrease equal to any poison his rage keep within no bounds and at length his passion will not only destroy his own performance but himself likewise and this i take to be natural in our modern criticks  the business of these gentlemen is to set the ignorant part of mankind right in correcting the errors of pretending authors and exposing of impositions whereby who has learning and merit and who has not may be so apparent that the world may not misplace their favour but unless they do it with more impartiality temper and candour than of late they may with equal prospect of success endeavour to turn the current of the thames as to pervert the humour of this goodnaturd town  i presume to present them with these two verses    the learned criticks learn not to be civil   in spite and malice personate the devil  having now dispatchd the two first subjects of my essay viz the usefulness of writing and criticism i come to my last head the qualification of authors  i am not of the opinion of a great many persons in the world that a poet is entirely born such and that poetry is a particular gift of heaven not but i confess there is a great deal in natural genius which i shall mention hereafter  it is consistent with my reason that any man having a share of learning and acquainted with the methods of writing may by an assiduous application not only write good poetry but make a tollerable figure in any sort of writings whatsoever and herein i could give numerous instances of authors who have written all manner of ways with success neither can i acquiesce in the common notion that the person who begins most early in poetry always arrives to the greatest perfection for in my opinion it is a matter of no great difficulty for a person of any age before his vivacity is too much abated and fire exhausted to commence a poet the great mr dryden not beginning to write till he was above the age of 30 and i doubt not but a great many persons have lost themselves for want of putting their geniuss to the trial and making particular writings their particular studies  their is no practice more frequent than for an author to misapply his genius and there is nothing more common than for a man after numerous trials in almost all sorts of authorship to make that his favourite writing which he is least capable of performing and too frequently authors use their geniuss as parents do their children place them to such businesses as make the most considerable figure in the world without consulting their qualifications  there are many other faults equal to these as where authors through overmuch timerity or too great opinion of their own performances permit their writings to pass with egregious errors and i take it to be equally pernicious for a man to be too diffident of his own performances as it is to be presuming there are likewise some gentlemen who by a lazy disposition or through over much haste an impatience in dispatch to gain an early reputation commit blunders almost to their immediate ruin but many of these errors are commonly excusd in an author by a condescending printer who is obligd to take the errata upon himself  in prose a slight examination of a performance may suffice but in poetry it cannot be too often repeated and in this way of writing haste is attended with a fatal consequence to compose your lines in perfect harmony of easy flowing numbers fine flights and similies and at the same time retain a strong sense which make poetry substantially beautiful is a work of time and requires the most sedate perusals and though some persons think giving poetry the character of easy lines to be a disgrace it is rightly considered the greatest reputation and honour they can do it the utmost difficulty attending this easy writing and there are very few persons that can ever attain it  but to leave these general observations i proceed to my point in hand the qualification of authors though i shall first take notice that the business of every author is to please and inform his readers but how difficult it is to please through the prevalence of parties envy and prejudice needs no illustration and some persons in the world are so very perverse and obstinate that they will not be informd by a person they entertain no good opinion of for writing prose a man ought to have a tollerable foundation of learning at least to be master of the latin tongue to be a good historian and to have a perfect knowledge of the world and besides these qualifications in poetry as i have before observd a writer should be master of the most refind and beautiful language surprizing turns fine adapted similes a sublimity of thought and to be a person of universal learning though i have often observd both in prose and verse that some persons of strong genius well acquainted with the world and but of little learning have made a better figure in some kinds of writings than persons of the most consummate literature not blessd with natural genius and a knowledge of mankind  the preference of genius to learning is sufficiently demonstrated in the writings of the author of the true born english man a poem that has sold beyond the best performance of any ancient or modern poet of the greatest excellency and perhaps beyond any poetry ever printed in the english language this author is characterizd as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the immortal shakespear had but a small share of literature it is likewise worthy observation that some of our most entertaining comedies novels and romances have been written by the fair sex who cannot be supposd to have learning in any degree equal to gentlemen of a university education and in north britain where literature shines amongst the persons of middle station an ounce of natural parts speaking in a common way of comparison is esteemd of greater value than a pound of learning  a person of learning without genius and knowledge of the world is like an architects assistant whose only business is to draw the draught or model of a pile of building hes at a loss in the materials necessary for compleating the structure tho he can judge of its beauty when perfected and may be compared to a man that has the theory in any art or science but wants the practice  and a meer scholar is the most unacceptable companion upon earth he is rude in his manners unpolishd in his literature and generally illnaturd to the last degree hes company for a very few persons and pleasing to none his pride exalts him in selfopinion beyond all mankind and some of the sucking tribe of levi think the gown and cassock alone merit a respect due to the greatest personages and that the broad hat with the rose should be adord tho it covers a thick and brainless skull  but these are a few only there are great numbers of the clergy who deserve the utmost respect and are justly paid more than they desire and no person can have a greater regard for that sacred body than my self as i was not only intended for a clergyman but have several relations now in being of that venerable order tho i am obligd to take notice that the authors of the gown in general treat the world with greater insolence and incharity than any laypersons whatsoever  theres nothing more frequent than to find the writings of many of our modern divines not only stiff and harsh but full of rancour and to find an easy propensity and complaisance in the writings of the laity a gentleman without the gown commonly writes with a genteel respect to the world abundance of good temper and a condescension endearing when a brawny priest shall shew a great deal of illnature give indecent reflections and affrontive language and oftentimes be dogmatical in all his performances  whether this be owing more to pride than a want of an easy free and polite conversation i do not take upon me to determine but i believe it must be generally imputed to the former as it cannot be supposd that either of the universities are at any time without a polite converse tho i take leave to observe that there is a great deal of difference between a finishd oxonian and a sprightly senator  this is demonstrated in the speeches from time to time made in the senate and the synod the stile and composure of the one is no way to be compard to the other tho the sense be equally strong theres an elegancy and beauty of expression in the former not to be met with in the latter oratory no where to be exceeded and an affluence of words not to be met with in any other speeches whatsoever and i believe it must be generally allowd that there is a very great difference in the common conversation particularly in point of manners of the members of those august assemblies  a good conversation is the greatest advantage an author can possibly enjoy by a variety of converse a man is furnishd with a perpetual variety of hints and may acquire a greater knowledge on some subjects in the space of a few minutes than he can attain by study in a succession of weeks tho i must allow study to be the only foundation for writing twas owing to a good conversation that those entertaining papers the tatlers were publishd by sir richard steel the examiner carried on by mr oldsworth and tis impossible a perfect good comedy can be written by any person without a constant resort to the best conversation whereby alone a man will be master of the best thoughts  in short conversation is the aliment of the genius the life of all airy performances as learning is the soul the various humours of mankind upon all occasions afford the most agreeable subjects for all sorts of writings and i look upon any performance tho done by a person celebrated for writing without the use of conversation in some measure incompleat  if an author be enclind to write for reformation of manners let him repair to st pauls or westminsterabbey and observe the indecent behaviour of multitudes of persons who make those sacred places assignations of vice if you are enclind to lash the follies and vanities of the fair sex retire to the tea table and the theatre if your business be to compose a sermon or you are engagd in theological studies resort to childs coffeehouse in st pauls churchyard if you are desirous to depaint the cheat and the trickster i recommend ye to the royalexchange and the court end of the town and if you would write a poem in imitation of rochester you need only go to the hundreds of drury and youll be sufficiently furnishd with laudable themes  but converse at home falls infinitely short of conversation abroad and the advantages attending travelling are so very great that they are not to be expressd this finishes education in the most effectual manner and enables a man to speak and write on all occasions with a grace and perfection no other way to be attaind the travels of a young gentleman have not only the effect of transplation of vegetables in respect to the encrease of stature but also the consequence of the most beautiful pruning how much the gentlemen of scotland owe their capacities to travelling is very obvious there being no person of quality in that kingdom but expends the greatest part of his fortune in other countries to reap the benefit of it in personal accomplishments and a greater commendation than this to the scots is the bestowing the best of literature upon all manner of youth educated amongst them  whilst the men of quality here very often neglect giving their children the common and necessary learning and too frequently entrust their education with lazy ignorant and incogitant tutors not to mention the supineness of schoolmasters in general throughout england the northbritains labour in this particular indefatigably as they are very sensible that learning is the greatest honour of their country and the ancient britains come so near the scots that amongst the common persons in some parts of wales you may meet with a ploughman that speaks tollerable latin and a mason like the famous ben johnson with his horace and a trowel  the want of a generous education is an irretrieveable misfortune and the negligence of an inspector of the literature of youth ought to be unpardonable how many persons of distinction have cursd their aged parents for not bestowing on them a liberal education and how many of the commonalty have regretted the mispending of the precious time of youth a man arrivd to maturity has the mortification of observing an inferior in circumstances superior in literature and wants the satisfaction of giving a tollerable reason for any thing he says or does or in any respect to judge of the excellency of others and in my opinion a generous education with a bare subsistence only is to be preferrd to the largest patrimony and a want of learning  without education it is impossible to write or read any thing distinctly without a frequent turning of the dictionary no person can be compleat in the english language neither can he give words their proper accent and pronunciation or be any ways master of elocution and a man without learning though he appears tollerable in conversation which i have known some persons do by a constant enjoyment of good company and a strength of memory is like an empirick that takes things upon trust and whenever he comes to exercise the pen that the subject is uncommon and study is requird youll find him oftentimes not capable of writing one single line of senfe and scarcely one word of english and on the other hand i have known some persons who could talk latin very fluently who have usd phrases and sentences perpetually in that language in conversation vulgar and deficient in the mothertongue and who have written most egregious nonsense from whence it is evident that writing is the only test of literature  i have a little deviated from my subject in pursuing the rules and advantages of education which i take to be of that universal good tendency that they are acceptable in any performance whatsoever i shall offer nothing farther but conclude this essay with the following particulars that besides the qualifications already mentiond it is as necessary for a fine writer to be endued with modesty as for a beautiful lady that good sense is of equal consequence to an author as a good soil for the culture of the most noble plants that a person writing a great deal on various subjects should be as cautious in owning all his performances as in revealing the secrets of his most intimate friend and in respect to those gentlemen who have made no scruple to prostitute their names the following similie may be judgd well adapted    as musick soft by constant use is forcd   grows harsh and cloys becomes at length the worst   the harmony amidst confusion lost   so finest pens employd in writing still   lose strength and beauty as the folios fill   finis     william andrews clark memorial library university of california  the augustan reprint society  general editors
