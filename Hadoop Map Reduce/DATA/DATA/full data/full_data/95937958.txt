95937958	the  complete poetical works  of  samuel taylor coleridge  including  poems and versions of poems now published for the first time   edited  with textual and bibliographical notes  by  ernest hartley coleridge ma hon frsl   in two volumes  vol i poems   illustration   oxford at the clarendon press 1912     preface   the aim and purport of this edition of the poetical works of samuel taylor coleridge is to provide the general reader with an authoritative list of the poems and dramas hitherto published and at the same time to furnish the student with an exhaustive summary of various readings derived from published and unpublished sources viz 1 the successive editions issued by the author 2 holograph mss or 3 contemporary transcriptions occasion has been taken to include in the text and appendices a considerable number of poems fragments metrical experiments and first drafts of poems now published for the first time from mss in the british museum from coleridges notebooks and from mss in the possession of private collectors  the text of the poems and dramas follows that of the last edition of the poetical works published in the authors lifetimethe threevolume edition issued by pickering in the spring and summer of 1834  i have adopted the text of 1834 in preference to that of 1829 which was selected by james dykes campbell for his monumental edition of 1893 i should have deferred to his authority but for the existence of conclusive proof that here and there coleridge altered and emended the text of 1829 with a view to the forthcoming edition of 1834 in the preface to the new edition of 1852 the editors maintain that the threevolume edition of 1828 a mistake for 1829 was the last upon which coleridge was able to bestow personal care and attention while that of 1834 was arranged mainly if not entirely at the discretion of his latest editor h n coleridge this no doubt was perfectly true with regard to the choice and arrangement of the poems and the labour of seeing the three volumes through the press but the fact remains that the text of 1829 differs from that of 1834 and that coleridge himself and not his latest editor was responsible for that difference  i have in my possession the proof of the first page of the destiny of nations as it appeared in 1828 and 1829 line 5 ran thus the will the word the breath the living god this line is erased and line 5 of 1834 substituted to the will absolute the one the good and line 6 the i am the word the life the living god is added and in 1834 appeared for the first time moreover in the songs of the pixies lines 9 11 12 15 16 as printed in 1834 differ from the readings of 1829 and all previous editions again in christabel lines 6 7 as printed in 1834 differ from the versions of 1828 1829 and revert to the original reading of the mss and the first edition it is inconceivable that in coleridges lifetime and while his pen was still busy his nephew should have meddled with or remodelled the masters handiwork  the poems have been printed as far as possible in chronological order but when no ms is extant or when the ms authority is a first draft embodied in a notebook the exact date can only be arrived at by a balance of probabilities the present edition includes all poems and fragments published for the first time in 1893 many of these were excerpts from the notebooks collected transcribed and dated by myself some of the fragments vide post p 996 n 1 i have since discovered are not original compositions but were selected passages from elder poetsamongst them cartwrights lines entitled the second birth which are printed on p 362 of the text but for their insertion in the edition of 1893 for a few misreadings of the mss and for their approximate date i was mainly responsible  in preparing the textual and bibliographical notes which are now printed as footnotes to the poems i was constantly indebted for information and suggestions to the notes to the poems pp 561654 in the edition of 1893 i have taken nothing for granted but i have followed for the most part where dykes campbell led and if i differ from his conclusions or have been able to supply fresh information it is because fresh information based on fresh material was at my disposal  no apology is needed for publishing a collation of the text of coleridges poems with that of earlier editions or with the mss of first drafts and alternative versions the first to attempt anything of the kind was richard herne shepherd the learned and accurate editor of the poetical works in four volumes issued by basil montagu pickering in 1877 important variants are recorded by mr campbell in his notes to the edition of 1893 and in a posthumous volume edited by mr hale white in 1899 coleridges poems c the corrected parts of religious musings the mss of lewti the introduction to the dark ladié and other poems are reproduced in facsimile few poets have altered the text of their poems so often and so often for the better as coleridge he has been blamed for writing so little for deserting poetry for metaphysics and theology he has been upbraided for winning only to lose the prize of his high calling sir walter scott one of his kindlier censors rebukes him for the caprice and indolence with which he has thrown from him as if in mere wantonness those unfinished scraps of poetry which like the torso of antiquity defy the skill of his poetical brethren to complete them but whatever may be said for or against coleridge as an inventor of harmonies neither the fineness of his selfcriticism nor the laborious diligence which he expended on perfecting his inventions can be gainsaid his erasures and emendations are not only a lesson in the art of poetry not only a record of poetical growth and development but they discover and reveal the hidden springs the thoughts and passions of the artificer  but if this be true of a stanza a line a word here or there inserted as an afterthought is there use or sense in printing a number of trifling or apparently accidental variants might not a choice have been made and the jots and tittles ignored or suppressed  my plea is that it is difficult if not impossible to draw a line above which a variant is important and below which it is negligible that to use a word of the poets own coining his emendations are rarely if ever lightheartednesses and that if a collation of the printed text with mss is worth studying at all the one must be as decipherable as the other facsimiles are rare and costly productions and an exhaustive table of variants is the nearest approach to a substitute many i know are the shortcomings too many i fear are the errors in the footnotes to this volume but now for the first time the mss of coleridges poems which are known to be extant are in a manner reproduced and made available for study and research  six poems of some length are now printed and included in the text of the poems for the first time  the first easter holidays p 1 is unquestionably a schoolboy poem and was written some months before the author had completed his fifteenth year it tends to throw doubt on the alleged date of time real and imaginary  the secondan inscription for a seat c p 349 was first published in the morning post on october 21 1800 coleridges twentyeighth birthday it remains an open question whether it was written by coleridge or by wordsworth both were contributors to the morning post both wrote inscriptions both had a hand in making the seat neither claimed or republished the poem it favours or rather parodies the style and sentiments now of one and now of the other  the third the rash conjurer p 399 must have been read by h n coleridge who included the last seven lines the epilogue in the first volume of literary remains published in 1836 i presume that even as a fantasia the subject was regarded as too extravagant and it may be too coarsely worded for publication it was no doubt in the first instance a metrical experiment but it is to be interpreted allegorically the rash conjurer the âme damnée is the adept in the black magic of metaphysics but for that he might have been like his brothers a devonshire christian  the fourth the madman and the lethargist p 414 is an expansion of an epigram in the greek anthology it is possible that it was written in germany in 1799 and is contemporary with the epigrams published in the morning post in 1802 for the greek original is quoted by lessing in a critical excursus on the nature of an epigram  the fifth faith hope and charity p 427 was translated from the italian of guarini at calne in 1815  of the sixth the delinquent travellers p 443 i know nothing save that the ms a first copy is in coleridges handwriting it was probably written for and may have been published in a newspaper or periodical it was certainly written at highgate  of the epigrams and jeux desprit eight are now published for the first time and of the fragments from various sources twentyseven have been added to those published in 1893  of the first drafts and alternative versions of wellknown poems thirteen are now printed for the first time two versions of the eolian harp preserved in the library of rugby school and the dramatic fragment entitled the triumph of loyalty are of especial interest and importance  an exact reproduction of the text of the ancyent marinere as printed in an early copy of the lyrical ballads of 1798 which belonged to s t coleridge and a collation of the text of the introduction to the tale of the dark ladié as published in the morning post dec 21 1799 with two mss preserved in the british museum are included in appendix no i  the text of the allegoric vision has been collated with the original ms and with the texts of 1817 and 1829  a section has been devoted to metrical experiments eleven out of thirteen are now published for the first time a few critical notes by professor saintsbury are with his kind permission appended to the text  numerous poems and fragments of poems first saw the light in 1893 and now again in 1912 a second batch of newlydiscovered forgotten or purposely omitted mss has been collected for publication it may reasonably be asked if the tale is told or if any mss have been retained for publication at a future date i cannot answer for fresh discoveries of poems already published in newspapers and periodicals or of mss in private collections but i can vouch for a final issue of all poems and fragments of poems included in the collection of notebooks and unassorted mss which belonged to coleridge at his death and were bequeathed by him to his literary executor joseph henry green nothing remains which if published in days to come could leave the present issue incomplete  a bibliography of the successive editions of poems and dramas published by coleridge himself and of the principal collected and selected editions which have been published since 1834 follows the appendices to this volume the actual record is long and intricate but the history of the gradual accretions may be summed up in a few sentences the fall of robespierre was published in 1795 a first edition entitled poems on various subjects was published in 1796 second and third editions with additions and subtractions followed in 1797 and 1803 two poems the rime of the ancyent marinere and the nightingale a conversation poem and two extracts from an unpublished drama osorio were included in the lyrical ballads of 1798 a quarto pamphlet containing three poems fears in

described as a collection of poems included the contents of the editions of 1797 and 1803 the poems published in the lyrical ballads of 1798 1800 and the quarto pamphlet of 1798 but excluded the contents of the first edition except the eolian harp christabel kubla khan and the pains of sleep the first collected edition of the poetical works which included a selection of the poems published in

amended text and the addition of the improvisatore and the garden of boccaccio followed in 1829  finally in 1834 there was a reissue in three volumes of the contents of 1829 with numerous additional poems then published or collected for the first time the first volume contained twentysix juvenilia printed from letters and ms copybooks which had been preserved by the poets family and the second volume some forty miscellaneous poems extracted from the notebooks or reprinted from newspapers the most important additions were alice du clos then first published from ms the knights tomb and the epitaph love hope and patience in education which had appeared in the keepsake of 1830 was printed on the last page of the third volume  after coleridges death the first attempt to gather up the fragments of his poetry was made by his latest editor h n coleridge in 1836 the first volume of literary remains contains the first reprint of the fall of robespierre some thirtysix poems collected from the watchman the morning post c and a selection of fragments then first printed from a ms notebook now known as the gutch memorandum book  h n coleridge died in 1843 and in 1844 his widow

first time included in the text in 1850 mrs h n coleridge included in the third volume of the essays on his own times six poems and numerous epigrams and jeux desprit which had appeared in the morning post and courier this was the first reprint of the epigrams as a whole a new edition of the poems which she had prepared in the last year of her life was published immediately after her death may 1852 by edward moxon it was based on the onevolume edition of 1844 with unimportant omissions and additions only one poem the hymn was published for the first time from ms  in the same year 1852 the dramatic works not including the fall of robespierre edited by derwent coleridge were published in a separate volume  in 1863 and 1870 the new edition of 1852 was reissued by derwent coleridge with an appendix containing thirteen poems collected for the first time in 1863 the reissue of 1870 contained a reprint of the first edition of the ancient mariner  the first edition of the poetical works

walker from a pencil sketch circ 1818 by c r leslie ra in the possession of the editor an engraving of the sketch by henry meyer is dated april 1819  the vignette on the titlepage is taken from the impression of a seal stamped on the flyleaf of one of coleridges notebooks  i desire to express my thanks to my kinsman lord coleridge for opportunity kindly afforded me of collating the text of the fragments first published in 1893 with the original mss in his possession and of making further extracts to mr gordon wordsworth for permitting me to print a first draft of the poem addressed to his ancestor on the growth of an individual mind and to miss arnold of fox how for a copy of the first draft of the lines on revisiting the seashore  i have also to acknowledge the kindness and courtesy of the authorities of rugby school who permitted me to inspect and to make use of an annotated copy of coleridges translation of schillers piccolomini and to publish first drafts of the eolian harp and other poems which had formerly belonged to joseph cottle and were presented by mr shadworth hodgson to the school library  i am indebted to my friend mr thomas hutchinson for valuable information with regard to the authorship of some of the fragments and for advice and assistance in settling the text of the metrical experiments and other points of difficulty  i have acknowledged in a prefatory note to the epigrams my obligation to dr hermann georg fiedler taylorian professor of the german language and literature at oxford in respect of his verifications of the german originals of many of the epigrams published by coleridge in the morning post and elsewhere  lastly i wish to thank mr h s milford for the invaluable assistance which he afforded me in revising my collation of the songs of the pixies and the introduction to the tale of the dark ladié and some of the earlier poems and the reader of the oxford university press for numerous hints and suggestions and for the infinite care

over the house of commons from the opposition to the ministry he received a pension of £1200 a year charged on the kings privy purse when he had completed his labours it was then a question what recompense his service deserved mr burke wanting a present supply of money it was thought that a pension of £2000 per annum for forty years certain would sell for eighteen years purchase and bring him of course £36000 but this pension must by the very unfortunate act of which mr burke was himself the author have come before parliament instead of this mr pitt suggested the idea of a pension of £2000 a year for three lives to be charged on the kings revenue of the west india 412 per cents this was tried at the market but it was found that it would not produce the £36000 which were wanted in consequence of this a pension of £2500 per annum for three lives on the 412 west india fund the lives to be nominated by mr burke that he may accommodate the purchasers is finally granted to this

flash of light repeatedly dart from a marigold surprised at such an uncommon appearance he resolved to examine it with attention and to be assured it was no deception of the eye he placed a man near him with orders to make a signal at the moment when he observed the light they both saw it constantly at the same moment  the light was most brilliant on marigolds of an orange or flame colour but scarcely visible on pale ones the flash was frequently seen on the same flower two or three times in quick succession but more commonly at intervals of several minutes and when several flowers in the same place emitted their light together it could be observed at a considerable distance  this phenomenon was remarked in the months of july and august at sunset and for half an hour when the atmosphere was clear but after a rainy day or when the air was loaded with vapours nothing of it was seen  the following flowers emitted flashes more or less vivid in this order    1 the marigold galendula sic officinalis   2 monkshood tropaelum sic majus   3 the orangelily lilium bulbiferum   4 the indian pink tagetes patula et erecta  from the rapidity of the flash and other circumstances it

poem was written in the year 1797 at stowey in the county of somerset the second part after my return from germany in the year 1800 at keswick cumberland it is probable that if the poem had been finished at either of the former periods or             5 if even the first and second part had been published in the year 1800 the impression of its originality would have been much greater than i dare at present expect but for this i have only my own indolence to blame the dates are mentioned for the exclusive purpose of precluding charges of          10 plagiarism or servile imitation from myself for there is amongst us a set of critics who seem to hold that every possible thought and image is traditional who have no notion that there are such things as fountains in the world small as well as great and who would therefore charitably            15 derive every rill they behold flowing from a perforation made in some other mans tank i am confident however that as far as the present poem is concerned the celebrated poets2151 whose writings i might be suspected of having imitated either in particular passages or in the tone and           20 the spirit of the whole would be among the first to vindicate me from the charge and who on any striking coincidence would permit me to address them in this doggerel version of two monkish latin hexameters2152    tis mine and it is likewise yours                                 25   but an if this will not do   let it be mine good friend for i   am the poorer of the two  i have only to add that the metre of christabel is not properly speaking irregular though it may seem so from its          30 being founded on a new principle namely that of counting in each line the accents not the syllables though the latter may vary from seven to twelve yet in each line the accents will be found to be only four nevertheless this occasional variation in number of syllables is not introduced wantonly          35 or for the mere ends of convenience but in correspondence with some transition in the nature of the imagery or passion   part i    tis the middle of night by the castle clock   and the owls have awakened the crowing

castle gate   she had dreams all yesternight   of her own betrothéd knight   and she in the midnight wood will pray   for the weal of her lover thats far away                          30    she stole along she nothing spoke   the sighs she heaved were soft and low   and naught was green upon the oak   but moss and rarest misletoe   she kneels beneath the huge oak tree                               35   and in silence prayeth she    the lady sprang up suddenly   the lovely lady christabel   it moaned as near as near can be   but what it is she cannot tell                                   40

                 45   to move away the ringlet curl   from the lovely ladys cheek   there is not wind enough to twirl   the one red leaf the last of its clan   that dances as often as dance it can

arms beneath her cloak                              55   and stole to the other side of the oak       what sees she there    there she sees a damsel bright   drest in a silken robe of white   that shadowy in the moonlight shone                                60   the neck that made that white robe wan   her stately neck and arms were bare   her blueveined feet unsandald were   and wildly glittered here and there   the gems entangled in her hair                                     65   i guess twas frightful there to see   a lady so richly clad as she   beautiful exceedingly    mary

scarce can speak for weariness   stretch forth thy hand and have no fear                           75   said christabel how camest thou here   and the lady whose voice was faint and sweet   did thus pursue her answer meet    my sire is of a noble line   and my name is geraldine                                           80   five warriors seized me yestermorn   me even me a maid forlorn   they choked my cries with force and fright   and tied me on a palfrey white   the palfrey was as fleet as wind                                   85   and they rode furiously behind   they spurred amain their steeds were white   and once we crossed the shade of night   as sure as heaven shall rescue me   i have no thought what men they be                                 90   nor do i know how long it is   for i have lain entranced i wis   since one the tallest of the five   took me from the palfreys back   a weary woman scarce alive                                        95   some muttered words his comrades spoke   ha placed me underneath this oak   he swore they would return with haste   whither they went i cannot tell   i thought i heard some minutes past                              100   sounds as of a castle bell   stretch forth thy hand thus ended she   and help a wretched maid to flee    then christabel stretched forth her hand   and comforted fair geraldine                                      105   o well bright dame may you command   the service of sir leoline   and gladly our stout chivalry   will he send forth and friends withal   to guide and guard you safe and free                               110   home to your noble fathers hall    she rose and forth with steps they passed   that strove to be and were not fast   her gracious stars the lady blest   and thus spake on sweet christabel                                115   all our household are at rest   the hall as silent as the cell   sir leoline is weak in health   and may not well awakened be   but we will move as if in stealth                                 120   and i beseech your courtesy   this night to share your couch with me    they crossed the moat and christabel   took the key that fitted well   a little door she opened straight                                 125   all in the middle of the gate   the gate that was ironed within and without   where an army in battle array had marched out   the lady sank belike through pain   and christabel with might and main                                 130   lifted her up a weary weight   over the threshold of the gate   then the lady rose again   and moved as she were not in pain    so free from danger free from fear                               135   they crossed the court right glad they were   and christabel devoutly cried   to the lady by her side   praise we the virgin all divine   who hath rescued thee from thy distress                           140   alas alas said geraldine   i cannot speak for weariness   so free from danger free from fear   they crossed the court right glad they were    outside her kennel the mastiff old                                145   lay fast asleep in moonshine cold   the mastiff old did not awake   yet she an angry moan did make   and what can ail the mastiff bitch   never till now she uttered yell                                    150   beneath the eye of christabel   perhaps it is the owlets scritch   for what can ail the mastiff bitch    they passed the hall that echoes still   pass as lightly as you will                                       155   the brands were flat the brands were dying   amid their own white ashes lying   but when the lady passed there came   a tongue of light a fit of flame   and christabel saw the ladys eye                                 160   and nothing else saw she thereby   save the boss of the shield of sir leoline tall   which hung in a murky old niche in the wall   o softly tread said christabel   my father seldom sleepeth well                                    165    sweet christabel her feet doth bare   and jealous of the listening air   they steal their way from stair to stair   now in glimmer and now in gloom   and now they pass the barons room                                170   as still as death with stifled breath   and now have reached her chamber door   and now doth geraldine press down   the rushes of the chamber floor    the moon shines dim in the open air                               175   and not a moonbeam enters here   but they without its light can see   the chamber carved so curiously   carved with figures strange and sweet   all made out of the carvers brain                                180   for a ladys chamber meet   the lamp with twofold silver chain   is fastened to an angels feet    the silver lamp burns dead and dim   but christabel the lamp will trim                                 185   she trimmed the lamp and made it bright   and left it swinging to and fro   while geraldine in wretched plight   sank down upon the floor below    o weary lady geraldine                                           190   i pray you drink this cordial wine   it is a wine of virtuous powers   my mother made it of wild flowers    and will your mother pity me   who am a maiden most forlorn                                      195   christabel answeredwoe is me   she died the hour that i was born   i have heard the greyhaired friar tell   how on her deathbed she did say   that she should hear the castlebell                               200   strike twelve upon my weddingday   o mother dear that thou wert here   i would said geraldine she were    but soon with altered voice said she   off wandering mother peak and pine                             205   i have power to bid thee flee   alas what ails poor geraldine   why stares she with unsettled eye   can she the bodiless dead espy   and why with hollow voice cries she                               210   off woman off this hour is mine   though thou her guardian spirit be   off woman off tis given to me    then christabel knelt by the ladys side   and raised to heaven her eyes so blue                            215   alas said she this ghastly ride   dear lady it hath wildered you   the lady wiped her moist cold brow   and faintly said tis over now    again the wildflower wine she drank                              220   her fair large eyes gan glitter bright   and from the floor whereon she sank   the lofty lady stood upright   she was most beautiful to see   like a lady of a far countrée                                     225    and thus the lofty lady spake   all they who live in the upper sky   do love you holy christabel   and you love them and for their sake   and for the good which me befel                                   230   even i in my degree will try   fair maiden to requite you well   but now unrobe yourself for i   must pray ere yet in bed i lie    quoth christabel so let it be                                    235   and as the lady bade did she   her gentle limbs did she undress   and lay down in her loveliness    but through her brain of weal and woe   so many thoughts moved to and fro                                 240   that vain it were her lids to close   so halfway from the bed she rose   and on her elbow did recline   to look at the lady geraldine    beneath the lamp the lady bowed                                   245   and slowly rolled her eyes around   then drawing in her breath aloud   like one that shuddered she unbound   the cincture from beneath her breast   her silken robe and inner vest                                   250   dropt to her feet and full in view   behold her bosom and half her side   a sight to dream of not to tell   o shield her shield sweet christabel    yet geraldine nor speaks nor stirs                                255   ah what a stricken look was hers   deep from within she seems halfway   to lift some weight with sick assay   and eyes the maid and seeks delay   then suddenly as one defied                                      260   collects herself in scorn and pride   and lay down by the maidens side   and in her arms the maid she took             ah weladay   and with low voice and doleful look                                265   these words did say   in the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell   which is lord of thy utterance christabel   thou knowest tonight and wilt know tomorrow   this mark of my shame this seal of my sorrow                     270         but vainly thou warrest           for this is alone in         thy power to declare           that in the dim forest         thou heardst a low moaning                                 275   and foundst a bright lady surpassingly fair   and didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity   to shield her and shelter her from the damp air   the conclusion to part i    it was a lovely sight to see   the lady christabel when she                                      280   was praying at the old oak tree       amid the jaggéd shadows       of mossy leafless boughs       kneeling in the moonlight       to make her gentle vows                                       285   her slender palms together prest   heaving sometimes on her breast   her face resigned to bliss or bale   her face oh call it fair not pale   and both blue eyes more bright than clear                         290   each about to have a tear    with open eyes ah woe is me   asleep and dreaming fearfully   fearfully dreaming yet i wis   dreaming that alone which is                                    295   o sorrow and shame can this be she   the lady who knelt at the old oak tree   and lo the worker of these harms   that holds the maiden in her arms   seems to slumber still and mild                                   300   as a mother with her child    a star hath set a star hath risen   o geraldine since arms of thine   have been the lovely ladys prison   o geraldine one hour was thine                                  305   thoust had thy will by tairn and rill   the nightbirds all that hour were still   but now they are jubilant anew   from cliff and tower tuwhoo tuwhoo   tuwhoo tuwhoo from wood and fell                            310    and see the lady christabel   gathers herself from out her trance   her limbs relax her countenance   grows sad and soft the smooth thin lids   close oer her eyes and tears she sheds                         315   large tears that leave the lashes bright   and oft the while she seems to smile   as infants at a sudden light    yea she doth smile and she doth weep   like a youthful hermitess                                         320   beauteous in a wilderness   who praying always prays in sleep   and if she move unquietly   perchance tis but the blood so free   comes back and tingles in her feet                                325   no doubt she hath a vision sweet   what if her guardian spirit twere   what if she knew her mother near   but this she knows in joys and woes   that saints will aid if men will call                             330   for the blue sky bends over all  1797   part ii    each matin bell the baron saith   knells us back to a world of death   these words sir leoline first said   when he rose and found his lady dead                              335   these words sir leoline will say   many a morn to his dying day    and hence the custom and law began   that still at dawn the sacristan   who duly pulls the heavy bell                                     340   five and forty beads must tell   between each strokea warning knell   which not a soul can choose but hear   from bratha head to wyndermere    saith bracy the bard so let it knell                             345   and let the drowsy sacristan   still count as slowly as he can   there is no lack of such i ween   as well fill up the space between   in langdale pike and witchs lair                                 350   and dungeonghyll so foully rent   with ropes of rock and bells of air   three sinful sextons ghosts are pent   who all give back one after tother   the deathnote to their living brother                            355   and oft too by the knell offended   just as their one two three is ended   the devil mocks the doleful tale   with a merry peal from borodale    the air is still through mist and cloud                           360   that merry peal comes ringing loud   and geraldine shakes off her dread   and rises lightly from the bed   puts on her silken vestments white   and tricks her hair in lovely plight                              365   and nothing doubting of her spell   awakens the lady christabel   sleep you sweet lady christabel   i trust that you have rested well    and christabel awoke and spied                                     370   the same who lay down by her side   o rather say the same whom she   raised up beneath the old oak tree   nay fairer yet and yet more fair   for she belike hath drunken deep                                   375   of all the blessedness of sleep   and while she spake her looks her air   such gentle thankfulness declare   that so it seemed her girded vests   grew tight beneath her heaving breasts                            380   sure i have sinnd said christabel   now heaven be praised if all be well   and in low faltering tones yet sweet   did she the lofty lady greet   with such perplexity of mind                                       385   as dreams too lively leave behind    so quickly she rose and quickly arrayed   her maiden limbs and having prayed   that he who on the cross did groan   might wash away her sins unknown                                  390   she forthwith led fair geraldine   to meet her sire sir leoline    the lovely maid and the lady tall   are pacing both into the hall   and pacing on through page and groom                              395   enter the barons presenceroom    the baron rose and while he prest   his gentle daughter to his breast   with cheerful wonder in his eyes   the lady geraldine espies                                         400   and gave such welcome to the same   as might beseem so bright a dame    but when he heard the ladys tale   and when she told her fathers name   why waxed sir leoline so pale                                     405   murmuring oer the name again   lord roland de vaux of tryermaine   alas they had been friends in youth   but whispering tongues can poison truth   and constancy lives in realms above                               410   and life is thorny and youth is vain   and to be wroth with one we love   doth work like madness in the brain   and thus it chanced as i divine   with roland and sir leoline                                       415   each spake words of high disdain   and insult to his hearts best brother   they partedneer to meet again   but never either found another   to free the hollow heart from paining

proclaim it far and wide   with trump and solemn heraldry                                    435   that they who thus had wronged the dame   were base as spotted infamy   and if they dare deny the

tears were on his face   and fondly in his arms he took   fair geraldine who met the embrace   prolonging it with joyous look                                    450   which when she viewed a vision fell   upon the soul of christabel   the vision of fear the touch and pain   she shrunk and shuddered and saw again   ah woe is me was it for thee                                   455   thou gentle maid such sights to see    again she saw that bosom old   again she felt that bosom cold   and drew in her breath with a hissing sound   whereat the knight turned wildly round                            460   and nothing saw but his own sweet maid   with eyes upraised as one that prayed    the touch the sight had passed away   and in its stead that vision blest   which comforted her afterrest                                     465   while in the ladys arms she lay   had put a rapture in her breast   and on her lips and oer her eyes   spread smiles like light                             with new surprise   what ails then my belovéd child                                 470   the baron saidhis daughter mild   made answer all will yet be well   i ween she had no power to tell   aught else so mighty was the spell    yet he who saw this geraldine                                    475   had deemed her sure a thing divine   such sorrow with such grace she blended   as if she feared she had offended   sweet christabel that gentle maid   and with such lowly tones she prayed                               480   she might be sent without delay   home to her fathers mansion                                 nay   nay by my soul said leoline   ho bracy the bard the charge be thine   go thou with music sweet and loud                                485   and take two steeds with trappings proud   and take the youth whom thou lovst best   to bear thy harp and learn thy song   and clothe you both in solemn vest   and over the mountains haste along                                490   lest wandering folk that are abroad   detain you on the valley road    and when he has crossed the irthing flood   my merry bard he hastes he hastes   up knorren moor through halegarth wood                           495   and reaches soon that castle good   which stands and threatens scotlands wastes    bard bracy bard bracy your horses are fleet   ye must ride up the hall your music so sweet   more

greets thee thus through me   he bids thee come without delay                                    505   with all thy numerous array   and take thy lovely daughter home   and he will meet thee on the way   with all his numerous array   white with their panting palfreys foam                           510   and by mine honour i will say   that i repent me of the day   when i spake words of fierce disdain   to roland de vaux of tryermaine   for since that evil hour hath flown                             515   many a summers sun hath shone   yet neer found i a friend again   like roland de vaux of tryermaine    the lady fell and clasped his knees   her face upraised her eyes oerflowing                           520   and bracy replied with faltering voice   his gracious hail on all bestowing   thy words thou sire of christabel   are sweeter than my harp can tell   yet might i gain a boon of thee                                   525   this day my journey should not be   so strange a dream hath come to me   that i had vowed with music loud   to clear yon wood from thing unblest   warned by a vision in my rest                                     530   for in my sleep i saw that dove   that gentle bird whom thou dost love   and callst by thy own daughters name   sir leoline i saw the same   fluttering and uttering fearful moan                             535   among the green herbs in the forest alone   which when i saw and when i heard   i wonderd what might ail the bird   for nothing near it could i see   save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree    and in my dream methought i went                                  541   to search out what might there be found   and what the sweet birds trouble meant   that thus lay fluttering on the ground   i went and peered and could descry                                545   no cause for her distressful cry   but yet for her dear ladys sake   i stooped methought the dove to take   when lo i saw a bright green snake   coiled around its wings and neck                                  550   green as the herbs on which it couched   close by the doves its head it crouched   and with the dove it heaves and stirs   swelling its neck as she swelled hers   i woke it was the midnight hour                                  555   the clock was echoing in the tower   but though my slumber was gone by   this dream it would not pass away   it seems to live upon my eye   and thence i vowed this selfsame day                              560   with music strong and saintly song   to wander through the forest bare   lest aught unholy loiter there    thus bracy said the baron the while   halflistening heard him with a smile                             565   then turned to lady geraldine   his eyes made up of wonder and love   and said in courtly accents fine   sweet maid lord rolands beauteous dove   with arms more strong than harp or song                           570   thy sire and i will crush the snake   he kissed her forehead as he spake   and geraldine in maiden wise   casting down her large bright eyes   with blushing cheek and courtesy fine                              575   she turned her from sir leoline   softly gathering up her train   that oer her right arm fell again   and folded her arms across her chest   and couched her head upon her breast                              580   and looked askance at christabel   jesu maria shield her well    a snakes small eye blinks dull and shy   and the ladys eyes they shrunk in her head   each shrunk up to a serpents eye                                 585   and with somewhat of malice and more of dread   at christabel she looked askance   one momentand the sight was fled   but christabel in dizzy trance   stumbling on the unsteady ground                                   590   shuddered aloud with a hissing sound   and geraldine again turned round   and like a thing that sought relief   full of wonder and full of grief   she rolled her large bright eyes divine                            595   wildly on sir leoline    the maid alas her thoughts are gone   she nothing seesno sight but one   the maid devoid of guile and sin   i know not how in fearful wise                                   600   so deeply had she drunken in   that look those shrunken serpent eyes   that all her features were resigned   to this sole image in her mind   and passively did imitate                                          605   that look of dull and treacherous hate   and thus she stood in dizzy trance   still picturing that look askance   with forced unconscious sympathy   full before her fathers view                                  610   as far as such a look could be   in eyes so innocent and blue    and when the trance was oer the maid   paused awhile and inly prayed   then falling at the barons feet                                  615   by my mothers soul do i entreat   that thou this woman send away   she said and more she could not say   for what she knew she could not tell   oermastered by the mighty spell                                 620    why is thy cheek so wan and wild   sir leoline thy only child   lies at thy feet thy joy thy pride   so fair so innocent so mild   the same for whom thy lady died                                  625   o by the pangs of her dear mother   think thou no evil of thy child   for her and thee and for no other   she prayed the moment ere she died   prayed that the babe for whom she died                            630   might prove her dear lords joy and pride     that prayer her deadly pangs beguiled           sir leoline     and wouldst thou wrong thy only child           her child and thine                                       635    within the barons heart and brain   if thoughts like these had any share   they only swelled his rage and pain   and did but work confusion there   his heart was cleft with pain and rage                            640   his cheeks they quivered his eyes were wild   dishonoured thus in his old age   dishonoured by his only child   and all his hospitality   to the wronged daughter of his friend                              645   by more than womans jealousy   brought thus to a disgraceful end   he rolled his eye with stern regard   upon the gentle minstrel bard   and said in tones abrupt austere                                650   why bracy dost thou loiter here   i bade thee hence the bard obeyed   and turning from his own sweet maid   the agéd knight sir leoline   led forth the lady geraldine                                      655  1800   the conclusion to part ii    a little child a limber elf   singing dancing to itself   a fairy thing with red round cheeks   that always finds and never seeks   makes such a vision to the sight                                   660   as fills a fathers eyes with light   and pleasures flow in so thick and fast   upon his heart that he at last   must needs express his loves excess   with words of unmeant bitterness                                  665   perhaps tis pretty to force together   thoughts so all unlike each other   to mutter and mock a broken charm   to dally with wrong that does no harm   perhaps tis tender too and pretty                                 670   at each wild word to feel within   a sweet recoil of love and pity   and what if in a world of sin   o sorrow and shame should this be true   such giddiness of heart and brain                                  675   comes seldom save from rage and pain   so talks as its most used to do  1801

apriloctober 1800 later in the same year or perhaps in 1801 coleridge made a copy of the first part or book the conclusion to the first book and the second book and presented it to mrs wordsworths sister sarah hutchinson a facsimile of the ms now in the possession of miss edith coleridge was issued in collotype in the edition of christabel published in 1907 under the auspices of the royal society of literature in 1801 or at some subsequent period possibly not till 1815 miss hutchinson transcribed coleridges ms the watermark of the paper is 1801 her transcript now in the possession of mr a h hallam murray was sent to lord byron in october 1815 it is possible that this transcription was the copy for the first edition published in 1816 but if so coleridge altered the text whilst the poem was passing through the press  the existence of two other mss rests on the authority of john payne collier see seven lectures on shakespeare and milton by s t coleridge 1856 pp xxxixxliii  the first which remained in his possession for many years was a copy in the handwriting of sarah stoddart afterwards mrs hazlitt j p collier notes certain differences between this ms which he calls the salisbury copy and the text of the first edition he goes on to say that before christabel was published coleridge lent him an ms in his own handwriting and he gives two or three readings from the second ms which differ from the text of the salisbury copy and from the texts of those mss which have been placed in my hands  the copy of the first edition of christabel presented to william stewart roses valet david hinves on november 11 1816 which coleridge had already corrected is now in the possession of mr john murray the emendations and additions inscribed on the margin of this volume were included in the collected edition of coleridges poetical works published by william pickering in 1828 the editions of 1829 and 1834 closely followed the edition of 1828 but in 1834 there was in one

feelings of every friend to liberty and foe to oppression of all who admiring the french revolution detest and deplore the conduct of france towards switzerland it is very satisfactory to find so zealous and steady an advocate for freedom as mr coleridge concur with us in condemning the conduct of france towards the swiss cantons indeed his concurrence is not singular we know of no friend to liberty who is not of his opinion what we most admire is the avowal of his sentiments and public censure of the unprincipled and atrocious conduct of france the poem itself is written with great energy the second third and fourth stanzas contain some of the most vigorous lines we have ever read the lines in the fourth stanza    to scatter rage and traitrous guilt    where peace her jealous home had built  to the end of the stanza are particularly expressive and beautiful  to the second morning post version 1802 a note and argument were prefixed  the following ode was first published in this paper in the beginning of the year 1798 in a less perfect state the present state of france and switzerland give it so peculiar an interest at the present time that we wished to republish it and accordingly have procured from the author a corrected copy  argument  first stanza an invocation to those objects in nature the contemplation of which had inspired the poet with a devotional love of liberty second stanza the exultation of the poet at the commencement of the french revolution and his unqualified abhorrence of the alliance against the republic third stanza the blasphemies and horrors during the domination of the terrorists regarded by the poet as a transient storm and as the natural consequence of the former despotism and of the foul superstition of popery reason indeed began to suggest many apprehensions yet still the poet struggled to retain the hope that france would make conquests by no other means than by presenting to the observation of europe a people more happy and better instructed than under other forms of government fourth stanza switzerland and the poets recantation fifth stanza an address to liberty in which the poet expresses his conviction that those feelings and that grand ideal of freedom which the mind attains by its contemplation of its individual nature and of the sublime surrounding objects see stanza the first do not belong to men as a society nor can possibly be either gratified or realised under any form of human government but belong to the individual man so far as he is pure and inflamed with the love and adoration of god in

        10   duly she hied to fill her milkingpail   ere shout of herdsmen rang from cliff or vale   when she returnd before the summer shiel   on the fresh grass she spread the dairy meal   just as the snowy peaks began to lose                               15   in glittering silver lights their rosy hues   singing in woods or bounding oer the lawn   no blither creature haild the early dawn

their sire   leave them to toil all day through paths unknown   and house at night behind some sheltering stone   impatient of the thought with lively cheer                         25   she broke halfclosed the tasteless tale severe   she playd with fancies of a gayer hue   enamourd of the scenes her wishes drew   and oft she prattled with an eager tongue   of promised joys that would not loiter long                        30   till with her tearless eyes so bright and fair   she seemd to see them realisd in air   in fancy oft within some sunny dell   where never wolf should howl or tempest yell   she built a little home of joy and rest                            35   and filld it with the friends whom she lovd best   she named the inmates of her fancied cot   and gave to each his own peculiar lot   which with our little herd abroad should roam   and which should tend the dairys toil at home                     40   and now the hour approachd which should restore   her lover from the wars to part no more   her whole frame fluttered with uneasy joy   i longd myself to clasp the valiant boy   and though i strove to calm her eager mood                       45   it was my own sole thought in solitude   i told it to the saints amid my hymns   for o you know not on an old mans limbs   how thrillingly the pleasant sunbeams play   that shine upon his daughters weddingday                         50   i hoped that those fierce tempests soon to rave   unheard unfelt around my mountain grave   not undelightfully would break her rest   while she lay pillowd on her lovers breast   or joind his pious prayer for pilgrims driven                      55   out to the mercy of the winds of heaven   yes now the hour approachd that should restore   her lover from the wars to part no more   her thoughts were wild her soul was in her eye   she wept and laughd as if she knew not why                        60   and she had made a song about the wars   and sang it to the sun and to the stars   but while she lookd and listend stood and ran   and saw him plain in every distant man   by treachery stabbed on nansys murderous day                     65   a senseless corse th expected husband lay   a wounded man who met us in the wood   heavily askd her where my cottage stood   and told us all she cast her eyes around   as if his words had been but empty sound                           70   then lookd to heavn like one that would deny   that such a thing could be beneath the sky   again he askd her if she knew my name   and instantly an anguish wrenchd her frame   and left her mind imperfect no delight                             75   thenceforth she found in any cheerful sight   not evn in those timehaunted wells and groves   scenes of past joy and birthplace of her loves   if to her spirit any sound was dear   twas the deep moan that spoke the tempest near                    80   or sighs which chasms of icy vales outbreathe   sent from the dark imprisond floods beneath   she wanderd up the crag and down the slope   but not as in her happy days of hope   to seek the churningplant of sovereign power                      85   that grew in clefts and bore a scarlet flower   she roamd without a purpose all alone   thro high grey vales unknowing and unknown      kindhearted stranger patiently you hear   a tedious tale i thank you for that

torrents rang   evn yet methinks its spiry turrets swim                          95   amid yon purple gloom ascending dim   for thither oft would my poor child repair   to ease her soul by penitence and prayer   i knew that peace at good mens prayers returns   home to the contrite heart of him that mourns                     100   and checkd her not and often there she found   a timely pallet when the evening frownd   and there i trusted that my child would light   on shelter and on food one dreadful night   when there was uproar in the element                              105   and she was absent to my rest i went   i thought her safe yet often did i wake   and felt my very heart within me ache   no daughter near me at this very door   next morn i listend to the dying roar

oh idle thought   in nature there is nothing melancholy                              15   but some nightwandering man whose heart was pierced   with the remembrance of a grievous wrong   or slow

a brook in mossy forestdell   by sun or moonlight to the influxes   of shapes and sounds and shifting elements   surrendering his whole spirit of his song   and of his fame forgetful so his fame                              30   should share in natures immortality   a venerable thing and so his song   should make all nature lovelier and itself   be loved like nature but twill not be so   and youths

too short for him to utter forth   his lovechant and disburthen his full soul   of all its music                      and i know a grove   of large extent hard by a castle huge

elsewhere in one place i knew                             55   so many nightingales and far and near   in wood and thicket over the wide grove   they answer and provoke each others song   with skirmish and capricious passagings   and murmurs musical and swift jug jug                              60   and one low piping sound more sweet than all   stirring the air with such a harmony   that should you close your eyes you might almost   forget it was not day on moonlight bushes   whose dewy leaflets are but halfdisclosed                         65   you may perchance behold them on the

at once   a hundred airy harps and she hath watched   many a nightingale perch giddily   on blossomy twig still swinging from the breeze   and to that motion tune his wanton song

1800     the three graves2671  a fragment of a sextons tale        the author has published the following humble fragment      encouraged by the decisive recommendation of more than one of      our most celebrated living poets the language was intended to      be dramatic that is suited to the narrator and the metre      corresponds to the homeliness of the diction it is therefore      presented as the fragment not of a poem but of a common      balladtale2681 whether this is sufficient to justify the      adoption of such a style in any metrical composition not      professedly ludicrous the author is himself in some doubt at      all events it is not presented as poetry and it is in no way      connected with the authors judgment concerning poetic      diction its merits if any are exclusively psychological      the story which must be supposed to have been narrated in the      first and second parts is as follows       edward a young farmer meets at the house of ellen her      bosomfriend mary and commences an acquaintance which ends      in a mutual attachment with her consent and by the advice of      their common friend ellen he announces his hopes and      intentions to marys mother a widowwoman bordering on her      fortieth year and from constant health the possession of a      competent property and from having had no other children but      mary and another daughter the father died in their infancy      retaining for the greater part her personal attractions and      comeliness of appearance but a woman of low education and      violent temper the answer which she at once returned to      edwards application was remarkablewell edward you are a      handsome young fellow and you shall have my daughter from      this time all their wooing passed under the mothers eye and      in fine she became herself enamoured of her future      soninlaw and practised every art both of endearment and of      calumny to transfer his affections from her daughter to      herself the outlines of the tale are positive facts and of      no very distant date though the author has purposely altered      the names and the scene of action as well as invented the      characters of the parties and the detail of the incidents      edward however though perplexed by her strange detractions      from her daughters good qualities yet in the innocence of      his own heart still mistook2682 her increasing fondness for      motherly affection she at length overcome by her miserable      passion after much abuse of marys temper and moral      tendencies exclaimed with violent emotiono edward indeed      indeed she is not fit for youshe has not a heart to love      you as you deserve it is i that love you marry me edward      and i will this very day settle all my property on you the      lovers eyes were now opened and thus taken by surprise      whether from the effect of the horror which he felt acting as      it were hysterically on his nervous system or that at the      first moment he lost the sense of the guilt of the proposal in      the feeling of its strangeness and absurdity he flung her      from him and burst into a fit of laughter irritated by this      almost to frenzy the woman fell on her knees and in a loud      voice that approached to a scream she prayed for a curse both      on him and on her own child mary happened to be in the room      directly above them heard edwards laugh and her mothers      blasphemous prayer and fainted away he hearing the fall      ran upstairs and taking her in his arms carried her off to      ellens home and after some fruitless attempts on her part      toward a reconciliation with her mother she was married to      himand here the third part of the tale begins       i was not led to choose this story from any partiality to      tragic much less to monstrous events though at the time that      i composed the verses somewhat more than twelve years ago i      was less averse to such subjects than at present but from      finding in it a striking proof of the possible effect on the      imagination from an idea violently and suddenly impressed on      it i had been reading bryan edwardss account of the effects      of the oby witchcraft on the negroes in the west indies and      hearnes deeply interesting anecdotes of similar workings on      the imagination of the copper indians those of my readers who      have it in their power will be well repaid for the trouble of      referring to those works for the passages alluded to and i      conceived the design of shewing that instances of this kind      are not peculiar to savage or barbarous tribes and of      illustrating the mode in which the mind is affected in these      cases and the progress and symptoms of the morbid action on      the fancy from the beginning       the tale is supposed to be narrated by an old sexton in a      country churchyard to a traveller whose curiosity had been      awakened by the appearance of three graves close by each      other to two only of which there were gravestones on the      first of these was the name and dates as usual on the      second no name but only a date

mother cried     ye shall not enter here    would ye come here ye maiden vile     and rob me of my mate   and on her child the mother scowled                                 80     a deadly leer of hate    fast rooted to the spot you guess     the wretched maiden stood   as pale as any ghost of night     that wanteth flesh and blood                                     85    she did not groan she did not fall     she did not shed a tear   nor did she cry oh mother why     may i not enter here    but wildly up the stairs she ran                                   90     as if her sense was fled   and then her trembling limbs she threw     upon the bridal bed    the mother she to edward went     where he sate in the bower                                       95   and said that woman is not fit     to be your paramour    she is my childit makes my heart     with grief and trouble swell   i rue the hour that gave her birth                                100     for never worse befel    for she is fierce and she is proud     and of an envious mind   a wily hypocrite she is     and giddy as the wind                                           105    and if you go to church with her     youll rue the bitter smart   for she will wrong your marriagebed     and she will break your heart    oh god to think that i have shared                               110     her deadly sin so long   she is my child and therefore i     as mother held my tongue    she is my child ive risked for her     my living souls estate                                         115   i cannot say my daily prayers     the burthen is so great    and she would scatter gold about     until her back was bare   and should you swing for lust of hers                              120     in truth shed little care    then in a softer tone she said     and took him by the hand   sweet edward for one kiss of yours     id give my house and land                                      125    and if youll go to church with me     and take me for your bride   ill make you heir of all i have     nothing shall be denied    then edward started from his seat                                 130     and he laughed loud and long   in truth good mother you are mad     or drunk with liquor strong    to him no word the mother said     but on her knees she fell                                       135   and fetched her breath while thrice your hand     might toll the passingbell    thou daughter now above my head     whom in my womb i bore   may every drop of thy hearts blood                                140     be curst for ever more    and curséd be the hour when first     i heard thee wawl and cry   and in the churchyard curséd be     the grave where thou shalt lie                                 145    and mary on the bridalbed     her mothers curse had heard   and while the cruel mother spake     the bed beneath her stirred    in wrath young edward left the hall                               150     and turning round he sees   the mother looking up to god     and still upon her knees    young edward he to mary went     when on the bed she lay                                         155   sweet love this is a wicked house     sweet love we must away    he raised her from the bridalbed     all pale and wan with fear   no dog quoth he if he were mine                              160     no dog would kennel here    he led her from the bridalbed     he led her from the stairs   had sense been hers she had not dard     to venture on her prayers ms erased    the mother still was in the bower     and with a greedy heart                                          165   she drank perdition on her knees     which never may depart    but when their steps were heard below     on god she did not call   she did forget the god of heaven                                  170     for they were in the hall    she started upthe servant maid     did see her when she rose   and she has oft declared to me     the blood within her froze                                      175    as edward led his bride away     and hurried to the door   the ruthless mother springing forth     stopped midway on the floor    what did she mean what did she mean                              180     for with a smile she cried   unblest ye shall not pass my door     the bridegroom and his bride    be blithe as lambs in april are     as flies when fruits are red                                    185   may god forbid that thought of me     should haunt your marriagebed    and let the night be given to bliss     the day be given to glee   i am a woman weak and old                                         190     why turn a thought on me    what can an agéd mother do     and what have ye to dread   a curse is wind it hath no shape     to haunt your marriagebed                                     195    when they were gone and out of sight     she rent her hoary hair   and foamed like any dog of june     when sultry sunbeams glare                                           now ask you why the barren wife                                   200     and why the maid forlorn   and why the ruthless mother lies     beneath the flowery thorn    three times three times this spade of mine     in spite of bolt or bar                                         205   did from beneath the belfry come     when spirits wandering are    and when the mothers soul to hell     by howling fiends was borne   this spade was seen to mark her grave                              210     beneath the flowery thorn    and when the deathknock at the door     called home the maid forlorn   this spade was seen to mark her grave     beneath the flowery thorn                                       215    and tis a fearful fearful tree     the ghosts that round it meet   tis they that cut the rind at night     yet still it blossoms sweet                                         end of ms   part iii2761    the grapes upon the vicars wall                                   220     were ripe as ripe could be   and yellow leaves in sun and wind     were falling from the tree    on the hedgeelms in the narrow lane     still swung the spikes of corn                                  225   dear lord it seems but yesterday     young edwards marriagemorn    up through that wood behind the church     there leads from edwards door   a mossy track all over boughed                                   230     for half a mile or more    and from their housedoor by that track     the bride and bridegroom went   sweet mary though she was not gay     seemed cheerful and content                                     235    but when they to the churchyard came     ive heard poor mary say   as soon as she stepped into the sun     her heart it died away    and when the vicar joind their hands                             240     her limbs did creep and freeze   but when they prayed she thought she saw     her mother on her knees    and oer the churchpath they returned     i saw poor marys back                                          245   just as she stepped beneath the boughs     into the mossy track    her feet upon the mossy track     the married maiden set   that momenti have heard her say                                250     she wished she could forget    the shade oerflushed her limbs with heat     then came a chill like death   and when the merry bells rang out     they seemed to stop her breath                                  255    beneath the foulest mothers curse     no child could ever thrive   a mother is a mother still     the holiest thing alive    so five months passed the mother still                            260     would never heal the strife   but edward was a loving man     and mary a fond wife    my sister may not visit us     my mother says her nay                                          265   o edward you are all to me   i wish for your sake i could be     more lifesome and more gay    im dull and sad indeed indeed     i know i have no reason                                         270   perhaps i am not well in health     and tis a gloomy season    twas a drizzly timeno ice no snow     and on the few fine days   she stirred not out lest she might meet                           275     her mother in the ways    but ellen spite of miry ways     and weather dark and dreary   trudged every day to edwards house     and made them all more cheery                                   280    oh ellen was a faithful friend     more dear than any sister   as cheerful too as singing lark   and she neer left them till twas dark     and then they always missed her                                 285    and now ashwednesday camethat day     but few to church repair   for on that day you know we read     the commination prayer    our late old vicar a kind man                                    290     once sir he said to me   he wished that service was clean out     of our good liturgy    the mother walked into the church     to ellens seat she went                                        295   though ellen always kept her church     all churchdays during lent    and gentle ellen welcomed her     with courteous looks and mild   thought she what if her heart should melt                       300     and all be reconciled    the day was scarcely like a day     the clouds were black outright   and many a night with half a moon     ive seen the church more light                                 305    the wind was wild against the glass     the rain did beat and bicker   the churchtower swinging over head     you scarce could hear the vicar    and then and there the mother knelt                               310     and audibly she cried   oh may a clinging curse consume     this woman by my side    o hear me hear me lord in heaven     although you take my life                                      315   o curse this woman at whose house     young edward wood his wife    by night and day in bed and bower     o let her curséd be   so having prayed steady and slow                                 320     she rose up from her knee   and left the church nor eer again     the churchdoor entered she    i saw poor ellen kneeling still     so pale i guessed not why                                      325   when she stood up there plainly was     a trouble in her eye    and when the prayers were done we all     came round and asked her why   giddy she seemed and sure there was                              330     a trouble in her eye    but ere she from the churchdoor stepped     she smiled and told us why   it was a wicked womans curse     quoth she and what care i                                    335    she smiled and smiled and passed it off     ere from the door she stept   but all agree it would have been     much better had she wept    and if her heart was not at ease                                  340     this was her constant cry   it was a wicked womans curse     gods good and what care i    there was a hurry in her looks     her struggles she redoubled                                     345   it was a wicked womans curse     and why should i be troubled    these tears will comei dandled her     when twas the merest fairy   good creature and she hid it all                                 350     she told it not to mary    but mary heard the tale her arms     round ellens neck she threw   o ellen ellen she cursed me     and now she hath cursed you                                    355    i saw young edward by himself     stalk fast adown the lee   he snatched a stick from every fence     a twig from every tree    he snapped them still with hand or knee                           360     and then away they flew   as if with his uneasy limbs     he knew not what to do    you see good sir that single hill     his farm lies underneath                                        365   he heard it there he heard it all     and only gnashed his teeth    now ellen was a darling love     in all his joys and cares   and ellens name and marys name                                   370   fastlinked they both together came     wheneer he said his prayers    and in the moment of his prayers     he loved them both alike   yea both sweet names with one sweet joy                           375     upon his heart did strike    he reachd his home and by his looks     they saw his inward strife   and they clung round him with their arms     both ellen and his wife                                         380    and mary could not check her tears     so on his breast she bowed   then frenzy melted into grief     and edward wept aloud    dear ellen did not weep at all                                    385     but closelier did she cling   and turned her face and looked as if     she saw some frightful thing   part iv    to see a man tread over graves     i hold it no good mark                                          390   tis wicked in the sun and moon     and bad luck in the dark    you see that grave the lord he gives     the lord he takes away   o sir the child of my old age                                     395     lies there as cold as clay    except that grave you scarce see one     that was not dug by me   id rather dance upon em all     than tread upon these three                                     400    aye sexton tis a touching tale     you sir are but a lad   this month im in my seventieth year     and still it makes me sad    and marys sister told it me                                      405     for three good hours and more   though i had heard it in the main     from edwards self before    well it passed off the gentle ellen     did well nigh dote on mary                                      410   and she went oftener than before   and mary loved her more and more     she managed all the dairy    to market she on marketdays     to church on sundays came                                       415   all seemed the same all seemed so sir     but all was not the same    had ellen lost her mirth oh no     but she was seldom cheerful   and edward looked as if he thought                                 420     that ellens mirth was fearful    when by herself she to herself     must sing some merry rhyme   she could not now be glad for hours     yet silent all the time                                         425    and when she soothed her friend through all     her soothing words twas plain   she had a sore grief of her own     a haunting in her brain    and oft she said im not grown thin                              430     and then her wrist she spanned   and once when mary was downcast     she took her by the hand   and gazed upon her and at first     she gently pressed her hand                                     435    then harder till her grasp at length     did gripe like a convulsion   alas said she we neer can be     made happy by compulsion    and once her both arms suddenly                                    440     round marys neck she flung   and her heart panted and she felt     the words upon her tongue    she felt them coming but no power     had she the words to smother                                    445   and with a kind of shriek she cried     oh christ youre like your mother    so gentle ellen now no more     could make this sad house cheery   and marys melancholy ways                                         450     drove edward wild and weary    lingering he raised his latch at eve     though tired in heart and limb   he loved no other place and yet     home was no home to him                                         455    one evening he took up a book     and nothing in it read   then flung it down and groaning cried     o heaven that i were dead    mary looked up into his face                                      460     and nothing to him said   she tried to smile and on his arm     mournfully leaned her head    and he burst into tears and fell     upon his knees in prayer                                        465   her heart is broke o god my grief     it is too great to bear    twas such a foggy time as makes     old sextons sir like me   rest on their spades to cough the spring                          470     was late uncommonly    and then the hot days all at once     they came we knew not how   you looked about for shade when scarce     a leaf was on a bough                                           475    it happened then twas in the bower     a furlong up the wood   perhaps you know the place and yet     i scarce know how you should    no path leads thither tis not nigh                               480     to any pastureplot   but clustered near the chattering brook     lone hollies marked the spot    those hollies of themselves a shape     as of an arbour took                                            485   a close round arbour and it stands     not three strides from a brook    within this arbour which was still     with scarlet berries hung   were these three friends one sunday morn                         490     just as the first bell rung    tis sweet to hear a brook tis sweet     to hear the sabbathbell   tis sweet to hear them both at once     deep in a woody dell                                            495    his limbs along the moss his head     upon a mossy heap   with shutup senses edward lay   that brook een on a working day     might chatter one to sleep                                      500    and he had passed a restless night     and was not well in health   the women sat down by his side     and talked as twere by stealth    the sun peeps through the close thick leaves                     505     see dearest ellen see   tis in the leaves a little sun     no bigger than your ee    a tiny sun and it has got     a perfect glory too                                             510   ten thousand threads and hairs of light   make up a glory gay and bright     round that small orb so blue    and then they argued of those rays     what colour they might be

wanderings of cain2851   prefatory note  a prose composition one not in metre at least seems primâ facie to require explanation or apology it was written in the year 1798 near nether stowey in somersetshire at which place sanctum et amabile nomen rich by so many associations and recollections the author had taken up his residence in order to enjoy the society and close neighbourhood of a dear and honoured friend t poole esq the work was to have been written in concert with another wordsworth whose name is too venerable within the precincts of genius to be unnecessarily brought into connection with such a trifle and who was then residing at a small distance from nether stowey the title and subject were suggested by myself who likewise drew out the scheme and the contents for each of the three books or cantos of which the work was to consist and which the reader is to be informed was to have been finished in one night my partner undertook the first canto i the second and which ever had done first was to set about the third almost thirty years have passed by yet at this moment i cannot without something more than a smile moot the question which of the two things was the more impracticable for a mind so eminently original to compose another mans thoughts and fancies or for a taste so austerely pure and simple to imitate the death of abel methinks i see his grand and noble countenance as at the moment when having despatched my own portion of the task at full fingerspeed i hastened to him with my manuscriptthat look of humourous despondency fixed on his almost blank sheet of paper and then its silent mockpiteous admission of failure struggling with the sense of the exceeding ridiculousness of the whole schemewhich broke up in a laugh and the ancient mariner was written instead  years afterward however the draft of the plan and proposed incidents and the portion executed obtained favour in the eyes of more than one person whose judgment on a poetic work could not but have weighed with me even though no parental partiality had been thrown into the same scale as a makeweight and i determined on commencing anew and composing the whole in stanzas and made some progress in realising this intention when adverse gales drove my bark off the fortunate isles of the muses and then other and more momentous interests prompted a different voyage to firmer anchorage and a securer port i have in vain tried to recover the lines from the palimpsest tablet of my memory and i can only offer the introductory stanza which had been committed to writing for the purpose of procuring a friends judgment on the metre as a specimen    encinctured with a twine of leaves   that leafy twine his only dress   a lovely boy was plucking fruits   by moonlight in a wilderness   in a moonlight wilderness  aids to reflection 1825   the moon was bright the air was free   and fruits and flowers together grew   on many a shrub and many a tree   and all put on a gentle hue   hanging in the shadowy air   like a picture rich and rare   it was a climate where they say   the night is more belovd than day   but who that beauteous boy beguild   that beauteous boy to linger here   alone by night a little child   in place so silent and so wild   has he no friend no loving mother near  i have here given the birth parentage and premature decease of the wanderings of cain a poemintreating however my readers not to think so meanly of my judgment as to suppose that i either regard or offer it as any excuse for the publication of the following fragment and i may add of one or two others in its neighbourhood in its primitive crudity but i should find still greater difficulty in forgiving myself were i to record pro taedio publico a set of petty mishaps and annoyances which i myself wish to forget i must be content therefore with assuring the friendly reader that the less he attributes its appearance to the authors will choice or judgment the nearer to the truth he will be    s t coleridge 1828   the wanderings of cain   canto ii    a little further o my father yet a little further and   we shall come into the open moonlight their road was   through a forest of firtrees at its entrance the trees stood   at distances from each other and the path was broad and   the moonlight and the moonlight shadows reposed upon it             5   and appeared quietly to inhabit that solitude but soon the   path winded and became narrow the sun at high noon   sometimes speckled but never illumined it and now it was   dark as a cavern    it is dark o my father said enos but the path under           10   our feet is smooth and soft and we shall soon come out into   the open moonlight    lead on my child said cain guide me little child   and the innocent little child clasped a finger of the hand   which had murdered the righteous abel and he guided his            15   father the fir branches drip upon thee my son yea   pleasantly father for i ran fast and eagerly to bring thee   the pitcher and the cake and my body is not yet cool how   happy the squirrels are that feed on these firtrees they leap   from bough to bough and the old squirrels play round their         20   young ones in the nest i clomb a tree yesterday at noon   o my father that i might play with them but they leaped   away from the branches even to the slender twigs did they   leap and in a moment i beheld them on another tree why   o my father would they not play with me i would be good           25   to them as thou art good to me and i groaned to them   even as thou groanest when thou givest me to eat and when   thou coverest me at evening and as often as i stand at thy   knee and thine eyes look at me then cain stopped and   stifling his groans he sank to the earth and the child enos        30   stood in the darkness beside him    and cain lifted up his voice and cried bitterly and said   the mighty one that persecuteth me is on this side and on   that he pursueth my soul like the wind like the sandblast   he passeth through me he is around me even as the air             35   o that i might be utterly no more i desire to dieyea   the things that never had life neither move they upon the   earthbehold they seem precious to mine eyes o that   a man might live without the breath of his nostrils  so   i might abide in darkness and blackness and an empty              40   space yea i would lie down i would not rise neither   would i stir my limbs till i became as the rock in the den   of the lion on which the young lion resteth his head whilst he   sleepeth for the torrent that roareth far off hath a voice   and the clouds in heaven look terribly on me the mighty one        45   who is against me speaketh in the wind of the cedar grove   and in silence am i dried up then enos spake to his father   arise my father arise we are but a little way from the place   where i found the cake and the pitcher and cain said   how knowest thou and the child answeredbehold the            50   bare rocks are a few of thy strides distant from the forest   and while even now thou wert lifting up thy voice i heard   the echo then the child took hold of his father as if he   would raise him and cain being faint and feeble rose slowly   on his knees and pressed himself against the trunk of a fir        55   and stood upright and followed the child    the path was dark till within three strides length of its   termination when it turned suddenly the thick black trees   formed a low arch and the moonlight appeared for a moment   like a dazzling portal enos ran before and stood in the open       60   air and when cain his father emerged from the darkness   the child was affrighted for the mighty limbs of cain were   wasted as by fire his hair was as the matted curls on the   bisons forehead and so glared his fierce and sullen eye   beneath and the black abundant locks on either side a rank        65   and tangled mass were stained and scorched as though the   grasp of a burning iron hand had striven to rend them and his   countenance told in a strange and terrible language of agonies   that had been and were and were still to continue to be    the scene around was desolate as far as the eye could              70   reach it was desolate the bare rocks faced each other and   left a long and wide interval of thin white sand you might   wander on and look round and round and peep into the   crevices of the rocks and discover nothing that acknowledged   the influence of the seasons there was no spring no summer       75   no autumn and the winters snow that would have been   lovely fell not on these hot rocks and scorching sands never   morning lark had poised himself over this desert but the huge   serpent often hissed there beneath the talons of the vulture and   the vulture screamed his wings imprisoned within the coils of      80   the serpent the pointed and shattered summits of the ridges   of the rocks made a rude mimicry of human concerns and   seemed to prophecy mutely of things that then were not   steeples and battlements and ships with naked masts as far   from the wood as a boy might sling a pebble of the brook there     85   was one rock by itself at a small distance from the main ridge   it had been precipitated there perhaps by the groan which the   earth uttered when our first father fell before you approached   it appeared to lie flat on the ground but its base slanted from   its point and between its point and the sands a tall man might     90   stand upright it was here that enos had found the pitcher   and cake and to this place he led his father but ere they   had reached the rock they beheld a human shape his back was   towards them and they were advancing unperceived when they   heard him smite his breast and cry aloud woe is me woe is        95   me i must never die again and yet i am perishing with   thirst and hunger    pallid as the reflection of the sheeted lightning on the   heavysailing nightcloud became the face of cain but the   child enos took hold of the shaggy skin his fathers robe and    100   raised his eyes to his father and listening whispered ere   yet i could speak i am sure o my father that i heard that   voice have not i often said that i remembered a sweet voice   o my father this is it and cain trembled exceedingly   the voice was sweet indeed but it was thin and querulous         105   like that of a feeble slave in misery who despairs altogether   yet can not refrain himself from weeping and lamentation   and behold enos glided forward and creeping softly round   the base of the rock stood before the stranger and looked up   into his face and the shape shrieked and turned round           110   and cain beheld him that his limbs and his face were those   of his brother abel whom he had killed and cain stood   like one who struggles in his sleep because of the exceeding   terribleness of a dream    thus as he stood in silence and darkness of soul the              115   shape fell at his feet and embraced his knees and cried   out with a bitter outcry thou eldest born of adam whom   eve my mother brought forth cease to torment me i was   feeding my flocks in green pastures by the side of quiet rivers   and thou killedst me and now i am in misery then cain           120   closed his eyes and hid them with his hands and again he   opened his eyes and looked around him and said to enos   what beholdest thou didst thou hear a voice my son   yes my father i beheld a man in unclean garments and   he uttered a sweet voice full of lamentation then cain          125   raised up the shape that was like abel and saidthe   creator of our father who had respect unto thee and unto   thy offering wherefore hath he forsaken thee then the   shape shrieked a second time and rent his garment and   his naked skin was like the white sands beneath their feet        130   and he shrieked yet a third time and threw himself on his   face upon the sand that was black with the shadow of the   rock and cain and enos sate beside him the child by his   right hand and cain by his left they were all three under   the rock and within the shadow the shape that was like           135   abel raised himself up and spake to the child i know where   the cold waters are but i may not drink wherefore didst   thou then take away my pitcher but cain said didst   thou not find favour in the sight of the lord thy god   the shape answered the lord is god of the living only           140   the dead have another god then the child enos lifted up   his eyes and prayed but cain rejoiced secretly in his heart   wretched shall they be all the days of their mortal life   exclaimed the shape who sacrifice worthy and acceptable   sacrifices to the god of the dead but after death their toil      145   ceaseth woe is me for i was well beloved by the god of   the living and cruel wert thou o my brother who didst   snatch me away from his power and his dominion having   uttered these words he rose suddenly and fled over the sands   and cain said in his heart the curse of the lord is on me       150   but who is the god of the dead and he ran after the shape   and the shape fled shrieking over the sands and the sands   rose like white mists behind the steps of cain but the feet   of him that was like abel disturbed not the sands he greatly   outrun cain and turning short he wheeled round and came         155   again to the rock where they had been sitting and where enos   still stood and the child caught hold of his garment as he   passed by and he fell upon the ground and cain stopped   and beholding him not said he has passed into the dark   woods and he walked slowly back to the rocks and when he        160   reached it the child told him that he had caught hold of his   garment as he passed by and that the man had fallen upon   the ground and cain once more sate beside him and said   abel my brother i would lament for thee but that the spirit   within me is withered and burnt up with extreme agony            165   now i pray thee by thy flocks and by thy pastures and   by the quiet rivers which thou lovedst that thou tell me all   that thou knowest who is the god of the dead where doth   he make his dwelling what sacrifices are acceptable unto him   for i have offered but have not been received i have prayed     170   and have not been heard and how can i be afflicted more than   i already am the shape arose and answered o that thou   hadst had pity on me as i will have pity on thee follow me   son of adam and bring thy child with thee    and they three passed over the white sands between the             175   rocks silent as the shadows  1798   footnotes  2851 the wanderings of cain in its present shape was

printed by the editor in the athenaeum of january 27 1894 p 114 the introduction of alligators and an immense meadow help to fix the date of the wanderings of cain the imagery is derived from william bartrams travels in florida and carolina which coleridge and wordsworth studied in 1798 mr hutchinson who reprints lyrical ballads of 1798 notes pp 25960 a selected passage from the ms fragment points out that coleridge had for a time thought of shaping the poem as a narrative addressed by cain to his wife  he falls down in a trancewhen he awakes he sees a luminous body coming before him it stands before him an orb of fire it goes on he moves not it returns to him again again retires as if wishing him to follow it it then goes on and he follows they are led to near the bottom of the wild woods brooks forests etc etc the fire gradually shapes itself retaining its luminous appearance into the lineaments of a man a dialogue between the fiery shape and cain in which the being presses upon him the enormity of his guilt and that he must make some expiation to the true deity who is a severe god and persuades him to burn out his eyes cain opposes this idea and says that god himself who had inflicted this punishment upon him had done it because he neglected to make a proper use of his senses etc the evil spirit answers him that god is indeed a god of mercy and that an example must be given to mankind that this end will be answered by his terrible appearance at the same time he will be gratified with the most delicious sights and feelings cain overpersuaded consents to do it but wishes to go to the top of the rocks to take a farewell of the earth his farewell speech concluding with an abrupt address to the promised redeemer and he abandons the idea on which the being had accompanied him and turning round to declare this to the being he sees him dancing from rock to rock in his former shape down those interminable precipices  child affeared by his fathers ravings goes

while he tells his story he begins with telling her that he had first after his leaving her found out a dwelling in the desart under a juniper tree etc etc how he meets in the desart a young man whom upon a nearer approach he perceives to be abel on whose countenance appears marks of the greatest misery    of another being who had power after this life greater than jehovah he is going to offer

do it when abel himself in his angelic appearance attended by michael is seen in the heavens whence they sail slowly down abel addresses cain with terror warning him not to offer up his innocent child

in a dream a fragment     the following fragment is here published at the request   of a poet of great and deserved celebrity lord byron and   as far as the authors own opinions are concerned rather as   a psychological curiosity than on the ground of any supposed   poetic merits                                                     5    in the summer of the year 17972952 the author then in ill   health had retired to a lonely farmhouse between porlock   and linton on the exmoor confines of somerset and devonshire   in consequence of a slight indisposition an anodyne   had been prescribed from the effects of which he fell asleep       10   in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following   sentence or words of the same substance in purchass   pilgrimage here the khan kubla commanded a palace   to be built and a stately garden thereunto and thus ten   miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall2961 the   author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep   at least of the external senses during which time he has the   most vivid confidence that he could not have composed less   than from two to three hundred lines if that indeed can   be called composition in which all the images rose up before        20   him as things with a parallel production of the correspondent   expressions without any sensation or consciousness of effort   on awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection   of the whole and taking his pen ink and paper instantly   and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved at   this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on   business from porlock and detained by him above an hour   and on his return to his room found to his no small surprise   and mortification that though he still retained some vague   and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision yet     30   with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and   images all the rest had passed away like the images on the   surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast but alas   without the after restoration of the latter                      then all the charm   is brokenall that phantomworld so fair   vanishes and a thousand circlets spread   and each misshapes the other stay awhile   poor youth who scarcely darst lift up thine eyes   the stream will soon renew its smoothness soon                     40   the visions will return and lo he stays   and soon the fragments dim of lovely forms   come trembling back unite and now once more   the pool becomes a mirror    from the picture or the lovers resolution ii 91100    yet from the still surviving recollections in his mind the   author has frequently purposed to finish for himself what had   been originally as it were given to him Σαμερον αδιον ασω2971   Αὔριον ἅδιον ἄσω 1834 but the tomorrow is yet to come    as a contrast to this vision i have annexed a fragment of a   very different character describing with equal fidelity the        50   dream of pain and disease2972   kubla khan    in xanadu did kubla khan   a stately pleasuredome decree   where alph the sacred river ran   through caverns measureless to man     down to a sunless sea                                             5   so twice five miles of fertile ground   with walls and towers were girdled round   and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills   where blossomed many an incensebearing tree   and here were forests ancient as the hills                         10   enfolding sunny spots of greenery    but oh that deep romantic chasm which slanted   down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover   a savage place as holy and enchanted   as eer beneath a waning moon was haunted                           15   by woman wailing for her demonlover2973   2974and from this chasm with ceaseless turmoil seething   as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing   a mighty fountain momently was forced   amid whose swift halfintermitted burst                             20   huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail   or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail   and mid these dancing rocks at once and ever   it flung up momently the sacred river   five miles meandering with a mazy motion                            25   through wood and dale the sacred river ran   then reached the caverns measureless to man   and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean   and mid this tumult kubla heard from far   ancestral voices prophesying war                                   30     the shadow of the dome of pleasure     floated midway on the waves     where was heard the mingled measure     from the fountain and the caves   it was a miracle of rare device                                    35   a sunny pleasuredome

me with a meek embrace   and bending back her head looked up       and gazed upon my face    twas partly love and partly fear   and partly twas a bashful art                                     90

27902 see coleridges poems a facsimile reproduction c ed by james dykes campbell 1899 and appendices of this edition  it is probable that the greater part of the introduction to the tale of the dark ladie was written either during or shortly after a visit which coleridge paid to the wordsworthss friends george and mary and sarah hutchinson at sockburn a farmhouse on the banks of the tees in november 1799 in the first draft ll 1316 she leaned c runs thus    she leand against a grey stone rudely carvd   the statue of an arméd knight   she leand in melancholy mood       amid the lingering light  in the church at sockburn there is a recumbent statue of an armed knight of the conyers family and in a field near the farmhouse there is a greystone which is said to commemorate the slaying of a monstrous wyverne or worme by the knight who is buried in the church it is difficult to believe that the arméd knight and the grey stone of the first draft were not suggested by the statue in sockburn church and the greystone in the adjoining field it has been argued that the ballad of the dark ladié of which only a fragment remains was written after coleridge returned from germany and that the introduction to the tale of the dark ladie which embodies love was written at stowey in 1797 or 1798 but in referring to the plan of the lyrical ballads of 1798 biog lit 1817 cap xiv ii 3 coleridge says that he had written the ancient mariner and was preparing the dark ladie and the christabel both unpublished poems when this chapter was written but says nothing of so typical a poem as love by the dark ladié he must have meant the unfinished ballad of the dark ladié which at one time numbered 190 lines not the introduction to the tale of the dark ladie which later on he refers to as the poem entitled love biog lit 1817 cap xxiv ii 298 and which had appeared under that title in the lyrical ballads of 1800 1802 and 1805  in sibylline leaves 1828 1829 and 1834 love which was the first in order of a group of poems with the subtitle love poems was prefaced by the following motto    quas humilis tenero stylus olim effudit in aevo   perlegis hic lacrymas et quod pharetratus acuta

mr editoran unmetrical letter from talleyrand to lord      grenville has already appeared and from an authority too high      to be questioned otherwise i could adduce some arguments for      the exclusive authenticity of the following metrical epistle      the very epithet which the wise ancients used aurea      carmina might have been supposed likely to have determined      the choice of the french minister in favour of verse and the      rather when we recollect that this phrase of golden verses      is applied emphatically to the works of that philosopher who      imposed silence on all with whom he had to deal besides is      it not somewhat improbable that talleyrand should have      preferred prose to rhyme when the latter alone has got the      chink is it not likewise curious that in our official answer      no notice whatever is taken of the chief consul bonaparte as      if there had been no such person man essays c 1850      existing notwithstanding that his existence is pretty      generally admitted nay that some have been so rash as to      believe that he has created as great a sensation in the world      as lord grenville or even the duke of portland but the      minister of foreign affairs talleyrand is acknowledged      which in our opinion could not have happened had he written      only that insignificant proseletter which seems to precede      bonapartes as in old romances a dwarf always ran before to      proclaim the advent or arrival of knight or giant that      talleyrands character and practices more resemble those of      some regular governments than bonapartes i admit but this      of itself does not appear a satisfactory explanation however      let the letter speak for itself the second line is      supererogative in syllables whether from the oscitancy of the      transcriber or from the trepidation which might have      overpowered the modest frenchman on finding himself in the      act of writing to so great a man i

attempt to analyse and illustrate the sense of time which appears to have been written before the lines as published in sibylline leaves took shape how marked the contrast between troubled manhood and joyouslyactive youth in the sense of time to the former time like the sun in an empty sky is never seen to move but only to have moved there there it was and now tis here now distant yet all a blank

to have moved at all this i feel to be a just image of time real and time as felt in two different states of being the title of the poem therefore for poem it ought to be should be time real and time

occurrence supposes a peculiar sensibility and tenderness of nature a constitutional communicativeness and utterancy of heart and soul a delight in the detail of sympathy in the outward and visible signs of the sacrament withinto count as it were the pulses of the life of love but above all it supposes a soul which even in the pride and summertide of lifeeven in the lustihood of health and

even by a feeling of modesty which will arise in delicate minds when they are conscious of possessing the same or the correspondent excellence in their own characters in short there must be a mind which while it feels the beautiful and the excellent in the beloved as its own and by right of love appropriates it can call goodness its playfellow and dares make sport of time and infirmity while in

accept as a small testimony of my grateful attachment the following dramatic poem in which i have endeavoured to detail in an interesting form the fall of a man whose great bad actions have cast a disastrous lustre on his name in the execution of the work as intricacy of plot could not have been attempted without a gross violation of recent facts it has been my sole aim to imitate the empassioned and highly figurative language of the french orators and to develope the characters of the chief actors on a vast stage of horrors                                            yours

of the joint authorship on this point coleridge writes to southey september 19 1794the tragedy will be printed in less than a week i shall put my name because it will sell at least a hundred copies in

editors note  in ms iii coleridge wrote on the opposite pagevelez supposes the picture which represents the attempt to assassinate albert to have been a mere invention contrived by osorio with the most innocent intentions osorio supposes it of course to be the portrait of maria which he had restored to albert  5562 the transcriber of ms i had here written superstitious which is marked through

lighted torch in the hand   is no unpleasant object hereones breath   floats round the flame and makes as many colours                   25   as the thin clouds that travel near the moon5641   you see

to have prefixed a life of wallenstein to this translation but i found that it must either have occupied a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of the publication or have been merely a meagre catalogue of events narrated not more fully than they already are in the play itself the recent translation likewise of schillers history of the thirty years war diminished the motives thereto in the translation i endeavoured to render my author literally wherever i was not prevented by absolute differences of idiom but i am conscious that in two or three short passages i have been guilty of dilating the original and from anxiety to give the full meaning have weakened the force in the metre i have availed myself of no other liberties than those which schiller had permitted to himself except the occasional breakingup of the line by the substitution of a trochee for an iambus of which liberty so frequent in our tragedies i find no instance in these dramas    s t coleridge

for the first time coleridge began his translation of the two plays at no 21 buckingham street strand in december 1799 and finished the last sheet at town end grasmere april 20 1800  these dramas have two grievous faults they are prolix in the particular parts and slow in the general movement but they have passion distinct and diversified character and they abound in passages of great moral and poetic beauty s t coleridge  the defects of these dramas are all of an instructive character for tho not the products of genius like those of shakespere they result from an energetic and thinking mind 1 the speeches are seldom suited to charactersthe characters are truly diversified and distinctly conceivedbut we learn them from the actions and from the descriptions given by other characters or from particular speeches the brutal illo repeatedly talks language which belongs to the countess c 2 astrology an undramatic superstition because it inspires no terror and its foundation of imagination is overbuilt and concealed by its scientific superstructure with other cause from the imagery is thus unpopular or swallowed up in more general and pleasing associations as the sun and moon is made prophetic and yet treated ludicrously the author as philosopher is in compleat discord with himself as historian this is a most grievous fault 3 the assassins talk ludicrously this is a most egregious misimitation of shakespereschiller should not have attempted tragicocomedy and none but shakespere has succeeded it is wonderful however that schiller who had studied shakespere should not have perceived his divine judgment in the management of his assassins as in macbeth they are fearful and almost pitiable beingsnot loathsome ludicrous miscreants 4 the character of thekla  o the bold heroine of any novel nothing of the convent no superstition nothing of the daughter of wallenstein nothing that her past life is represented by 5 wallenstein is a finer psychological than dramatic and a more dramatic than a tragic character shakespere draws strength as in richard the third and even when he blends weakness as in macbethyet it is weakness of a specific kind that leaves the strength in full and fearful energybut schiller has drawn weakness imposing on itself the love of power for the sense of strength a fine conception in itself but not tragicat least for the principal character of a long dramahence wallenstein with one exception that of the regimental deputation to him in the second part evaporates in mockmysterious speeches these are the chief defects i think on the other hand the character of butler is admirable throughout octavio is very grand and max tho it may be an easy character to draw for a man of thought and lofty feelingfor a man who possesses all the analoga of genius is yet so delightful and its moral influence so grand and salutary that we must allow it great praise the childish lovetoying with the glove and aunt tertsky in the

sort and lovely should be present   to feast our eyes                                                  45    illo aside to butler and how came you to know   that the count galas joins us not    butler

that to make the gift still sweeter                   55   the duke has given him the very same   in which he first saw service and since then   worked himself step by step through each preferment   from the ranks upwards and verily it gives   a precedent of hope a spur of action                               60   to the whole corps if once in their remembrance   an old deserving soldier makes

speaks from my mouth and not my own presumption    wallenstein we excuse all preface    questenberg                        when his majesty   the emperor to his courageous armies   presented in the person of duke friedland   a most experienced and renowned commander                          15   he did it in glad hope and confidence   to give thereby to the fortune of the war   a rapid and auspicious change the onset   was favourable to his royal wishes   bohemia was delivered from the saxons                              20   the swedes career of conquest checked these lands   began to

of triumph this proud day   marched toward bohemia with the speed of flight                    35   and vanished from the theatre of war   while the young weimar hero forced his way   into franconia to the danube like   some delving winterstream which where it rushes   makes its own channel with such sudden speed                       40   he marched and now at once fore regenspurg   stood to the affright of all good catholic christians   then did bavarias welldeserving prince   entreat swift aidance in his extreme need   the emperor sends seven horsemen to duke friedland                 45   seven horsemen couriers sends he with the entreaty   he superadds his own and supplicates   where as the sovereign lord he can command   in vain his supplication at this moment   the duke hears only

nine years ago during the danish war                             110   i raised him up a force a mighty force   forty or fifty thousand men that cost him   of his own purse no doit through saxony

i hold it as the empires general   for the common weal the universal interest   and no more for that one mans aggrandizement   but to the point what is it thats desired of me    questenberg first his imperial majesty hath willed             145   that without pretexts of delay the army   evacuate bohemia    wallenstein    in this season   and to what quarter wills the emperor   that we direct our

nothing good    max           that counterfeited paper                          150   appears to me no other than a trick   of illos own device these underhand   traders in great mens interests ever use   to urge and hurry all things to the extreme   they see the duke at variance with the court                      155   and fondly think to serve him when they widen   the breach irreparably trust

sort of broad humour and is not   deficient in character but to have translated it into prose or   into any other metre than that of the original would have   given a false notion both of its style and purport to have         10   translated it into the same metre would have been incompatible with   a faithful adherence to the sense of the german from the   comparative poverty of our language in rhymes and it would have   been unadvisable from the incongruity of those lax verses with   the present taste of the english public schillers intention       15   seems to have been merely to have prepared his reader for the   tragedies by a lively picture of the laxity of discipline and the   mutinous dispositions of wallensteins soldiery it is not   necessary as a preliminary explanation for these reasons it   has been thought expedient not to translate it                     20    the admirers of schiller who have abstracted their conception   of that author from the robbers and the cabal and love plays   in which the main interest is produced by the excitement of   curiosity and in which the curiosity is excited by terrible and   extraordinary incident will not have perused without some          25   portion of disappointment the dramas which it has been my   employment to translate they should however reflect that   these are historical dramas taken from a popular german   history that we must therefore judge of them in some measure   with the feelings of germans or by analogy with the interest      30   excited in us by similar dramas in our own language few   i trust would be rash or ignorant enough to compare schiller   with shakspeare yet merely as illustration i would say   that we should proceed to the perusal of wallenstein not   from lear or othello but from richard the second or the           35   three parts of henry the sixth we scarcely expect rapidity   in an historical drama and many prolix speeches are   pardoned from characters whose names and actions have   formed the most amusing tales of our early life on the other   hand there exist in these plays more individual beauties          40   more passages the excellence of which will bear reflection   than in the former productions of schiller the description of   the astrological tower and the reflections of the young lover   which follow it form in the original a fine poem and my   translation must have been wretched indeed if it can have          45   wholly overclouded the beauties of the scene in the first act of   the first play between questenberg max and octavio piccolomini   if we except the scene of the setting sun in the robbers   i know of no part in schillers plays which equals the whole   of the first scene of the fifth act of the concluding play it      50   would be unbecoming in me to be more diffuse on this subject   a translator stands connected with the original author by   a certain law of subordination which makes it more decorous   to point out excellencies than defects indeed he is not likely   to be a fair judge of either the pleasure or disgust from his      55   own labour will mingle with the feelings that arise from an   afterview of the original even in the first perusal of a work   in any foreign language which we understand we are apt to   attribute to it more excellence than it really possesses from our   own pleasurable sense of difficulty overcome without effect        60   translation of poetry into poetry is difficult because the   translator must give a brilliancy to his language without that warmth   of original conception from which such brilliancy would follow   of its own accord but the translator of a living author is   encumbered with additional inconveniences if he render his         65   original faithfully as to the sense of each passage he must   necessarily destroy a considerable portion of the spirit if he   endeavour to give a work executed according to laws of   compensation he subjects himself to imputations of vanity or   misrepresentation i have thought it my duty to remain              70   bound by the sense of my original with as few exceptions as   the nature of the languages

enjoyed from him   no grace or favour i could almost doubt   if ever in his greatness he once thought on   an old friend of his youth for still my office                     80   kept me at distance from him and when first   he to this citadel appointed me   he was sincere and serious in his duty   i do not then abuse his confidence   if i preserve my fealty in that                                     85   which to my fealty was first delivered    butler say then will you fulfil the attainder on him    gordon if it be soif all be as you say   if heve betrayed the emperor his master   have sold the troops have purposed to deliver                      90   the strong holds of the country to the enemy   yea trulythere is no redemption for him   yet it is hard that me the lot should destine

  100   his frame of mind was serious and severe   beyond his years his dreams were of great objects   he walked amidst us of a silent spirit   communing with himself yet i have known him   transported on a sudden into utterance                             105   of strange conceptions kindling into splendour   his soul revealed itself and he spake so   that we looked round perplexed upon each other   not knowing whether it were craziness   or whether it were a god that spoke in him                        110    butler but was it where he fell two story high   from a windowledge on

    115   doubtless more selfenwrapt and melancholy   he made himself a catholic marvellously   his marvellous preservation had transformed him   thenceforth he held himself for an exempted   and privileged being and as if he were                           120   incapable of dizziness or fall   he ran along the unsteady rope of life   but now our destinies drove us asunder   he paced with rapid step the way of greatness   was count and prince dukeregent and dictator                  125   and now is all all this too little for him   he stretches forth his hands for a kings crown   and

remorse8121     preface   this tragedy was written in the summer and autumn of the year 1797 at nether stowey in the county of somerset by whose recommendation and of the manner in which both the play and the author were treated by the recommender let me be permitted to relate that i knew of its having been received only by a third person that i could procure neither answer nor the manuscript and that but for an accident i should have had no copy of the work itself that such treatment would damp a young mans exertions may be easily conceived there was no need of aftermisrepresentation and calumny as an additional sedative  8122as an amusing anecdote and in the wish to prepare future authors as young as i then was and as ignorant of the world of8123 the treatment they may meet with i will add that the person8124 who by a twice conveyed recommendation in the year 1797 had urged me to write a tragedy8125 who on my own objection that i was utterly ignorant of all stagetactics had promised that he would himself make the necessary alterations if the piece should be at all representable who together with the copy of the play hastened by his means so as to prevent the full developement8126 of the characters received a letter from the author to this purport that conscious of his inexperience he had cherished no expectations and should therefore feel no disappointment from the rejection of the play but that if beyond his hopes mr  found in it any capability of being adapted to the stage it was delivered to him as if it had been his own manuscript to add omit or alter as he saw occasion and that if it were rejected the author would deem himself amply remunerated by the addition to his experience which he should receive if mr would point out8127 to him the nature of its unfitness for public representationthat this very person returned8131 me no answer and8132 spite of repeated applications retained my manuscript when i was not conscious of any other copy being in existence my duplicate having been destroyed by an accident that he8133 suffered this manuscript to wander about the town from his house so that but ten days ago i saw8134 the song in the third act printed and set to music without my name by mr carnaby in the year 1802 likewise that the same person asserted8135 as i have been assured that the play was rejected because i would not submit to the alteration of one ludicrous line and finally8136 in the year 1806 amused and delighted as who was ever in his company if i may trust the universal report without being amused and delighted a large company at the house of a highly respectable member of parliament with the ridicule of the8137 tragedy as a fair specimen of the whole of which he adduced a line    drip drip drip theres nothing here but dripping  in the original copy of the play in the first scene of the fourth act isidore had commenced his soliloquy in the cavern with the words    drip drip a ceaseless sound of waterdrops81388139  as far as i can at present recollect for on the possible ludicrous association being pointed out to me i instantly and thankfully struck out the line and as to my obstinate tenacity not only my old acquaintance but i dare boldly aver both the managers of drury lane theatre and every actor and actress whom i have recently met in the green room will repel the accusation perhaps not without surprise  i thought it right to record these circumstances8141 but i turn gladly and with sincere gratitude to the converse in the close of last year i was advised to present the tragedy once more to the theatre accordingly having altered the names i ventured to address a letter to mr whitbread requesting information as to whom i was to present my tragedy my letter was instantly and most kindly answered and i have now nothing to tell but a tale of thanks i should scarce know where to begin if the goodness of the manager mr arnold had not called for my first acknowledgements not merely as an acting play but as a dramatic poem the remorse has been importantly and manifoldly benefited by his suggestions i can with severest truth say that every hint he gave me was the ground of some improvement in the next place it is my duty to mention mr raymond the stage manager had the remorse been his own playnay that is saying too littlehad i been his brother or his dearest friend he could not have felt or exerted himself more zealously  as the piece is now acting it may be thought presumptuous in me to speak of the actors yet how can i abstain feeling as i do mrs glovers8142 powerful assistance and knowing the circumstances8143 under which she consented to act alhadra a time will come when without painfully oppressing her feelings i may speak of this more fully to miss smith i have an equal though different acknowledgement to make namely for her acceptance of a character not fully developed and quite inadequate to her extraordinary powers she enlivened and supported many passages which though not perhaps wholly uninteresting in the closet would but for her have hung heavy on the ears of a theatrical audience and in speaking the epilogue a composition which i fear my hurry will hardly excuse and which as unworthy of her name is here 1828 1829 1834 omitted she made a sacrifice which only her established character with all judges of tragic action could have rendered compatible with her duty to herself to mr de camps judgement and full conception of isidore to mr popes accurate representation of the partial yet honourable father to mr ellistons energy in the character of alvar and who in more than one instance gave it beauties and striking points which not only delighted but surprised me and to mr rae8151 to whose zeal and unwearied study of his part i am not less indebted as a man than to his impassioned realization of ordonio as an authorto these and to all concerned with the bringing out of the play i can address but one wordthanksbut that word is uttered sincerely and to persons constantly before the eye of the public a public acknowledgement becomes appropriate and a duty  i defer all answers to the different criticisms on the piece to an essay which i am about to publish immediately on dramatic poetry relatively to the present state of the metropolitan theatres  from the necessity of hastening the publication i was obliged to send the manuscript intended for the stage which is the sole cause of the number of directions printed in italics                                                   s t

selfmade is adduced which determined me to refer to what i had already forgiven and almost forgotten in the year 1806 ms r  8137 the this ms r  8138 private had the piece been really silly and i have proof positive that sheridan did not think it so yet 10 years afterwards to have committed a breach of confidence in order to injure the otherwise    that on the ground of an indiscretion into which he had himself seduced the writer and the writer too a man whose reputation was his breada man who had devoted the firstlings of his talents to the celebration of sheridans geniusand who after he met treatment not only never spoke unkindly or resentfully of it but actually was zealous and frequent in defending and praising his public principles of conduct in the morning postand all this in the presence of men of rank previously disposed to think highly    i am sure you will not be surprised that this did provoke me and that it justifies to my heart the detail here printed

must not see thee wretched    teresa                     there are woes   ill bartered for the garishness of joy   if it be wretched with an untired eye                               20   to watch those skiey tints and this green ocean   or in the sultry hour beneath some rock   my hair dishevelled by the pleasant sea breeze   to shape sweet visions and live oer again   all past hours of delight if it be wretched                        25   to watch some bark and fancy alvar there   to go through each minutest circumstance   of the blest meeting and to frame adventures   most terrible and strange and hear him tell them8241   as once i knew a crazy moorish maid                                30   who drest her in her buried lovers clothes   and oer the smooth spring in the mountain cleft   hung with her lute and played the selfsame tune   he used to play and listened to the shadow   herself had madeif this be wretchedness                         35   and if indeed it be a wretched thing   to trick out mine own deathbed and imagine   that i had died died just ere his return   then see him listening to my constancy   or hover round as he at midnight oft                               40   sits on my grave and gazes at the moon   or haply in some more fantastic mood   to be in paradise and with choice flowers   build up a bower where he and i might dwell   and there to wait his coming o my sire                            45   my alvars sire if this be wretchedness   that eats away the life what were it think you   if in a most assured reality   he should return and see a brothers infant   smile at him from my arms                                          50   oh what a thought    valdez a thought even so mere thought an empty thought   the very week he promised his return    teresa was it not then a busy joy to see him   after those three years travels we had no fears                 55   the frequent tidings the neer failing letter   almost endeared his absence yet the gladness   the tumult of our joy what then if now    valdez o power of youth to feed on pleasant thoughts   spite of conviction i am old and heartless                        60   yes i am oldi have no pleasant fancies   hectic and unrefreshed with rest    teresa                          my father    valdez the sober truth is all too much for me   i see no sail which brings not to my mind   the homebound bark in which my son was captured                    65   by the algerineto perish with his captors    teresa oh no he did not    valdez                    captured in sight of land   from yon hill point nay from our castle watchtower   we might have seen    teresa              his capture not his death    valdez alas how aptly thou forgetst a tale                     70   thou neer didst wish to learn my brave ordonio   saw both the pirate and his prize go down   in the same storm that baffled his own valour   and thus twice snatched a brother from his hopes   gallant ordonio o beloved teresa                                  75   wouldst thou best prove thy faith to generous alvar   and most delight his spirit go make thou   his brother happy make his aged father   sink to the grave in joy    teresa                 for mercys sake   press me no more i have no power to love him                      80   his proud forbidding eye and his dark brow   chill me like dewdamps of the unwholesome night   my love a timorous and tender flower   closes beneath his touch    valdez                 you wrong him maiden   you wrong him by my soul nor was it well                          85   to character by such unkindly phrases   the stir and workings of that love for you   which he has toiled to smother twas not well   nor is it grateful in you to forget   his wounds and perilous voyages and how                            90   with an heroic fearlessness of danger   he roamd the coast of afric for your alvar   it was not wellyou have moved me even to tears    teresa oh pardon me lord valdez pardon me   it was a foolish and ungrateful speech                             95   a most ungrateful speech but i am hurried   beyond myself if i but hear of one   who aims to rival alvar were we not   born in one day like twins of the same parent   nursed in one cradle pardon me my father                        100   a six years absence is a heavy thing   yet still

 alhadra is her name asks audience of you    ordonio hail reverend father what may be the business        110    monviedro my lord on strong suspicion of relapse   to his false creed so recently abjured   the secret servants of the inquisition   have seized her husband and at my command   to the supreme tribunal would have led him                        115   but that he made appeal to you my lord   as surety for his soundness in the faith   though lessoned by experience what small trust   the asseverations of these moors deserve   yet still the deference to ordonios name                         120   nor less the wish to prove with what high honour   the holy church regards her faithful soldiers   thus far prevailed with me that    ordonio                          reverend father   i am much beholden to your high opinion   which so oerprizes my light services      then to alhadra    125   i would that i could serve you but in truth   your face is new to me    monviedro            my mind foretold me   that such would be the event in truth lord valdez   twas little probable that don ordonio   that your illustrious son who fought so bravely                   130   some four years since to quell these rebel moors   should prove the patron of this infidel   the warranter of a morescos faith   now i return    alhadra my lord my husbands name                              135

but me   for mine own self seemd nothing lacking her   this maid so idolized that trusted friend   dishonoured in my absence soul and body   fear following guilt tempted to blacker guilt                   285   and murderers were suborned against my life   but by my looks and most impassioned words   i roused the virtues that are dead in no man   even in the assassins hearts they made their terms   and thanked me for redeeming them from murder                     290    alhadra you are lost in thought hear him no more sweet lady    teresa from morn to night i am myself a dreamer   and slight

to the lowbreathing gale   made a soft sound most like the distant ocean   i stayed as though the hour of death were passed   and i were sitting in the world of spirits   for all things seemed unreal there i sate                       300   the dews fell clammy and the night descended   black sultry close and ere the midnight hour   a storm came on mingling all sounds of fear   that woods and sky and mountains seemed one havock   the second flash of lightning shewed a tree                        305   hard by me newly scathed i rose tumultuous   my soul worked high i bared my head to the storm   and with loud voice and clamorous agony   kneeling i prayed to the great spirit that made me   prayed that remorse might fasten on their hearts                 310   and cling with poisonous tooth inextricable   as the gored lions bite    teresa                 a fearful curse    alhadra but dreamt you not that you returned and killed them   dreamt you of no revenge    alvar                  she would have died   died in her guiltperchance by her own hands                     315   and bending oer her selfinflicted wounds   i might have met the evil glance of frenzy   and leapt myself into an unblest grave   i prayed for the punishment that cleanses hearts   for still i loved her    alhadra             and you dreamt all this                    320    teresa my soul is full of visions all as wild    alhadra there is no room in this heart for puling lovetales    teresa lifts up her veil and advances to alvar stranger       farewell i guess not who you are   nor why you so addressed your tale to me   your mien is noble and i own perplexed me                      325   with obscure memory of something past   which still escaped my efforts or presented   tricks of a fancy pampered with long wishing   if as it sometimes happens our rude startling   whilst your full heart was shaping out its dream                  330   drove you to this your not ungentle wildness   you have my sympathy and so farewell   but if some undiscovered wrongs oppress you   and you need strength to drag them into light   the generous valdez and my lord ordonio                          335

western wall and by an easier entrance   stole after him unnoticed there i marked                         145   that mid the chequer work of light and shade   with curious choice he plucked no other flowers   but those on which the moonlight fell and once   i heard him muttering oer the plant a wizard   some gaunt slave prowling here for dark employment                150    ordonio doubtless you

            175   down in the water at the further end   a puny cataract falls on the lake   and there a curious sight you see its shadow   for ever curling like a wreath of smoke   up through the

breath   floats round the flame and makes as many colours                   25   as the thin clouds that travel near the moon   you see that crevice there   my torch extinguished by these waterdrops   and marking that the moonlight came from thence   i stept in to it meaning to sit there                             30   but scarcely had i measured twenty paces   my body bending forward yea oerbalanced   almost beyond recoil on the dim brink   of a huge chasm i stept the shadowy moonshine   filling the void so counterfeited substance                        35   that my foot hung aslant adown the edge   was it my own fear                       fear too hath its instincts8601   and yet such dens as these are wildly told of   and there are beings that live yet not for the eye   an arm

in huge stones and heard them strike and rattle   against its horrid sides then hung my head                         55   low down and listened till the heavy fragments   sank with faint crash in that still groaning well   which never thirsty pilgrim blest which never   a living thing came nearunless perchance   some blindworm battens on the ropy mould                           60   close at its

youll smile my lord but true it is                     65   my last nights sleep was very sorely haunted   by what had passed between us in the morning   o sleep of horrors now run down and stared at   by forms so hideous that they mock remembrance   now seeing nothing and imagining nothing                           70   but only being afraidstifled with fear   while every goodly or familiar form   had a strange power of breathing terror round me8611   i saw you in a thousand fearful shapes   and i entreat your lordship to believe me                         75   in my last dream    ordonio           well    isidore                 i was in the act   of falling down that chasm when alhadra   wakd me she heard my heart beat    ordonio                         strange enough   had you been here before    isidore                never my lord   but mine eyes do not see it now more clearly                       80   than in my dream i sawthat very chasm    ordonio after a pause i know not why it should be yet it is    isidore what is my lord    ordonio                   abhorrent from our nature   to kill a man    isidore       except in selfdefence    ordonio why thats my case and yet the soul recoils from it   85   tis so with me at least but you perhaps   have sterner feelings    isidore             something troubles you   how shall i serve you by the life you gave me   by all that makes that life of value to me   my wife my babes my honour i swear to you                       90   name it and i will toil to do the thing   if it be innocent but this my lord   is not a place where you could perpetrate   no nor propose a wicked thing the darkness   when ten strides off we know tis cheerful moonlight               95   collects the guilt and crowds it round the heart   it must be innocent    ordonio           thyself be judge   one of our family knew this place well    isidore who when my lord    ordonio                     what boots it who or when   hang up thy torchill tell his tale to thee                     100         they hang up their torches on some ridge in the cavern    he was a man different from other men   and he despised them yet revered himself    isidore aside he he despised thourt speaking of thyself   i am on my guard however no surprise     then to ordonio   what he was mad    ordonio        all men seemed mad to him                       105   nature had made him for some other planet   and pressed his soul into a human shape   by accident or malice in this world   he found no fit companion    isidore of himself he speaks

troubled him   something within would still be shadowing out   all possibilities and with these shadows   his mind held dalliance once as so it happened                  115   a fancy crossed him wilder than the rest   to this in moody murmur and low voice   he yielded utterance as some talk in sleep   the man who heard him                            why didst thou look round    isidore i have a prattler three years old my lord             120   in truth he is my darling as i went   from forth my door he made a moan in sleep   but i am talking idlypray proceed   and what did this man

soul   he was a woodman and could fell and saw   with lusty arm you know that huge round beam                       15   which props the hanging wall of the old chapel   beneath that tree while yet it was a tree   he found a baby wrapt in mosses lined   with thistlebeards and such small locks of wool   as hang on brambles well he brought him home                     20   and reared him at the then lord valdez cost   and so the babe grew up a pretty boy   a pretty boy but most unteachable   and never learnd a prayer nor told a bead   but knew the names of birds and mocked their notes                25   and whistled as he were a bird himself   and all the autumn twas his only play   to gather seeds of wild flowers and to plant them   with earth and water on the stumps of trees   a friar who gathered simples in the wood                          30   a greyhaired man he loved this little boy   the boy loved him and when the friar taught him   he soon could write with the pen and from that time   lived chiefly at the convent or the castle   so he became a rare and learned youth                              35   but o poor wretch he read and read and read   till his brain turned and ere his twentieth year   he had unlawful thoughts of many things   and though he prayed he never loved to pray   with holy men nor in a holy place                                 40   but yet his speech it was so soft and sweet   the late lord valdez neer was wearied with him   and once as by the north side of the chapel   they stood together chained in deep discourse   the earth heaved under them with such a groan                      45   that the wall tottered and had well nigh fallen   right on their heads my lord was sorely frightened   a fever seized him and he made confession   of all the heretical and lawless talk   which brought this judgment so the youth was seized               50   and cast into that hole my husbands father   sobbed like a childit almost broke his heart   and

poem is in humble imitation of the winters tale of shakspeare except that i have called the first part a prelude instead of a first act as a somewhat nearer resemblance to the plan of the ancients of which one specimen is left us in the Æschylean trilogy of the agamemnon the orestes and the eumenides though a matter of form merely yet two plays on different periods of the same tale might seem less bold than an interval of twenty years between a first and second act this is however in mere obedience to custom the effect does not in reality at all depend on the time of the interval but on a very different principle there are cases in which an interval of twenty hours between the acts would have a worse effect i e render the imagination less disposed to take the position required than twenty years in other cases for the rest i shall be well content if my readers will take it up read and judge it as a christmas tale   footnotes  8831 first published in 1817 included in 1828 1829 and 1834

a larger number of fragments properly so called which were published from ms sources in 1893 or are now published for the first time these fragments are taken exclusively from coleridges notebooks the source of anima poetæ 1895 and were collected transcribed and dated by the present editor for publication in 1893 the fragments now published for the first time were either not used by j d campbell in 1893 or had not been discovered or transcribed the very slight emendations of the text are due to the fact that mr campbell printed from copies and that the collection as a whole has now for the second time been collated with the original mss fragments numbered 64 96 98 111 113 in p w 1893 are quotations from the plays and poems of william cartwright 16111643 they are not included in the

and differs from that suggested in 1893 it must be borne in mind that the entries in coleridges notebooks are not continuous and that the additional matter in prose or verse was inserted from time to time wherever a page or half a page was not filled up it follows that the context is an uncertain guide to the date of any given entry pains have been taken to exclude quotations from older writers which coleridge neither claimed nor intended to claim for his own but it is possible that two or three of these fragments of verse are not original  9962 this quatrain described as the concluding

fear thy skinny hand   and thou art long and lank and brown     as is the ribbd seasand    i fear thee and thy glittering eye                                220     and thy skinny hand so brown   fear not fear not thou wedding guest     this body dropt not down    alone alone all all alone     alone on the wide wide sea                                      225   and christ would take no pity on     my soul in agony    the many men so beautiful     and they all dead did lie   and a million million slimy things                                 230     livd onand so did i    i lookd upon the rotting sea     and drew my eyes away   i lookd upon the eldritch deck     and there the dead men lay                                      235    i lookd to heavn and tryd to pray     but or ever a prayer had gusht   a wicked whisper came and made     my heart as dry as dust    i closd my lids and kept them close                              240     till the balls like pulses beat   for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky   lay like a load on my weary eye     and the dead were at my feet    the cold sweat melted from their limbs                            245     ne rot ne reek did they   the look with which they lookd on me     had never passd away    an orphans curse would drag to hell     a spirit from on high                                           250   but o more horrible than that     is the curse in a dead mans eye   seven days seven nights i saw that curse     and yet i could not die    the moving moon went up the sky                                   255     and no where did abide   softly she was going up     and a star or two beside    her beams bemockd the sultry main     like morning frosts yspread                                     260   but where the ships huge shadow lay   the charmed water burnt alway     a still and awful red    beyond the shadow of the ship     i watchd the watersnakes                                      265   they movd in tracks of shining white   and when they reard the elfish light     fell off in hoary flakes    within the shadow of the ship     i watchd their rich attire                                     270   blue glossy green and velvet black   they coild and swam and every track     was a flash of golden fire    o happy living things no tongue     their beauty might declare                                      275   a spring of love gusht from my heart     and i blessd them unaware   sure my kind saint took pity on me     and i blessd them unaware    the selfsame moment i could pray                                 280     and from my neck so free   the albatross fell off and sank     like lead into the sea   v    o sleep it is a gentle thing     belovd from pole to pole                                       285   to maryqueen the praise be yeven   she sent the gentle sleep from heaven     that slid into my soul    the silly buckets on the deck     that had so long remaind                                       290   i dreamt that they were filld with dew     and when i awoke it raind    my lips were wet my throat was cold     my garments all were dank   sure i had drunken in my dreams                                    295     and still my body drank    i movd and could not feel my limbs     i was so light almost   i thought that i had died in sleep     and was a blessed ghost                                         300    the roaring wind it roard far off     it did not come anear   but with its sound it shook the sails     that were so thin and sere    the upper air bursts into life                                    305     and a hundred fireflags sheen   to and fro they are hurried about   and to and fro and in and out     the stars dance on between    the coming wind doth roar more loud                               310     the sails do sigh like sedge   the rain pours down from one black cloud     and the moon is at its edge    hark hark the thick black cloud is cleft     and the moon is at its side                                     315   like waters shot from some high crag   the lightning falls with never a jag     a river steep and wide    the strong wind reachd the ship it roard     and droppd down like a stone                                  320   beneath the lightning and the moon     the dead men gave a groan    they groand they stirrd they all uprose     ne spake ne movd their eyes   it had been strange even in a dream                               325     to have seen those dead men rise    the helmsman steerd the ship movd on     yet never a breeze upblew   the marineres all gan work the ropes     where they were wont to do                                      330   they raisd their limbs like lifeless tools     we were a ghastly crew    the body of my brothers son     stood by me knee to knee   the body and i pulld at one rope                                 335     but he said nought to me   and i quakd to think of my own voice     how frightful it would be    the daylight dawndthey droppd their arms     and clusterd round the mast                                    340   sweet sounds rose slowly thro their mouths     and from their bodies passd    around around flew each sweet sound     then darted to the sun   slowly the sounds came back again                                  345     now mixd now one by one    sometimes a dropping from the sky     i heard the lavrock sing   sometimes all little birds that are   how they seemd to fill the sea and air                            350     with their sweet jargoning    and now twas like all instruments     now like a lonely flute   and now it is an angels song     that makes the heavens be mute                                  355    it ceasd yet still the sails made on     a pleasant noise till noon   a noise like of a hidden brook     in the leafy month of june   that to the sleeping woods all night                               360     singeth a quiet tune    listen o listen thou weddingguest     marinere thou hast thy will   for that which comes out of thine eye doth make     my body and soul to be still                                  365    never sadder tale was told     to a man of woman born   sadder and wiser thou weddingguest     thoult rise tomorrow morn    never sadder tale was heard                                        370     by a man of woman born   the marineres all returnd to work     as silent as beforne    the marineres all gan pull the ropes     but look at me they nold                                       375   thought i i am as thin as air     they cannot me behold    till noon we silently saild on     yet never a breeze did breathe   slowly and smoothly went the ship                                  380     movd onward from beneath    under the keel nine fathom deep     from the land of mist and snow   the spirit slid and it was he     that made the ship to go                                        385   the sails at noon left off their tune     and the ship stood still also    the sun right up above the mast     had fixd her to the ocean   but in a minute she gan stir                                      390     with a short uneasy motion   backwards and forwards half her length     with a short uneasy motion    then like a pawing horse let go     she made a sudden bound                                         395   it flung the blood into my head     and i fell into a swound    how long in that same fit i lay     i have not to declare   but ere my living life returnd                                   400   i heard and in my soul discernd     two voices in the air    is it he quoth one is this the man     by him who died on cross   with his cruel bow he layd full low                              405     the harmless albatross    the spirit who bideth by himself     in the land of mist and snow   he lovd the bird that lovd the man     who shot him with his bow                                      410    the other was a softer voice     as soft as honeydew   quoth he the man hath penance done     and penance more will do   vi     first voice    but tell me tell me speak again                                415     thy soft response renewing   what makes that ship drive on so fast     what is the ocean doing     second voice    still as a slave before his lord     the ocean hath no blast                                        420   his great bright eye most silently     up to the moon is cast    if he may know which way to go     for she guides him smooth or grim   see brother see how graciously                                 425     she looketh down on him     first voice    but why drives on that ship so fast     withouten wave or wind     second voice    the air is cut away before     and closes from behind                                         430    fly brother fly more high more high     or we shall be belated   for slow and slow that ship will go     when the marineres trance is abated    i woke and we were sailing on                                     435     as in a gentle weather   twas night calm night the moon was high     the dead men stood together    all stood together on the deck     for a charneldungeon fitter                                    440   all fixd on me their stony eyes     that in the moon did glitter    the pang the curse with which they died     had never passd away   i could not draw my een from theirs                                445     ne turn them up to pray    and in its time the spell was snapt     and i could move my een   i lookd farforth but little saw     of what might else be seen                                      450    like one that on a lonely road     doth walk in fear and dread   and having once turnd round walks on     and turns no more his head   because he knows a frightful fiend                                455     doth close behind him tread    but soon there breathd a wind on me     ne sound ne motion made   its path was not upon the sea     in ripple or in shade                                           460    it raisd my hair it fannd my cheek     like a meadowgale of spring   it mingled strangely with my fears     yet it felt like a welcoming    swiftly swiftly flew the ship                                    465     yet she saild softly too   sweetly sweetly blew the breeze     on me alone it blew    o dream of joy is this indeed     the lighthouse top i see                                       470   is this the hill is this the kirk     is this mine own countrée    we drifted oer the harbourbar     and i with sobs did pray   o let me be awake my god                                        475     or let me sleep alway    the harbourbay was clear as glass     so smoothly it was strewn   and on the bay the moon light lay     and the shadow of the moon                                      480    the moonlight bay was white all oer     till rising from the same   full many shapes that shadows were     like as of torches came    a little distance from the prow                                    485     those darkred shadows were   but soon i saw that my own flesh     was red as in a glare    i turnd my head in fear and dread     and by the holy rood                                            490   the bodies had advancd and now     before the mast they stood    they lifted up their stiff right arms     they held them strait and tight   and each rightarm burnt like a torch                             495     a torch thats borne upright   their stony eyeballs glitterd on     in the red and smoky light    i prayd and turnd my head away     forth looking as before                                         500   there was no breeze upon the bay     no wave against the shore    the rock shone bright the kirk no less     that stands above the rock   the moonlight steepd in silentness                                505     the steady weathercock    and the bay was white with silent light     till rising from the same   full many shapes that shadows were     in crimson colours came                                         510    a little distance from the prow     those crimson shadows were   i turnd my eyes upon the deck     o christ what saw i there    each corse lay flat lifeless and flat                            515     and by the holy rood   a man all light a seraphman     on every corse there stood    this seraphband each wavd his hand     it was a heavenly sight                                         520   they stood as signals to the land     each one a lovely light    this seraphband each wavd his hand     no voice did they impart   no voice but o the silence sank                                 525     like music on my heart    eftsones i heard the dash of oars     i heard the pilots cheer   my head was turnd perforce away     and i saw a boat appear                                         530    then vanishd all the lovely lights     the bodies rose anew   with silent pace each to his place     came back the ghastly crew   the wind that shade nor motion made                              535     on me alone it blew    the pilot and the pilots boy     i heard them coming fast   dear lord in heaven it was a joy     the dead men could not blast                                    540    i saw a thirdi heard his voice     it is the hermit good   he singeth loud his godly hymns     that he makes in the wood   hell shrieve my soul hell wash away                             545     the albatrosss blood   vii    this hermit good lives in that wood     which slopes down to the sea   how loudly his sweet voice he rears   he loves to talk with marineres                                    550     that come from a far contrée    he kneels at morn and noon and eve     he hath a cushion plump   it is the moss that wholly hides     the rotted old oakstump                                        555    the skiffboat nerd i heard them talk     why this is strange i trow   where are those lights so many and fair     that signal made but now    strange by my faith the hermit said                           560     and they answerd not our cheer   the planks look warpd and see those sails     how thin they are and sere   i never saw aught like to them     unless perchance it were                                        565    the skeletons of leaves that lag     my forestbrook along   when the ivytod is heavy with snow   and the owlet whoops to the wolf below     that eats the shewolfs young                                  570    dear lord it has a fiendish look     the pilot made reply   i am afeardpush on push on     said the hermit cheerily    the boat came closer to the ship                                  575     but i ne spake ne stirrd   the boat came close beneath the ship     and strait a sound was heard    under the water it rumbled on     still louder and more dread                                     580   it reachd the ship it split the bay     the ship went down like lead    stunnd by that loud and dreadful sound     which sky and ocean smote   like one that had been seven days drownd                          585     my body lay afloat   but swift as dreams myself i found     within the pilots boat    upon the whirl where sank the ship     the boat spun round and round                                   590   and all was still save that the hill     was telling of the sound    i movd my lips the pilot shriekd     and fell down in a fit   the holy hermit raisd his eyes                                    595     and prayd where he did sit    i took the oars the pilots boy     who now doth crazy go   laughd loud and long and all the while     his eyes went to and fro                                        600   ha ha quoth hefull plain i see     the devil knows how to row    and now all in mine own countrée     i stood on the firm land   the hermit steppd forth from the boat                            605     and scarcely he could stand    o shrieve me shrieve me holy man     the hermit crossd his brow   say quick quoth he i bid thee say     what manner man art thou                                      610    forthwith this frame of mine was wrenchd     with a woeful agony   which forcd me to begin my tale     and then it left me free    since then at an uncertain hour                                   615     now oftimes and now fewer   that anguish comes and makes me tell     my ghastly aventure    i pass like night from land to land     i have strange power of speech                                  620   the moment that his face i see   i know the man that must hear me     to him my tale i teach    what loud uproar bursts from that door     the weddingguests are there                                    625   but in the gardenbower the bride     and bridemaids singing are   and hark the little vesperbell     which biddeth me to prayer    o weddingguest this soul hath been                               630     alone on a wide wide sea   so lonely twas that god himself     scarce seemed there to be    o sweeter than the marriagefeast     tis sweeter far to me                                           635   to walk together to the kirk     with a goodly company    to walk together to the kirk     and all together pray   while each to his great father bends                              640   old men and babes and loving friends     and youths and maidens gay    farewell farewell but this i tell     to thee thou weddingguest   he prayeth well who loveth well                                   645     both man and bird and beast    he prayeth best who loveth best     all things both great and small   for the dear god who loveth us     he made and loveth all                                          650    the marinere whose eye is bright     whose beard with age is hoar   is gone and now the weddingguest     turnd from the

introduction to the tale of the dark ladie10521  vide ante p 330   to the editor of the morning post  sir  the following poem is the introduction to a somewhat longer one for which i shall solicit insertion on your next open day the use of the old ballad word ladie for lady is the only piece of obsoleteness in it and as it is professedly a tale of ancient times i trust that the affectionate lovers of venerable antiquity as camden says will grant me their pardon and perhaps may be induced to admit a force and propriety in it a heavier objection may be adduced against the author that in these times of fear and expectation when novelties explode around us in all directions he should presume to offer to the public a silly tale of old fashioned love and five years ago i own i should have allowed and felt the force of this objection but alas explosion has succeeded explosion so rapidly that novelty itself ceases to appear new and it is possible that now even a simple story wholly unspired  inspired with politics or personality may find some attention amid the hubbub of revolutions as to those who have resided a long time by the falls of niagara the lowest whispering becomes

                          60  16    and how he crossd the woodmans paths     thro briars and swampy mosses beat   how boughs rebounding scourgd his limbs     and low stubs gord his feet  17    how sometimes from the savage den                                  65     and sometimes from the darksome shade   and sometimes starting up at once     in green and sunny glade  18    there came and lookd him in the face     an angel beautiful and bright                                    70   and how he knew it was a fiend     this misrable knight  19    and how unknowing what he did     he leapt amid

left by a wood the pyrenees are visible in the distance small knots of soldiers all in the military dress of the middle ages are seen passing across the stage then  enter earl henry and sandoval both armed    sandoval a delightful plain this and doubly pleasant   after so long and wearisome a descent from the pyranees   sic did you not observe how our poor over wearied horses   mended their pace as soon as they reached it    earl henry i must entreat your forgiveness gallant               5   castilian i ought ere this to have bade you welcome to my   native navarre    sandoval cheerily general navarre has indeed but ill   repaid your services in thus recalling you from the head of   an army which you yourself had collected and disciplined           10   but the wrongs and insults which you have suffered    earl henry deserve my thanks friend in the sunshine   of courtfavor i could only believe that i loved my queen and   my country now i know it but why name i my country or   my sovereign i owe all my wrongs to the private enmity of          15   the chancellor    sandoval heaven be praised you have atchieved sic   a delicious revenge upon himthat the same courier who   brought the orders for your recall carried back with him the   first tidings of your victoryit was exquisite good fortune       20    earl henry sandoval my gallant friend let me not   deceive you to you i have vowed an undisguised openness   the gloom which overcast me was occasioned by causes of less   public import    sandoval connected i presume with that mansion the            25   spacious pleasure grounds of which we noticed as we were   descending from the mountain lawn and grove river and   hillockit looked within these high walls like a world of   itself    earl henry this wood scarcely conceals these high walls          30   from us alas i know the place too well    nay why too   wellbut wherefore spake you sandoval of this mansion   what know you    sandoval nothing therefore i spake of it on our descent   from the mountain i pointed it out to you and asked to whom         35   it belongedyou became suddenly absent and answered me   only by looks of disturbance and anxiety    earl henry that mansion once belonged to manric sic   lord of valdez    sandoval alas poor man the same who had dangerous             40   claims to the throne of navarre    earl henry claimssay rather pretensionsplausible   only to the unreasoning multitude    sandoval pretensions then with bitterness    earl henry bad as these were the means he employed to           45   give effect to them were still worse he trafficked with france   against the independence of his country he was a traitor   my friend and died a traitors death his two sons suffered   with him and many i fear too many of his adherents    sandoval earl henry a pause if the sentence were just      50   why was not the execution of it public    it is reported that   they werebut no i will not believe itthe honest soul of   my friend would not justify so foul a deed    earl henry speak plainlywhat is reported    sandoval that they were all assassinated by order of the         55   new queen    earl henry accursed be the hearts that framed and   the tongues that scattered the calumnythe queen was   scarcely seated on her throne the chancellor who had been   her guardian exerted a pernicious influence over her               60   judgementshe was taught to fear dangerous commotions in the   capital she was intreated to prevent the bloodshed of the   deluded citizens and thus overawed she reluctantly consented   to permit the reinforcement of an obsolete law and    sandoval they were not assassinated then                    65    earl henry why these bitter tones to me sandoval can   a law assassinate don manrique sic and his accomplices   drank the sleepy poison adjudged by that law in the state   prison at pampilona at that time i was with the army on   the frontiers of france                                            70    sandoval had you been in the capital    earl henry i would have pledged my life on the safety of   a public trial and a public punishment    sandoval poisoned the father and his sonsand this   earl henry was the first act of that queen whom you idolize      75    earl henry no sandoval no this was not her act she   roused herself from the stupor of alarm she suspended in   opposition to the advice of her council all proceedings against   the inferior partisans of the conspiracy she facilitated the   escape of don manriques brother and to donna oropeza his         80   daughter and only surviving child she restored all her fathers   possessions nay became herself her protectress and friend   these were the acts these the first acts of my royal mistress    sandoval and how did donna oropeza receive these favors    earl henry why ask you that did they not fall on her           85   like heavenly dews    sandoval and will they not rise again like an earthly mist   what is gratitude opposed to ambition filial revenge and   womans rivalrywhat is it but a cruel curb in the mouth of   a fiery horse maddening the fierce animal whom it cannot           90   restrain forgive me earl henry i meant not to move   you so deeply    earl henry sandoval you have uttered that in a waking   hour which having once dreamt i feared the return of sleep   lest i should dream it over again my friend his voice            95   trembling i wood the daughter of don manrique but we are   interrupted    sandoval it is fernandez    earl henry struggling with his emotions a truehearted old   fellow                                                         100    sandoval as splenetic as he is brave  enter fernandez    earl henry well my ancient how did you like our tour   through the mountains earl henry sits down on the seat by   the woodside    fernandez but little general and my faithful charger          105   liked it still less

              110   for by my troth i have been laughing at him   even till the merry tears so filled my eyes   that i lost sight of him    sandoval               but wherefore captain    fernandez he hath been studying speeches with fierce gestures   speeches brimfull of wrath and indignation                        115   the which he hopes to vent in open council   and in the heat and fury of this fancy   he graspd your groom of the chamber by the throat   who squeaking piteously ey quoth your brother   i cry you mercy fool hadst been indeed                           120   the chancellor i should have strangled thee    sandoval ha ha poor barnard    fernandez                      what you know my gentleman   my groom of the chamber my sieur barnard hey    sandoval i know him for a barrenpated coxcomb    fernandez but very weedy sir in worthless phrases            125   a sedulous eschewer of the popular   and the colloquialone who seeketh dignity   i th paths of circumlocution it would have   surprisd you tho to hear how natrally   he squeakd when curio had him by the throat                      130    sandoval i know him too for an habitual scorner   of truth    fernandez and one that lies more dully than   old women dream without pretence of fancy   humour or mirth a most disinterested   gratuitous liar    earl henry    ho enough enough                               135   spare him i pray you weret but from respect   to the presence of his lord    sandoval                  i stand reprovd    fernandez i too but that i know our noble general   maintains him near his person only that   if he should ever go in jeopardy                                   140   of being damnd as hes now persecuted   for his virtue and fair sense he may be savd   by the supererogation of this fellows   folly and worthlessness    earl henry                hold hold good ancient   do you not know that this barnard saved my life                   145   well but my brother    fernandez             he will soon be here   i swear by this my sword dear general   i swear he has a heros souli only   wish i could communicate to him   my gift of governing the spleenthen he                          150   has had his colors the drums too of the regiment   all put in caseso that stirs the soldiery    earl henry impetuous boy    fernandez                 nay fear not for them general   the chancellor no doubt will take good care   to let their blood grow cool on garrison duty                     155    sandoval earl henry frown not thus upon fernandez   tis said and all the soldiery believe it   that the five regiments who return with you   will be dispersd in garrisons and castles   and other jails of honourable name                                160   so great a crime it is to have been present   in duty and devotion to a hero    fernandez what now what now the politic chancellor is   the soldiers friend and rather than not give   snug pensions to brave men hell overlook                         165   all small disqualifying circumstances   of youth and health keen eye and muscular limb   hell count our scars and set them down for maims   and gain us thus all privileges and profits   of invalids and superannuate veterans                             170    earl henry tis but an idle rumoursee they come  enter barnard and a number of soldiers their colours wound up and the drums in cases and after them don curio all pay the military honors to the general during this time fernandez has hurried up in front of the stage

from the queens royal persontis rejected    sandoval rejected    barnard making a deep obeisance may it please the earl    earl henry                                                speak       barnard

 walks with sandoval to the back of the stage    don curio to himself freaks freaks but what if they have       savd from bursting   the swelling heart of one whose cup of hope   was savagely dashd downeven from his lips                    245   permitted just to see the face of war   then like a truant boy scourgd home again   one field my whole campaign one glorious battle   to madden one with

henry i spake more harshly to him than need was    sandoval observd you how he pulld his beaver down   doubtless to hide the tears he could not check    earl henry go sooth sic him friendand having reachd       the castle   gain oropezas private ear and tell her                           260   where you have left me  as sandoval is going                            nay stay awhile with me   i am too full of dreams to meet her now    sandoval you lovd the daughter of don manrique    earl henry                                       loved    sandoval did you not say you wood her    earl henry                               once i lovd   her whom i dard not woo    sandoval                   and wood perchance                  265   one whom you lovd not    earl henry           o i were most base   not loving oropeza true i wood her   hoping to heal a deeper wound but she   met my advances with an empassiond pride   that kindled love with love and when her sire                     270   who in his dream of hope already graspd   the golden circlet in his hand rejected   my suit with insult and in memory   of ancient feuds pourd curses on my head   her blessings overtook and baffled them                           275   but thou art stern and with unkindling countenance   art inly reasoning whilst thou listenest to me    sandoval anxiously henry reasoning anxiously   but oropeza    earl henry blessings gather round her   within this wood there winds a secret passage                     280   beneath the walls which open out at length   into the gloomiest covert of the garden   the night ere my departure to the army   she nothing trembling led me through that gloom   and to the covert by a silent stream                              285   which with one star reflected near its marge   was the sole object visible around me   the night so dark so close the umbrage oer us   no leaflet stirrdyet pleasure hung upon us   the gloom and stillness of the balmy nightair                    290   a little further on an arbor stood   fragrant with flowering treesi well remember   what an uncertain glimmer in the darkness   their snowwhite blossoms madethither she led me   to that sweet bower then oropeza trembled                       295   i heard her heart beatif twere not my own    sandoval a rude and searing note my friend    earl henry                                   oh no   i have small memory of aught but pleasure   the inquietudes of fear like lesser streams   still flowing still were lost in those of love                   300   so love grew mightier from the pear and nature   fleeing from pain shelterd herself in joy   the stars above our heads were dim and steady   like eyes suffusd with rapture life was in us   we were all life each atom of our frames                          305   a living souli vowd to die for her   with the faint voice of one who having spoken   relapses into blessedness i vowd it   that solemn vow a whisper scarcely heard   a murmur breathd against a ladys cheek                          310   oh there is joy above the name of pleasure   deep selfpossession an intense repose   no other than as eastern sages feign   the god who floats upon a lotos leaf   dreams for a thousand ages then awaking                          315   creates a world and smiling at the bubble   relapses into bliss ah was that bliss   feard as an alien and too vast for man   for suddenly intolerant of its silence   did oropeza starting grasp my forehead                          320   i caught her arms the veins were swelling on them   thro the dark bower she sent a hollow voice   oh what if all betray me what if thou   i swore and with an inward thought that seemed   the unity and substance of my being                               325   i swore to her that were she red with guilt   i would exchange my unblenchd state with hers   friend by that winding passage to the bower   i now will goall objects there will teach me   unwavering love and singleness of heart                          330   go sandoval i am prepard to meet her   say nothing of mei myself will seek her   nay leave me friend i cannot bear the torment   and inquisition

alike in spring and in autumn but in spring   it is the melancholy of hope in autumn it is the melancholy   of resignation as i was journeying on foot through the   appennine i fell in with a pilgrim in whom the spring and           5   the autumn and the melancholy of both seemed to have   combined in his discourse there were the freshness and the   colours of april         qual ramicel a ramo        tal da pensier pensiero                                        10        in lui germogliava    but as i gazed on his whole form and figure i bethought me   of the not unlovely decays both of age and of the late season   in the stately elm after the clusters have been plucked from   its entwining vines and the vines are as bands of dried withies    15   around its trunk and branches even so there was a memory   on his smooth and ample forehead which blended with the   dedication of his steady eyes that still lookedi know not   whether upward or far onward or rather to the line of meeting   where the sky rests upon the distance but how may i express        20   that dimness of abstraction which lay on the lustre of the   pilgrims eyes like the flitting tarnish from the breath of a sigh   on a silver mirror and which accorded with their slow and   reluctant movement whenever he turned them to any object   on the right hand or on the left it seemed methought as          25   if there lay upon the brightness a shadowy presence of   disappointments now unfelt but never forgotten it was at once   the melancholy of hope and of resignation    we had not long been fellowtravellers ere a sudden tempest   of wind and rain forced us to seek protection in the vaulted        30   doorway of a lone chapelry and we sate face to face each on   the stone bench alongside the low weatherstained wall and   as close as possible to the massy door    after a pause of silence even thus said he like two strangers   that have fled to the same shelter from the same storm not         35   seldom do despair and hope meet for the first time in the   porch of death all extremes meet i answered but yours   was a strange and visionary thought the better then doth it   beseem both the place and me he replied from a visionary   wilt thou hear a vision mark that vivid flash through this         40   torrent of rain fire and water even here thy adage holds   true and its truth is the moral of my vision i entreated him   to proceed sloping his face toward the arch and yet averting   his eye from it he seemed to seek and prepare his words till   listening to the wind that echoed within the hollow edifice        45   and to the rain without         which stole on his thoughts with its twofold sound        the clash hard by and the murmur all round10921    he gradually sank away alike from me and from his own purpose   and amid the gloom of the storm and in the duskiness of that        50   place he sate like an emblem on a rich mans sepulchre or like a   mourner on the sodded grave of an only onean aged mourner   who is watching the waned moon and sorroweth not starting   at length from his brief trance of abstraction with courtesy and   an atoning smile he renewed his discourse and commenced his        55   parable    during one of those short furloughs from the service of the   body which the soul may sometimes obtain even in this its   militant state i found myself in a vast plain which i   immediately knew to be the valley of life it possessed an          60   astonishing diversity of soils here was a sunny spot and   there a dark one forming just such a mixture of sunshine and   shade as we may have observed on the mountains side in an   april day when the thin broken clouds are scattered over   heaven almost in the very entrance of the valley stood             65   a large and gloomy pile into which i seemed constrained to   enter every part of the building was crowded with tawdry   ornaments and fantastic deformity on every window was   portrayed in glaring and inelegant colours some horrible tale   or preternatural incident so that not a ray of light could enter  70   untinged by the medium through which it passed the body   of the building was full of people some of them dancing in and   out in unintelligible figures with strange ceremonies and antic   merriment while others seemed convulsed with horror or   pining in mad melancholy intermingled with these i observed       75   a number of men clothed in ceremonial robes who appeared   now to marshal the various groups and to direct their   movements and now with menacing countenances to drag some   reluctant victim to a vast idol framed of iron bars intercrossed   which formed at the same time an immense cage and the shape        80   of a human colossus    i stood for a while lost in wonder what these things might   mean when lo one of the directors came up to me and with   a stern and reproachful look bade me uncover my head for   that the place into which i had entered was the temple of           85   the only true religion in the holier recesses of which the   great goddess personally resided himself too he bade me   reverence as the consecrated minister of her rites awestruck   by the name of religion i bowed before the priest and humbly   and earnestly intreated him to conduct me into her presence        90   he assented offerings he took from me with mystic   sprinklings of water and with salt he purified and with strange   sufflations he exorcised me and then led me through many   a dark and winding alley the dewdamps of which chilled my   flesh and the hollow echoes under my feet mingled methought     95   with moanings affrighted me at length we entered a large   hall without window or spiracle or lamp the asylum and   dormitory it seemed of perennial nightonly that the walls were   brought to the eye by a number of selfluminous inscriptions in   letters of a pale sepulchral light which held strange neutrality  100   with the darkness on the verge of which it kept its rayless vigil   i could read them methought but though each of the words   taken separately i seemed to understand yet when i took them   in sentences they were riddles and incomprehensible as i   stood meditating on these hard sayings my guide thus addressed    105   meread and believe these are mysteriesat the   extremity of the vast hall the goddess was placed her features   blended with darkness rose out to my view terrible yet vacant   i prostrated myself before her and then retired with my guide   soulwithered and wondering and dissatisfied                    110    as i reentered the body of the temple i heard a deep buzz   as of discontent a few whose eyes were bright and either   piercing or steady and whose ample foreheads with the weighty   bar ridgelike above the eyebrows bespoke observation followed   by meditative thought and a much larger number who were          115   enraged by the severity and insolence of the priests in exacting   their offerings had collected in one tumultuous group and with   a confused outcry of this is the temple of superstition after   much contumely and turmoil and cruel maltreatment on all   sides rushed out of the pile and i methought joined them      120    we speeded from the temple with hasty steps and had now   nearly gone round half the valley when we were addressed by   a woman tall beyond the stature of mortals and with a   something more than human in her countenance and mien which   yet could by mortals be only felt not conveyed by words or        125   intelligibly distinguished deep reflection animated by ardent   feelings was displayed in them and hope without its   uncertainty and a something more than all these which i understood   not but which yet seemed to blend all these into a divine unity   of expression her garments were white and matronly and of        130   the simplest texture we inquired her name my name   she replied is religion    the more numerous part of our company affrighted by the   very sound and sore from recent impostures or sorceries   hurried onwards and examined no farther a few of us struck       135   by the manifest opposition of her form and manners to those   of the living idol whom we had so recently abjured agreed to   follow her though with cautious circumspection she led us to   an eminence in the midst of the valley from the top of which   we could command the whole plain and observe the relation of      140   the different parts to each other and of each to the whole and   of all to each she then gave us an optic glass which assisted   without contradicting our natural vision and enabled us to see   far beyond the limits of the valley of life though our eye   even thus assisted permitted us only to behold a light and         145   a glory but what we could not descry save only that it was   and that it was most glorious    and now with the rapid transition of a dream i had overtaken   and rejoined the more numerous party who had abruptly   left us indignant at the very name of religion they journied     150   on goading each other with remembrances of past oppressions   and never looking back till in the eagerness to recede from the   temple of superstition they had rounded the whole circle of the   valley and lo there faced us the mouth of a vast cavern at   the base of a lofty and almost perpendicular rock the interior    155   side of which unknown to them and unsuspected formed the   extreme and backward wall of the temple an impatient   crowd we entered the vast and dusky cave which was the only   perforation of the precipice at the mouth of the cave sate   two figures the first by her dress and gestures i knew to be    160   sensuality the second form from the fierceness of his demeanour   and the brutal scornfulness of his looks declared himself   to be the monster blasphemy he uttered big words and yet   ever and anon i observed that he turned pale at his own   courage we entered some remained in the opening of the           165   cave with the one or the other of its guardians the rest and   i among them pressed on till we reached an ample chamber   that seemed the centre of the rock the climate of the place   was unnaturally cold    in the furthest distance of the chamber sate an old dimeyed       170   man poring with a microscope over the torso of a statue   which had neither basis nor feet nor head but on its breast   was carved nature to this he continually applied his glass   and seemed enraptured with the various inequalities which it   rendered visible on the seemingly polished surface of the          175   marbleyet evermore was this delight and triumph followed   by expressions of hatred and vehement railing against a being   who yet he assured us had no existence this mystery   suddenly recalled to me what i had read in the holiest recess   of the temple of superstition the old man spake in divers         180   tongues and continued to utter other and most strange   mysteries among the rest he talked much and vehemently   concerning an infinite series of causes and effects which he   explained to be a string of blind men the last of whom   caught hold of the skirt of the one before him he of the next    185   and so on till they were all out of sight and that they all   walked infallibly straight without making one false step   though all were alike blind methought i borrowed courage   from surprise and asked himwho then is at the head to   guide them he looked at me with ineffable contempt not           190   unmixed with an angry suspicion and then replied no one   the string of blind men went on for ever without any beginning   for although one blind man could not move without stumbling   yet infinite blindness supplied the want of sight i burst into   laughter which instantly turned to terrorfor as he started      195   forward in rage i caught a glimpse of him from behind and   lo i beheld a monster biform and janusheaded in the hinder   face and shape of which i instantly recognised the dread   countenance of superstitionand in the terror i awoke

middle classes which was published in 1817 the first fiftysix lines which contain a description of italian mountain scenery were entirely new but the rest of the vision is an amended and softened reproduction of the preface to the lecture of 1795 the moral he desires to point is the falsehood of extremes as religion is the golden mean between superstition and atheism so the righteous

virtues of a sincere christian consecrates a   cultivated genius and the favourable accidents of birth opulence   and splendid connexions it was my good fortune to meet in   a dinnerparty with more men of celebrity in science or polite         5   literature than are commonly found collected round the same   table in the course of conversation one of the party reminded   an illustrious poet scott then present of some verses which   he had recited that morning and which had appeared in   a newspaper under the name of a wareclogue in which fire            10   famine and slaughter were introduced as the speakers the   gentleman so addressed replied that he was rather surprised   that none of us should have noticed or heard of the poem as it   had been at the time a good deal talked of in scotland it   may be easily supposed that my feelings were at this moment            15   not of the most comfortable kind of all present one only sir   h davy knew or suspected me to be the author a man who   would have established himself in the first rank of englands   living poets10973 if the genius of our country had not decreed that   he should rather be the first in the first rank of its philosophers    20   and scientific benefactors it appeared the general wish to   hear the lines as my friend chose to remain silent i chose   to follow his example and mr     scott recited the poem   this he could do with the better grace being known to have   ever been not only a firm and active antijacobin and                  25   antigallican but likewise a zealous admirer of mr pitt both as   a good man and a great statesman as a poet exclusively he   had been amused with the eclogue as a poet he recited it   and in a spirit which made it evident that he would have read   and repeated it with the same pleasure had his own name been           30   attached to the imaginary object or agent    after the recitation our amiable host observed that in his   opinion mr     had overrated the merits of the poetry   but had they been tenfold greater they could not have   compensated for that malignity of heart which could alone have         35   prompted sentiments so atrocious i perceived that my   illustrious friend became greatly distressed on my account but   fortunately i was able to preserve fortitude and presence of   mind enough to take up the subject without exciting even   a suspicion how nearly and painfully it interested me                 40    what follows is the substance of what i then replied but   dilated and in language less colloquial it was not my intention   i said to justify the publication whatever its authors feelings   might have been at the time of composing it that they are   calculated to call forth so severe a reprobation from a good man      45   is not the worst feature of such poems their moral deformity   is aggravated in proportion to the pleasure which they are   capable of affording to vindictive turbulent and unprincipled   readers could it be supposed though for a moment that the   author seriously wished what he had thus wildly imagined              50   even the attempt to palliate an inhumanity so monstrous would   be an insult to the hearers but it seemed to me worthy of   consideration whether the mood of mind and the general state   of sensations in which a poet produces such vivid and fantastic   images is likely to coexist or is even compatible with that        55   gloomy and deliberate ferocity which a serious wish to realize   them would presuppose it had been often observed and all   my experience tended to confirm the observation that prospects   of pain and evil to others and in general all deep feelings of   revenge are commonly expressed in a few words ironically tame       60   and mild the mind under so direful and fiendlike an influence   seems to take a morbid pleasure in contrasting the intensity of   its wishes and feelings with the slightness or levity of the   expressions by which they are hinted and indeed feelings   so intense and solitary if they were not precluded as in almost      65   all cases they would be by a constitutional activity of fancy   and association and by the specific joyousness combined with it   would assuredly themselves preclude such activity passion in   its own quality is the antagonist of action though in an   ordinary and natural degree the former alternates with the latter     70   and thereby revives and strengthens it but the more intense   and insane the passion is the fewer and the more fixed are the   correspondent forms and notions a rooted hatred an inveterate   thirst of revenge is a sort of madness and still eddies round its   favourite object and exercises as it were a perpetual tautology       75   of mind in thoughts and words which admit of no adequate   substitutes like a fish in a globe of glass it moves restlessly   round and round the scanty circumference which it cannot   leave without losing its vital element    there is a second character of such imaginary representations          80   as spring from a real and earnest desire of evil to another   which we often see in real life and might even anticipate from   the nature of the mind the images i mean that a vindictive   man places before his imagination will most often be taken   from the realities of life they will be images of pain and            85   suffering which he has himself seen inflicted on other men and   which he can fancy himself as inflicting on the object of his   hatred i will suppose that we had heard at different times   two common sailors each speaking of some one who had   wronged or offended him that the first with apparent violence         90   had devoted every part of his adversarys body and soul to all   the horrid phantoms and fantastic places that ever quevedo   dreamt of and this in a rapid flow of those outrageous and wildly   combined execrations which too often with our lower classes   serve for escapevalves to carry off the excess of their passions     95   as so much superfluous steam that would endanger the vessel if   it were retained the other on the contrary with that sort of   calmness of tone which is to the ear what the paleness of anger   is to the eye shall simply say if i chance to be made   boatswain as i hope i soon shall and can but once get that          100   fellow under my hand and i shall be upon the watch for him   ill tickle his pretty skin i wont hurt him oh no ill only   cut the   to the liver i dare appeal to all present which   of the two they would regard as the least deceptive symptom   of deliberate malignity nay whether it would surprise them          105   to see the first fellow an hour or two afterwards cordially   shaking hands with the very man the fractional parts of whose   body and soul he had been so charitably disposing of or even   perhaps risking his life for him what language shakespeare   considered characteristic of malignant disposition we see in the      110   speech of the goodnatured gratiano who spoke an infinite   deal of nothing more than any man in all venice         too wild too rude and bold of voice    the skipping spirit whose thoughts and words reciprocally ran   away with each other                                                 115           o be them damnd inexorable dog        and for thy life let justice be accused    and the wild fancies that follow contrasted with shylocks   tranquil i stand here for law    or to take a case more analogous to the present subject             120   should we hold it either fair or charitable to believe it to have   been dantes serious wish that all the persons mentioned by   him many recently departed and some even alive at the time   should actually suffer the fantastic and horrible punishments to   which he has sentenced them in his hell and purgatory                125   or what shall we say of the passages in which bishop jeremy   taylor anticipates the state of those who vicious themselves   have been the cause of vice and misery to their fellowcreatures   could we endure for a moment to think that a spirit like   bishop taylors burning with christian love that a man              130   constitutionally overflowing with pleasurable kindliness who   scarcely even in a casual illustration introduces the image of   woman child or bird but he embalms the thought with so   rich a tenderness as makes the very words seem beauties and   fragments of poetry from euripides or simonidescan we              135   endure to think that a man so natured and so disciplined did   at the time of composing this horrible picture attach a sober   feeling of reality to the phrases or that he would have   described in the same tone of justification in the same luxuriant   flow of phrases the tortures about to be inflicted on a living       140   individual by a verdict of the starchamber or the still more   atrocious sentences executed on the scotch antiprelatists and   schismatics at the command and in some instances under the   very eye of the duke of lauderdale and of that wretched bigot   who afterwards dishonoured and forfeited the throne of great          145   britain or do we not rather feel and understand that these   violent words were mere bubbles flashes and electrical   apparitions from the magic cauldron of a fervid and ebullient fancy   constantly fuelled by an unexampled opulence of language    were i now to have read by myself for the first time the poem         150   in question my conclusion i fully believe would be that the   writer must have been some man of warm feelings and active   fancy that he had painted to himself the circumstances that   accompany war in so many vivid and yet fantastic forms as   proved that neither the images nor the feelings were the result       155   of observation or in any way derived from realities i should   judge that they were the product of his own seething imagination   and therefore impregnated with that pleasurable exultation   which is experienced in all energetic exertion of intellectual   power that in the same mood he had generalized the causes of         160   the war and then personified the abstract and christened it by   the name which he had been accustomed to hear most often   associated with its management and measures i should guess   that the minister was in the authors mind at the moment of   composition as completely ἀπαθὴς ἀναιμόσαρκος as anacreons     165   grasshopper and that he had as little notion of a real person of   flesh and blood         distinguishable in member joint or limb                                        paradise lost ii 668     as milton had in the grim and terrible phantom half person   half allegory which he has placed at the gates of hell i            170   concluded by observing that the poem was not calculated to excite   passion in any mind or to make any impression except on   poetic readers and that from the culpable levity betrayed   at the close of the eclogue by the grotesque union of epigrammatic   wit with allegoric personification in the allusion to the            175   most fearful of thoughts i should conjecture that the rantin   bardie instead of really believing much less wishing the fate   spoken of in the last line in application to any human individual   would shrink from passing the verdict even on the devil himself   and exclaim with poor burns                                          180         but fare ye weel auld nickieben        oh wad ye tak a thought an men        ye aiblins mighti dinna ken                      still hae a stake        im wae to think upon yon den                                   185                      evn for your sake    i need not say that these thoughts which are here dilated   were in such a company only rapidly suggested our kind   host smiled and with a courteous compliment observed that   the defence was too good for the cause my voice faltered             190   a little for i was somewhat agitated though not so much on   my own account as for the uneasiness that so kind and friendly   a man would feel from the thought that he had been the   occasion of distressing me at length i brought out these words   i must now confess sir that i am author of that poem it           195   was written some years ago i do not attempt to justify my   past self young as i then was but as little as i would now   write a similar poem so far was i even then from imagining   that the lines would be taken as more or less than a sport   of fancy at all events if i know my own heart there was            200   never a moment in my existence in which i should have been   more ready had mr pitts person been in hazard to interpose   my own body and defend his life at the risk of my own    i have prefaced the poem with this anecdote because to have   printed it without any remark might well have been understood         205   as implying an unconditional approbation on my part and this   after many years consideration but if it be asked why i   republished it at all i answer that the poem had been attributed   at different times to different other persons and what i had   dared beget i thought it neither manly nor honourable not to         210   dare father from the same motives i should have published   perfect copies of two poems the one entitled the devils   thoughts and the other the two round spaces on the   tombstone but that the three first stanzas of the former which   were worth all the rest of the poem and the best stanza of the       215   remainder were written by a friend southey of deserved   celebrity and because there are passages in both which might   have given offence to the religious feelings of certain readers   i myself indeed see no reason why vulgar superstitions and   absurd conceptions that deform the pure faith of a christian          220   should possess a greater immunity from ridicule than stories of   witches or the fables of greece and rome but there are those   who deem it profaneness and irreverence to call an ape an ape   if it but wear a monks cowl on its head and i would rather   reason with this weakness than offend it                             225    the passage from jeremy taylor to which i referred is found   in his second sermon on christs advent to judgment which   is likewise the second in his years course of sermons among   many remarkable passages of the same character in those   discourses i have selected this as the most so but when this       230   lion of the tribe of judah shall appear then justice shall strike   and mercy shall not hold her hands she shall strike sore strokes   and pity shall not break the blow as there are treasures of   good things so hath god a treasure of wrath and fury and   scourges and scorpions and then shall be produced the shame          235   of lust and the malice of envy and the groans of the oppressed   and the persecutions of the saints and the cares of covetousness   and the troubles of ambition and the insolencies of traitors and   the violences of rebels and the rage of anger and the uneasiness   of impatience and the restlessness of unlawful desires and by       240   this time the monsters and diseases will be numerous and   intolerable when gods heavy hand shall press the sanies and   the intolerableness the obliquity and the unreasonableness the   amazement and the disorder the smart and the sorrow the   guilt and the punishment out from all our sins and pour them        245   into one chalice and mingle them with an infinite wrath and   make the wicked drink off all the vengeance and force it down   their unwilling throats with the violence of devils and accursed   spirits    that this tartarean drench displays the imagination rather            250   than the discretion of the compounder that in short this passage   and others of the same kind are in a bad taste few will deny   at the present day it would doubtless have more behoved   the good bishop not to be wise beyond what is written on   a subject in which eternity is opposed to time and a death           255   threatened not the negative but the positive opposite of life   a subject therefore which must of necessity be indescribable   to the human understanding in our present state but i can   neither find nor believe that it ever occurred to any reader to   ground on such passages a charge against bishop taylors              260   humanity or goodness of heart i was not a little surprised   therefore to find in the pursuits of literature and other works   so horrible a sentence passed on miltons moral character for   a passage in his prose writings as nearly parallel to this of   taylors as two passages can well be conceived to be all his         265   merits as a poet forsoothall the glory of having written the   paradise lost are light in the scale nay kick the beam   compared with the atrocious malignity of heart expressed in the   offensive paragraph i remembered in general that milton had   concluded one of his works on reformation written in the             270   fervour of his youthful imagination in a high poetic strain that   wanted metre only to become a lyrical poem i remembered   that in the former part he had formed to himself a perfect ideal   of human virtue a character of heroic disinterested zeal and   devotion for truth religion and public liberty in act and in       275   suffering in the day of triumph and in the hour of martyrdom   such spirits as more excellent than others he describes as   having a more excellent reward and as distinguished by a   transcendant glory and this reward and this glory he displays and   particularizes with an energy and brilliance that announced the       280   paradise lost as plainly as ever the bright purple clouds in the   east announced the coming of the sun milton then passes to   the gloomy contrast to such men as from motives of selfish   ambition and the lust of personal aggrandizement should against   their own light persecute truth and the true religion and           285   wilfully abuse the powers and gifts entrusted to them to bring   vice blindness misery and slavery on their native country on   the very country that had trusted enriched and honoured them   such beings after that speedy and appropriate removal from   their sphere of mischief which all good and humane men must           290   of course desire will he takes for granted by parity of reason   meet with a punishment an ignominy and a retaliation as   much severer than other wicked men as their guilt and its   consequences were more enormous his description of this   imaginary punishment presents more distinct pictures to the           295   fancy than the extract from jeremy taylor but the thoughts   in the latter are incomparably more exaggerated and horrific   all this i knew but i neither remembered nor by reference   and careful reperusal could discover any other meaning either   in milton or taylor but that good men will be rewarded and          300   the impenitent wicked punished in proportion to their   dispositions and intentional acts in this life and that if the   punishment of the least wicked be fearful beyond conception all words   and descriptions must be so far true that they must fall short   of the punishment that awaits the transcendantly wicked had          305   milton stated either his ideal of virtue or of depravity as an   individual or individuals actually existing certainly not   is this representation worded historically or only   hypothetically assuredly the latter does he express it as his own   wish that after death they should suffer these tortures or as        310   a general consequence deduced from reason and revelation that   such will be their fate again the latter only his wish is   expressly confined to a speedy stop being put by providence to   their power of inflicting misery on others but did he name   or refer to any persons living or dead no but the                   315   calumniators of milton daresay for what will calumny not dare say   that he had laud and strafford in his mind while writing of   remorseless persecution and the enslavement of a free country   from motives of selfish ambition now what if a stern antiprelatist   should daresay that in speaking of the insolencies of                320   traitors and the violences of rebels bishop taylor must have   individualised in his mind hampden hollis pym fairfax   ireton and milton and what if he should take the liberty of   concluding that in the afterdescription the bishop was feeding   and feasting his partyhatred and with those individuals before      325   the eyes of his imagination enjoying trait by trait horror after   horror the picture of their intolerable agonies yet this   bigot would have an equal right thus to criminate the one good   and great man as these men have to criminate the other   milton has said and i doubt not but that taylor with equal           330   truth could have said it that in his whole life he never spake   against a man even that his skin should be grazed he asserted   this when one of his opponents either bishop hall or his   nephew had called upon the women and children in the streets   to take up stones and stone him milton it is known that            335   milton repeatedly used his interest to protect the royalists   but even at a time when all lies would have been meritorious   against him no charge was made no story pretended that he   had ever directly or indirectly engaged or assisted in their   persecution oh methinks there are other and far better feelings     340   which should be acquired by the perusal of our great elder   writers when i have before me on the same table the works   of hammond and baxter when i reflect with what joy and   dearness their blessed spirits are now loving each other it   seems a mournful thing that their names should be perverted to        345   an occasion of bitterness among us who are enjoying that happy   mean which the human toomuch on both sides was perhaps   necessary to produce the tangle of delusions which stifled   and distorted the growing tree of our wellbeing has been torn   away the parasiteweeds that fed on its very roots have been         350   plucked up with a salutary violence to us there remain only   quiet duties the constant care the gradual improvement the   cautious unhazardous labours of the industrious though   contented gardenerto prune to strengthen to engraft and one   by one to remove from its leaves and fresh shoots the slug and        355   the caterpillar but far be it from us to undervalue with light   and senseless detraction the conscientious hardihood of our   predecessors or even to condemn in them that vehemence to   which the blessings it won for us leave us now neither   temptation nor pretext we antedate the feelings in order to         360   criminate the authors of our present liberty light and   toleration the friend no iv sept 7 1809 1818 i 105    if ever two great men might seem during their whole lives   to have moved in direct opposition though neither of them has   at any time introduced the name of the other milton and              365   jeremy taylor were they the former commenced his career   by attacking the churchliturgy and all set forms of prayer   the latter but far more successfully by defending both   miltons next work was against the prelacy and the then   existing churchgovernmenttaylors in vindication and               370   support of them milton became more and more a stern republican   or rather an advocate for that religious and moral aristocracy   which in his day was called republicanism and which even more   than royalism itself is the direct antipode of modern jacobinism   taylor as more and more sceptical concerning the fitness of          375   men in general for power became more and more attached to   the prerogatives of monarchy from calvinism with a still   decreasing respect for fathers councils and for churchantiquity   in general milton seems to have ended in an indifference   if not a dislike to all forms of ecclesiastic government and to     380   have retreated wholly into the inward and spiritual churchcommunion   of his own spirit with the light that lighteth every   man that cometh into the world taylor with a growing   reverence for authority an increasing sense of the insufficiency of   the scriptures without the aids of tradition and the consent of       385   authorized interpreters advanced as far in his approaches not   indeed to popery but to romancatholicism as a conscientious   minister of the english church could well venture milton   would be and would utter the same to all on all occasions he   would tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the            390   truth taylor would become all things to all men if by any   means he might benefit any hence he availed himself in his   popular writings of opinions and representations which stand   often in striking contrast with the doubts and convictions   expressed in his more philosophical works he appears indeed        395   not too severely to have blamed that management of truth   istam falsitatem dispensativam authorized and exemplified by   almost all the fathers integrum omnino doctoribus et coetus   christiani antistitibus esse ut dolos versent falsa veris   intermisceant et imprimis religionis hostes fallant dummodo          400   veritatis commodis et utilitati inserviant    the same antithesis might be carried on with the elements   of their several intellectual powers milton austere condensed   imaginative supporting his truth by direct enunciation of lofty   moral sentiment and by distinct visual representations and in        405   the same spirit overwhelming what he deemed falsehood by   moral denunciation and a succession of pictures appalling or   repulsive in his prose so many metaphors so many allegorical   miniatures taylor eminently discursive accumulative   and to use one of his own words agglomerative still more           410   rich in images than milton himself but images of fancy and   presented to the common and passive eye rather than to the   eye of the imagination whether supporting or assailing he   makes his way either by argument or by appeals to the   affections unsurpassed even by the schoolmen in subtlety            415   agility and logic wit and unrivalled by the most rhetorical of   the fathers in the copiousness and vividness of his expressions   and illustrations here words that convey feelings and words   that flash images and words of abstract notion flow together   and whirl and rush onward like a stream at once rapid and full       420   of eddies and yet still interfused here and there we see a tongue   or islet of smooth water with some picture in it of earth or sky   landscape or living group of quiet beauty    differing then so widely and almost contrariantly wherein   did these great men agree wherein did they resemble each             425   other in genius in learning in unfeigned piety in blameless   purity of life and in benevolent aspirations and purposes for   the moral and temporal improvement of their fellowcreatures   both of them wrote a latin accidence to render education   more easy and less painful to children both of them composed         430   hymns and psalms proportioned to the capacity of common   congregations both nearly at the same time set the glorious   example of publicly recommending and supporting general   toleration and the liberty both of the pulpit and the press   in the writings of neither shall we find a single sentence like      435   those meek deliverances to gods mercy with which laud   accompanied his votes for the mutilations and loathsome   dungeoning of leighton and othersnowhere such a pious prayer   as we find in bishop halls memoranda of his own life concerning   the subtle and witty atheist that so grievously perplexed             440   and gravelled him at sir robert drurys till he prayed to the   lord to remove him and behold his prayers were heard for   shortly afterward this philistinecombatant went to london   and there perished of the plague in great misery in short   nowhere shall we find the least approach in the lives and            445   writings of john milton or jeremy taylor to that guarded   gentleness to that sighing reluctance with which the holy   brethren of the inquisition deliver over a condemned heretic   to the civil magistrate recommending him to mercy and   hoping that the magistrate will treat the erring brother with         450   all possible mildnessthe magistrate who too well knows what   would be his own fate if he dared offend them by acting on their   recommendation    the opportunity of diverting the reader from myself to   characters more worthy of his attention has led me far beyond my     455   first intention but it is not unimportant to expose the false   zeal which has occasioned these attacks on our elder patriots   it has been too much the fashion first to personify the church   of england and then to speak of different individuals who in   different ages have been rulers in that church as if in some         460   strange way they constituted its personal identity why should   a clergyman of the present day feel interested in the defence   of laud or sheldon surely it is sufficient for the warmest   partisan of our establishment that he can assert with   truthwhen our church persecuted it was on mistaken principles     465   held in common by all christendom and at all events far less   culpable was this intolerance in the bishops who were   maintaining the

times of laud and sheldon least intolerant when all   christians unhappily deemed a species of intolerance their   religious duty that bishops of our church were among the first   that contended against this error and finally that since the        480   reformation when tolerance became a fashion the church of   england in a tolerating age has shewn herself eminently   tolerant and far more

fancyand this morning it struck across the eolian harp of my brain that there was something pleasing and emblematic of what i did not distinctly make out in two such lookingglasses fronting each seeing the other in itself and itself in the other have you ever noticed the vault or snug little apartment which the spider spins and weaves for itself by spiral threads round and round and sometimes with strait lines so that its lurking parlour or withdrawingroom is an oblong square this too connected itself in my mind with the melancholy truth that as we grow older the world alas how often it happens that the less we love it the more we care for it the less reason we have to value its shews the more anxious are we about themalas how often do we become more and more loveless as love which can outlive all change save a change with regard to itself and all loss save the loss of its reflex is more needed to sooth us and alone is able so to do what was i saying o i was adverting to the fact that as we advance in years the world that spidery witch spins its threads narrower and narrower still closing on us till at last it shuts us up within four walls walls of flues and films windowlessand well if there be skylights and a small opening left for the light from above i do not know that i have anything to add except to remind you that pheer or phere for mate companion

isaac newton at the end of the last edition of his optics supposes that a very subtile and elastic fluid which he calls aether is diffused thro the pores of gross bodies as well as thro the open spaces that are void of gross matter he supposes it to pierce all bodies and to touch their least particles acting on them with a force proportional to their number or to the matter of the body on which it acts he supposes likewise that it is rarer in the pores of bodies than in open spaces and even rarer in small pores and dense bodies than in large pores and rare bodies and also that its density increases in receding from gross matter so for instance as to be greater at the 1100 of an inch from the surface of any body than at its surface and so on to the action of this aether he ascribes the attractions of gravitation and cohœsion the attraction and repulsion of electrical bodies the mutual influences of bodies and light upon each other the effects and communication of heat and the performance of animal sensation and motion david hartley from whom this account of aether is chiefly borrowed makes it the instrument of propagating those vibrations or configurative motions which are ideas it appears to me no hypothesis ever involved so many contradictions for how can the same fluid be both dense and rare in the same body at one time yet in the earth as gravitating to the moon it must be very rare and in the earth as gravitating to the sun it must be very dense for as andrew baxter well observes it doth not appear sufficient to account how the fluid may act with a force proportional to the body to which another is impelled to assert that it is rarer in great bodies than in small ones it must be further asserted that this fluid is rarer or denser in the same body whether small or great according as the body to which that is impelled is itself small or great but whatever may be the solidity of this objection the following seems unanswerable  if every particle thro the whole solidity of a heavy body receive its impulse from the particles of this fluid it should seem that the fluid itself must be as dense as the very densest heavy body gold for instance there being as many impinging particles in the one as there are gravitating particles in the other which receive their gravitation by being impinged upon so that throwing gold or any heavy body upward against the impulse of this fluid would be like throwing gold thro gold and as this aether must be equally diffused over the whole sphere of its activity it must be as dense when it impels cork as when it impels gold so that to throw a piece of cork upward would be as if we endeavoured to make cork penetrate a medium as dense as gold and tho we were to adopt the extravagant opinions which have been advanced concerning the progression of pores yet however porous we suppose a body if it be not all pore the argument holds equally the fluid must be as dense as the body in order to give every particle its impulse  it has been asserted that sir isaac newtons philosophy leads in its consequences to atheism perhaps not without reason for if matter by any powers or properties given to it can produce the order of the visible world and even generate thought why may it not have possessed such properties by inherent right and where is the necessity of a god matter is according to the mechanic philosophy capable of acting most wisely and most beneficently without wisdom or benevolence and what more does the atheist assert if matter possess those properties why might it not have possessed them from all eternity sir isaac newtons deity seems to be alternately operose and indolent to have delegated so much power as to make it inconceivable what he can have reserved he is dethroned by viceregent second causes  we seem placed here to acquire a knowledge of effects whenever we would pierce into the adyta of causation we bewilder ourselves and all that laborious conjecture can do is to fill up the gaps of imagination we are restless because invisible things are not the objects of visionand philosophical systems for the most part are received not for their truth but in proportion as they attribute to causes a susceptibility of being seen whenever our visual organs shall have become sufficiently powerful     e  dedication11131  ode on the departing year 1796 pp 34  vide ante p 160   to thomas poole of stowey  my dear friend  soon after the commencement of this month the editor of the cambridge intelligencer a newspaper conducted with so much ability and such unmixed and fearless zeal for the interests of piety and freedom that i cannot but think my poetry honoured by being permitted to appear in it requested me by letter to furnish him with some lines for the last day of this year i promised him that i would make the attempt but almost immediately after a rheumatic complaint seized on my head and continued to prevent the possibility of poetic composition till within the last three days so in the course of the last three days the following ode was produced in general when an author informs the public that his production was struck off in a great hurry he offers an insult not an excuse but i trust that the present case is an exception and that the peculiar circumstances which obliged me to write with such unusual rapidity give a propriety to my professions of it nec nunc eam apud te jacto sed et ceteris indico ne quis asperiore limâ carmen examinet et a confuso scriptum et quod frigidum erat ni statim traderem11132 i avail myself of the words of statius and hope that i shall likewise be able to say of any weightier publication what he has declared of his thebaid that it had been tortured11133 with a laborious polish  for me to discuss the literary merits of this hasty composition were idle and presumptuous if it be found to possess that impetuosity of transition and that precipitation of fancy and feeling which are the essential excellencies of the sublimer ode its deficiency in less important respects will be easily pardoned by those from whom alone praise could give me pleasure and whose minuter criticisms will be disarmed by the reflection that these lines were conceived not in the soft obscurities of retirement or under the shelter of academic groves but amidst inconvenience and distraction in sickness and in sorrow11141 i am more anxious lest the moral spirit of the ode should be mistaken you i am sure will not fail to recollect that among the ancients the bard and the prophet were one and the same character and you know that although i prophesy curses i pray fervently for blessings farewell brother of my soul        o ever found the same   and trusted and belovd11142  never without an

defects millstones round the slender neck of its merits it presupposes a long story and this long story which yet is necessary to the complete understanding of the play is not half told albert had sent a letter informing his family that he should arrive about such a time by ship he was shipwrecked and wrote a private letter to osorio informing him alone of this accident that he might not shock maria osorio destroyed the letter and sent assassins to meet albert   worse than all the growth of osorios character is nowhere explainedand yet i had most clear and psychologically accurate ideas of the whole of it   a man who from constitutional calmness of appetites is seduced into pride and the love of power by these into misanthropism or rather a contempt of mankind and from thence by the cooperation of envy and a curiously modified love for a beautiful female which is nowhere developed in the play into a most atrocious guilt a man who is in truth a weak man yet always duping himself into the belief that he has a soul of iron such were some of my leading ideas  in short the thing is but an embryo and whilst it remains in manuscript which it is destined to do the critic would judge unjustly who should call it a miscarriage it furnished me with a most important lesson namely that to have conceived strongly does not always imply the power of successful execution s t c  from early

will be read at one time and under the influence of one set of feelingsthis is an heavy disadvantage for we love or admire a poet in proportion as he developes our own sentiments and emotions or reminds us of our own knowledge  compositions resembling those of the present volume are not unfrequently condemned for their querulous egotism but egotism is to be condemned then only when it offends against time and place as in an history or an epic poem to censure it in a monody or sonnet is almost as absurd as to dislike a circle for being round why then write sonnets or monodies because they give me pleasure when perhaps nothing else could after the more violent emotions of sorrow the mind demands solace and can find it in employment alone but full of its late sufferings it can endure no employment not connected with those sufferings forcibly to turn away our attention to other subjects is a painful and in general an unavailing effort    but o how grateful to a wounded heart    the tale of misery to impart    from others eyes bid artless sorrows flow    and raise esteem upon the base of woe11361  the communicativeness of our nature leads us to describe our own sorrows in the endeavor to describe them intellectual activity is exerted and by a benevolent law of our nature from intellectual activity a pleasure results which is gradually associated and mingles as a corrective with the painful subject of the description true it may be answered but how are the public interested in your sorrows or your description we are for ever attributing a personal unity to imaginary aggregates what is the public but a term for a number of scattered individuals of whom as many will be interested in these sorrows as have experienced the same or similar                                   holy be the lay   which mourning soothes the mourner on his way  there is one species of egotism which is truly disgusting not that which leads us to communicate our feelings to others but that which would reduce the feelings of others to an identity with our own the atheist who exclaims pshaw when he glances his eye on the praises of deity is an egotist an old man when he speaks contemptuously of loveverses is an egotist and your sleek favourites of fortune are egotists when they condemn all melancholy discontented verses  surely it would be candid not merely to ask whether the poem pleases ourselves but to consider whether or no there may not be others to whom it is wellcalculated to give an innocent pleasure with what anxiety every fashionable author avoids the word inow he transforms himself into a third personthe present writernow multiplies himself and swells into weand all this is the watchfulness of guilt conscious that this said i is perpetually intruding on his mind and that it monopolizes his heart he is prudishly solicitous that it may not escape from his lips  this disinterestedness of phrase is in general commensurate with selfishness of feeling men old and hackneyed in the ways of the world are scrupulous avoiders of egotism  of the following poems a considerable number are styled effusions in defiance of churchills line    effusion on effusion pour away11362  i could recollect no title more descriptive of the manner and matter of the poemsi might indeed have called the majority of them sonnetsbut they do not possess that oneness of thought which i deem indispensible sic in a sonnetand not a very honorable motive perhaps i was fearful that the title sonnet might have reminded my reader of the poems of the rev w l bowlesa comparison with whom would have sunk me below that mediocrity on the surface of which i am at present enabled to float  some of the verses allude to an intended emigration to america on the scheme of an abandonment of individual property  the effusions signed c l were written by mr charles lamb of the india houseindependently of the signature their superior merit would have sufficiently distinguished them for the rough sketch of effusion xvi i am indebted to mr favell and the first half of effusion xv was written by the author of joan of arc an epic poem   notes attached to a first draft of the preface to the first edition ms r  i  i cannot conclude the preface without expressing my grateful acknowledgments to mr cottle bristol for the liberality with which with little probability i know of remuneration from the sale he purchased the poems and the typographical elegance by which he endeavoured to recommend them orthe liberal assistance which he afforded me by the purchase of the copyright with little probability of remuneration from the sale of the poems  this acknowledgement which was omitted from the preface to the first edition was rewritten and included in the advertisement to the supplement to the second edition  ii  to earl stanhope    a man beloved of science and of freedom these poems are                  respectfully inscribed by                        the author  in a letter to miss cruikshank  1807 early recollections 1837 i 201 coleridge maintains that the sonnet to earl stanhope which was published in poems 1796 vide ante pp 89 90 was inserted by the fool of a publisher cottle prints inserted by biggs the fool of a printer in order forsooth that he might send the book and a letter to earl stanhope who to prove that he is not mad in all things treated both book and letter with silent contempt in a note cottle denies this statement and maintains that the book handsomely bound and the letter were sent to lord s by mr c himself it is possible that before the book was published coleridge had repented of sonnet dedication and letter and that the handsomely bound volume was sent by cottle and not by coleridge but the dedication is in his own handwriting and proves that he was in the first instance at least particeps criminis see note by j d campbell p w 1893 pp 575 576   contents

and p w 1893 p 544   contents   introduction  the composition of the sonnet has been regulated by boileau in his art  of poetry and since boileau by william preston in the elegant preface  to his amatory poems the rules which they would establish are founded  on the practice of petrarch i have never yet been able to discover either  sense nature or poetic fancy in petrarchs poems they appear to me all  one cold glitter of heavy conceits and metaphysical abstractions however petrarch although not the inventor of the sonnet was the first  who made it popular and his countrymen have taken his poems as the  model charlotte smith and bowles are they who first made the sonnet  popular among the present english i am justified therefore by analogy  in deducing its laws from their compositions  the sonnet then is a small poem in which some lonely feeling is developed it is limited to a particular number of lines in order that the  readers mind having expected the close at the place in which he finds it  may rest satisfied and that so the poem may acquire as it were a totalityin 15 plainer phrase may become a whole it is confined to fourteen lines  because as some particular number is necessary and that particular  number must be a small one it may as well be fourteen as any other  number when no reason can be adduced against a thing custom is a  sufficient reason for it perhaps if the sonnet were comprized in less  than fourteen lines it would become a serious epigram if it extended to  more it would encroach on the province of the elegy poems in which  no lonely feeling is developed are not sonnets because the author has  chosen to write them in fourteen lines they should rather be entitled  odes or songs or inscriptions the greater part of wartons sonnets are  severe and masterly likenesses of the style of the greek επιγραμματα  in a sonnet then we require a developement of some lonely feeling by  whatever cause it may have been excited but those sonnets appear to me  the most exquisite in which moral sentiments affections or feelings  are deduced from and associated with the scenery of nature such  compositions generate a habit of thought highly favourable to delicacy of  character they create a sweet and indissoluble union between the  intellectual and the material world easily remembered from their briefness  and interesting alike to the eye and the affections these are the poems  which we can lay up in our heart and our soul and repeat them when  we walk by the way and when we lie down and when we rise up  hence the sonnets of bowles derive their marked superiority over all  other sonnets hence they domesticate with the heart and become as it  were a part of our identity  respecting the metre of a sonnet the writer should consult his own  conveniencerhymes many or few or no rhymes at allwhatever the  chastity of his ear may prefer whatever the rapid expression of his  feelings will permitall these things are left at his own disposal a sameness in the final sound of its words is the great and grievous defect of the  italian language that rule therefore which the italians have established of exactly four different sounds in the sonnet seems to have arisen  from their wish to have as many not from any dread of finding more but  surely it is ridiculous to make the defect of a foreign language a reason for  our not availing ourselves of one of the marked excellencies of our own  the sonnet says preston will ever be cultivated by those who write on  tender pathetic subjects it is peculiarly adapted to the state of a man  violently agitated by a real passion and wanting composure and vigor of  mind to methodize his thought it is fitted to express a momentary burst  of passion etc now if there be one species of composition more difficult  and artificial than another it is an english sonnet on the italian model  adapted to the agitations of a real passion express momentary bursts  of feeling in it i should sooner expect to write pathetic axes or pour  forth extempore eggs and altars11401 but the best confutation of such idle rules  is to be found in the sonnets of those who have observed them in their  inverted sentences their quaint phrases and incongruous mixture of  obsolete and spenserian words and when at last the thing is toiled and  hammered into fit shape it is in general racked and tortured prose rather  than any thing resembling poetry miss seward who has perhaps  succeeded the best in these laborious trifles and who most dogmatically  insists on what she

or uyttenhove and ptolomœus luxius tasteus were scholar friends of the scottish poet and historian george buchanan 15061582 who prefixes some iambics carolo utenhovio f s to his hexameters franciscanus et fratres in some elegiacs addressed to tasteus and tevius in which he complains of his sufferings from gout and kindred maladies he tells them that groscollius professor of medicine at the university of paris was doctoring him with herbs and by suggestionet spe languentem consilioque juvat hence the three names in another set of iambics entitled mutuus amor in which he celebrates

273   preface to the first edition  pp xiiixvi  compositions resembling those of the present volume are not unfrequently condemned for their querulous egotism but egotism is to be  condemned then only when it offends against time and place as in an  history or an epic poem to censure it in a monody or sonnet is almost  as absurd as to dislike a circle for being round why then write sonnets  or monodies because they give me pleasure when perhaps nothing else  could after the more violent emotions of sorrow the mind demands  amusement and can find it in employment alone but full of its late  sufferings it can endure no employment not in some measure connected  with them forcibly to turn away our attention to general subjects is  a painful and most often an unavailing effort    but o how grateful to a wounded heart   the tale of misery to impart   from others eyes bid artless sorrows flow   and raise esteem upon the base of woe                              15                                              shaw  the communicativeness of our nature leads us to describe our own  sorrows in the endeavour to describe them intellectual activity is exerted  and from intellectual activity there results a pleasure which is gradually  associated and mingles as a corrective with the painful subject of the  description true it may be answered but how are the public  interested in your sorrows or your description we are for ever  attributing personal unities to imaginary aggregateswhat is the public  but a term for a number of scattered individuals of whom as many  will be interested in these sorrows as have experienced the same or  similar                                 holy be the lay   which mourning soothes the mourner on his way  if i could judge of others by myself i should not hesitate to affirm that  the most interesting passages in our most interesting poems are those in  which the author developes his own feelings the sweet voice of cona11441  never sounds so sweetly as when it speaks of itself and i should almost  suspect that man of an unkindly heart who could read the opening of the  third book of the paradise lost without peculiar emotion by a law of  our nature he who labours under a strong feeling is impelled to seek for  sympathy but a poets feelings are all strong quicquid amet valde amat  akenside therefore speaks with philosophical accuracy when he classes  love and poetry as producing the same effects    love and the wish of poets when their tongue   would teach to others bosoms what so charms                       40   their ownpleasures of imagination  there is one species of egotism which is truly disgusting not that  which leads us to communicate our feelings to others but that which  would reduce the feelings of others to an identity with our own the  atheist who exclaims pshaw when he glances his eye on the praises  of deity is an egotist an old man when he speaks contemptuously of  loveverses is an egotist and the sleek favorites of fortune are  egotists when they condemn all melancholy discontented verses  surely it would be candid not merely to ask whether the poem pleases  ourselves but to consider whether or no there may not be others to whom  it is wellcalculated to give an innocent pleasure  i shall only add that each of my readers will i hope remember that  these poems on various subjects which he reads at one time and under  the influence of one set of feelings were written at different times and  prompted by very different feelings and therefore that the supposed  inferiority of one poem to another may sometimes be owing to the temper  of mind in which he happens to peruse it   pp xviixx  preface to the second edition  i return my acknowledgments to the different reviewers for the  assistance which they have afforded me in detecting my poetic deficiencies i have endeavoured to avail myself of their remarks one third of  the former volume i have omitted and the imperfections of the republished  part must be considered as errors of taste not faults of carelessness my  poems have been rightly charged with a profusion of doubleepithets and  a general turgidness i have pruned the doubleepithets with no sparing  hand and used my best efforts to tame the swell and glitter both of  thought and diction this latter fault however had insinuated itself  into my religious musings with such intricacy of union that sometimes  i have omitted to disentangle the weed from the fear of snapping the  flower a third and heavier accusation has been brought against me that  of obscurity but not i think with equal justice an author is obscure  when his conceptions are dim and imperfect and his language incorrect  or unappropriate or involved a poem that abounds in allusions  like the bard of gray or one that impersonates high and abstract  truths like collinss ode on the poetical character claims not to be  popularbut should be acquitted of obscurity the deficiency is in the  reader but this is a charge which every poet whose imagination is  warm and rapid must expect from his contemporaries milton did not  escape it and it was adduced with virulence against gray and collins  we now hear no more of it not that their poems are better understood  at present than they were at their first publication but their fame is  established and a critic would accuse himself of frigidity or inattention  who should profess not to understand them but a living writer is yet  sub judice and if we cannot follow his conceptions or enter into his  feelings it is more consoling to our pride to consider him as lost beneath  than as soaring above us if any man expect from my poems the same  easiness of style which he admires in a drinkingsong for him i have not  written intelligibilia non intellectum adfero  i expect neither profit nor general fame by my writings and i consider  myself as having been amply repayed without either poetry has been to  me its own11461 exceeding great reward it has soothed my afflictions it  has multiplied and refined my enjoyments it has endeared solitude  and it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the good and the  beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me  there were inserted in my former edition a few sonnets of my friend  and old schoolfellow charles lamb he has now communicated to me  a complete collection of all his poems quae qui non prorsus amet illum  omnes et virtutes et veneres odere my friend charles lloyd has  likewise joined me and has contributed every poem of his which he  deemed

yet been able to discover sense nature or poetic fancy in petrarchs poems ca piece of petulant presumption of which i should be more ashamed if i did not flatter myself that it stands alone in my writings the best of the joke is that at the time i wrote it i did not understand a word of italian and could therefore judge of this divine poet only by bald translations of some halfdozen of his sonnets   pp 243245  advertisement  i have excepted the following poems from those which i had determined to omit some intelligent friends particularly requested it observing that what most delighted me when i was young in writing poetry would probably best please those who are young in reading poetry and a man must learn to be pleased with a subject before he can yield that attention to it which is requisite in order to acquire a just taste i however was fully convinced that he who gives to the press what he does not thoroughly approve in his own closet commits an act of disrespect both against himself and his fellowcitizens the request and the reasoning would not therefore have influenced me had they not been assisted by other motives the first in order of these verses which i have thus endeavoured to reprieve from immediate oblivion was originally addressed to the author of poems published anonymously at bristol a second edition of these poems has lately appeared with the authors name prefixed and i could not refuse myself the gratification of seeing the name of that man among my poems without whose kindness they would probably have remained unpublished and to whom i know myself greatly and variously obliged as a poet a man and a christian  the second is entitled an effusion on an autumnal evening written in early youth in a note to this poem i had asserted that the tale of florio in mr rogers pleasures of memory was to be found in the lochleven of bruce i did and still do perceive a certain likeness between the two stories but certainly not a sufficient one to justify my assertion i feel it my duty therefore to apologize to the author and the public for this rashness and my sense of honesty would not have been satisfied by the bare omission of the note no one can see more clearly the littleness and futility of imagining plagiarisms in the works of men of genius but nemo omnibus horis sapit and my mind at the time of writing that note was sick and sore with anxiety and weakened through much suffering i have not the most distant knowledge of mr rogers except as a correct and elegant poet if any of my readers should know him personally they would oblige me by informing him that i have expiated a sentence of unfounded detraction by an unsolicited and selforiginating apology  having from these motives readmitted two and those the longest of the poems i had omitted i yielded a passport to the three others pp 256 262 264 which were recommended by the greatest number of votes there are some lines too of lloyds and lambs in this appendix they had been omitted in the former part of the volume partly by accident but i have reason to believe that the authors regard them as of inferior merit and they are therefore rightly placed where they

biographia literaria was published in july and sibylline leaves in august 1817 see note by j d campbell in p w 1893 pp 551 552   preface  the following collection has been entitled sibylline leaves in allusion to the fragmentary and widely scattered state in which they have been long suffered to remain it contains the whole of the authors poetical compositions from 1793 to the present date with the exception of a few works not yet finished and those published in the first edition of his juvenile poems over which he has no controul11501 they may be divided into three classes first a selection from the poems added to the second and third editions together with those originally published in the lyrical ballads11502 which after having remained many years out of print have been omitted by mr wordsworth in the recent collection of all his minor poems and of course revert to the author second poems published at very different periods in various obscure or perishable journals etc some with some without the writers consent many imperfect all incorrect the third and last class is formed of poems which have hitherto remained in manuscript the whole is now presented to the reader collectively with considerable additions and alterations and as perfect as the authors judgment and powers could render them  in my literary life it has been mentioned that with the exception of this preface the sibylline leaves have been printed almost two years and the necessity of troubling the reader with the list of errata11511 fortyseven in number which follows this preface alone induces me to refer again to the circumstances at the risk of ungenial feelings from the recollection of its worthless causes11512 a few corrections of later date have been addedhenceforward the author must be occupied by studies of a very different kind    ite hinc camŒnÆ vos quoque ite suaves   dulces camŒnÆ nam fatebimur verum   dulces fuistiset tamen meas chartas   revisitote sed pudenter et raro

poemswith a song modernized with some additions from one of our elder poets11514 surely malice itself will scarcely attribute their insertion to any other motive than the wish to keep alive the recollections from early lifei scarcely knew what title i should prefix to the first by imaginary time11515 i meant the state of a schoolboys mind when on his return to school he projects his being in

chronological arrangement of poetry in completed collections is now beginning to find general favour pains have been taken to follow this method in the present edition of s t coleridges poetical and dramatic works as far as circumstances permittedthat is to say as far as the date of composition of each poem was ascertainable and as far as the plan could be carried out without effacing the classes into which the author had himself distributed his most important poetical publication the sibylline leaves namely poems occasioned by political events or feelings connected with them love poems meditative poems in blank verse odes and miscellaneous poems on account of these impediments together with the fact that many a poem such as it appears in its ultimate form is the growth of different periods the agreement with chronology in this edition is approximative rather than perfect yet in the majority of instances the date of each piece has been made out and its place fixed accordingly  in another point of view also the poems have been distributed with relation to time they are thrown into three broad groups representing first the youthsecondly the early manhood and middle lifethirdly the declining age of the poet and it will be readily perceived that each division has its own distinct tone and colour corresponding to the period of life in which it was composed it has been suggested indeed that coleridge had four poetical epochs more or less diversely characterisedthat there is a discernible difference betwixt the productions of his early manhood and of his middle age the latter being distinguished from those of his stowey life which may be considered as his poetic prime by a less buoyant spirit fire they have but it is not the clear bright mounting fire of his earlier poetry conceived and executed when he and youth were housemates still in the course of a very few years after threeandtwenty all his very finest poems were produced his twentyfifth year has been called his annus mirabilis to be a prodigals favourite11691then worse truth a misers pensioner is the lot of man in respect of poetry coleridge was a prodigals favourite more perhaps than ever poet was before                                       the poems produced before the authors twentyfourth year 1796 devoted as he was to the soft strains of bowles have more in common with the passionate lyrics of collins and the picturesque wildness of the pretended ossian than with the welltuned sentimentality of that muse which the overgrateful poet has represented as his earliest inspirer for the young they will ever retain a peculiar charm because so fraught with the joyous spirit of youth and in the minds of all readers that feeling which disposes men to set the bud above the rose fullblown would secure them an interest even if their intrinsic beauty and sweetness were less adequate to obtain it                                       the present editors have been guided in the general arrangement of this edition by those of 1817 and 1828 which may be held to represent the authors matured judgment upon the larger and more important part of his poetical productions they have reason indeed to believe that the edition of 1828 was the last upon which he was able to bestow personal care and attention that of 1834 the last year of his earthly sojourning a period when his thoughts were wholly engrossed so far as the decays of his frail outward part left them free for intellectual pursuits and speculations by a grand scheme of christian philosophy to the enunciation of which in a long projected work his chief thoughts and aspirations had for many years been directed was arranged mainly if not entirely at the discretion of his earliest editor h n coleridge   such alterations only have been made in this final arrangement of the poetical and dramatic works of s t coleridge by those into whose charge they have devolved as they feel assured both the author himself and his earliest editor would at this time find to be either necessary or desirable the observations and experience of eighteen years a period long enough to bring about many changes in literary opinion have satisfied them that the immature essays of boyhood and adolescence not marked with any such prophetic note of genius as certainly does belong to the four schoolboy poems they have retained tend to injure the general effect of a body of poetry that a writer especially a writer of verse should keep out of sight his thirdrate performances is now become a maxim with critics for they are not at the worst effectless they have an effect that of diluting and weakening to the readers feelings the general power of the collection mr coleridge himself constantly after 1796 rejected a certain portion of his earliest published juvenilia never printed any attempts of his boyhood except those four with which the present publication commences and there can be no doubt that the editor of 1834 would ere now have come to the conclusion that only such of the authors early performances as were sealed by his own approval ought to form a permanent part of the body of his poetical works                                       it must be added that time has robbed of their charm certain sportive effusions of mr coleridges later years which were given to the public in the first gloss and glow of novelty in 1834 and has proved that though not devoid of the quality of genius they possess upon the whole not more than an ephemeral interest these the editors have not scrupled to omit on the same grounds and in the same confidence that has been already explained                                                                                                   s c    chester place

advanced him various sums of money on the security of the sheets as printed and the future sale of the works when published they were angry with him for postponing completion of these works and keeping them out of their money and he was naturally and reasonably indignant at the excessive sum charged for paper and printing the fact was that they had done and intended to do him a kindness but
