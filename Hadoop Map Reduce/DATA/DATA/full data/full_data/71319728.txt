71319728	town geology     preface    this little book including the greater part of this preface has  shaped itself out of lectures given to the young men of the city of  chester  but it does not deal in its present form with the geology  of the neighbourhood of chester only  i have tried so to recast it  that any townsman at least in the manufacturing districts of england  and scotland may learn from it to judge roughly perhaps but on the  whole accurately of the rocks and soils of his own neighbourhood   he will find it is true in these pages little or nothing about  those old red sandstones so interesting to a scotchman and he  will have to bear in mind if he belong to the coal districts of  scotland that the stones in the wall there belong to much older  rocks than those new red sandstones of which this book treats and  that the coal measures of scotland with the volcanic rocks which  have disturbed them are often very different in appearance to the  english coal measures  but he will soon learn to distinguish the  relative age of rocks by the fossils found in them which he can now  happily study in many local museums and he may be certain for the  rest that all rocks and soils whatsoever which he may meet have been  laid down by the agents and according to the laws which i have  tried to set forth in this book and these only require for the  learning of them the exercise of his own observation and common  sense  i have not tried to make this a handbook of geological facts   such a guide and none better the young man will find in sir charles  lyells students elements of geology  i have tried rather to  teach the method of geology than its facts to furnish the student  with a key to all geology rough indeed and rudimentary but sure and  sound enough i trust to help him to unlock most geological problems  which he may meet in any quarter of the globe  but young men must  remember always that neither this book nor all the books in the  world will make them geologists  no amount of book learning will  make a man a scientific man nothing but patient observation and  quiet and fair thought over what he has observed  he must go out for  himself see for himself compare and judge for himself in the  field the quarry the cutting  he must study rocks ores fossils  in the nearest museum and thus store his head not with words but  with facts  he must verifyas far as he canwhat he reads in  books by his own observation and be slow to believe anything even  on the highest scientific authority till he has either seen it or  something like enough to it to make it seem to him probable or at  least possible  so and so only will he become a scientific man  and a good geologist and acquire that habit of mind by which alone  he can judge fairly and wisely of facts of any kind whatsoever  i sayfacts of any kind whatsoever  if any of my readers should be  inclined to say to themselves  geology may be a very pleasant study  but i have no special fancy for it  i had rather learn something of  botany astronomy chemistry or what noti shall answer  by all  means  learn any branch of natural science you will  it matters  little to me which you learn provided you learn one at least  but  bear in mind and settle it in your hearts that you will learn no  branch of science soundly so as to master it and be able to make  use of it unless you acquire that habit and method of mind which i  am trying to teach you in this book  i have tried to teach it you by  geology because geology is perhaps the simplest and the easiest of  all physical sciences  it appeals more than any to mere common  sense  it requires fewer difficult experiments and expensive  apparatus  it requires less previous knowledge of other sciences  whether pure or mixed at least in its rudimentary stages  it is  more free from long and puzzling greek and latin words  it is  specially the poor mans science  but if you do not like it study  something else  only study that as you must study geology  proceeding from the known to the unknown by observation and  experiment  but here some of my readers may ask as they have a perfect right to  ask why i wish young men to learn natural science at all  what good  will the right understanding of geology or of astronomy or of  chemistry or of the plants or animals which they meetwhat good i  say will that do them  in the first place they need i presume occupation after their  hours of work  if any of them answer  we do not want occupation  we want amusement  work is very dull and we want something which  will excite our fancy imagination sense of humour  we want poetry  fiction even a good laugh or a game of playi shall most fully  agree with them  there is often no better medicine for a hardworked  body and mind than a good laugh and the man who can play most  heartily when he has a chance of playing is generally the man who can  work most heartily when he must work  but there is certainly nothing  in the study of physical science to interfere with genial hilarity  though indeed some solemn persons have been wont to reprove the  members of the british association and specially that red lion club  where all the philosophers are expected to lash their tails and roar  of being somewhat too fond of mere and sheer fun after the abstruse  papers of the day are read and discussed  and as for harmless  amusement and still more for the free exercise of the fancy and the  imagination i know few studies to compare with natural history with  the search for the most beautiful and curious productions of nature  amid her loveliest scenery and in her freshest atmosphere  i have  known again and again working men who in the midst of smoky cities  have kept their bodies their minds and their hearts healthy and  pure by going out into the country at odd hours and making  collections of fossils plants insects birds or some other objects  of natural history and i doubt not that such will be the case with  some of my readers  another argument and a very strong one in favour of studying some  branch of natural science just now is thisthat without it you can  hardly keep pace with the thought of the world around you  over and above the solid gain of a scientific habit of mind of which  i shall speak presently the gain of mere facts the increased  knowledge of this planet on which we live is very valuable just now  valuable certainly to all who do not wish their children and their  younger brothers to know more about the universe than they do  natural science is now occupying a more and more important place in  education  oxford cambridge the london university the public  schools one after another are taking up the subject in earnest so  are the middleclass schools so i trust will all primary schools  throughout the country and i hope that my children at least if not  i myself will see the day when ignorance of the primary laws and  facts of science will be looked on as a defect only second to  ignorance of the primary laws of religion and morality  i speak strongly but deliberately  it does seem to me strange to  use the mildest word that people whose destiny it is to live even  for a few short years on this planet which we call the earth and  who do not at all intend to live on it as hermits shutting  themselves up in cells and looking on death as an escape and a  deliverance but intend to live as comfortably and wholesomely as  they can they and their children after themit seems strange i  say that such people should in general be so careless about the  constitution of this same planet and of the laws and facts on which  depend not merely their comfort and their wealth but their health  and their very lives and the health and the lives of their children  and descendants  i know some will say at least to themselves  what need for us to  study science  there are plenty to do that already and we shall be  sure sooner or later to profit by their discoveries and meanwhile it  is not science which is needed to make mankind thrive but simple  common sense  i should reply that to expect to profit by other mens discoveries  when you do not pay for themto let others labour in the hope of  entering into their labours is not a very noble or generous state of  mindcomparable somewhat i should say to that of the fatting ox  who willingly allows the farmer to house him till for him feed him  provided only he himself may lounge in his stall and eat and not be  thankful  there is one difference in the two cases but only one that while the farmer can repay himself by eating the ox the  scientific man cannot repay himself by eating you and so never gets  paid in most cases at all  but as for mankind thriving by common sense  they have not thriven  by common sense because they have not used their common sense  according to that regulated method which is called science  in no  age in no country as yet have the majority of mankind been guided  i will not say by the love of god and by the fear of god but even  by sense and reason  not sense and reason but nonsense and  unreason prejudice and fancy greed and haste have led them to such  results as were to be expectedto superstitions persecutions wars  famines pestilence hereditary diseases poverty wastewaste  incalculable and now too often irremediablewaste of life of  labour of capital of raw material of soil of manure of every  bounty which god has bestowed on man till as in the eastern  mediterranean whole countries some of the finest in the world seem  ruined for ever  and all because men will not learn nor obey those  physical laws of the universe which whether we be conscious of them  or not are all around us like walls of iron and of adamantsay  rather like some vast machine ruthless though beneficent among the  wheels of which if we entangle ourselves in our rash ignorance they  will not stop to set us free but crush us as they have crushed  whole nations and whole races ere now to powder  very terrible  though very calm is outraged nature   though the mills of god grind slowly    yet they grind exceeding small though he sit and wait with patience    with exactness grinds he all   it is i believe one of the most hopeful among the many hopeful  signs of the times that the civilised nations of europe and america  are awakening slowly but surely to this truth  the civilised world  is learning thank god more and more of the importance of physical  science year by year thank god it is learning to live more and  more according to those laws of physical science which are as the  great lord bacon said of old none other than vox dei in rebus  revelatathe word of god revealed in facts and it is gaining by so  doing year by year more and more of health and wealth of peaceful  and comfortable even of graceful and elevating means of life for  fresh millions  if you want to know what the study of physical science has done for  man look as a single instance at the science of sanatory reform  the science which does not merely try to cure disease and shut the  stabledoor after the horse is stolen but tries to prevent disease  and thank god is succeeding beyond our highest expectations  or  look at the actual fresh amount of employment of subsistence which  science has during the last century given to men and judge for  yourselves whether the study of it be not one worthy of those who  wish to help themselves and in so doing to help their fellowmen   let me quote to you a passage from an essay urging the institution of  schools of physical science for artisans which says all i wish to  say and more  the discoveries of voltaic electricity electromagnetism and  magnetic electricity by volta oersted and faraday led to the  invention of electric telegraphy by wheatstone and others and to the  great manufactures of telegraph cables and telegraph wire and of the  materials required for them  the value of the cargo of the great  eastern alone in the recent bombay telegraph expedition was  calculated at three millions of pounds sterling  it also led to the  employment of thousands of operators to transmit the telegraphic  messages and to a great increase of our commerce in nearly all its  branches by the more rapid means of communication  the discovery of  voltaic electricity further led to the invention of electroplating  and to the employment of a large number of persons in that business   the numerous experimental researches on specific heat latent heat  the tension of vapours the properties of water the mechanical  effect of heat etc resulted in the development of steamengines  and railways and the almost endless employments depending upon their  construction and use  about a quarter of a million of persons are  employed on railways alone in great britain  the various original  investigations on the chemical effects of light led to the invention  of photography and have given employment to thousands of persons who  practise that process or manufacture and prepare the various  material and articles required in it  the discovery of chlorine by  scheele led to the invention of the modern processes of bleaching  and to various improvements in the dyeing of the textile fabrics and  has given employment to a very large number of our lancashire  operatives  the discovery of chlorine has also contributed to the  employment of thousands of printers by enabling esparto grass to be  bleached and formed into paper for the use of our daily press  the  numerous experimental investigations in relation to coalgas have  been the means of extending the use of that substance and of  increasing the employment of workmen and others connected with its  manufacture  the discovery of the alkaline metals by davy of  cyanide of potassium of nickel phosphorus the common acids and a  multitude of other substances has led to the employment of a whole  army of workmen in the conversion of those substances into articles  of utility  the foregoing examples might be greatly enlarged upon  and a great many others might be selected from the sciences of  physics and chemistry  but those mentioned will suffice  there is  not a force of nature nor scarcely a material substance that we  employ which has not been the subject of several and in some cases  of numerous original experimental researches many of which have  resulted in a greater or less degree in increasing the employment  for workmen and others 1  all this may be very true  but of what practical use will physical  science be to me  let me ask in return  are none of you going to emigrate  if you  have courage and wisdom emigrate you will some of you instead of  stopping here to scramble over each others backs for the scraps  like blackbeetles in a kitchen  and if you emigrate you will soon  find out if you have eyes and common sense that the vegetable  wealth of the world is no more exhausted than its mineral wealth   exhausted  not half of iti believe not a tenth of itis yet  known  could i show you the wealth which i have seen in a single  tropic island not sixty miles squareprecious timbers gums  fruits what not enough to give employment and wealth to thousands  and tens of thousands wasting for want of being known and worked then you would see what a man who emigrates may do by a little sound  knowledge of botany alone  and if not  suppose that any one of you learning a little sound  natural history should abide here in britain to your lifes end and  observe nothing but the hedgerow plants he would find that there is  much more to be seen in those mere hedgerow plants than he fancies  now  the microscope will reveal to him in the tissues of any wood  of any seed wonders which will first amuse him then puzzle him and  at last i hope awe him as he perceives that smallness of size  interferes in no way with perfection of development and that  nature as has been well said is greatest in that which is  least  and more  suppose that he went further still  suppose that  he extended his researches somewhat to those minuter vegetable forms  the mosses fungi lichens suppose that he went a little further  still and tried what the microscope would show him in any stagnant  pool whether fresh water or salt of desmidiae diatoms and all  those wondrous atomies which seem as yet to defy our classification  into plants or animals  suppose he learnt something of this but  nothing of aught else  would he have gained no solid wisdom  he  would be a stupider man than i have a right to believe any of my  readers to be if he had not gained thereby somewhat of the most  valuable of treasuresnamely that inductive habit of mind that  power of judging fairly of facts without which no good or lasting  work will be done whether in physical science in social science in  politics in philosophy in philology or in history  but more  let me urge you to study natural science on grounds which  may be to you new and unexpectedon social i had almost said on  political grounds  we all know and i trust we all love the names of liberty equality  and brotherhood  we feel i trust that these words are too  beautiful not to represent true and just ideas and that therefore  they will come true and be fulfilled somewhen somewhere somehow   it may be in a shape very different from that which you or i or any  man expects but still they will be fulfilled  but if they are to come true it is we the individual men who must  help them to come true for the whole world by practising them  ourselves when and where we can  and i tell youthat in becoming  scientific men in studying science and acquiring the scientific  habit of mind you will find yourselves enjoying a freedom an  equality a brotherhood such as you will not find elsewhere just  now  freedom  what do we want freedom for  for this at least that we  may be each and all able to think what we choose and to say what we  choose also provided we do not say it rudely or violently so as to  provoke a breach of the peace  that last was mr buckles definition  of freedom of speech  that was the only limit to it which he would  allow and i think that that is mr john stuart mills limit also   it is mine  and i think we have that kind of freedom in these  islands as perfectly as any men are likely to have it on this earth  but what i complain of is that when men have got the freedom three  out of four of them will not use it  whatsomeone will answerdo  you suppose that i will not say what i choose and that i dare not  speak my own mind to any man  doubtless  but are you sure first  that you think what you choose or only what someone else chooses for  you  are you sure that you make up your own mind before you speak  or let someone else make it up for you  your speech may be free  enough my good friend and heaven forbid that it should be anything  else  but are your thoughts free likewise  are you sure that  though you may hate bigotry in others you are not somewhat of a  bigot yourself  that you do not look at only one side of a question  and that the one which pleases you  that you do not take up your  opinions at second hand from some book or some newspaper which  after all only reflects your own feelings your own opinions  you  should ask yourselves that question seriously and often  are my  thoughts really free  no one values more highly than i do the  advantage of a free press  but you must remember always that a  newspaper editor however honest or able is no more infallible than  the pope that he may just as you may only see one side of a  question while any question is sure to have two sides or perhaps  three or four and if you only see the side which suits you day  after day month after month you must needs become bigoted to it   your thoughts must needs run in one groove  they cannot as mr  matthew arnold would say play freely round a question and look it  all over boldly patiently rationally charitably  and i tell you that if you or i or any man want to let our  thoughts play freely round questions and so escape from the tendency  to become bigoted and narrowminded which there is in every human  being then we must acquire something of that inductive habit of mind  which the study of natural science gives  it is after all as  professor huxley says only common sense well regulated  but then it  is well regulated and how precious it is if you can but get it   the art of seeing the art of knowing what you see the art of  comparing of perceiving true likenesses and true differences and so  of classifying and arranging what you see  the art of connecting  facts together in your own mind in chains of cause and effect and  that accurately patiently calmly without prejudice vanity or  temperthis is what is wanted for true freedom of mind  but  accuracy patience freedom from prejudice carelessness for all  except the truth whatever the truth may beare not these the  virtues of a truly free spirit  then as i said just now i know no  study so able to give that free habit of mind as the study of natural  science  equality too  whatever equality may or may not be just or  possible this at least is just and i hope possible that every  man every child of every rank should have an equal chance of  education an equal chance of developing all that is in him by  nature an equal chance of acquiring a fair knowledge of those facts  of the universe which specially concern him and of having his reason  trained to judge of them  i say whatever equal rights men may or  may not have they have this right  let every boy every girl have  an equal and sound education  if i had my way i would give the same  education to the child of the collier and to the child of a peer  i  would see that they were taught the same things and by the same  method  let them all begin alike say i  they will be handicapped  heavily enough as they go on in life without our handicapping them  in their first race  whatever stable they come out of whatever  promise they show let them all train alike and start fair and let  the best colt win  well  but there is a branch of education in which even now the  poor man can compete fairly against the rich and that is natural  science  in the first place the rich blind to their own interest  have neglected it hitherto in their schools so that they have not  the start of the poor man on that subject which they have on many   in the next place natural science is a subject which a man cannot  learn by paying for teachers  he must teach it himself by patient  observation by patient common sense  and if the poor man is not the  rich mans equal in those qualities it must be his own fault not  his purses  many shops have i seen about the world in which fools  could buy articles more or less helpful to them but never saw i yet  an observationshop nor a commonsense shop either  and if any man  says we must buy books i answer a poor man now can obtain better  scientific books than a duke or a prince could sixty years ago  simply because then the books did not exist  when i was a boy i  would have given much or rather my father would have given much if  i could have got hold of such scientific books as are to be found now  in any firstclass elementary school  and if more expensive books  are needed if a microscope or apparatus is needed can you not get  them by the cooperative method which has worked so well in other  matters  can you not form yourselves into a natural science club  for buying such things and lending them round among your members and  for discussion also the reading of scientific papers of your own  writing the comparing of your observations general mutual help and  mutual instructions  such societies are becoming numerous now and  gladly should i see one in every town  for in science as in most  matters as iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the  countenance of his friend  and brotherhood  well if you want that if you want to mix with  men and men too eminently worth mixing with on the simple ground  that a mans a man for a that if you want to become the  acquaintances andif you prove worthythe friends of men who will  be glad to teach you all they know and equally glad to learn from  you anything you can teach them asking no questions about you save  firstis he an honest student of nature for her own sake  and next is he a man who will not quarrel or otherwise behave in an  unbrotherly fashion to his fellowstudentsif you want a ground of  brotherhood with men not merely in these islands but in america on  the continentin a word all over the worldsuch as rank wealth  fashion or other artificial arrangements of the world cannot give  and cannot take away if you want to feel yourself as good as any man  in theory because you are as good as any man in practice except  those who are better than you in the same line which is open to any  and every man if you wish to have the inspiring and ennobling  feeling of being a brother in a great freemasonry which owns no  difference of rank of creed or of nationalitythe only  freemasonry the only international league which is likely to make  mankind as we all hope they will be some day onethen become men  of science  join the freemasonry in which hugh miller the poor  cromarty stonemason in which michael faraday the poor bookbinders  boy became the companions and friends of the noblest and most  learned on earth looked up to by them not as equals merely but as  teachers and guides because philosophers and discoverers  do you wish to be great  then be great with true greatness which  isknowing the facts of nature and being able to use them  do you  wish to be strong  then be strong with true strength which is  knowing the facts of nature and being able to use them  do you wish  to be wise  then be wise with true wisdom which is knowing the  facts of nature and being able to use them  do you wish to be free   then be free with true freedom which is again knowing the facts of  nature and being able to use them  i dare say some of my readers especially the younger ones will  demur to that last speech of mine  well i hope they will not be  angry with me for saying it  i at least shall certainly not he  angry with them  for when i was young i was very much of what i  suspect is their opinion  i used to think one could get perfect  freedom and social reform and all that i wanted by altering the  arrangements of society and legislation by constitutions and acts  of parliament by putting society into some sort of freedommill and  grinding it all down and regenerating it so  and that something can  be done by improved arrangements something can be done by acts of  parliament i hold still as every rational man must hold  but as i grew older i began to see that if things were to be got  right the freedommill would do very little towards grinding them  right however well and amazingly it was made  i began to see that  what sort of flour came out at one end of the mill depended mainly  on what sort of grain you had put in at the other and i began to see  that the problem was to get good grain and then good flour would be  turned out even by a very clumsy oldfashioned sort of mill  and  what do i mean by good grain  good men honest men accurate men  righteous men patient men selfrestraining men fair men modest  men  men who are aware of their own vast ignorance compared with the  vast amount that there is to be learned in such a universe as this   men who are accustomed to look at both sides of a question who  instead of making up their minds in haste like bigots and fanatics  wait like wise men for more facts and more thought about the facts   in one word men who had acquired just the habit of mind which the  study of natural science can give and must give for without it  there is no use studying natural science and the man who has not got  that habit of mind if he meddles with science will merely become a  quack and a charlatan only fit to get his bread as a spiritrapper  or an inventor of infallible pills  and when i saw that i said to myselfi will train myself by  natural science to the truly rational and therefore truly able and  useful habit of mind and more i will for it is my duty as an  englishman train every englishman over whom i can get influence in  the same scientific habit of mind that i may if possible make him  too a rational and an able man  and therefore knowing that most of you my readersprobably all of  you as you ought and must if you are britons think much of social  and political questionstherefore i say i entreat you to  cultivate the scientific spirit by which alone you can judge justly  of those questions  i ask you to learn how to conquer nature by  obeying her as the great lord bacon said two hundred and fifty  years ago  for so only will you in your theories and your movements  draw bills which nature will honourto use mr carlyles famous  parablebecause they are according to her unchanging laws and not  have them returned on your hands as too many theorists are with  no effects written across their backs  take my advice for yourselves dear readers and for your children  after you for believe me i am showing you the way to true and  useful and therefore to just and deserved power  i am showing you  the way to become members of what i trust will bewhat i am certain  ought to bethe aristocracy of the future  i say it deliberately as a student of society and of history  power  will pass more and more if all goes healthily and well into the  hands of scientific men into the hands of those who have made due  use of that great heirloom which the philosophers of the seventeenth  century left for the use of future generations and specially of the  teutonic race  for the rest events seem but too likely to repeat themselves again  and again all over the world in the same hopeless circle   aristocracies of mere birth decay and die and give place to  aristocracies of mere wealth and they again to aristocracies of  genius which are really aristocracies of the noisiest of mere  scribblers and spouters such as france is writhing under at this  moment  and when these last have blown off their steam with mighty  roar but without moving the engine a single yard then they are but  too likely to give place to the worst of all aristocracies the  aristocracy of mere order which means organised brute force and  military despotism  and after that what can come save anarchy  and decay and social death  what elseunless there be left in the nation in the society as  the salt of the land to keep it all from rotting a sufficient  number of wise men to form a true working aristocracy an aristocracy  of sound and rational science  if they be strong enough and they  are growing stronger day by day over the civilised world on them  will the future of that world mainly depend  they will rule and  they will actcautiously we may hope and modestly and charitably  because in learning true knowledge they will have learnt also their  own ignorance and the vastness the complexity the mystery of  nature  but they will be able to rule they will be able to act  because they have taken the trouble to learn the facts and the laws  of nature  they will rule and their rule if they are true to  themselves will be one of health and wealth and peace of prudence  and of justice  for they alone will be able to wield for the benefit  of man the brute forces of nature because they alone will have  stooped to conquer nature by obeying her  so runs my dream  i ask my young readers to help towards making that  dream a fact by becoming as many of them as feel the justice of my  words honest and earnest students of natural science  but now  why should i as a clergyman interest myself specially in  the spread of natural science  am i not going out of my proper  sphere to meddle with secular matters  am i not indeed going into  a sphere out of which i had better keep myself and all over whom i  may have influence  for is not science antagonistic to religion  and if so what has a clergyman to do save to warn the young  against it instead of attracting them towards it  first as to meddling with secular matters  i grudge that epithet of  secular to any matter whatsoever  but i do more i deny it to  anything which god has made even to the tiniest of insects the most  insignificant atom of dust  to those who believe in god and try to  see all things in god the most minute natural phenomenon cannot be  secular  it must be divine i say deliberately divine and i can  use no less lofty word  the grain of dust is a thought of god gods  power made it gods wisdom gave it whatsoever properties or  qualities it may possess gods providence has put it in the place  where it is now and has ordained that it should be in that place at  that moment by a train of causes and effects which reaches back to  the very creation of the universe  the grain of dust can no more go  from gods presence or flee from gods spirit than you or i can   if it go up to the physical heaven and float as it actually often  does far above the clouds in those higher strata of the atmosphere  which the aeronaut has never visited whither the alpine snowpeaks  do not rise even there it will be obeying physical laws which we  term hastily laws of nature but which are really the laws of god   and if it go down into the physical abyss if it be buried fathoms  miles below the surface and become an atom of some rock still in  the process of consolidation has it escaped from god even in the  bowels of the earth  is it not there still obeying physical laws of  pressure heat crystallisation and so forth which are laws of god the will and mind of god concerning particles of matter  only look  at all created things in this lightlook at them as what they are  the expressions of gods mind and will concerning this universe in  which we livethe word of god as bacon says revealed in facts and then you will not fear physical science for you will be sure  that the more you know of physical science the more you will know  of the works and of the will of god  at least you will be in  harmony with the teaching of the psalmist  the heavens says he  declare the glory of god and the firmament showeth his handiwork   there is neither speech nor language where their voices are not heard  among them  so held the psalmist concerning astronomy the  knowledge of the heavenly bodies and what he says of sun and stars  is true likewise of the flowers around our feet of which the  greatest christian poet of modern times has said   to me the meanest flower that grows may give thoughts that do lie too deep for tears   so again you will be in harmony with the teaching of st paul who  told the romans that the invisible things of god are clearly seen  from the creation of theworld being understood by the things that  are made even his eternal power and godhead and who told the  savages of lycaonia that god had not left himself without witness  in that he did good and sent men rain from heaven and fruitful  seasons filling mens hearts with food and gladness  rain and  fruitful seasons witnessed to all men of a father in heaven  and he  who wishes to know how truly st paul spoke let him study the laws  which produce and regulate rain and fruitful seasons what we now  call climatology meteorology geography of land and water  let him  read that truly noble christian work maurys physical geography of  the sea and see if he be a truly rational man how advanced  science instead of disproving has only corroborated st pauls  assertion and how the ocean and the raincloud like the sun and  stars declare the glory of god  and if anyone undervalues the  sciences which teach us concerning stones and plants and animals or  thinks that nothing can be learnt from them concerning godallow one  who has been from childhood only a humble though he trusts a  diligent student of these sciencesallow him i say to ask in all  reverence but in all frankness who it was who said consider the  lilies of the field how they grow  consider the birds of the air and how your heavenly father feedeth them  consider them  if he has bid you do so can you do so too much  i know of course the special application which our lord made of  these words  but i know too from experience that the more you  study nature in all her forms the more you will find that the  special application itself is deeper wider more literally true  more wonderful more tender and if i dare use such a word more  poetic than the unscientific man can guess  but let me ask you furtherdo you think that our lord in that  instance and in those many instances in which he drew his parables  and lessons from natural objects was leading mens minds on to  dangerous ground and pointing out to them a subject of contemplation  in the laws and processes of the natural world and their analogy  with those of the spiritual world the kingdom of goda subject of  contemplation i say which it was not safe to contemplate too much  i appeal to your common sense  if he who spoke these words were as  i believe none other than the creator of the universe by whom all  things were made and without whom nothing was made that is made do  you suppose that he would have bid you to consider his universe had  it been dangerous for you to do so  do you suppose moreover that the universe which he the truth the  light the love has made can be otherwise then infinitely worthy to  be considered or that the careful accurate and patient  consideration of it even to its minutest details can be otherwise  than useful to man and can bear witness of aught save the mind and  character of him who made it  and if so can it be a work unfit for  unworthy of a clergymanwhose duty is to preach him to all and in  all waysto call on men to consider that physical world which like  the spiritual world consists holds together by him and lives and  moves and has its being in him  and here i must pause to answer an objection which i have heard in my  youth from many pious and virtuous peoplebetter people in gods  sight than i i fear can pretend to be  they used to say this would be all very true if there were not a  curse upon the earth  and then they seemed to deduce from the fact  of that curse a vague notion for it was little more that this  world was the devils world and that therefore physical facts could  not be trusted because they were disordered and deceptive and what  not  now in justice to the bible and in justice to the church of  england i am bound to say that such a statement or anything like  it is contrary to the doctrines of both  it is contrary to  scripture  according to it the earth is not cursed  for it is said  in gen viii 21 and the lord said i will not again curse the  ground any more for mans sake  while the earth remaineth seedtime  and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night shall  not cease  according to scripture again physical facts are not  disordered  the psalmist says they continue this day according to  their ordinance for all things serve thee  and again thou hast  made them fast for ever and ever  thou hast given them a law which  cannot be broken  so does the bible not to quote over again the passages which i have  already given you from st paul and one greater than st paul  declare the permanence of natural laws and the trustworthiness of  natural phenomena as obedient to god  and so does the church of  england  for she has incorporated into her services that magnificent  hymn which our forefathers called the song of the three children  which is as it were the very flower and crown of the old testament  the summing up of all that is true and eternal in the old jewish  faith as true for us as for them  as true millions of years hence  as it is nowwhich cries to all heaven and earth from the skies  above our heads to the green herb beneath our feet o all ye works  of the lord bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever   on that one hymn i take my stand  that is my charter as a student of  natural science  as long as that is sung in an english church i  have a right to investigate nature boldly without stint or stay and  to call on all who have the will to investigate her boldly likewise  and with socrates of old to follow the logos whithersoever it leads  the logos  i must pause on that word  it meant at first no doubt  simply speech argument reason  in the mind of socrates it had a  deeper meaning at which he only dimly guessed which was seen more  clearly by philo and the alexandrian jews which was revealed in all  its fulness to the beloved apostle st john till he gathered speech  to tell men of a logos a word who was in the beginning with god  and was god by whom all things were made and without him was not  anything made that was made and how in him was life and the life  was the light of men and that he was none other than jesus christ  our lord  yes that is the truth  and to that truth no man can add and from  it no man can take away  and as long as we believe that as long as  we believe that in his light alone can we see lightas long as we  believe that the light around us whether physical or spiritual is  given by him without whom nothing is madeso long we shall not fear  to meet light so long we shall not fear to investigate life for we  shall know however strange or novel beautiful or awful the  discoveries we make may be we are only following the word  whithersoever he may lead us and that he can never lead us amiss    i the soil of the field 2    my dear readers let me before touching on the special subject of  this paper say a few words on that of the whole series  it is geology  that is the science which explains to us the rind of  the earth of what it is made how it has been made  it tells us  nothing of the mass of the earth  that is properly speaking an  astronomical question  if i may be allowed to liken this earth to a  fruit then astronomy will tell uswhen it knowshow the fruit  grew and what is inside the fruit  geology can only tell us at most  how its rind its outer covering grew and of what it is composed a  very small part doubtless of all that is to be known about this  planet  but as it happens the mere rind of this earthfruit which has  countless ages since dropped as it were from the bosom of god the  eternal fount of lifethe mere rind of this earthfruit i say is  so beautiful and so complex that it is well worth our awful and  reverent study  it has been well said indeed that the history of  it which we call geology would be a magnificent epic poem were  there only any human interest in it did it deal with creatures more  like ourselves than stones and bones and the dead relics of plants  and beasts  whether there be no human interest in geology whether  man did not exist on the earth during ages which have seen enormous  geological changes is becoming more and more an open question  but meanwhile all must agree that there is matter enough for  interestnay room enough for the free use of the imagination in a  science which tells of the growth and decay of whole mountainranges  continents oceans whole tribes and worlds of plants and animals  and yet it is not so much for the vastness and grandeur of those  scenes of the distant past to which the science of geology  introduces us that i value it as a study and wish earnestly to  awaken you to its beauty and importance  it is because it is the  science from which you will learn most easily a sound scientific  habit of thought  i say most easily and for these reasons  the  most important facts of geology do not require to discover them any  knowledge of mathematics or of chemical analysis they may be studied  in every bank every grot every quarry every railwaycutting by  anyone who has eyes and common sense and who chooses to copy the  late illustrious hugh miller who made himself a great geologist out  of a poor stonemason  next its most important theories are not or  need not be wrapped up in obscure latin and greek terms  they may  be expressed in the simplest english because they are discovered by  simple common sense  and thus geology is or ought to be in  popular parlance the peoples sciencethe science by studying  which the man ignorant of latin greek mathematics scientific  chemistry can yet becomeas far as his brain enables hima truly  scientific man  but how shall we learn science by mere common sense  first  always try to explain the unknown by the known  if you meet  something which you have not seen before then think of the thing  most like it which you have seen before and try if that which you  know explains the one will not explain the other also  sometimes it  will sometimes it will not  but if it will no one has a right to  ask you to try any other explanation  suppose for instance that you found a dead bird on the top of a  cathedral tower and were asked how you thought it had got there   you would say of course it died up here  but if a friend said  not so it dropped from a balloon or from the clouds and told you  the prettiest tale of how the bird came to so strange an end you  would answer no no i must reason from what i know  i know that  birds haunt the cathedral tower i know that birds die and  therefore let your story be as pretty as it may my common sense  bids me take the simplest explanation and sayit died here  in  saying that you would be talking scientifically  you would have  made a fair and sufficient induction as it is called from the facts  about birds habits and birds deaths which you know  but suppose that when you took the bird up you found that it was  neither a jackdaw nor a sparrow nor a swallow as you expected but  a hummingbird  then you would be adrift again  the fact of it  being a hummingbird would be a new fact which you had not taken into  account and for which your old explanation was not sufficient and  you would have to try a new inductionto use your common sense  afreshsaying i have not to explain merely how a dead bird got  here but how a dead hummingbird  and now if your imaginative friend chimed in triumphantly with  do  you not see that i was right after all  do you not see that it fell  from the clouds that it was swept away hither all the way from  south america by some southwesterly storm and wearied out at last  dropped here to find rest as in a sacredplace what would you  answer  my friend that is a beautiful imagination but i must  treat it only as such as long as i can explain the mystery more  simply by facts which i do know  i do not know that hummingbirds  can be blown across the atlantic alive  i do know they are actually  brought across the atlantic dead are stuck in ladies hats  i know  that ladies visit the cathedral and odd as the accident is i prefer  to believe till i get a better explanation that the hummingbird  has simply dropped out of a ladys hat  there again you would be  speaking common sense and using too sound inductive method trying  to explain what you do not know from what you do know already  now i ask of you to employ the same common sense when you read and  think of geology  it is very necessary to do so  for in past times men have tried to  explain the making of the world around them its oceans rivers  mountains and continents by i know not what of fancied cataclysms  and convulsions of nature explaining the unknown by the still more  unknown till some of their geological theories were no more  rational because no more founded on known facts than that of the  new zealand maories who hold that some god when fishing fished up  their islands out of the bottom of the ocean  but a sounder and  wiser school of geologists now reigns the father of whom in england  at least is the venerable sir charles lyell  he was almost the  first of englishmen who taught us to seewhat common sense tells us that the laws which we see at work around us now have been most  probably at work since the creation of the world and that whatever  changes may seem to have taken place in past ages and in ancient  rocks should be explained if possible by the changes which are  taking place now in the most recent depositsin the soil of the  field  and in the last forty yearssince that great and sound idea has  become rooted in the minds of students and especially of english  students geology has thriven and developed perhaps more than any  other science and has led men on to discoveries far more really  astonishing and awful than all fancied convulsions and cataclysms  i have planned this series of papers therefore on sir charles  lyells method  i have begun by trying to teach a little about the  part of the earths crust which lies nearest us which we see most  often namely the soil intending if my readers do me the honour to  read the papers which follow to lead them downward as it were into  the earth deeper and deeper in each paper to rocks and minerals  which are probably less known to them than the soil in the fields   thus you will find i shall lead you or try to lead you on  throughout the series from the known to the unknown and show you  how to explain the latter by the former  sir charles lyell has i  see in the new edition of his students elements of geology begun  his book with the uppermost that is newest strata or layers and  has gone regularly downwards in the course of the book to the lowest  or earliest strata and i shall follow his plan  i must ask you meanwhile to remember one law or rule which seems to  me founded on common sense namely that the uppermost strata are  really almost always the newest that when two or more layers  whether of rock or earthor indeed two stones in the street or two  sheets on a bed or two books on a tableany two or more lifeless  things in fact lie one on the other then the lower one was most  probably put there first and the upper one laid down on the lower   does that seem to you a truism  do i seem almost impertinent in  asking you to remember it  so much the better  i shall be saved  unnecessary trouble hereafter  but some one may say and will have a right to say stopthe lower  thing may have been thrust under the upper one  quite true  and  therefore i said only that the lower one was most probably put there  first  and i said most probably because it is most probable that  in nature we should find things done by the method which costs least  force just as you do them  i will warrant that when you want to  hide a thing you lay something down on it ten times for once that  you thrust it under something else  you may say what  when i want  to hide a paper say under the sofacover do i not thrust it  under  no you lift up the cover and slip the paper in and let the cover  fall on it again  and so even in that case the paper has got into  its place first  now why is this  simply because in laying one thing on another you  only move weight  in thrusting one thing under another you have not  only to move weight but to overcome friction  that is why you do  it though you are hardly aware of it  simply because so you employ  less force and take less trouble  and so do clays and sands and stones  they are laid down on each  other and not thrust under each other because thus less force is  expended in getting them into place  there are exceptions  there are cases in which nature does try to  thrust one rock under another  but to do that she requires a force  so enormous compared with what is employed in laying one rock on  another that so to speak she continually fails and instead of  producing a volcanic eruption produces only an earthquake  of that  i may speak hereafter and may tell you in good time how to  distinguish rocks which have been thrust in from beneath from rocks  which have been laid down from above as every rock between london  and birmingham or exeter has been laid down  that i only assert now   but i do not wish you to take it on trust from me  i wish to prove  it to you as i go on or to do what is far better for you  to put  you in the way of proving it for yourself by using your common  sense  at the risk of seeming prolix i must say a few more words on this  matter  i have special reasons for it  until i can get you to let  your thoughts play freely round this question of the superposition  of soils and rocks there will be no use in my going on with these  papers  suppose then to argue from the known to the unknown that you were  watching men cleaning out a pond  atop perhaps they would come to  a layer of soft mud and under that to a layer of sand  would not  common sense tell you that the sand was there first and that the  water had laid down the mud on the top of it  then perhaps they  might come to a layer of dead leaves  would not common sense tell  you that the leaves were there before the sand above them  then  perhaps to a layer of mud again  would not common sense tell you  that the mud was there before the leaves  and so on down to the  bottom of the pond where lastly i think common sense would tell  you that the bottom of the pond was there already before all the  layers which were laid down on it  is not that simple common sense  then apply that reasoning to the soils and rocks in any spot on  earth  if you made a deep boring and found as you would in many  parts of this kingdom that the boring after passing through the  soil of the field entered clays or loose sands you would say the  clays were there before the soil  if it then went down into  sandstone you would saywould you notthat sandstone must have  been here before the clay and however thickeven thousands of feet it might be that would make no difference to your judgment  if  next the boring came into quite different rocks into a different  sort of sandstone and shales and among them beds of coal would you  not saythese coalbeds must have been here before the sandstones   and if you found in those coalbeds dead leaves and stems of plants  would you not saythose plants must have been laid down here before  the layers above them just as the dead leaves in the pond were  if you then came to a layer of limestone would you not say the same   and if you found that limestone full of shells and corals dead but  many of them quite perfect some of the corals plainly in the very  place in which they grew would you not saythese creatures must  have lived down here before the coal was laid on top of them  and  if lastly below the limestone you came to a bottom rock quite  different again would you not saythe bottom rock must have been  here before the rocks on the top of it  and if that bottom rock rose up a few miles off two thousand feet  or any other height into hills what would you say then  would you  say  oh but the rock is not bottom rock is not under the  limestone here but higher than it  so perhaps in this part it has  made a shift and the highlands are younger than the lowlands for  see they rise so much higher  would not that be as wise as to say  that the bottom of the pond was not there before the pond mud  because the banks round the pond rose higher than the mud  now for the soil of the field  if we can understand a little about it what it is made of and how  it got there we shall perhaps be on the right road toward  understanding what all englandand indeed the crust of this whole  planetis made of and how its rocks and soils got there  but we shall best understand how the soil in the field was made by  reasoning as i have said from the known to the unknown  what do i  mean  this  on the uplands are fields in which the soil is already  made  you do not know how  then look for a field in which the soil  is still being made  there are plenty in every lowland  learn how  it is being made there apply the knowledge which you learn from them  to the upland fields which are already made  if there is as there usually is a rivermeadow or still better an  aestuary near your town you have every advantage for seeing soil  made  thousands of square feet of freshmade soil spread between  your town and the sea thousands more are in process of being made  you will see now why i have begun with the soil in the field because  it is the uppermost and therefore latest of all the layers and  also for this reason that if sir charles lyells theory be trueas  it isthen the soils and rocks below the soil of the field may have  been made in the very same way in which the soil of the field is  made  if so it is well worth our while to examine it  you all know from whence the soil comes which has filled up in the  course of ages the great aestuaries below london stirling chester  or cambridge  it is river mud and sand  the river helped by tributary brooks  right and left has brought down from the inland that enormous mass   you know that  you know that every flood and freshet brings a fresh  load either of fine mud or of fine sand or possibly some of it  peaty matter out of distant hills  here is one indisputable fact  from which to start  let us look for another  how does the mud get into the river  the rain carries it thither  if you wish to learn the first elements of geology by direct  experiment do this  the next rainy daythe harder it rains the  betterinstead of sitting at home over the fire and reading a book  about geology put on a macintosh and thick boots and get away i  care not whither provided you can find there running water  if you  have not time to get away to a hilly country then go to the nearest  bit of turnpike road or the nearest sloping field and see in little  how whole continents are made and unmade again  watch the rain  raking and sifting with its million delicate fingers separating the  finer particles from the coarser dropping the latter as soon as it  can and carrying the former downward with it toward the sea  follow  the nearest roadside drain where it runs into a pond and see how it  drops the pebbles the moment it enters the pond and then the sand in  a fanshaped heap at the nearest end but carries the fine mud on  and holds it suspended to be gradually deposited at the bottom in  the still water and say to yourself  perhaps the sands which cover  so many inland tracts were dropped by water very near the shore of a  lake or sea and by rapid currents  perhaps again the brick clays  which are often mingled with these sands were dropped like the mud  in the pond in deeper water farther from the shore and certainly in  stilt water  but more  suppose once more then that looking and  watching a pond being cleared out under the lowest layer of mud you  foundas you would find in any of those magnificent reservoirs so  common in the lancashire hillsa layer of vegetable soil with grass  and brushwood rooted in it  what would you say but  the pond has  not been always full  it has at some time or other been dry enough  to let a whole copse grow up inside it  and if you foundas you will actually find along some english  shoresunder the sand hills perhaps a bed of earth with shells and  bones under that a bed of peat under that one of blue silt under  that a buried forest with the trees upright and rooted under that  another layer of blue silt full of roots and vegetable fibre perhaps  under that again another old land surface with trees again growing in  it and under all the main bottom clay of the districtwhat would  common sense tell you  i leave you to discover for yourselves  it  certainly would not tell you that those trees were thrust in there by  a violent convulsion or that all those layers were deposited there  in a few days or even a few years and you might safely indulge in  speculations about the antiquity of the aestuary and the changes  which it has undergone with which i will not frighten you at  present  it will be fair reasoning to argue thus  you may not be always right  in your conclusion but still you will be trying fairly to explain  the unknown by the known  but have rain and rivers alone made the soil  how very much they have done toward making it you will be able to  judge for yourselves if you will read the sixth chapter of sir  charles lyells new elements of geology or the first hundred pages  of that admirable book de la beches geological observer and  last but not least a very clever little book called rain and  rivers by colonel george greenwood  but though rain like rivers is a carrier of soil it is more  it  is a maker of soil likewise and by it mainly the soil of an upland  field is made whether it be carried down to the sea or not  if you will look into any quarry you will see that however compact  the rock may be a few feet below the surface it becomes in almost  every case rotten and broken up as it nears the upper soil till you  often cannot tell where the rock ends and the soil begins  now this change has been produced by rain  first mechanically by  rain in the shape of ice  the winter rain gets into the ground and  does by the rock what it has done by the stones of many an old  building  it sinks into the porous stone freezes there expands in  freezing and splits and peels the stone with a force which is slowly  but surely crumbling the whole of northern europe and america to  powder  do you doubt me  i say nothing but what you can judge of yourselves   the next time you go up any mountain look at the loose broken stones  with which the top is coated just underneath the turf  what has  broken them up but frost  look again as stronger proof at the  talus of broken stonesscrees as they call them in scotland  rattles as we call them in devonwhich lie along the base of many  mountain cliffs  what has brought them down but frost  if you ask  the country folk they will tell you whether i am right or not  if  you go thither not in the summer but just after the winters frost  you will see for yourselves by the fresh frostcrop of newlybroken  bits that i am right  possibly you may find me to be even more  right than is desirable by having a few angular stones from the  size of your head to that of your body hurled at you by the frost giants up above  if you go to the alps at certain seasons and hear  the thunder of the falling rocks and see their long linesmoraines  as they are calledsliding slowly down upon the surface of the  glacier then you will be ready to believe the geologist who tells  you that frost and probably frost alone has hewn out such a peak as  the matterhorn from some vast tableland and is hewing it down  still winter after winter till some day where the snow alps now  stand there shall be rolling uplands of rich cultivable soil  so much for the mechanical action of rain in the shape of ice  now  a few words on its chemical action  rain water is seldom pure  it carries in it carbonic acid and that  acid beating in shower after shower against the face of a cliff especially if it be a limestone cliffweathers the rock chemically  changing in case of limestone the insoluble carbonate of lime into  a soluble bicarbonate and carrying that away in water which  however clear is still hard  hard water is usually water which has  invisible lime in it there are from ten to fifteen grains and more  of lime in every gallon of limestone water  i leave you to calculate  the enormous weight of lime which must be so carried down to the sea  every year by a single limestone or chalk brook  you can calculate  it if you like by ascertaining the weight of lime in each gallon  and the average quantity of water which comes down the stream in a  day and when your sum is done you will be astonished to find it one  not of many pounds but probably of many tons of solid lime which  you never suspected or missed from the hills around  again by the  time the rain has sunk through the soil it is still less pure  it  carries with it not only carbonic acid but acids produced by  decaying vegetablesby the roots of the grasses and trees which grow  above and they dissolve the cement of the rock by chemical action  especially if the cement be lime or iron  you may see this for  yourselves again and again  you may see how the root of a tree  penetrating the earth discolours the soil with which it is in  contact  you may see how the whole rock just below the soil has  often changed in colour from the compact rock below if the soil be  covered with a dense layer of peat or growing vegetables  but there is another force at work and quite as powerful as rain and  rivers making the soil of alluvial flats  perhaps it has helped  likewise to make the soil of all the lowlands in these islesand  that is the waves of the sea  if you ever go to parkgate in cheshire try if you cannot learn  there a little geology  walk beyond the town  you find the shore protected for a long way by  a seawall lest it should be eaten away by the waves  what the  force of those waves can be even on that sheltered coast you may  judgeat least you could have judged this time last yearby the  masses of masonry torn from their iron clampings during the gale of  three winters since  look steadily at those rolled blocks those  twisted stanchions if they are there still and then ask yourselves it will be fair reasoning from the known to the unknownwhat effect  must such wavepower as that have had beating and breaking for  thousands of years along the western coasts of england scotland  ireland  it must have eaten up thousands of acreswhole shires may  be ere now  its teeth are strong enough and it knows neither rest  nor pity the cruel hungry sea  give it but time enough and what  would it not eat up  it would eat up in the course of ages all the  dry land of this planet were it not baffled by another counteracting  force of which i shall speak hereafter  as you go on beyond the seawall you find what it is eating up  the  whole low cliff is going visibly  but whither is it going  to form  new soil in the aestuary  now you will not wonder how old harbours  so often become silted up  the sea has washed the land into them   but more the seacurrents do not allow the sands of the aestuary to  escape freely out to sea  they pile it up in shifting sandbanks  about the mouth of the aestuary  the prevailing seawinds from  whatever quarter catch up the sand and roll it up into sandhills   those sandhills are again eaten down by the sea and mixed with the  mud of the tideflats and so is formed a mingled soil partly of  clayey mud partly of sand such a soil as stretches over the greater  part of all our lowlands  now why should not that soil whether in england or in scotland  have been made by the same means as that of every aestuary  you find over great tracts of east scotland lancashire norfolk  etc pure loose sand just beneath the surface which looks as if it  was blown sand from a beach  is it not reasonable to suppose that it  is  you find rising out of many lowlands crags which look exactly  like old seacliffs eaten by the waves from the base of which the  waters have gone back  why should not those crags be old seacliffs   why should we not following our rule of explaining the unknown by  the known assume that such they are till someone gives us a sound  proof that they are not and saythese great plains of england and  scotland were probably once covered by a shallow sea and their soils  made as the soil of any tideflat is being made now  but you may say and most reasonably the tideflats are just at the  sealevel  the whole of the lowland is many feet above the sea it  must therefore have been raised out of the sea according to your  theory  and what proofs have you of that  well that is a question both grand and deep on which i shall not  enter yet but meanwhile to satisfy you that i wish to play fair  with you i ask you to believe nothing but what you can prove for  yourselves  let me ask you this  suppose that you had proof  positive that i had fallen into the river in the morning would not  your meeting me in the evening be also proof positive that somehow or  other i had in the course of the day got out of the river  i think  you will accept that logic as sound  now if i can give you proof positive proof which you can see with  your own eyes and handle with your own hands and alas often feel  but too keenly with your own feet that the whole of the lowlands  were once beneath the sea then will it not be certain that somehow  or other they must have been raised out of the sea again  and that i propose to do in my next paper when i speak of the  pebbles in the street  meanwhile i wish you to face fairly the truly grand idea which all i  have said tends to prove truethat all the soil we see is made by  the destruction of older soils whether soft as clay or hard as  rock that rain rivers and seas are perpetually melting and  grinding up old land to compose new land out of it and that it must  have been doing so as long as rain rivers and seas have existed   but how did the first land of all get made  i can only reply  a  natural question  but we can only answer that by working from the  known to the unknown  while we are finding out how these later lands  were made and unmade we may stumble on some hints as to how the  first primeval continents rose out of the bosom of the sea  and thus i end this paper  i trust it has not been intolerably dull   but i wanted at starting to show my readers something of the right  way of finding out truth on this and perhaps on all subjects to make  some simple appeals to your common sense and to get you to accept  some plain rules founded on common sense which will be of infinite  use to both you and me in my future papers  i hope meanwhile that you will agree with me that there is plenty  of geological matter to be seen and thought over in the neighbourhood  of any town  be sure that wherever there is a river even a drain and a stone  quarry or even a roadside bank much more where there is a sea or a  tidal aestuary there is geology enough to be learnt to explain the  greater part of the making of all the continents on the globe    ii  the pebbles in the street    if you dear reader dwell in any northern town you will almost  certainly see paving courts and alleys and sometimesto the  discomfort of your feetwhole streets or set up as bournestones at  corners or laid in heaps to be broken up for roadmetal certain  round pebbles usually dark brown or speckled gray and exceedingly  tough and hard  some of them will be very largeboulders of several  feet in diameter  if you move from town to town from the north of  scotland as far down as essex on the east or as far down as  shrewsbury and wolverhampton at least on the west you will still  find these pebbles but fewer and smaller as you go south  it  matters not what the rocks and soils of the country round may be   however much they may differ these pebbles will be on the whole  the same everywhere  but if your town be south of the valley of the thames you will find  as far as i am aware no such pebbles there  the gravels round you  will be made up entirely of rolled chalk flints and bits of beds  immediately above or below the chalk  the blocks of sarsden  sandstonethose of which stonehenge is builtand the plumpudding  stones which are sometimes found with them have no kindred with the  northern pebbles  they belong to beds above the chalk  now if seeing such pebbles about your town you inquire like a  sensible person who wishes to understand something of the spot on  which he lives whence they come you will be shown either a gravel pit or a claypit  in the gravel the pebbles and boulders lie mixed  with sand as they do in the railway cutting just south of  shrewsbury or in huge mounds of fine sweet earth as they do in the  gorge of the tay about dunkeld and all the way up strathmore where  they form long grassy moundstomauns as they call them in some parts  of scotlandaskers as they call them in ireland  these mounds with  their sweet fresh turf rising out of heather and bog were tenanted so scottish children used to believeby fairies  he that was lucky  might hear inside them fairy music and the jingling of the fairy  horses trappings  but woe to him if he fell asleep upon the mound  for he would be spirited away into fairyland for seven years which  would seem to him but one day  a strange fancy yet not so strange  as the actual truth as to what these mounds are and how they came  into their places  or again you might find that your towns pebbles and boulders came  out of a pit of clay in which they were stuck without any order or  bedding like plums and raisins in a pudding  this clay goes usually  by the name of boulderclay  you would see such near any town in  cheshire and lancashire or along leith shore near edinburgh or to  give one more instance out of hundreds along the coast at  scarborough  if you walk along the shore southward of that town you  will see in the gullies of the cliff great beds of sticky clay  stuffed full of bits of every rock between the lake mountains and  scarborough from rounded pebbles of most ancient rock down to great  angular fragments of ironstone and coal  there as elsewhere the  great majority of the pebbles have nothing to do with the rock on  which the clay happens to lie but have come some of them from  places many miles away  now if we find spread over a low land pebbles composed of rocks which  are only found in certain high lands is it not an act of common  sense to saythese pebbles have come from the highlands  and if the  pebbles are rounded while the rocks like them in the highlands  always break off in angular shapes is it not again an act of mere  common sense to saythese pebbles were once angular and have been  rubbed round either in getting hither or before they started hither  does all this seem to you mere truism my dear reader  if so i am  sincerely glad to hear it  it was not so very long ago that such  arguments would have been considered not only no truisms but not  even common sense  but to return let us take as an example a sample of these boulder  clay pebbles from the neighbourhood of liverpool and birkenhead made  by mr de rance the government geological surveyor  granite greenstone felspar porphyry felstone quartz rock all  igneous rocks that is either formed by or altered by volcanic  heat and almost all found in the lake mountains 37 per cent  silurian grits the common stones of the lake mountains deposited by  water 43 per cent  ironstone 1 per cent  carboniferous limestone 5 per cent  permian or triassic sandstones ie rocks immediately round  liverpool 12 per cent  now does not this sample show as far as human common sense can be  depended on that the great majority of these stones come from the  lake mountains sixty or seventy miles north of liverpool  i think  your common sense will tell you that these pebbles are not mere  concretions that is formed out of the substance of the clay after  it was deposited  the least knowledge of mineralogy would prove  that  but even if you are no mineralogist common sense will tell  you that if they were all concreted out of the same clay it is most  likely that they would be all of the same kind and not of a dozen or  more different kinds  common sense will tell you also that if they  were all concreted out of the same clay it is a most extraordinary  coincidence indeed one too strange to be believed if any less  strange explanation can be foundthat they should have taken the  composition of different rocks which are found all together in one  group of mountains to the northward  you will surely sayif this be  granite it has most probably come from a granite mountain if this  be grit from a gritstone mountain and so on with the whole list   whyare we to go out of our way to seek improbable explanations  when there is a probable one staring us in the face  nextand this is well worth your noticeif you will examine the  pebbles carefully especially the larger ones you will find that  they are not only more or less rounded but often scratched and  often too in more than one direction two or even three sets of  scratches crossing each other marked as a cat marks an elder stem  when she sharpens her claws upon it and that these scratches have  not been made by the quarrymens tools but are old marks which  existas you may easily prove for yourselfwhile the stone is still  lying in its bed of clay  would it not be an act of mere common  sense to saythese scratches have been made by the sharp points of  other stones which have rubbed against the pebbles somewhere and  somewhen with great force  so far so good  the next question ishow did these stones get into  the clay  if we can discover that we may also discover how they  wore rounded and scratched  we must find a theory which will answer  our question and one which as professor huxley would say will go  on allfours that is will explain all the facts of the case and  not only a few of them  what then brought the stones  we cannot i think answer that question as some have tried to  answer it by saying that they were brought by noahs flood  for it  is clear that very violent currents of water would be needed to  carry boulders some of them weighing many tons for many miles  now  scripture says nothing of any such violent currents and we have no  right to put currents or any other imagined facts into scripture  out of our own heads and then argue from them as if not we but the  text of scripture had asserted their existence  but still they may have been rolled hither by water  that theory  certainly would explain their being rounded though not their being  scratched  but it will not explain their being found in the clay  recollect what i said in my first paper  that water drops its  pebbles and coarser particles first while it carries the fine clayey  mud onward in solution and only drops it when the water becomes  still  now currents of such tremendous violence as to carry these  boulder stones onward would have carried the mud for many miles  farther still and we should find the boulders not in clay but  lying loose together probably on a hard rock bottom scoured clean  by the current  that is what we find in the beds of streams that is  just what we do not find in this case  but the boulders may have been brought by a current and then the  water may have become still and the clay settled quietly round them   what  under them as well as over them  on that theory also we  should find them only at the bottom of the clay  as it is we find  them scattered anywhere and everywhere through it from top to  bottom  so that theory will not do  indeed no theory will do which  supposes them to have been brought by water alone  try yourself dear reader and make experiments with running water  pebbles and mud  if you try for seven years i believe you will  never contrive to make your pebbles lie about in your mud as they  lie about in every pit in the boulder clay  well then there we are at fault it seems  we have no explanation  drawn from known facts which will dounless we are to suppose which  i dont think you will do that stones clay and all were blown  hither along the surface of the ground by primeval hurricanes ten  times worse than those of the west indies which certainly will roll  a cannon a few yards but cannot surely roll a boulder stone a  hundred miles  now suppose that there was a force an agent knownluckily for  you not to youbut known too well to sailors and travellers a  force which is at work over the vast sheets of land at both the north  and south poles at work too on every high mountain range in the  world and therefore a very common natural force and suppose that  this force would explain all the facts namely  how the stones got here  how they were scratched and rounded  how they were imbedded in clay  because it is notoriously and before mens eyes now carrying great  stones hundreds of miles and scratching and rounding them also  carrying vast deposits of mud too and mixing up mud and stones just  as we see them in the brickpitswould not our common sense have a  right to try that explanationto suspect that this force which we  do not see at work in britain now may have been at work here ages  since  that would at least be reasoning from the known to the  unknown  what state of things then do we find among the highest  mountains and over whole countries which though not lofty lie far  enough north or south to be permanently covered with ice  we find first an icecap or icesheet fed by the winters snows  stretching over the higher land and crawling downward and outward by  its own weight along the valleys as glaciers  we find underneath the glaciers first a moraine profonde consisting  of the boulders and gravel and earth which the glacier has ground  off the hillsides and is carrying down with it  these stones of course grind scratch and polish each other and  in like wise grind scratch and polish the rock over which they  pass under the enormous weight of the superincumbent ice  we find also issuing from under each glacier a stream carrying the  finest mud the result of the grinding of the boulders against each  other and the glacier  we find moreover on the surface of the glaciers moraines  superieureslong lines of stones and dirt which had fallen from  neighbouring cliffs and are now travelling downward with the  glaciers  their fate if the glacier ends on land is what was to be expected   the stones from above the glacier fall over the icecliff at its end  to mingle with those thrown out from underneath the glacier and form  huge banks of boulders called terminal moraines while the mud runs  off as all who have seen glaciers know in a turbid torrent  their fate again is what was to be expected if the glacier ends as  it commonly does in arctic regions in the sea  the ice grows out to  seaward for more than a mile sometimes about oneeighth of it being  above water and seveneighths below so that an icecliff one  hundred feet high may project into water eight hundred feet deep  at  last when it gets out of its depth the buoyancy of the water breaks  it off in icebergs which float away at the mercy of tides and  currents often grounding again in shallower water and ploughing the  seabottom as they drag along it  these bergs carry stones and dirt  often in large quantities so that whenever a berg melts or  capsizes it strews its burden confusedly about the seafloor  meanwhile the fine mud which is flowing out from under the ice goes  out to sea likewise colouring the water far out and then subsiding  as a soft tenacious ooze in which the stones brought out by the ice  are imbedded  and this oozeso those who have examined it assert cannot be distinguished from the brickclay or fossiliferous  boulderclay so common in the north  a very illustrious  scandinavian explorer visiting edinburgh declared as soon as he  saw the sections of boulderclay exhibited near that city that this  was the very substance which he saw forming in the spitzbergen ice fiords 3  i have put these facts as simply and baldly as i can in order that  the reader may look steadily at them without having his attention  drawn off or his fancy excited by their real poetry and grandeur   indeed it would have been an impertinence to have done otherwise  for i have never seen a live glacier by land or sea though i have  seen many a dead one  and the public has had the opportunity  lately of reading so many delightful books about peaks passes and  glaciers that i am bound to suppose that many of my readers know as  much or more about them than i do  but let us go a step farther and bearing in our minds what live  glaciers are like let us imagine what a dead glacier would be like  a glacier that is which had melted and left nothing but its  skeleton of stones and dirt  we should find the faces of the rock scored and polished generally  in lines pointing down the valleys or at least outward from the  centre of the highlands and polished and scored most in their upland  or weather sides  we should find blocks of rock left behind and  perched about on other rocks of a different kind  we should find in  the valleys the old moraines left as vast deposits of boulder and  shingle which would be in time sawn through and sorted over by the  rivers  and if the seabottom outside were upheaved and became dry  land we should find on it the remains of the mud from under the  glacier stuck full of stones and boulders icebergdropped  this mud  would be often very irregularly bedded for it would have been  disturbed by the ploughing of the icebergs and mixed here and there  with dirt which had fallen from them  moreover as the sea became  shallower and the mudbeds got awash one after the other they would  be torn about resifted and reshaped by currents and by tides and  mixed with shoresand ground out of shinglebeach thus making  confusion worse confounded  a few shells of an arctic or northern  type would be found in it here and there  some would have lived  near those later beaches some in deeper water in the ancient ooze  wherever the iceberg had left it in peace long enough for seaanimals  to colonise and breed in it  but the general appearance of the dried  seabottom would be a dreary and lifeless waste of sands gravels  loose boulders and boulderbearing clays and wherever a boss of  bare rock still stood up it would be found ground down and probably  polished and scored by the ponderous icebergs which had lumbered over  it in their passage out to sea  in a word it would look exactly as vast tracts of the english  scotch and irish lowlands must have looked before returning  vegetation coated their dreary sands and clays with a layer of brown  vegetable soil  thus and i believe thus only can we explain the facts connected  with these boulder pebbles  no agent known on earth can have stuck  them in the clay save ice which is known to do so still elsewhere  no known agent can have scratched them as they are scratched save  ice which is known to do so still elsewhere  no known agentcertainly not in my opinion the existing rivers can have accumulated the vast beds of boulders which lie along the  course of certain northern rivers notably along the dee about  aboynesave ice bearing them slowly down from the distant summits of  the grampians  no known agent save ice can have produced those rounded and  polished and scored and fluted rochers moutonnes sheepbacked  rocksso common in the lake district so common too in snowdon  especially between the two lakes of llanberis common in kerry to be  seen anywhere as far as i have ascertained around the scotch  highlands where the turf is cleared away from an unweathered surface  of the rock in the direction in which a glacier would have pressed  against it had one been there  where these polishings and scorings  are found in narrow glens it is no doubt an open question whether  some of them may not be the work of water  but nothing but the  action of ice can have produced what i have seen in landlocked and  quiet fords in kerryiceflutings in polished rocks below highwater  mark so large that i could lie down in one of them  nothing but the  action of ice could produce what may be seen in any of our mountains whole sheets of rock ground down into rounded flats irrespective of  the lie of the beds not in valleys but on the brows and summits of  mountains often ending abruptly at the edge of some sudden cliff  where the true work of water in the shape of rain and frost is  actually destroying the previous work of ice and fulfilling the rule  laid down i think by professor geikie in his delightful book on  scotch scenery as influenced by its geology that ice planes down  into flats while water saws out into crags and gullies and that the  rain and frost are even now restoring scotch scenery to something of  that ruggedness and picturesqueness which it must have lost when it  lay like greenland under the indiscriminating grinding of a heavy  sheet of ice  lastly no known agent save ice will explain those perched  boulders composed of ancient hard rocks which may be seen in so  many parts of these islands and of the continent  no water power  could have lifted those stones and tossed them up high and dry on  mountain ridges and promontories upon rocks of a totally different  kind  some of my readers surely recollect wordsworths noble lines  about these mysterious wanderers of which he had seen many a one  about his native hills   as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a seabeast crawled forth that on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun itself   yes but the next time you see such a stone believe that the wonder  has been solved and found to be like most wonders in nature more  wonderful than we guessed it to be  it is not a seabeast which has  crawled forth but an icebeast which has been left behind lifted up  thither by the ice as surely as the famous pierreabot forty feet  in diameter and hundreds of boulders more almost as large as  cottages have been carried by ice from the distant alps right across  the lake of neufchatel and stranded on the slopes of the jura nine  hundred feet above the lake 4  thus i think we have accounted for facts enough to make it probable  that britain was once covered partly by an icesheet as greenland is  now and partly perhaps by an icy sea  but to make assurance more  sure let us look for new facts and try whether our icedream will  account for them also  let us investigate our case as a good medical  man does by verifying his first induction  he says  at the first glance i can see symptoms a b c  it is  therefore probable that my patient has got complaint a  but if he  has he ought to have symptom d also  if i find that my guess will  be yet more probable  he ought also to have symptom e and so forth  and as i find successively each of these symptoms which are proper to  a my first guess will become more and more probable till it reaches  practical certainty  now let us do the same and sayif this strange dream be true and  the lowlands of the north were once under an icy sea ought we not to  find seashells in their sands and clays  not abundantly of course   we can understand that the seaanimals would be too rapidly covered  up in mud and too much disturbed by icebergs and boulders to be  very abundant  but still some should surely be found here and  there  doubtless and if my northerntown readers will search the boulder clay pits near them they will most probably find a few shells if  not in the clay itself yet in sandbeds mixed with them and  probably underlying them  and this is a notable fact that the more  species of shells they find the more they will findif they work  out their names from any good book of conchologyof a northern type  of shells which notoriously at this day inhabit the colder seas  it is impossible for me here to enter at length on a subject on which  a whole literature has been already written  those who wish to study  it may find all that they need know and more in lyells students  elements of geology and in chapter xii of his antiquity of man   they will find that if the evidence of scientific conchologists be  worth anything the period can be pointed out in the strata though  not of course in time at which these seas began to grow colder and  southern and mediterranean shells to disappear their places being  taken by shells of a temperate and at last of an arctic climate  which last have since retreated either toward their native north or  into cold water at great depths  from essex across to wales from  wales to the aestuary of the clyde this fact has been verified again  and again  and in the search for these shells a fresh fact and a  most startling one was discovered  they are to be found not only in  the clay of the lowlands but at considerable heights up the hills  showing that at some time or other these hills have been submerged  beneath the sea  let me give one example which any tourist into wales may see for  himself  moel tryfaen is a mountain over carnarvon  now perched on  the side of that mountain fourteen hundred feet above the present  sealevel is an ancient seabeach fiveandthirty feet thick lying  on great icescratched boulders which again lie on the mountain  slates  it was discovered by the late mr trimmer now alas lost  to geology  out of that beach fiftyseven different species of  shells have been taken eleven of them are now exclusively arctic  and not found in our seas four of them are still common to the  arctic seas and to our own and almost all the rest are northern  shells  fourteen hundred feet above the present sea  and that it must be  understood is not the greatest height at which such shells may be  found hereafter  for according to professor ramsay drift of the  same kind as that on moel tryfaen is found at a height of two  thousand three hundred feet  now i ask my readers to use their common sense over this astounding  factwhich after all is only one among hundreds to let as mr  matthew arnold would well say their thought play freely about it  and consider for themselves what those shells must mean  i say not  may but must unless we are to believe in a deus quidam deceptor  in a god who puts shells upon mountainsides only to befool honest  human beings and gives men intellects which are worthless for even  the simplest work  those shells must mean that that mountain and  therefore the mountains round it must have been once fourteen  hundred feet at least lower than they are now  that the sea in which  they were sunk was far colder than now  that icebergs brought and  dropped boulders round their flanks  that upon those boulders a sea beach formed and that dead shells were beaten into it from a sea bottom close by  that and no less moel tryfaen must mean  but it must mean also a length of time which has been well called  appalling  a length of time sufficient to let the mountain sink  into the sea  then length of time enough to enable those arctic  shells to crawl down from the northward settle and propagate  themselves generation after generation then length of time enough to  uplift their dead remains and the beach and the boulders and all  snowdonia fourteen hundred feet into the air  and if anyone should  object that the last upheaval may have been effected suddenly by a  few tremendous earthquakes we must answerwe have no proof of it   earthquakes upheave lands now only by slight and intermittent upward  pulses nay some lands we know to rise without any earthquake  pulses but by simple slow upward swelling of a few feet in a  century and we have no reason and therefore no right to suppose  that snowdonia was upheaved by any means or at any rate which we do  not witness now and therefore we are bound to allow not only that  there was a past age of ice but that that age was one of  altogether enormous duration  but meanwhile some of you i presume will be ready to crystop  it  may be our own weakness but you are really going on too fast and too  far for our small imaginations  have you not played with us as well  as argued with us till you have inveigled us step by step into a  conclusion which we cannot and will not believe  that all this land  should have been sunk beneath an icy sea  that britain should have  been as greenland is now  we cant believe it and we wont  if you say so like stout commonsense britons who have a wholesome  dread of being taken in with fine words and wild speculations i  assure you i shall not laugh at you even in private  on the  contrary i shall saywhat i am sure every scientific man will say so much the better  that is the sort of audience which we want if  we are teaching natural science  we do not want haste enthusiasm  gobemoucherie as the french call it which is agape to snap up any  new and vast fancy just because it is new and vast  we want our  readers to be slow suspicious conservative ready to gib as we  say of a horse and refuse the collar up a steep place sayingi  must stop and think  i dont like the look of the path ahead of me   it seems an ugly place to get up  i dont know this road and i  shall not hurry over it  i must go back a few steps and make sure   i must see whether it is the right road whether there are not other  roads a dozen of them perhaps which would do as well and better  than this  this is the temper which finds out truth slowly but once and for  all and i shall be glad not sorry to see it in my readers  and i am bound to say that it has been by that temper that this  theory has been worked out and the existence of this past age of  ice or glacial epoch has been discovered through many mistakes  many corrections and many changes of opinion about details for  nearly forty years of hard work by many men in many lands  as a very humble student of this subject i may say that i have been  looking these facts in the face earnestly enough for more than twenty  years and that i am about as certain that they can only be explained  by ice as i am that my having got home by rail can only be explained  by steam  but i think i know what startles you  it is the being asked to  believe in such an enormous change in climate and in the height of  the land above the sea  wellit is very astonishing appallingall  but incredible if we had not the facts to prove it  but of the  facts there can be no doubt  there can be no doubt that the climate  of this northern hemisphere has changed enormously more than once   there can be no doubt that the distribution of land and water the  shape and size of its continents and seas have changed again and  again  there can be no doubt that for instance long before the age  of ice the whole north of europe was much warmer than it is now  take greenland for instance  disco island lies in baffins bay off  the west coast of greenland in latitude 70 degrees far within the  arctic circle  now there certain strata of rock older than the ice  have not been destroyed by the grinding of the icecap and they are  full of fossil plants  but of what kind of plants  of the same  families as now grow in the warmer parts of the united states  even  a tuliptree has been found among them  now how is this to be  explained  either we must say that the climate of greenland was then so much  warmer than now that it had summers probably as hot as those of new  york or we must say that these leaves and stems were floated thither  from the united states  but if we say the latter we must allow a  change in the shape of the land which is enormous  for nothing now  can float northward from the united states into baffins bay  the  polar current sets out of baffins bay southward bringing icebergs  down not leaves up through daviss straits  and in any case we  must allow that the hills of disco island were then the bottom of a  sea  or how would the leaves have been deposited in them at all  so much for the change of climate and land which can be proved to  have gone on in greenland  it has become colder  why should it not  some day become warmer again  now for england  it can be proved as far as common sense can prove  anything that england was before the age of ice much warmer than  it is now and grew gradually cooler and cooler just as while the  age of ice was dying out it grew warmer again  now what proof is there of that  this  underneath londonas i dare say many of you knowthere  lies four or five hundred feet of clay  but not iceclay  anything  but that as you will see  it belongs to a formation late  geologically speaking but somewhat older than those disco island  beds  and what sort of fossils do we find in it  in the first place the shells which are abundant are tropical nautili cones and such like  and more fruits and seeds are found  in it especially at the isle of sheppey  and what are they  fruits  of nipa palms a form only found now at rivermouths in eastern india  and the indian islands anonaseeds gourdseeds acacia fruitsall  tropical again and proteaceous plants tooof an australian type   surely your common sense would hint to you that this london clay  must be mud laid down off the mouth of a tropical river  but your  common sense would be all but certain of that when you found as you  would find the teeth and bones of crocodiles and turtles who come  to land remember to lay their eggs the bones too of large  mammals allied to the tapir of india and south america and the  waterhog of the cape  if all this does not mean that there was once  a tropic climate and a tropic river running into some sea or other  where london now stands i must give up common sense and reason as  deceitful and useless faculties and believe nothing not even the  evidence of my own senses  and now have i or have i not fulfilled the promise which i made rashly i dare say some of you thoughtin my first paper  have i  or have i not made you prove to yourself by your own common sense  that the lowlands of britain were underneath the sea in the days in  which these pebbles and boulders were laid down over your plains   nay have we not proved more  have we not found that that old sea  was an icy sea  have we not wandered on step by step into a whole  true fairyland of wonders to a time when all england scotland and  ireland were as greenland is now when mud streams have rushed down  from under glaciers on to a cold seabottom when ice mast high  came floating by as green as emerald when snowdon was sunk for at  least fourteen hundred feet of its height when as i could prove to  you had i time the peaks of the highest cumberland and scotch  mountains alone stood out as islets in a frozen sea  we want to get an answer to one strange question and we have found a  group of questions stranger still and got them answered too  but so  it is always in science  we know not what we shall discover  but  this at least we know that it will be far more wonderful than we  had dreamed  the scientific explorer is always like saul of old who  set out simply to find his fathers asses and found themand a  kingdom besides  i should have liked to have told you more about this bygone age of  ice  i should have liked to say something to you on the curious  questionwhich is still an open onewhether there were not two ages  of ice whether the climate here did not after perhaps thousands of  years of arctic cold soften somewhat for a whilea few thousand  years perhapsand then harden again into a second age of ice  somewhat less severe probably than the first  i should have liked  to have hinted at the probable causes of this changeindeed of the  age of ice altogetherwhether it was caused by a change in the  distribution of land and water or by change in the height and size  of these islands which made them large enough and high enough to  carry a sheet of eternal snow inland or whether finally the age of  ice was caused by an actual change in the position of the whole  planet with regard to its orbit round the sunshifting at once the  poles and the tropics a deep question that latter on which  astronomers whose business it is are still at work and on which  ere young folk are old they will have discovered i expect some  startling facts  on that last question i being no astronomer  cannot speak  but i should have liked to have said somewhat on  matters on which i have knowledge enough at least to teach you how  much there is to be learnt  i should have liked to tell the student  of seaanimalshow the iceage helps to explain and is again  explained by the remarkable discoveries which dr carpenter and mr  wyville thompson have just made in the deepsea dredgings in the  north atlantic  i should have liked to tell the botanist somewhat of  the proglacial florathe plants which lived here before the ice  and lasted some of them at least through all those ages of fearful  cold and linger still on the summits of snowdon and the highest  peaks of cumberland and scotland  i should have liked to have told  the lovers of zoology about the animals which lived before the ice of the mammoth or woolly elephant the woolly rhinoceros the cave  lion and bear the reindeer the musk oxen the lemmings and the  marmots which inhabited britain till the ice drove them out  southward even into the south of france and how as the ice  retreated and the climate became tolerable once more some of them the mammoth and rhinoceros the bison the lion and many another  mighty beast reoccupied our lowlands at a time when the  hippopotamus at least in summer ranged freely from africa and spain  across what was then dry land between france and england and fed by  the side of animals which have long since retreated to norway and to  canada  i should have liked to tell the archaeologist of the human  beingsprobably from their weapons and their habitsof the same  race as the present laplanders who passed northward as the ice went  back following the wild reindeer herds from the south of france into  our islands which were no islands then to be in their turn driven  northward by stronger races from the east and south  but space  presses and i fear that i have written too much already  at least i have turned over for you a few grand and strange pages in  the book of nature and taught you i hope a key by which to  decipher their hieroglyphics  at least i have i trust taught you  to look as i do with something of interest even of awe upon the  pebbles in the street    iii  the stones in the wall    this is a large subject  for in the different towns of these  islands the walls are built of stones of almost every age from the  earliest to the latest and the towngeologist may find a quite  different problem to solve in the nearest wall on moving from one  town to another twenty miles off  all i can do therefore is to  take one set of towns in the walls of which one sort of stones is  commonly found and talk of them taking care of course to choose a  stone which is widely distributed  and such i think we can find in  the socalled new red sandstone which with its attendant marls  covers a vast tractand that a rich and busy oneof england  from  hartlepool and the mouth of the tees down through yorkshire and  nottinghamshire over the manufacturing districts of central england  down the valley of the severn past bristol and the somersetshire  flats to torquay in south devon up northwestward through shropshire  and cheshire past liverpool and northward through lancashire  reappearing again north of the lake mountains about carlisle and  the scotch side of the solway frith stretches the new red sandstone  plain from under which everywhere the coalbearing rocks rise as  from a sea  it contains in many places excellent quarries of  buildingstone the most famous of which perhaps are the wellknown  runcorn quarries near liverpool from which the old romans brought  the material for the walls and temples of ancient chester and from  which the stone for the restoration of chester cathedral is being  taken at this day  in some quarters especially in the northwest of  england its soil is poor because it is masked by that very boulder clay of which i spoke in my last paper  but its rich red marls  wherever they come to the surface are one of gods most precious  gifts to this favoured land  on them one finds oneself at once in a  garden amid the noblest of timber wheat roots grass which is  green through the driest summers and in the western counties  ciderorchards laden with red and golden fruit  i know throughout  northern europe no such charming scenery for quiet beauty and solid  wealth as that of the new red marls and if i wished to show a  foreigner what england was i should take him along them from  yorkshire to south devon and saythere  is not that a country  worth living forand worth dying for if need be  another reason which i have for dealing with the new red sandstone is  thisthat as i said just now over great tracts of england  especially about the manufacturing districts the towngeologist will  find it covered immediately by the boulder clay  the townsman finding this would have a fair right to suppose that  the clay was laid down immediately or at least soon after the  sandstones or marls on which it lies that as soon as the one had  settled at the bottom of some old sea the other settled on the top  of it in the same sea  a fair and reasonable guess which would in many cases indeed in  most be quite true  but in this case it would be a mistake  the  sandstone and marls are immensely older than the boulderclay  they  are humanly speaking some four or five worlds older  what do i mean  thisthat between the time when the one and the  time when the other was made the british islands and probably the  whole continent of europe have changed four or five times in shape  in height above the sea or depth below it in climate in the kinds  of plants and animals which have dwelt on them or on their sea bottoms  and surely it is not too strong a metaphor to call such  changes a change from an old world to a new one  mind  i do not say that these changes were sudden or violent  it is  far more probable that they are only part and parcel of that vast but  slow change which is going on everywhere over our whole globe  i  think that will appear probable in the course of this paper  but  that these changes have taken place is my main thesis  the fact i  assert and i am bound to try and prove it  and in trying to do so  i shall no longer treat my readers as i did in the first two papers  like children  i shall take for granted that they now understand  something of the method by which geological problems are worked out  and can trust it and me and shall state boldly the conclusions of  geologists only giving proof where proof is specially needed  now you must understand that in england there are two great divisions  of these new red sandstones trias as geologists call them  an  upper called in germany keuper which consists atop of the rich  red marl below them of sandstones and of those vast deposits of  rocksalt which have been long worked and worked to such good  purpose that a vast subsidence of land has just taken place near  nantwich in cheshire and serious fears are entertained lest the town  itself may subside to fill up the caverns below from whence the  salt has been quarried  underneath these beds again are those which  carry the buildingstone of runcorn  now these beds altogether in  cheshire at least are about 3400 feet thick and were not laid  down in a year or in a century either  below them lies a thousand feet of sandstones known in germany by  the name of bunter from its mottled and spotted appearance  what  lies under them again does not concern us just now  i said that the geologists called these beds the trias that is the  triple group  but as yet we have heard of only two parts of it   where is the third  not here but in germany  there between the keuper above and the  bunter below lies a great series of limestone beds which from the  abundance of fossils which they contain go by the name of  muschelkalk  a long epoch must therefore have intervened between the  laying down of the bunter and of the keuper  and we have a trace of  that long epoch even in england  the keuper lies certainly  immediately on the bunter but not always conformably on it  that  is the beds are not exactly parallel  the bunter had been slightly  tilted and slightly waterworn before the keuper was laid on it  it is reasonable therefore to suppose that the bunter in england  was dry land and therefore safe from fresh deposit through ages  during which it was deep enough beneath the sea in germany to have  the muschelkalk laid down on it  here again then as everywhere we  have evidence of timetime not only beyond all counting but beyond  all imagining  and now perhaps the reader will askif i am to believe that all  new land is made out of old land and that all rocks and soils are  derived from the wear and tear of still older rocks off what land  came this enormous heap of sands more than 5000 feet thick in  places stretching across england and into germany  it is difficult to answer  the shape and distribution of land in  those days were so different from what they are now that the rocks  which furnished a great deal of our sandstone may be now for aught i  know a mile beneath the sea  but over the land which still stands out of the sea near us there has  been wear and tear enough to account for any quantity of sand  deposit  as a single instanceit is a provable and proven factas  you may see from mr ramsays survey of north walesthat over a  large tract to the south of snowdon between port madoc and barmouth  there has been ground off and carried away a mass of solid rock  20000 feet thick thick enough in fact if it were there still to  make a range of mountains as high as the andes  it is a provable and  proven fact that vast tracts of the centre of poor old ireland were  once covered with coalmeasures which have been scraped off in  likewise deprived of inestimable mineral wealth  the destruction of  rocksdenudation as it is calledin the district round malvern  is i am told provably enormous  indeed it is so over all wales  north england and west and north scotland  so there is enough of  rubbish to be accounted for to make our new red sands  the round  pebbles in it being i believe pieces of old red sandstone may have  come from the great old red sandstone region of south east wales and  herefordshire  some of the rubbish too may have come from what is  now the isle of anglesey  for you find in the beds from the top to the bottom at least in  cheshire particles of mica  now this mica could not have been  formed in the sand  it is a definite crystalline mineral whose  composition is well known  it is only found in rocks which have been  subjected to immense pressure and probably to heat  the granites  and micaslates of anglesey are full of it and from angleseyas  likely as from anywhere elsethese thin scales of mica came  and  that is about all that i can say on the matter  but it is certain  that most of these sands were deposited in a very shallow water and  very near to land  sand and pebbles as i said in my first paper  could not be carried far out to sea and some of the beds of the  bunter are full of rounded pebbles  nay it is certain that their  surface was often out of water  of that you may see very pretty  proofs  you find these sands ripplemarked as you do shoresands  now  you find cracks where the marl mud has dried in the sun  and  more you find the little pits made by rain  of that i have no  doubt  i have seen specimens in which you could not only see at a  glance that the marks had been made by the large drops of a shower  but see also from what direction the shower had come  these delicate  markings must have been covered up immediately with a fresh layer of  mud or sand  how long since  how long since that flag had seen the  light of the sun when it saw it once again restored to the upper  air by the pick of the quarryman  who can answer that  not i  fossils are very rare in these sands it is not easy to say why  it  may be that the red oxide of iron in them has destroyed them  few or  none are ever found in beds in which it abounds  it is curious too  that the keuper which is all but barren of fossils in england is  full of them in wurtemberg reptiles fish and remains of plants  being common  but what will interest the reader are the footprints  of a strange beast found alike in england and in germanythe  cheirotherium as it was first named from its handlike feet the  labyrinthodon as it is now named from the extraordinary structure  of its teeth  there is little doubt now among anatomists that the  bones and teeth of the socalled labyrinthodon belong to the animal  which made the footprints  if so the creature must have been a  right loathly monster  some think him to have been akin to lizards  but the usual opinion is that he was a cousin of frogs and toads   looking at his hands and other remains one pictures him to oneself  as a short squat brute as big as a fat hog with a head very much  the shape of a baboon very large hands behind and small ones in  front waddling about on the tide flats of a sandy sea and dragging  after him seemingly a short tail which has left its mark on the  sand  what his odour was whether he was smooth or warty what he  ate and in general how he got his living we know not  but there  must have been something there for him to eat and i dare say that he  was about as happy and about as intellectual as the toad is now   remember always that there is nothing alive now exactly like him or  indeed like any animal found in these sandstones  the whole animal  world of this planet has changed entirely more than once since the  labyrinthodon waddled over the cheshire flats  a lizard for  instance which has been found in the keuper had a skull like a  birds and no teetha type which is now quite extinct  but there  is a more remarkable animal of which i must say a few words and one  which to scientific men is most interesting and significant  both near warwick and near elgin in scotland in central india and  in south africa fossil remains are found of a family of lizards  utterly unlike anything now living save one and that one is crawling  about plentifully i believeof all places in the worldin new  zealand  how it got there how so strange a type of creature should  have died out over the rest of the world and yet have lasted on in  that remote island for long ages ever since the days of the new red  sandstone is one of those questionsquite awful questions i  consider themwith which i will not puzzle my readers  i only  mention it to show them what serious questions the scientific man has  to face and to answer if he can  only the next time they go to the  zoological gardens in london let them go to the reptilehouse and  ask the very clever and courteous attendant to show them the  sphenodons or hatterias as he will probably call themand then  look i hope with kindly interest at the oldest conservatives they  ever saw or are like to see gentlemen of most ancient pedigree who  have remained all but unchanged while the whole surface of the globe  has changed around them more than once or twice  and now of course my readers will expect to hear something of the  deposits of rocksalt for which cheshire and its red rocks are  famous  i have never seen them and can only say that the salt does  not it is said by geologists lie in the sandstone but at the  bottom of the red marl which caps the sandstone  it was formed most  probably by the gradual drying up of lagoons such as are depositing  salt it is said now both in the gulf of tadjara on the abyssinian  frontier opposite aden and in the runn of cutch near the delta of  the indus  if this be so then these new red sandstones may be the  remains of a whole saharaa sheet of sandy and all but lifeless  deserts reaching from the west of england into germany and rising  slowly out of the sea to sink as we shall find beneath the sea  again  and now as to the vast period of timethe four or five worlds as i  called itwhich elapsed between the laying down of the new red  sandstones and the laying down of the boulderclays  i think this factfor fact it ismay be better proved by taking  readers an imaginary railway journey to london from any spot in the  manufacturing districts of central englandbegging them meanwhile  to keep their eyes open on the way  and here i must say that i wish folks in general would keep their  eyes a little more open when they travel by rail  when i see young  people rolling along in a luxurious carriage their eyes and their  brains absorbed probably in a trashy shilling novel and never lifted  up to look out of the window unconscious of all that they are  passingof the reverend antiquities the admirable agriculture the  rich and peaceful scenery the like of which no country upon earth  can show unconscious too of how much they might learn of botany  and zoology by simply watching the flowers along the railway banks  and the sections in the cuttings  then it grieves me to see what  little use people make of the eyes and of the understanding which god  has given them  they complain of a dull journey  but it is not the  journey which is dull it is they who are dull  eyes have they and  see not ears have they and hear not mere dolls in smart clothes  too many of them like the idols of the heathen  but my readers i trust are of a better mind  so the next time they  find themselves running up southward to londonor the reverse way let them keep their eyes open and verify with the help of a  geological map the sketch which is given in the following pages  of the black countriesthe actual coal districts i shall speak  hereafter  they are in england either shores or islands yet  undestroyed which stand out of the great sea of new red sandstone  and often carry along their edges layers of far younger rocks called  now permian from the ancient kingdom of permia in russia where  they cover a vast area  with them i will not confuse the reader just  now but will only ask him to keep his eye on the rolling plain of  new red sands and marls past say birmingham and warwick  after  those places these sands and marls dip to the southeast and other  rocks and soils appear above them one after another dipping  likewise towards the southeastthat is toward london  first appear thin layers of a very hard blue limestone full of  shells and parted by layers of blue mud  that rock runs in a broad  belt across england from whitby in yorkshire to lyme in  dorsetshire and is known as lias  famous it is as some readers may  know for holding the bones of extinct monstersichthyosaurs and  plesiosaurs such as the unlearned may behold in the lake at the  crystal palace  on this rock lie the rich cheese pastures and the  best tracts of the famous hunting shires of england  lying on it as we go southeastward appear alternate beds of sandy  limestone with vast depths of clay between them  these oolites  or freestones furnish the famous bath stone the oxford stone and  the barnack stone of northamptonshire of which some of the finest  cathedrals are builta stone only surpassed i believe by the caen  stone which comes from beds of the same age in normandy  these  freestones and clays abound in fossils but of kinds be it  remembered which differ more and more from those of the lias  beneath as the beds are higher in the series and therefore nearer   there too are found principally the bones of that extraordinary  flying lizard the pterodactyle which had wings formed out of its  forelegs on somewhat the same plan as those of a bat but with one  exception  in the bat as any one may see four fingers of the hand  are lengthened to carry the wing while the first alone is left free  as a thumb  but in the pterodactyle the outer or little finger  alone is lengthened and the other four fingers left freeone of  those strange instances in nature of the same effect being produced  in widely different plants and animals and yet by slightly different  means on which a whole chapter of natural philosophysay rather  natural theologywill have to be written some day  but now consider what this lias and the oolites and clays upon it  mean  they mean that the new red sandstone after it had been dry  land or all but dry land as is proved by the footprints of animals  and the deposits of salt was sunk again beneath the sea  each  deposit of limestone signifies a long period of time during which  that sea was pure enough to allow reefs of coral to grow and shells  to propagate at the bottom  each great band of clay signifies a  long period during which fine mud was brought down from some wasting  land in the neighbourhood  and that land was not far distant is  proved by the bones of the pterodactyle of crocodiles and of  marsupials by the fact that the shells are of shallowwater or shore  species by the presence mixed with them of fragments of wood  impressions of plants and even wingshells of beetles and lastly  if further proof was needed by the fact that in the dirtbed of  the isle of portland and the neighbouring shores stumps of trees  allied to the modern sagopalms are found as they grew in the soil  which with them has been covered up in layers of freshwater shale  and limestone  a tropic forest has plainly sunk beneath a lagoon  and that lagoon again beneath the sea  and how long did this period of slow sinking go on  who can tell   the thickness of the lias and oolites together cannot be less than a  thousand feet  considering then the length of time required to lay  down a thousand feet of strata and considering the vast difference  between the animals found in them and the few found in the new red  sandstone we have a right to call them another world and that one  which must have lasted for ages  after we pass oxford or the vale of aylesbury we enter yet another  world  we come to a bed of sand under which the freestones and  their adjoining clays dip to the southeast  this is called commonly  the lower greensand though it is not green but rich ironred  then  succeeds a band of stiff blue clay called the gault and then  another bed of sand the upper greensand which is more worthy of the  name for it does carry in most places a band of green or  glauconite sand  but it and the upper layers of the lower  greensand also are worth our attention for we are all probably  eating them from time to time in the form of bran  it had been long remarked that certain parts of these beds carried  admirable wheatland it had been remarked too that the finest hop landsthose of farnham for instance and tunbridgelay upon them   but that the fertile band was very narrow that as in the surrey  moors vast sheets of the lower greensand were not worth cultivation   what caused the striking difference  my beloved friend and teacher the late dr henslow when professor  of botany at cambridge had brought to him by a farmer so the story  ran a few fossils  he saw being somewhat of a geologist and  chemist that they were not as fossils usually are carbonate of  lime but phosphate of limeboneearth  he said at once as by an  inspiration you have found a treasurenot a goldmine indeed but  a foodmine  this is boneearth which we are at our wits end to  get for our grain and pulse which we are importing as expensive  bones all the way from buenos ayres  only find enough of them and  you will increase immensely the food supply of england and perhaps  make her independent of foreign phosphates in case of war  his advice was acted on for the british farmer is by no means the  stupid personage which townsfolk are too apt to fancy him  this bed  of phosphates was found everywhere in the greensand underlying the  chalk  it may be traced from dorsetshire through england to  cambridge and thence i believe into yorkshire  it may be traced  again i believe all round the weald of kent and sussex from hythe  to farnhamwhere it is peculiarly richand so to eastbourne and  beachey head and it furnishes in cambridgeshire the greater part  of those socalled coprolites which are used perpetually now for  manure being ground up and then treated with sulphuric acid till  they become a soluble superphosphate of lime  so much for the useless hobby as some fancy it of poking over old  bones and stones and learning a little of the composition of this  earth on which god has placed us  how to explain the presence of this vast mass of animal matter in  one or two thin bands right across england i know not  that the  fossils have been rolled on a seabeach is plain to those who look at  them  but what caused so vast a destruction of animal life along  that beach must remain one of the buried secrets of the past  and now we are fast nearing another world which is far younger than  that coprolite bed and has been formed under circumstances the most  opposite to it  we are nearing by whatever rail we approach london  the escarpment of the chalk downs  all readers surely know the white chalk the special feature and  the special pride of the south of england  all know its softly rounded downs its vast beech woods its short and sweet turf its  snowy cliffs which have givenso some sayto the whole island the  name of albionthe white land  but all do not perhaps know that  till we get to the chalk no single plant or animal has been found  which is exactly like any plant or animal now known to be living   the plants and animals grow on the whole more and more like our  living forms as we rise in the series of beds  but only above the  chalk as far as we yet know do we begin to find species identical  with those living now  this in itself would prove a vast lapse of time  we shall have a  further proof of that vast lapse when we examine the chalk itself   it is composedof this there is now no doubtalmost entirely of the  shells of minute animalcules and animalcules i use an unscientific  word for the sake of unscientific readers like these and in some  cases identical with them are now forming a similar deposit of mud  at vast depths over the greater part of the atlantic seafloor   this fact has been put out of doubt by recent deepsea dredgings  a  whole literature has been written on it of late  any reader who  wishes to know it need only ask the first geologist he meets and if  he has the wholesome instinct of wonder in him fill his imagination  with true wonders more grand and strange than he is like to find in  any fairy tale  all i have to do with the matter here is to say  that arguing from the known to the unknown from the atlantic deep sea ooze which we do know about to the chalk which we do not know  about the whole of the chalk must have been laid down at the bottom  of a deep and still ocean far out of the reach of winds tides and  even currents as a great part of the atlantic seafloor is at this  day  prodigious says the reader  and so it is  prodigious to think that  that shallow greensand shore strewed with dead animals should sink  to the bottom of an ocean perhaps a mile perhaps some four miles  deep  prodigious the time during which it must have lain as a still  oceanfloor  for so minute are the living atomies which form the  ooze that an inch i should say is as much as we can allow for  their yearly deposit and the chalk is at least a thousand feet  thick  it may have taken therefore twelve thousand years to form  the chalk alone  a rough guess of course but one as likely to be  two or three times too little as two or three times too big  such  or somewhat such is the fact  it had long been suspected and more  than suspected and the late discoveries of dr carpenter and mr  wyville thompson have surely placed it beyond doubt  thus surely if we call the oolitic beds one new world above the new  red sandstone we must call the chalk a second new world in like  wise  i will not trouble the reader here with the reasons why geologists  connect the chalk with the greensands below it by regular  gradations in spite of the enormous downward leap from seashore to  deep ocean which the beds seem but only seem to have taken  the  changelike all changes in geologywas probably gradual  not by  spasmodic leaps and starts but slowly and stately as befits a god  of order of patience and of strength have these great deeds been  done  but we have not yet done with new worlds or new prodigies on our way  to london as any londoner may ascertain for himself if he will run  out a few miles by rail and look in any cutting or pit where the  surface of the chalk and the beds which lie on it are exposed  on the chalk lieespecially in the blackheath and woolwich district sands and clays  and what do they tell us  of another new world in which the chalk has been lifted up again to  form gradually doubtless and at different points in succession the  shore of a sea  but what proof is there of this  the surface of the chalk is not flat and smooth as it must have been  when at the bottom of the sea  it is eaten out into holes and  furrows plainly by the gnawing of the waves and on it lie in many  places large rolled flints out of chalk which has been destroyed  beds of shoreshingle beds of oysters lying as they grew fresh or  brackish watershells standing as they lived bits of lignite fossil  wood half turned to coal and as in katesgrove pits at reading  leaves of trees  proof enough one would say that the chalk had  been raised till part of it at least became dry land and carried  vegetation  and yet we have not done  there is another world to tell of yet  for these beds known as the woolwich and reading beds dip under  that vast bed of london clay four hundred and more feet thick which  as i said in my last chapter was certainly laid down by the estuary  of some great tropic river among palmtrees and anonas crocodiles  and turtles  is the readers power of belief exhausted  if not  there are to be seen capping almost every high land round  london the remains of a fifth world  some of my readers may have  been to ascot races or to aldershot camp and may recollect the  tableland of the sandy moors perfectly flat atop dreary enough to  those to whom they are not as they have long been to me a home and  a workfield  those sands are several hundred feet thick  they lie  on the london clay  and they representthe reader must take  geologists word for ita series of beds in some places thousands of  feet thick in the isle of wight in the paris basin in the volcanic  country of the auvergne in switzerland in italy a period during  which the land must at first have swarmed with forms of tropic life  and then grownbut very graduallymore temperate and then colder  and colder still till at last set in that age of ice which spread  the boulder pebbles over all rocks and soils indiscriminately from  the lake mountains to within a few miles of london  for everywhere about those ascot moors the top of the sands has been  ploughed by shoreice in winter as they lay awash in the shallow  sea and over them in many places is spread a thin sheet of ice  gravel more ancient the best geologists think than the boulder and  the boulderclay  if any of my readers ask how long the period was during which those  sands of ascot heath and aldershot have been laid down i cannot  tell  but this we can tell  it was long enough to see such changes  in land and sea that maps representing europe during the greater  part of that period as far as we can guess at it look no more like  europe than like america or the south sea islands  and this we can  tell besides  that that period was long enough for the swiss alps to  be lifted up at least 10000 feet of their present height  and that  was a work whichthough god could if he willed it have done it in  a single daywe have proof positive was not done in less than ages  beside which the mortal life of man is as the life of the gnat which  dances in the sun  and all this and moreas may be proved from the geology of foreign  countrieshappened between the date of the boulderclay and that of  the new red sandstone on which it rests    iv  the coal in the fire    my dear towndwelling readers let me tell you now something of a  geological product well known happily to all dwellers in towns and  of late years thanks to railroad extension to most dwellers in  country districts  i mean coal  coal as of course you know is commonly said to be composed of  vegetable matter of the leaves and stems of ancient plants and  treesa startling statement and one which i do not wish you to take  entirely on trust  i shall therefore spend a few pages in showing  you how this factfor fact it iswas discovered  it is a very good  example of reasoning from the known to the unknown  you will have a  right to say at first starting coal is utterly different in look  from leaves and stems  the only property which they seem to have in  common is that they can both burn  true  but difference of mere  look may be only owing to a transformation or series of  transformations  there are plenty in nature quite as great and  greater  what can be more different in look for instance than a  green field of wheat and a basket of loaves at the bakers  and yet  there is i trust no doubt whatsoever that the bread has been once  green wheat and that the green wheat has been transformed into  breadmaking due allowance of course for the bonedust or gypsum  or alum with which the worthy baker may have found it profitable to  adulterate his bread in order to improve the digestion of her  majestys subjects  but you may say yes but we can see the wheat growing flowering  ripening reaped ground kneaded baked  we see in the case of  bread the processes of the transformation going on  but in the case  of coal we do not see the wood and leaves being actually transformed  into coal or anything like it  now suppose we laid out the wheat on a table in a regular series  such as you may see in many exhibitions of manufactures beginning  with the wheat plant at one end and ending with the loaf at the  other and called in to look at them a savage who knew nothing of  agriculture and nothing of cookerycalled in as an extreme case  the man in the moon who certainly can know nothing of either for as  there is neither air nor water round the moon there can be nothing  to grow there and therefore nothing to cookand suppose we asked  him to study the series from end to end  do you not think that the  man in the moon if he were half as shrewd as crofton croker makes  him in his conversation with daniel orourke would answer after due  meditation how the wheat plant got changed into the loaf i cannot  see from my experience in the moon  but that it has been changed  and that the two are the same thing i do see for i see all the  different stages of the change  and so i think you may say of the  wood and the coal  the man in the moon would be quite reasonable in his conclusion for  it is a law a rule and one which you will have to apply again and  again in the study of natural objects that however different two  objects may look in some respects yet if you can find a regular  series of gradations between them with all shades of likeness first  to one of them and then to the other then you have a fair right to  suppose them to be only varieties of the same species the same kind  of thing and that therefore they have a common origin  that sounds rather magniloquent  let me give you a simple example  suppose you had come into britain with brute the grandson of aeneas  at that remote epoch when as all archaeologists know who have duly  read geoffrey of monmouth and the arthuric legends britain was  inhabited only by a few giants  now if you had met giants with one  head and also giants with seven heads and no others you would have  had a right to say there are two breeds of giants here oneheaded  and sevenheaded  but if you had found as jack the giantkiller  who belongs to the same old cycle of myths appears to have found  twoheaded giants also and threeheaded and giants indeed with  any reasonable number of heads would you not have been justified in  saying they are all of the same breed after all only some are  more capitate or heady than others  i hope that you agree to that reasoning for by it i think we arrive  most surely at a belief in the unity of the human race and that the  negro is actually a man and a brother  if the only two types of men in the world were an extreme white type  like the norwegians and an extreme black type like the negros then  there would be fair ground for saying these two types have been  always distinct they are different races who have no common  origin  but if you found as you will find many types of man  showing endless gradations between the white man and the negro and  not only that but endless gradations between them both and a third  type whose extreme perhaps is the chineseendless gradations i  say showing every conceivable shade of resemblance or difference  till you often cannot say to what type a given individual belongs  and all of them however different from each other more like each  other than they are like any other creature upon earth then you are  justified in saying all these are mere varieties of one kind   however distinct they are now they were probably like each other at  first and therefore all probably had a common origin  that seems  to me sound reasoning and advanced natural science is corroborating  it more and more daily  now apply the same reasoning to coal  you may find about the world you may see even in england aloneevery gradation between coal and  growing forest  you may see the forest growing in its bed of  vegetable mould you may see the forest dead and converted into peat  with stems and roots in it that again into sunken forests like  those to be seen below highwater mark on many coasts of this island   you find gradations between them and beds of lignite or wood coal  then gradations between lignite and common or bituminous coal and  then gradations between common coal and culm or anthracite such as  is found in south wales  have you not a right to say these are all  but varieties of the same kind of thingnamely vegetable matter   they have a common originnamely woody fibre  and coal or rather  culm is the last link in a series of transformations from growing  vegetation  this is our first theory  let us try to verify it as scientific men  are in the habit of doing by saying if that be true then something  else is likely to be true too  if coal has all been vegetable soil then it is likely that some of  it has not been quite converted into shapeless coal  it is likely  that there will be vegetable fibre still to be seen here and there  perhaps leaves perhaps even stems of trees as in a peat bog  let  us look for them  you will not need to look far  the coal and the sands and shales  which accompany the coal are so full of plantremains that three  hundred species were known to adolphe brongniart as early as 1849  and that number has largely increased since  now one point is specially noticeable about these plants of the coal  namely that they may at least have grown in swamps  first you will be interested if you study the coal flora with the  abundance beauty and variety of the ferns  now ferns in these  islands grow principally in rocky woods because there beside the  moisture they get from decaying vegetable or decaying rock  especially limestone the carbonic acid which is their special food  and which they do not get on our dry pastures and still less in our  cultivated fields  but in these islands there are two noble species  at least which are true swampferns the lastraea thelypteris which  of old filled the fens but is now all but extinct and the osmunda  or kingfern which as all know will grow wherever it is damp  enough about the roots  in hampshire in devon and cornwall and in  the southwest of ireland the kingfern too is a true swamp fern   but in the tropics i have seen more than once noble treeferns  growing in wet savannahs at the sealevel as freely as in the  mountainwoods ferns with such a stem as some of the coal ferns had  some fifteen feet in height under which as one rode on horseback  one saw the blazing blue sky as through a parasol of delicate lace  as men might have long ages since have seen it through the plumed  fronds of the ferns now buried in the coal had there only been a man  then created to enjoy its beauty  next we find plants called by geologists calamites  there is no  doubt now that they are of the same family as our equiseta or horse tails a race which has over most parts of the globe dwindled down  now from twenty or thirty feet in height as they were in the old  coal measures to paltry little weeds  the tallest equisetum in  englandthe beautiful e telmateiais seldom five feet high  but  they too are mostly mud and swamp plants and so may the calamites  have been  the lepidodendrons again are without doubt the splendid old  representatives of a family now dwindled down to such creeping things  as our clubmosses or lycopodiums  now it is a certain fact which  can be proved by the microscope that a very great part of the best  coal is actually made up of millions of the minute seeds of club mosses such as growa few of them and those very smallon our  moors a proof surely not only of the vast amount of the vegetation  in the coalmaking age but also of the vast time during which it  lasted  the lepidodendra may have been fifty or sixty feet high   there is not a lycopodium in the world now i believe five feet  high  but the clubmosses are now in these islands and elsewhere  lovers of wet and peaty soils and so may their huger prototypes have  been in the old forests of the coal  of the sigillariae we cannot say as much with certainty for  botanists are not agreed as to what low order of flowerless plants  they belong  but that they rooted in clay beds there is proof as  you will hear presently  and as to the conifers or pinelike treesthe dadoxylon of which  the pith goes by the name of sternbergia and the uncertain tree  which furnishes in some coalmeasures bushels of a seed connected  with that of the yewwe may suppose that they would find no more  difficulty in growing in swamps than the cypress which forms so  large a portion of the vegetation in the swamps of the southern  united states  i have given you these hints because you will naturally wish to know  what sort of a world it was in which all these strange plants grew  and turned into coal  my answer is that it was most probably just like the world in which  we are living now with the one exception that the plants and animals  are different  it was the fashion a few years since to explain the coallike other  phenomena of geologyby some mere hypothesis of a state of things  quite unlike what we see now  we were brought up to believe that in  the carboniferous or coalbearing era the atmosphere was intensely  moist and hot and overcharged with carbonic acid which had been  poured out from the interior of the planet by volcanic eruptions or  by some other convulsion  i forget most of it now  and really there  is no need to remember for it is all i verily believe a dreaman  attempt to explain the unknown not by the known but by the still  more unknown  you may find such theories lingering still in  sensational schoolbooks if you like to be unscientific  if you  like on the other hand to be scientific you will listen to those  who tell you that instead of there having been one unique  carboniferous epoch with a peculiar coalmaking climate all epochs  are carboniferous if they get the chance that coal is of every age  from that of the scotch and english beds up to the present day  the  great coalbeds along the rocky mountains for instance are  tertiarythat is later than the chalk  coal is forming now i  doubt not in many places on the earth and would form in many more  if man did not interfere with the processes of wild nature by  draining the fens and embanking the rivers  let me by a few words prove this statement  they will give you  beside a fresh proof of sir charles lyells great geological rule that the best way to explain what we see in ancient rocks is to take  for granted as long as we can do so fairly that things were going  on then very much as they are going on now  when it was first seen that coal had been once vegetable the  question arosehow did all these huge masses of vegetable matter get  there  the yorkshire and derbyshire coalfields i hear cover 700  or 800 square miles the lancashire about 200  how large the north  wales and the scotch fields are i cannot say  but doubtless a great  deal more coal than can be got at lies under the sea especially in  the north of wales  coal probably exists over vast sheets of england  and france buried so deeply under later rocks that it cannot be  reached by mining  as an instance a distinguished geologist has  long held that there are beds of coal under london itself which  rise owing to a peculiar disturbance of the strata to within 1000  or 1200 feet of the surface and that we or our children may yet see  coalmines in the marshes of the thames  and more it is a provable  fact that only a portion of the coal measures is left  a great part  of ireland must once have been covered with coal which is now  destroyed  indeed it is likely that the coal now known of in europe  and america is but a remnant of what has existed there in former  ages and has been eaten away by the inroads of the sea  now whence did all that enormous mass of vegetable soil come  off  some neighbouring land was the first and most natural answer  it  was a rational one  it proceeded from the known to the unknown  it  was clear that these plants had grown on land for they were land plants  it was clear that there must have been land close by for  between the beds of coal as you all know the rock is principally  coarse sandstone which could only have been laid down as i have  explained to you already in very shallow water  it was natural then to suppose that these plants and trees had been  swept down by rivers into the sea as the sands and muds which buried  them had been  and it was known that at the mouths of certain  riversthe mississippi for instancevast rafts of dead floating  trees accumulated and that the bottoms of the rivers were often full  of snags etc trees which had grounded and stuck in the mud and  why should not the coal have been formed in the same way  becauseand this was a serious objectionthen surely the coal would  be impuremixed up with mud and sand till it was not worth burning   instead of which the coal is usually pure vegetable parted sharply  from the sandstone which lies on it  the only other explanation was  that the coal vegetation had grown in the very places where it was  found  but that seemed too strange to be true till that great  geologist sir w loganwho has since done such good work in canada showed that every bed of coal had a bed of clay under it and that  that clay always contained fossils called stigmaria  then it came  out that the stigmaria in the under clay had long filaments attached  to them while when found in the sandstones or shales they had lost  their filaments and seemed more or less rolledin fact that the  natural place of the stigmaria was in the under clay  then mr  binney discovered a treea sigillaria standing upright in the coal measures with its roots attached  those roots penetrated into the  under clay of the coal and those roots were stigmarias  that seems  to have settled the question  the sigillarias at least had grown  where they were found and the clay beneath the coalbeds was the  original soil on which they had grown  just so if you will look at  any peat bog you will find it bottomed by clay which clay is pierced  everywhere by the roots of the moss forming the peat or of the  trees birches alders poplars and willows which grow in the bog   so the proof seemed complete that the coal had been formed out of  vegetation growing where it was buried  if any further proof for  that theory was needed it would be found in this fact most  ingeniously suggested by mr boyd dawkins  the resinous spores or  seeds of the lepidodendra make upas said abovea great part of the  bituminous coal  now those spores are so light that if the coal had  been laid down by water they would have floated on it and have been  carried away and therefore the bituminous coal must have been  formed not under water but on dry land  i have dwelt at length on these further arguments because they seem  to me as pretty a specimen as i can give my readers of that regular  and gradual induction that commonsense regulated by which  geological theories are worked out  but how does this theory explain the perfect purity of the coal  i  think sir c lyell answers that question fully in p 383 of his  students elements of geology  he tells us that the dense growths  of reeds and herbage which encompass the margins of forestcovered  swamps in the valley and delta of the mississippi in passing through  them are filtered and made to clear themselves entirely before they  reach the areas in which vegetable matter may accumulate for  centuries forming coal if the climate be favourable and that in the  cypressswamps of that region no sediment mingles with the vegetable  matter accumulated from the decay of trees and semiaquatic plants  so that when in a very dry season the swamp is set on fire pits  are burnt into the ground many feet deep or as far as the fire can  go down without reaching water and scarcely any earthy residuum is  left just as when the soil of the english fens catches fire redhot  holes are eaten down through pure peat till the waterbearing clay  below is reached  but the purity of the water in peaty lagoons is  observable elsewhere than in the delta of the mississippi  what can  be more transparent than many a pool surrounded by quaking bogs  fringed as they are in ireland with a ring of white waterlilies  which you dare not stoop to pick lest the peat bending inward  slide you down into that clear dark gulf some twenty feet in depth  bottomed and walled with yielding ooze from which there is no  escape  most transparent likewise is the water of the west indian  swamps  though it is of the colour of coffee or rather of dark  beer and so impregnated with gases that it produces fever or cholera  when drunk yet it isat least when it does not mingle with the salt  waterso clear that one might see every marking on a boa constrictor or alligator if he glided along the bottom under the  canoe  but now comes the questioneven if all this be true how were the  forests covered up in shale and sandstone one after another  by gradual sinking of the land one would suppose  if we find as we may find in a hundred coalpits trees rooted as  they grew with their trunks either standing up through the coal and  through the sandstone above the coal their bark often remaining as  coal while their inside is filled up with sandstone has not our  commonsense a right to saythe land on which they grew sank below  the waterline the trees were killed and the mud and sand which  were brought down the streams enveloped their trunks  as for the  inside being full of sandstone have we not all seen hollow trees   do we not all know that when a tree dies its wood decays first its  bark last  it is so especially in the tropics  there one may see  huge dead trees with their bark seemingly sound and their inside a  mere cavern with touchwood at the bottom into which caverns one used  to peep with some caution  for though one might have found inside  only a pair of toucans or parrots or a whole party of jolly little  monkeys one was quite as likely to find a poisonous snake four or  five feet long whose bite would have very certainly prevented me  having the pleasure of writing this book  now is it not plain that if such trees as that sunk their bark would  be turned into lignite and at last into coal while their insides  would be silted up with mud and sand  thus a core or pillar of hard  sandstone would be formed which might do to the collier of the  future what they are too apt to do now in the newcastle and bristol  collieries  for there when the coal is worked out below the  sandstone stemscoalpipes as the colliers call themin the roof  of the seam having no branches and nothing to hold them up but  their friable bark of coal are but too apt to drop out suddenly  killing or wounding the hapless men below  or again if we findas we very often findas was found at  parkfield colliery near wolverhampton in the year 1814a quarter  of an acre of coalseam filled with stumps of trees as they grew  their trunks broken off and lying in every direction turned into  coal and flattened as coalfossils so often are by the weight of  the rock aboveshould we not have a right to saythese trees were  snapped off where they grew by some violent convulsion by a storm  or by a sudden inrush of water owing to a sudden sinking of the land  or by the very earthquake shock itself which sank the land  but what evidence have we of such sinkings  the plain fact that you  have coalseam above coalseam each with its bed of underclay and  that therefore the land must have sunk ere the next bed of soil could  have been deposited and the next forest have grown on it  in one of the rocky mountain coalfields there are more than thirty  seams of coal each with its underclay below it  what can that mean  but thirty or more subsidences of the land and the peat of thirty or  more forests or peatmosses one above the other  and now if any  reader shall say subsidence  what is this quite new element which  you have brought into your argument  you told us that you would  reason from the known to the unknown  what do we know of subsidence   you offered to explain the thing which had gone on once by that which  is going on now  where is subsidence going on now upon the surface  of our planet  and where too upheaval such as would bring us  these buried forests up again from under the sealevel and make  them like our british coalfield dry land once more  the answer issubsidence and elevation of the land are common now  probably just as common as they were in any age of this planets  history  to give two instances made now notorious by the writings of  geologists  as lately as 1819 a single earthquake shock in cutch at  the mouth of the indus sunk a tract of land larger than the lake of  geneva in some places to a depth of eighteen feet and converted it  into an inland sea  the same shock raised a few miles off a  corresponding sheet of land some fifty miles in length and in some  parts sixteen miles broad ten feet above the level of the alluvial  plain and left it to be named by the countrypeople the ullah  bund or bank of god to distinguish it from the artificial banks in  the neighbourhood  again  in the valley of the mississippia tract which is now it  would seem in much the same state as central england was while our  coalfields were being laid downthe earthquakes of 181112 caused  large lakes to appear suddenly in many parts of the district amid  the dense forests of cypress  one of these the sunk country near  new madrid is between seventy and eighty miles in length and thirty  miles in breadth and throughout it as late as 1846 dead trees  were conspicuous some erect in the water others fallen and strewed  in dense masses over the bottom in the shallows and near the  shore  i quote these words from sir charles lyells principles of  geology 11th edit vol i p 453  and i cannot do better than  advise my readers if they wish to know more of the way in which coal  was formed to read what is said in that book concerning the delta of  the mississippi and its strata of forests sunk where they grew and  in some places upraised again alternating with beds of clay and  sand vegetable soil recent seashells and what not forming to a  depth of several hundred feet just such a mass of beds as exists in  our own coalfields at this day  if therefore the reader wishes to picture to himself the scenery of  what is now central england during the period when our coal was  being laid down he has only i believe to transport himself in  fancy to any great alluvial delta in a moist and warm climate  favourable to the growth of vegetation  he has only to conceive  wooded marshes at the mouth of great rivers slowly sinking beneath  the sea the forests in them killed by the water and then covered up  by layers of sand brought down from inland till that new layer  became dry land to carry a fresh crop of vegetation  he has thus  all that he needs to explain how coalmeasures were formed  i myself  saw once a scene of that kind which i should be sorry to forget for  there was as i conceived coal making or getting ready to be made  before my eyes  a sheet of swamp sinking slowly into the sea for  there stood trees still rooted below highwater mark and killed by  the waves while inland huge trees stood dying or dead from the  water at their roots  but what a scenea labyrinth of narrow  creeks so narrow that a canoe could not pass up haunted with  alligators and boaconstrictors parrots and white herons amid an  inextricable confusion of vegetable mud roots of the alderlike  mangroves and tangled creepers hanging from tree to tree and  overhead huge fanpalms delighting in the moisture mingled with  still huger broadleaved trees in every stage of decay  the drowned  vegetable soil of ages beneath me above my head for a hundred feet  a mass of stems and boughs and leaves and flowers compared with  which the richest hothouse in england was poor and small  but if the  sinking process which was going on continued a few hundred years all  that huge mass of wood and leaf would be sunk beneath the swamp and  covered up in mud washed down from the mountains and sand driven in  from the sea to form a bed many feet thick of what would be first  peat then lignite and last it may be coal with the stems of  killed trees standing up out of it into the new mud and sandbeds  above it just as the sigillariae and other stems stand up in the  coalbeds both of britain and of nova scotia while over it a fresh  forest would grow up to suffer the same fateif the sinking process  went onas that which had preceded it  that was a sight not easily to be forgotten  but we need not have  gone so far from home at least a few hundred years ago to see an  exactly similar one  the fens of norfolk and cambridgeshire before  the rivers were embanked the water pumped off the forests felled  and the reedbeds ploughed up were exactly in the same state  the  vast deposits of peat between cambridge and the sea often filled  with timbertrees either fallen or upright as they grew and often  mixed with beds of sand or mud brought down in floods were formed  in exactly the same way and if they had remained undrained then  that slow sinking which geologists say is going on over the whole  area of the fens would have brought them gradually but surely  below the sealevel to be covered up by new forests and converted  in due time into coal  and future geologists would have foundthey  may find yet if which god forbid england should become barbarous  and the trees be thrown out of cultivationinstead of fossil  lepidodendra and sigillariae calamites and ferns fossil ashes and  oaks alders and poplars bulrushes and reeds  almost the only  fossil fern would have been that tall and beautiful lastraea  thelypteris once so abundant now all but destroyed by drainage and  the plough  we need not therefore fancy any extraordinary state of things on  this planet while our english coal was being formed  the climate of  the northern hemispherebritain at least and nova scotiawas  warmer than now to judge from the abundance of ferns and especially  of treeferns but not so warm to judge from the presence of  conifers trees of the pine tribe as the tropics  moreover there  must have been it seems to me a great scarcity of animallife   insects are found beautifully preserved a few reptiles too and  landshells but very few  and where are the traces of such a  swarming life as would be entombed were a tropic forest now sunk  which is found entombed in many parts of our english fens  the only  explanation which i can offer is thisthat the clubmosses tree ferns pines and other lowranked vegetation of the coal afforded  little or no food for animals as the same families of plants do to  this day and if creatures can get nothing to eat they certainly  cannot multiply and replenish the earth  but be that as it may the  fact that coal is buried forest is not affected  meanwhile the shape and arrangements of sea and land must have been  utterly different from what they are now  where was that great land  off which great rivers ran to deposit our coalmeasures in their  deltas  it has been supposed for good reasons that northwestern  france belgium holland and germany were then under the sea that  denmark and norway were joined to scotland by a continent a tongue  of which ran across the centre of england and into ireland dividing  the northern and southern coalfields  but how far to the west and  north did that old continent stretch  did it as it almost certainly  did long ages afterwards join greenland and north america with  scotland and norway  were the northern fields of nova scotia which  are of the same geological age as our own and contain the same  plants laid down by rivers which ran off the same continent as ours   who can tell now  that old land and all record of it save what  these fragmentary coalmeasures can give are buried in the dark  abyss of countless ages and we can only look back with awe and  comfort ourselves with the thoughtlet time be ever so vast yet  time is not eternity  one word more  if my readers have granted that all for which i have  argued is probable they will still have a right to ask for further  proof  they will be justified in saying  you say that coal is transformed  vegetable matter but can you show us how the transformation takes  place  is it possible according to known natural laws  the chemist must answer that  and he tells us that wood can become  lignite or woodcoal by parting with its oxygen in the shape of  carbonic acid gas or chokedamp and then common or bituminous coal  by parting with its hydrogen chiefly in the form of carburetted  hydrogenthe gas with which we light our streets  that is about as  much as the unscientific reader need know  but it is a fresh  corroboration of the theory that coal has been once vegetable fibre  for it shows how vegetable fibre can by the laws of nature become  coal  and it certainly helps us to believe that a thing has been  done if we are shown that it can be done  this fact explains also why in mines of woodcoal carbonic acid  ie chokedamp alone is given off  for in the woodcoal a great  deal of the hydrogen still remains  in mines of true coal not only  is chokedamp given off but that more terrible pest of the miners  firedamp or explosive carburetted hydrogen and olefiant gases  now  the occurrence of that firedamp in mines proves that changes are  still going on in the coal  that it is getting rid of its hydrogen  and so progressing toward the state of anthracite or culmstonecoal  as it is sometimes called  in the pennsylvanian coalfields some of  the coal has actually done this under the disturbing force of  earthquakes for the coal which is bituminous like our common coal  to the westward where the strata are horizontal becomes gradually  anthracite as it is tossed and torn by the earthquake faults of the  alleghany and appalachian mountains  and is a further transformation possible  yes and more than one   if we conceive the anthracite cleared of all but its last atoms of  oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen till it has become all but pure  carbon it would becomeas it has become in certain rocks of immense  antiquity graphitewhat we miscall blacklead  and after that it  might go through one transformation more and that the most startling  of all  it would need only perfect purification and crystallisation  to becomea diamond nothing less  we may consider the coal upon  the fire as the middle term of a series of which the first is live  wood and the last diamond and indulge safely in the fancy that  every diamond in the world has probably at some remote epoch formed  part of a growing plant  a strange transformation which will look to us more strange more  truly poetical the more steadily we consider it  the coal on the fire the table at which i writewhat are they made  of  gas and sunbeams with a small percentage of ash or earthy  salts which need hardly be taken into account  gas and sunbeams  strange but true  the life of the growing plantand what that life is who can tell laid hold of the gases in the air and in the soil of the carbonic  acid the atmospheric air the waterfor that too is gas  it drank  them in through its rootlets  it breathed them in through its leaf pores that it might distil them into sap and bud and leaf and  wood  but it has to take in another element without which the  distillation and the shaping could never have taken place  it had to  drink in the sunbeamsthat mysterious and complex force which is for  ever pouring from the sun and making itself partly palpable to our  senses as heat and light  so the life of the plant seized the  sunbeams and absorbed them buried them in itselfno longer as  light and heat but as invisible chemical force locked up for ages  in that woody fibre  so it is  lord lytton told us long ago in a beautiful song how   the wind and the beam loved the rose   but natures poetry was more beautiful than mans  the wind and the  beam loved the rose so well that they made the roseor rather the  rose took the wind and the beam and built up out of them by her own  inner life her exquisite texture hue and fragrance  what next  the rose dies the timber tree dies decays down into  vegetable fibre is buried and turned to coal  but the plant cannot  altogether undo its own work  even in death and decay it cannot set  free the sunbeams imprisoned in its tissue  the sunforce must stay  shut up age after age invisible but strong working at its own  prisoncells transmuting them or making them capable of being  transmuted by man into the manifold products of coalcoke  petroleum mineral pitch gases coaltar benzole delicate aniline  dyes and what not till its day of deliverance comes  man digs it throws it on the fire a black deadseeming lump  a  corner an atom of it warms till it reaches the igniting point the  temperature at which it is able to combine with oxygen  and then like a dormant live thing awaking after ages to the sense  of its own powers its own needs the whole lump is seized atom  after atom with an infectious hunger for that oxygen which it lost  centuries since in the bottom of the earth  it drinks the oxygen in  at every pore and burns  and so the spell of ages is broken  the sunforce bursts its prison cells and blazes into the free atmosphere as light and heat once  more returning in a moment into the same forms in which it entered  the growing leaf a thousand centuries since  strange it all is yet true  but of nature as of the heart of man  the old saying standsthat truth is stranger than fiction    v  the lime in the mortar    i shall presume in all my readers some slight knowledge about lime   i shall take for granted for instance that all are better informed  than a certain party of australian black fellows were a few years  since  in prowling on the track of a party of english settlers to see what  they could pick up they cameoh joyon a sack of flour dropped  and left behind in the bush at a certain creek  the poor savages had  not had such a prospect of a good meal for many a day  with endless  jabbering and dancing the whole tribe gathered round the precious  flourbag with all the pannikins gourds and other hollow articles  it could muster each of course with a due quantity of water from the  creek therein and the chief began dealing out the flour by handfuls  beginning of course with the boldest warriors  but horror of  horrors each mans porridge swelled before his eyes grew hot  smoked boiled over  they turned and fled man woman and child  from before that supernatural prodigy and the settlers coming back  to look for the dropped sack saw a sight which told the whole tale   for the poor creatures in their terror had thrown away their pans  and calabashes each filled with that which it was likely to contain  seeing that the sack itself had contained not flour but quicklime   in memory of which comitragedy that creek is called to this day  flourbag creek  now i take for granted that you are all more learned than these black  fellows and know quicklime from flour  but still you are not bound  to know what quicklime is  let me explain it to you  lime properly speaking is a metal which goes among chemists by the  name of calcium  but it is formed as you all know in the earth  not as a metal but as a stone as chalk or limestone which is a  carbonate of lime that is calcium combined with oxygen and  carbonicacid gases  in that state it will make if it is crystalline and hard excellent  building stone  the finest white marble like that of carrara in  italy of which the most delicate statues are carved is carbonate of  lime altered and hardened by volcanic heat  but to make mortar of  it it must be softened and then brought into a state in which it can  be hardened again and ages since some man or other who deserves to  rank as one of the great inventors one of the great benefactors of  his race discovered the art of making lime soft and hard again in  fact of making mortar  the discovery was probably very ancient and  made probably like most of the old discoveries in the east  spreading westward gradually  the earlier greek buildings are  cyclopean that is of stone fitted together without mortar  the  earlier egyptian buildings though the stones are exquisitely squared  and polished are put together likewise without mortar  so long  ages after were the earlier roman buildings and even some of the  later  the famous aqueduct of the pont du gard near nismes in the  south of france has if i recollect right no mortar whatever in it   the stones of its noble double tier of circular arches have been  dropped into their places upon the wooden centres and stand unmoved  to this day simply by the jamming of their own weight a miracle of  art  but the fact is puzzling for these romans were the best mortar  makers of the world  we cannot i believe surpass them in the art  even now and in some of their old castles the mortar is actually to  this day harder and tougher than the stones which it holds together   and they had plenty of lime at hand if they had chosen to make  mortar  the pont du gard crosses a limestone ravine and is itself  built of limestone  but i presume the cunning romans would not trust  mortar made from that coarse nummulite limestone filled with gritty  sand and preferred with their usual carefulness no mortar at all  to bad  but i must return and tell my readers in a few words the chemical  history of mortar  if limestone be burnt or rather roasted in a  kiln the carbonic acid is given offas you may discover by your own  nose as many a poor tramp has discovered too late when on a cold  winter night he has lain down by the side of the burning kiln to  keep himself warm and woke in the other world stifled to death by  the poisonous fumes  the lime then gives off its carbonic acid and also its water of  crystallisation that is water which it holds as do many rocks  locked up in it unseen and only to be discovered by chemical  analysis  it is then anhydrousthat is waterlessoxide of lime  what we call quicklime that which figured in the comitragedy of  flourbag creek and then as you may find if you get it under your  nails or into your eyes will burn and blister like an acid  this has to be turned again into a hard and tough artificial  limestone in plain words into mortar and the first step is to  slack itthat is to give it back the water which it has lost and  for which it is as it were thirsting  so it is slacked with water  which it drinks in heating itself and the water till it steams and  swells in bulk because it takes the substance of the water into its  own substance  slacked lime as we all know is not visibly wetter  than quicklime it crumbles to a dry white powder in spite of all  the water which it contains  then it must be made to set that is to return to limestone to  carbonate of lime by drinking in the carbonic acid from water and  air which some sorts of lime will do instantly setting at once and  being therefore used as cements  but the lime usually employed must  be mixed with more or less sand to make it set hard  a mysterious  process of which it will be enough to tell the reader that the sand  and lime are said to unite gradually not only mechanically that is  by sticking together but also in part chemicallythat is by  forming out of themselves a new substance which is called silicate  of lime  be that as it may the mortar paste has now to do two things first  to dry and next to take up carbonic acid from the air and water  enough to harden it again into limestone  and that it will take some  time in doing  a thick wall i am informed requires several years  before it is set throughout and has acquired its full hardness or  rather toughness and good mortar as is well known will acquire  extreme hardness with age probably from the very same cause that it  did when it was limestone in the earth  for as a general rule the  more ancient the strata is in which the limestone is found the  harder the limestone is except in cases where volcanic action and  earthquake pressure have hardened limestone in more recent strata as  in the case of the white marbles of carrara in italy which are of  the age of our oolites that is of the freestone of bath etc  hardened by the heat of intruded volcanic rocks  but now  what is the limestone and how did it get where it isnot  into the mortar i mean but into the limestone quarry  let me tell  you or rather help you to tell yourselves by leading you as  before from the known to the unknown  let me lead you to places  unknown indeed to most but there may be sailors or soldiers among my  readers who know them far better than i do  let me lead you in  fancy to some island in the tropic seas  after all i am not  leading you as far away as you fancy by several thousand miles as  you will see i trust ere i have done  let me take you to some island  what shall it be like  shall it be  a high island with cliff piled on cliff and peak on peak all rich  with mighty forests like a furred mantle of green velvet mounting  up and up till it is lost among white clouds above  or shall it be a  mere low reef which you do not see till you are close upon it on  which nothing rises above the water but here and there a knot of  cocoanut palms or a block of stone or a few bushes swarming with  innumerable seafowl and their eggs  let it be which you will  both  are strange enough both beautiful both will tell us a story  the ship will have to lieto and anchor if she can it may be a  mile it may be only a few yards from the land  for between it and  the land will be a line of breakers raging in before the warm trade wind  and this you will be told marks the edge of the coral reef  you will have to go ashore in a boat over a sea which looks  unfathomable and which may be a mile or more in depth and search  for an opening in the reef through which the boat can pass without  being knocked to pieces  you find one  and in a moment what a change  the deep has suddenly  become shallow the blue white from the gleam of the white coral at  the bottom  but the coral is not all white only indeed a little of  it for as you look down through the clear water you find that the  coral is starred with innumerable live flowers blue crimson grey  every conceivable hue and that these are the coral polypes each  with its ring of arms thrust out of its cell who are building up  their common habitations of lime  if you want to understand by a  rough but correct description what a coral polype is  all who have  been to the seaside know or at least have heard of seaanemones   now coral polypes are seaanemones which make each a shell of lime  growing with its growth  as for their shapes the variety of them  the beauty of them no tongue can describe them  if you want to see  them go to the coral rooms of the british or liverpool museums and  judge for yourselves  only remember that you must reclothe each of  those exquisite forms with a coating of live jelly of some delicate  hue and put back into every one of the thousand cells its living  flower and into the beds or rather banks of the saltwater flower  garden the gaudiest of shellless seaanemones such as we have on  our coasts rooted in the cracks and live shells and seaslugs as  gaudy as they crawling about with fifty other forms of fantastic  and exuberant life  you must not overlook too the fish especially  the parrotfish some of them of the gaudiest colours who spend  their lives in browsing on the live coral with strong clipping and  grinding teeth just as a cow browses the grass keeping the animal  matter and throwing away the lime in the form of an impalpable white  mud which fills up the interstices in the coral beds  the bottom just outside the reef is covered with that mud mixed  with more limemud which the surge wears off the reef and if you  have as you should have a dredge on board and try a haul of that  mud as you row home you may find but not always animal forms  rooted in it which will delight the soul of a scientific man  one  i hope would be some sort of terebratula or shell akin to it  you  would probably think it a cockle  but you would be wrong  the  animal which dwells in it has about the same relationship to a cockle  as a dog has to a bird  it is a brachiopod a family with which the  ancient seas once swarmed but which is rare now all over the world  having been supplanted and driven out of the seas by newer and  stronger forms of shelled animals  the nearest spot at which you are  likely to dredge a live brachiopod will be in the deep water of loch  fyne in argyleshire where two species still linger fastened  strangely enough to the smooth pebbles of a submerged glacier  formed in the open air during the age of ice but sunk now to a depth  of eighty fathoms  the first time i saw those shells come up in the  dredge out of the dark and motionless abyss i could sympathise with  the feelings of mingled delight and awe which so my companion told  me the great professor owen had in the same spot first beheld the  same lingering remnants of a primaeval world  the other might be but i cannot promise you even a chance of  dredging that unless you were off the coast of portugal or the  windward side of some of the west india islands a live crinoid an  exquisite starfish with long and branching arms but rooted in the  mud by a long stalk and that stalk throwing out barren side  branches the whole a living plant of stone  you may see in museums  specimens of this family now so rare all but extinct  and yet  fifty or a hundred different forms of the same type swarmed in the  ancient seas  whole masses of limestone are made up of little else  but the fragments of such animals  but we have not landed yet on the dry part of the reef  let us make  for it taking care meanwhile that we do not get our feet cut by the  coral or stung as by nettles by the coral insects  we shall see  that the dry land is made up entirely of coral ground and broken by  the waves and hurled inland by the storm sometimes in huge  boulders mostly as fine mud and that under the influence of the  sun and of the rain which filters through it charged with lime from  the rotting coral the whole is setting as cement sets into rock   and what is this  a long bank of stone standing up as a low cliff  ten or twelve feet above highwater mark  it is full of fragments of  shell of fragments of coral of all sorts of animal remains and the  lower part of it is quite hard rock  moreover it is bedded in  regular layers just such as you see in a quarry  but how did it get  there  it must have been formed at the sealevel some of it  indeed under the sea for here are great masses of madrepore and  limestone corals imbedded just as they grew  what lifted it up   your companions if you have any who know the island have no  difficulty in telling you  it was hove up they say in the  earthquake in such and such a year and they will tell you perhaps  that if you will go on shore to the main island which rises inside  the reef you may see dead coral beds just like these lying on the  old rocks and sloping up along the flanks of the mountains to  several hundred feet above the sea  i have seen such many a time  thus you find the coral being converted gradually into a limestone  rock either fine and homogeneous composed of coral grown into pulp  or filled with corals and shells or with angular fragments of older  coral rock  did you never see that last  no  yes you have a  hundred times  you have but to look at the marbles commonly used  about these islands with angular fragments imbedded in the mass and  here and there a shell the whole cemented together by water holding  in solution carbonate of lime and there see the very same phenomenon  perpetuated to this day  thus i think we have got first from the known to the unknown from  a tropic coral island back here to the limestone hills of great  britain and i did not speak at random when i said that i was not  leading you away as far as you fancied by several thousand miles  examine any average limestone quarry from bristol to berwick and you  will see there all that i have been describing that is all of it  which is not soft animal matter certain to decay  you will see the  limemud hardened into rock beds you will see the shells embedded in  it you will see the corals in every stage of destruction you will  see whole layers made up of innumerable fragments of crinoidsno  wonder they are innumerable for it has been calculated there are  in a single animal of some of the species 140000 joints140000  bits of lime to fall apart when its soft parts decay  but is it not  all there  and why should it not have got there by the same process  by which similar old coral beds get up the mountain sides in the west  indies and elsewhere namely by the upheaving force of earthquakes   when you see similar effects you have a right to presume similar  causes  if you see a man fall off a house here and break his neck  and some years after in london or new york or anywhere else find  another man lying at the foot of another house with his neck broken  in the same way is it not a very fair presumption that he has fallen  off a house likewise  you may be wrong  he may have come to his end by a dozen other  means  but you must have proof of that  you will have a full right  in science and in common sense to saythat man fell off the house  till some one proves to you that he did not  in fact there is nothing which you see in the limestones of these  islessave and except the difference in every shell and coralwhich  you would not see in the coralbeds of the west indies if such  earthquakes as that famous one at st thomass in 1866 became  common and periodic upheaving the land they needs upheave it a very  little only two hundred and fifty feet till st thomass and all  the virgin isles and the mighty mountain of porto rico which looms  up dim and purple to the west were all joined into dry land once  more and the lonely coralshoal of anegada were raised as it would  be raised then into a limestone tableland like that of central  ireland of galway or of county clare  but you must clearly understand that however much these coralline  limestones have been upheaved since they were formed yet the sea bottom while they were being formed was sinking and not rising   this is a fact which was first pointed out by mr darwin from the  observations which he made in the worldfamous voyage of the beagle  and the observations of subsequent great naturalists have all gone to  corroborate his theory  it was supposed at first you must understand that when a coral  island rose steeply to the surface of the sea out of blue water  perhaps a thousand fathoms or more that fact was plain proof that  the little coral polypes had begun at the bottom of the sea and in  the course of ages built up the whole island an enormous depth  but it soon came out that that theory was not correct for the coral  polypes cannot live and build save in shallow watersay in thirty to  forty fathoms  indeed some of the strongest and largest species  work best at the very surface and in the cut of the fiercest surf   and so arose a puzzle as to how coral rock is often found of vast  thickness which mr darwin explained  his theory was and there is  no doubt now that it is correct that in these cases the seabottom  is sinking that as it sinks carrying the coral beds down with it  the coral dies and a fresh live crop of polypes builds on the top of  the houses of their dead ancestors  so that as the depression goes  on generation after generation builds upwards the living on the  dead keeping the upper surface of the reef at the same level while  its base is sinking downward into the abyss  applying this theory to the coral reef of the pacific ocean the  following interesting facts were made out  that where you find an island rising out of deep water with a ring  of coral round it a little way from the shoreor as in eastern  australia a coast with a fringing reef the flinders reef of  australia is eleven thousand miles longthat is a pretty sure sign  that that shore or mountain is sinking slowly beneath the sea   that where you find as you often do in the pacific a mere atoll or  circular reef of coral with a shallow pond of smooth water in the  centre and deep sea round that is a pretty sure sign that the  mountaintop has sunk completely into the sea and that the corals  are going on building where its peak once was  and more  on working out the geography of the south sea islands by  the light of this theory of mr darwins the following extraordinary  fact has been discovered  that over a great part of the pacific ocean sinking is going on and  has been going on for ages and that the greater number of the  beautiful and precious south sea islands are only the remnants of a  vast continent or archipelago which once stretched for thousands of  miles between australia and south america  now applying the same theory to limestone beds which are as you  know only fossil coral reefs we have a right to say when we see in  england scotland ireland limestones several thousand feet thick  that while they were being laid down as coral reef the seabottom  and probably the neighbouring land must have been sinking to the  amount of their thicknessto several thousand feetbefore that  later sinking which enabled several hundred feet of millstone grit to  be laid down on the top of the limestone  this millstone grit is a new and a very remarkable element in our  strange story  from derby to northumberland it forms vast and lofty  moors capping as at whernside and penygent the highest limestone  hills with its hard rough barren and unfossiliferous strata   wherever it is found it lies on the top of the mountain or  carboniferous limestone  almost everywhere where coal is found in  england it lies on the millstone grit  i speak roughly for fear of  confusing my readers with details  the three deposits pass more or  less in many places into each other  but always in the order of  mountain limestone below millstone grit on it and coal on that  again  now what does its presence prove  what but this  that after the  great coral reefs which spread over somersetshire and south wales  around the present estuary of the severnand those once perhaps  joined to them which spread from derby to berwick with a western  branch through northeast waleswere laid downafter all this i  say some change took place in the seabottom and brought down on  the reefs of coral sheets of sand which killed the corals and buried  them in grit  does any reader wish for proof of this  let him  examine the cherty or flinty beds which so often appear where the  bottom of the millstone grit is passing into the top of the mountain  limestonethe beds to give an instance which are now quarried on  the top of the halkin mountain in flintshire for chert which is  sent to staffordshire to be ground down for the manufacture of china   he will find layers in those beds of several feet in thickness as  hard as flint but as porous as sponge  on examining their cavities  he will find them to be simply hollow casts of innumerable joints of  crinoids so exquisitely preserved even to their most delicate  markings that it is plain they were never washed about upon a beach  but have grown where or nearly where they lie  what then has  happened to them  they have been killed by the sand  the soft parts  of the animals have decayed letting the 140000 joints more or  less belonging to each animal fall into a heap and be imbedded in  the growing sandrock and then it may be long years after water  filtering through the porous sand has removed the lime of which the  joints were made and left their perfect casts behind  so much for the millstone grits  how long the deposition of sand  went on how long after it that second deposition of sands took  place which goes by the name of the gannister or lower coal measures we cannot tell  but it is clear at least that parts of  that ancient sea were filling up and becoming dry land  for coal or  fossilised vegetable matter becomes more and more common as we  ascend in the series of beds till at last in the upper coal measures the enormous wealth of vegetation which grew much of it  where it is now found prove the existence of some such sheets of  fertile and forestclad lowland as i described in my last paper  thousands of feet of rich coral reef thousands of feet of barren  sands then thousands of feet of rich alluvial forestand all these  sliding into each other if not in one place then in another  without violent break or change this is the story which the lime in  the mortar and the coal on the fire between the two reveal    vi  the slates on the roof    the slates on the roof should be when rightly understood a pleasant  subject for contemplation to the dweller in a town  i do not ask him  to imitate the boy who cliffbred from his youth used to spend  stolen hours on the housetop with his back against a chimneystalk  transfiguring in his imagination the roofslopes into mountainsides  the slates into sheets of rock the cats into lions and the sparrows  into eagles  i only wish that he shouldat least after reading this  paperlet the slates on the roof carry him back in fancy to the  mountains whence they came perhaps to pleasant trips to the lakes  and hills of cumberland westmoreland and north wales and to  recogniseas he will do if he have intellect as well as fancyhow  beautiful and how curious an object is a common slate  beautiful not only for the compactness and delicacy of its texture  and for the regularity and smoothness of its surface but still more  for its colour  whether merely warm grey as when dry or bright  purple as when wet the colour of the english slate well justifies  mr ruskins saying that wherever there is a brick wall and a slate  roof there need be no want of rich colour in an english landscape   but most beautiful is the hue of slate when shining wet in the  sunshine after a summer shower its blue is brought out in rich  contrast by golden spots of circular lichen whose spores i presume  have travelled with it off its native mountains  then indeed it  reminds the voyager of a sight which it almost rivals in brilliancy of the sapphire of the deep ocean brought out into blazing intensity  by the contrast of the golden patches of floating gulfweed beneath  the tropic sun  beautiful i say is the slate and curious likewise nay venerable  a most ancient and elaborate work of god which has lasted long  enough and endured enough likewise to bring out in it whatsoever  latent capabilities of strength and usefulness might lie hid in it  which has literally beenas far as such words can apply to a thing  inanimate   heated hot with burning fears and bathed in baths of hissing tears and battered by the strokes of doom to shape and use   and yet it was at first naught but an ugly lump of soft and shapeless  ooze  therefore the slates to me are as a parable on which i will not  enlarge but will leave each reader to interpret it for himself  i  shall confine myself now to proofs that slate is hardened mud and to  hints as to how it assumed its present form  that slate may have been once mud is made probable by the simple  fact that it can be turned into mud again  if you grind tip slate  and then analyse it you will find its mineral constituents to be  exactly those of a fine rich and tenacious clay  the slate  districts at least in snowdon carry such a rich clay on them  wherever it is not masked by the ruins of other rocks  at  ilfracombe in north devon the passage from slate below to clay  above may be clearly seen  wherever the top of the slate beds and  the soil upon it is laid bare the black layers of slate may be seen  gradually meltingif i may use the wordunder the influence of rain  and frost into a rich tenacious clay which is now not black like  its parent slate but red from the oxidation of the iron which it  contains  but granting this how did the first change take place  it must be allowed at starting that time enough has elapsed and  events enough have happened since our supposed mud began first to  become slate to allow of many and strange transformations  for  these slates are found in the oldest beds of rocks save one series  in the known world and it is notorious that the older and lower the  beds in which the slates are found the better that is the more  perfectly elaborate is the slate  the best slates of snowdoni  must confine myself to the district which i know personallyare  found in the socalled cambrian beds  below these beds but one  series of beds is as yet known in the world called the laurentian   they occur to a thickness of some eighty thousand feet in labrador  canada and the adirondack mountains of new york  but their  representatives in europe are as far as is known only to be found in  the northwest highlands of scotland and in the island of lewis  which consists entirely of them  and it is to be remembered as a  proof of their inconceivable antiquity that they have been upheaved  and shifted long before the cambrian rocks were laid down  unconformably on their worn and broken edges  above the cambrian slateswhether the lower and older ones of  penrhyn and llanberris which are the sameone slate mountain being  worked at both sides in two opposite valleysor the upper and newer  slates of tremadoc lie other and newer slatebearing beds of  inferior quality and belonging to a yet newer world the silurian   to them belong the llandeilo flags and slates of wales and the  skiddaw slates of cumberland amid beds abounding in extinct fossil  forms  fossil shells are found it is true in the upper cambrian  beds  in the lower they have all but disappeared  whether their  traces have been obliterated by heat and pressure and chemical  action during long ages or whether in these lower beds we are  actually reaching that primordial zone conceived of by m barrande  namely rocks which existed before living things had begun to people  this planet is a question not yet answered  i believe the former  theory to be the true one  that there was life in the sea at least  even before the oldest cambrian rocks were laid down is proved by  the discovery of the now famous fossil the eozoon in the laurentian  limestones which seems to have grown layer after layer and to have  formed reefs of limestone as do the living coralbuilding polypes   we know no more as yet  but all that we do know points downwards  downwards still warning us that we must dig deeper than we have dug  as yet before we reach the graves of the first living things  let this suffice at present for the cambrian and laurentian rocks  the silurian rocks lower and upper which in these islands have  their chief development in wales and which are nearly thirtyeight  thousand feet thick and the devonian or old red sandstone beds  which in the fans of brecon and carmarthenshire attain a thickness of  ten thousand feet must be passed through in an upward direction  before we reach the bottom of that carboniferous limestone of which i  spoke in my last paper  we thus find on the cambrian rocks forty five thousand feet at least of newer rocks in several cases lying  unconformably on each other showing thereby that the lower beds had  been upheaved and their edges worn off on a seashore ere the upper  were laid down on them and throughout this vast thickness of rocks  the remains of hundreds of forms of animals corals shells fish  older forms dying out in the newer rocks and new ones taking their  places in a steady succession of evervarying forms till those in  the upper beds have become unlike those in the lower and all are  from the beginning more or less unlike any existing now on earth   whole families indeed disappear entirely like the trilobites  which seem to have swarmed in the silurian seas holding the same  place there as crabs and shrimps do in our modern seas  they vanish  after the period of the coal and their place is taken by an allied  family of crustaceans of which only one form as far as i am aware  lingers now on earth namely the king crab or limulus of the  indian seas a wellknown animal of which specimens may sometimes be  seen alive in english aquaria  so perished in the lapse of those  same ages the armourplated or ganoid fish which hugh miller made  so justly famousand which made him so justly famous in return appearing first in the upper silurian beds and abounding in vast  variety of strange forms in the old red sandstone but gradually  disappearing from the waters of the world till their only  representatives as far as known are the lepidostei or bony  pikes of north america the polypteri of the nile and senegal the  lepidosirens of the african lakes and western rivers the ceratodus  or barramundi of queensland the two latter of which approach  amphibians and one or two more fantastic forms either rudimentary  or degraded which have lasted on here and there in isolated stations  through long ages comparatively unchanged while all the world is  changed around them and their own kindred buried like the fossil  ceratodus of the trias beneath thousands of feet of ancient rock  among creatures the likes whereof are not to be found now on earth   and these are but two examples out of hundreds of the vast changes  which have taken place in the animal life of the globe between the  laying down of the cambrian slates and the present time  surelyand it is to this conclusion i have been tending throughout a  seemingly wandering paragraphsurely there has been time enough  during all those ages for clay to change into slate  and how were they changed  i think i cannot teach my readers this more simply than by asking  them first to buy sheet no lxxviii se bangor of the snowdon  district of the government geological survey which may be ordered at  any good stationers price 3s and study it with me  he will see  down the righthand margin interpretations of the different colours  which mark the different beds beginning with the youngest alluvium  atop and going down through carboniferous limestone and sandstone  upper silurian lower silurian cambrian and below them certain  rocks marked of different shades of red which signify rocks either  altered by heat or poured out of old volcanic vents  he will next  see that the map is covered with a labyrinth of red patches and  curved lines signifying the outcrop or appearance at the surface of  these volcanic beds  they lie at every conceivable slope and the  hills and valleys have been scooped out by rain and ice into every  conceivable slope likewise  wherefore we see here a broad patch of  red where the back of a sheet of lava porphyry greenstone or what  not is exposed there a narrow line curving often with the curve of  the hillside where only the edge of a similar sheet is exposed and  every possible variety of shape and attitude between these two  he  will see also large spaces covered with little coloured dots which  signify as he will find at the margin beds of volcanic ash  if he  look below the little coloured squares on the margin he will see  figures marking the strike or direction of the inclination of the  bedsinclined vertical horizontal contorted that the white lines  in the map signify faults ie shifts in the strata the gold lines  lodes of metalthe latter of which i should advise him strongly in  this district at least not to meddle with  but to button up his  pockets and to put into the fire in wholesome fear of his own  weakness and ignorance any puffs of mining companies which may be  sent himas one or two have probably been sent him already  furnished with which keys to the map let him begin to con it over  sure that there is if not an order still a grand meaning in all its  seeming confusion and let him if he be a courteous and grateful  person return due thanks to professor ramsay for having found it all  out not without wondering as i have often wondered how even  professor ramsays acuteness and industry could find it all out  when my reader has studied awhile the confusionfor it is a true  confusionof the different beds he will ask or at least have a  right to ask what known process of nature can have produced it  how  have these various volcanic rocks which he sees marked as felspathic  traps quartz porphyries greenstones and so forth got intermingled  with beds which he is told to believe are volcanic ashes and those  again with fossilbearing silurian beds and cambrian slates which he  is told to believe were deposited under water  and his puzzle will  not be lessened when he is told that in some cases as in that of  the summit of snowdon these very volcanic ashes contain fossil  shells  the best answer i can give is to ask him to use his imagination or  his common sense and to picture to himself what must go on in the  case of a submarine eruption such as broke out off the coast of  iceland in 1783 and 1830 off the azores in 1811 and in our day in  more than one spot in the pacific ocean  a main bore or ventor more than oneopens itself between the  bottom of the sea and the nether fires  from each rushes an enormous  jet of highpressure steam and other gases which boils up through  the sea and forms a cloud above that cloud descends again in heavy  rain and gives out often true lightning from its under side  but it does more  it acts as a true steamgun hurling into the air  fragments of cold rock rasped off from the sides of the bore and  fragments also of melted lava and clouds of dust which fall again  into the sea and form there beds either of fine mud or of breccia that is fragments of stone embedded in paste  this the reader will  understand is no fancy sketch as far as i am concerned  i have  steamed into craters sawn through by the sea and showing sections of  beds of ash dipping outwards and under the sea and in them boulders  and pebbles of every size which had been hurled out of the crater  and in them also veins of hardened lava which had burrowed out  through the soft ashes of the cone  of those lava veins i will speak  presently  what i want the reader to think of now is the immense  quantity of ash which the steammitrailleuse hurls to so vast a  height into the air that it is often drifted many miles down to  leeward  to give two instances  the jet of steam from vesuvius in  the eruption of 1822 rose more than four miles into the air the jet  from the souffriere of st vincent in the west indies in 1812  probably rose higher certainly it met the ne tradewind for it  poured down a layer of ashes several inches thick not only on st  vincent itself but on barbadoes eighty miles to windward and  therefore on all the sea between  now let us consider what that  representsa layer of fine mud laid down at the bottom of the  ocean several inches thick eighty miles at least long and twenty  miles perhaps broad by a single eruption  suppose that hardened in  long ages as it would be under pressure into a bed of fine grained  felstone or volcanic ash and we can understand how the ashbeds of  snowdoniawhich may be traced some of them for many square miles were laid down at the bottom of an ancient sea  but now about the lavas or true volcanic rocks which are painted as  is usual in geological maps red  let us go down to the bottom of  the sea and build up our volcano towards the surface  first as i said the subterranean steam would blast a bore  the  dust and stones rasped and blasted out of that hole would be spread  about the seabottom as an ashbed sloping away round the hole then  the molten lava would rise in the bore and flow out over the ashes  and the seabottomperhaps in one direction perhaps all round   then usually the volcano having vented itself would be quieter  for a time till the heat accumulated below and more ash was blasted  out making a second ashbed and then would follow a second lava  flow  thus are produced the alternate beds of lava and ash which are  so common  now suppose that at this point the volcano was exhausted and lay  quiet for a few hundred years or more  if there was any land near  from which mud and sand were washed down we might have layers on  layers of sediment deposited with live shells etc living in them  which would be converted into fossils when they died and so we  should have fossiliferous beds over the ashes and lavas  indeed  shells might live and thrive in the ashmud itself when it cooled  and the sea grew quiet as they have lived and thriven in snowdonia  now suppose that after these sedimentary beds are laid down by water  the volcano breaks out againwhat would happen  many things  specially this which has often happened already  the lava kept down by the weight of these new rocks searches for  the point of least resistance and finds it in a more horizontal  direction  it burrows out through the softer ashbeds and between  the sedimentary beds spreading itself along horizontally  this  process accounts for the very puzzling though very common case in  snowdon and elsewhere in which we find lavas interstratified with  rocks which are plainly older than those lavas  perhaps when that is  done the volcano has got rid of all its lava and is quiet  but if  not sooner or later it bores up through the new sedimentary rocks  faulting them by earthquake shocks till it gets free vent and begins  its layers of alternate ash and lava once more  and consider this fact also  if near the first as often happens  there is another volcano the lava from one may run over the lava  from the other and we may have two lavas of different materials  overlying each other which have come from different directions  the  ashes blown out of the two craters may mingle also and so in the  course of ages the result may be such a confusion of ashes lavas  and sedimentary rocks as we find throughout most mountain ranges in  snowdon in the lake mountains in the auvergne in france in sicily  round etna in italy round vesuvius and in so many west indian  islands the last confusion of which is very likely to be this  that when the volcano has succeededas it did in the case of sabrina  island off the azores in 1811 and as it did perhaps often in  snowdoniain piling up an ash cone some hundred feet out of the sea  thatas has happened to sabrina islandthe cone is sunk again by  earthquakes and gnawn down at the same time by the seawaves till  nothing is left but a shoal under water  but where have all its vast  heaps of ashes gone  to be spread about over the bottom of the sea  to mingle with the mud already there and so make beds of which like  many in snowdon we cannot say whether they are of volcanic or of  marine origin because they are of both  but what has all this to do with the slates  i shall not be surprised if my readers ask that question two or three  times during this paper  but they must be kind enough to let me tell  my story my own way  the slates were not made in a day and i fear  they cannot be explained in an hour  unless we begin carefully at  the beginning in order to end at the end  let me first make my  readers clearly understand that all our slatebearing mountains and  most also of the nonslatebearing ones likewise are formed after  the fashion which i have described namely beneath the sea  i do  not say that there may not have been again and again ashcones  rising above the surface of the waves  but if so they were washed  away again and again ages before the land assumed anything of its  present shape ages before the beds were twisted and upheaved as they  are now  and therefore i beg my readers to put out of their minds once and for  all the fancy that in any known part of these islands craters are to  be still seen such as exist in etna or vesuvius or other volcanoes  now at work in the open air  it is necessary to insist on this because many people hearing that  certain mountains are volcanic concludeand very naturally and  harmlesslythat the circular lakes about their tops are true  craters  i have been told for instance that that wonderful little  blue glas llyn under the highest cliff of snowdon is the old crater  of the mountain and i have heard people insist that a similar lake  of almost equal grandeur in the south side of cader idris is a  crater likewise  but the fact is not so  any one acquainted with recent craters would  see at once that glas llyn is not an ancient one and i am not  surprised to find the government geologists declaring that the llyn  on cader idris is not one either  the fact is that the crater or  rather the place where the crater has been in ancient volcanoes of  this kind is probably now covered by one of the innumerable bosses  of lava  for as an eruption ceases the melted lava cools in the vents and  hardens usually into lava infinitely harder than the ashcone round  it and this when the ashcone is washed off remains as the highest  part of the hill as in the mont dore and the cantal in france and  in several extinct volcanoes in the antilles  of course the lava  must have been poured out and the ashes blown out from some vents or  other connected with the nether world of fire probably from many  successive vents  for in volcanoes when one vent is choked another  is wont to open at some fresh point of least resistance among the  overlying rocks  but where are these vents  buried deep under  successive eruptions shifted probably from their places by  successive upheavings and dislocations and if we wanted to find them  we should have to quarry the mountain range all over a mile deep  before we hit upon here and there a taproot of ancient lava  connecting the upper and the nether worlds  there are such tap roots probably under each of our british mountain ranges  but  snowdon certainly does not owe its shape to the fact of one of  these old fire vents being under it  it owes its shape simply to the  accident of some of the beds toward the summit being especially hard  and thus able to stand the wear and tear of seawave ice and rain   its lakes have been formed quite regardless of the lie of the rocks  though not regardless of their relative hardness  but what forces  scooped them outwhether they were originally holes left in the  ground by earthquakes and deepened since by rain and rivers or  whether they were scooped out by ice or by any other means is a  question on which the best geologists are yet undecideddecided only  on thisthat craters they are not  as for the enormous changes which have taken place in the outline of  the whole of the mountains since first their strata were laid down  at the bottom of the sea  i shall give facts enough before this  paper is done to enable readers to judge of them for themselves  the reader will now ask naturally enough how such a heap of beds as  i have described can take the shape of mountains like snowdon  look at any sea cliff in which the strata are twisted and set on  slope  there are hundreds of such in these isles  the beds must  have been at one time straight and horizontal  but it is equally  clear that they have been folded by being squeezed laterally  at  least that is the simplest explanation as may be proved by  experiment  take a number of pieces of cloth or any such stuff lay  them on each other and then squeeze them together at each end  they  will arrange themselves in folds just as the beds of the cliff have  done  and if instead of cloth you take some more brittle matter  you will find that as you squeeze on these folds will tend to snap  at the points of greatest tension or stretching which will be of  course at the anticlinal and synclinal linesin plain english the  tops and bottoms of the folds  thus cracks will be formed and if  the pressure goes on the ends of the layers will shift against each  other in the line of those cracks forming faults like those so  common in rocks  but again suppose that instead of squeezing these broken and folded  lines together any more you took off the pressure right and left  and pressed them upwards from below by a mimic earthquake  they  would rise and as they rose leave open space between them  now if  you could contrive to squeeze into them from below a paste which  would harden in the cracks and between the layers and so keep them  permanently apart you would make them into a fair likeness of an  average mountain rangea messif i may make use of a plain old  wordof rocks which have by alternate contraction and expansion  helped in the latter case by the injection of molten lava been  thrust about as they are in most mountain ranges  that such a contraction and expansion goes on in the crust of the  earth is evident for here are the palpable effects of it  and the  simplest general cause which i can give for it is this  that things  expand as they are heated and contract as they are cooled  now i am not learned enoughand were i i have not timeto enter  into the various theories which philosophers have put forward to  account for these grand phenomena  the most remarkable perhaps and the most probable is the theory of  m elie de beaumont which is in a few words this  that this earth like all the planets must have been once in a state  of intense heat throughout as its mass inside is probably now  that it must be cooling and giving off its heat into space  that therefore as it cools its crust must contract  that therefore in contracting wrinkles for the loftiest mountain  chains are nothing but tiny wrinkles compared with the whole mass of  the earth wrinkles i say must form on its surface from time to  time  and that the mountain chains are these wrinkles  be that as it may we may safely say this  that wherever the  internal heat of the earth tends as in the case of volcanoes  towards a particular spot that spot must expand and swell up  bulging the rocks out and probably cracking them and inserting  melting lava into those cracks from below  on the other hand if the  internal heat leaves that spot again and it cools then it must  contract more or less in falling inward toward the centre of the  earth and so the beds must be crumpled and crushed and shifted  against each other still more as those of our mountains have been  but here may arise in some of my readers minds a reasonable  questionif these upheaved beds were once horizontal should we not  be likely to find them in some places horizontal still  a reasonable question and one which admits of a full answer  they know of course that there has been a gradual but steady  change in the animals of this planet and that the relative age of  beds can on the strength of that known change be determined  generally by the fossils usually shells peculiar to them  so that  if we find the same fashion of shells and still more the same  species of shells in two beds in different quarters of the world  then we have a right to saythese beds were laid down at least about  the same time  that is a general rule among all geologists and not  to be gainsaid  now i think i may say that granting that we can recognise a bed by  its fossils there are few or no beds which are found in one place  upheaved broken and altered by heat which are not found in some  other place still horizontal unbroken unaltered and more or less  as they were at first  from the most recent beds from the upheaved coralrocks of the west  indies and the upheaved and faulted boulder clay and chalk of the  isle of moen in denmarkdownwards through all the strata down to  that very ancient one in which the best slates are found this rule  i believe stands true  it stands true certainly of the ancient silurian rocks of wales  cumberland ireland and scotland  for throughout great tracts of russia and in parts of norway and  sweden sir roderick murchison discovered our own silurian beds  recognisable from their peculiar fossils  but in what state  not  contracted upheaved and hardened to slates and grits as they are  in wales and elsewhere  but horizontal unbroken and still soft  because undisturbed by volcanic rooks and earthquakes  at the bottom  of them all near petersburg sir roderick found a shale of dried mud  to quote his own words so soft and incoherent that it is even  used by sculptors for modelling although it underlies the great mass  of fossilbearing silurian rocks and is therefore of the same age  as the lower crystalline hard slates of north wales  so entirely  have most of these eldest rocks in russia been exempted from the  influence of change throughout those enormous periods which have  passed away since their accumulation  among the many discoveries which science owes to that illustrious  veteran i know none more valuable for its bearing on the whole  question of the making of the earthcrust than this one magnificent  fact  but what a contrast between these scandinavian and russian rocks and  those of britain  never exceeding in scandinavia a thousand feet  in thickness and lying usually horizontal as they were first laid  down they are swelled in britain to a thickness of thirty thousand  feet by intruded lavas and ashes snapt turned set on end at every  conceivable angle shifted against each other to such an extent  that to give a single instance in the vale of gwynnant under  snowdon an immense wedge of porphyry has been thrust up in what is  now the bottom of the valley between rocks far newer than it on one  side to a height of eight hundred on the other to a height of  eighteen hundred feethalf the present height of snowdon  nay the  very slate beds of snowdonia have not forced their way up from under  the mountainwithout long and fearful struggles  they are set in  places upright on end then horizontal again then sunk in an  opposite direction then curled like seawaves then set nearly  upright once more and faulted through and through six times i  believe in the distance of a mile or two they carry here and there  on their backs patches of newer beds the rest of which has long  vanished and in their rise they have hurled back to the eastward  and set upright what is now the whole western flank of snowdon a  mass of rock which was then several times as thick as it is now  the force which thus tortured them was probably exerted by the great  mass of volcanic quartzporphyry which rises from under them to the  northwest crossing the end of the lower lake of the llanberris and  indeed the shifts and convulsions which have taken place between them  and the menai straits are so vast that they can only be estimated by  looking at them on the section which may be found at the end of  professor ramsays geological survey of north wales  but anyone  who will study that section and use as with the map a little  imagination and common sense will see that between the heat of that  porphyry which must have been poured out as a fluid mass as hot  probably as melted iron and the pressure of it below and of the  silurian beds above the cambrian mudstrata of llanberris and  penrhyn quarries must have suffered enough to change them into  something very different from mud and therefore probably into  what they are nownamely slate  and now at last we have got to the slates on the roof and may  disport ourselves over themlike the cats  look at any piece of slate  all know that slate splits or cleaves  freely in one direction only into flat layers  now any one would  suppose at first sight and fairly enough that the flat surfacethe  plane of cleavagewas also the plane of bedding  in simpler  english we should saythe mud which has hardened into the slate was  laid down horizontally and therefore each slate is one of the little  horizontal beds of it perhaps just what was laid down in a single  tide  we should have a right to do so because that would be true of  most sedimentary rocks  but it would not be true of slate  the  plane of bedding in slate has nothing to do with the plane of  cleavage  or more plainly the mud of which the slate is made may  have been deposited at the seabottom at any angle to the plane of  cleavage  we may sometimes see the lines of the true beddingthe  lines which were actually horizontal when the mud was laid downin  bits of slate and find them sometimes perpendicular to sometimes  inclined to and sometimes again coinciding with the plane of  cleavage which they have evidently acquired long after  nay more  these parallel planes of cleavage at each of which the  slate splits freely will run through a whole mountain at the same  angle though the beds through which they run may be tilted at  different angles and twisted into curves  now what has made this change in the rook  we do not exactly know   one thing is clear that the particles of the now solid rock have  actually moved on themselves  and this is proved by a very curious  factwhich the reader if he geologises about slate quarries much  may see with his own eyes  the fossils in the slate are often  distorted into quaint shapes pulled out long if they lie along the  plane of cleavage or squeezed together or doubled down on both  sides if they lie across the plane  so that some force has been at  work which could actually change the shape of hard shells very  slowly no doubt else it would have snapped and crumbled them  if i am asked what that force was i do not know  i should advise  young geologists to read what sir henry de la beche has said on it in  his admirable geological observer pp 706725  he will find  there too some remarks on that equally mysterious phenomena of  jointing which you may see in almost all the older rocks it is  common in limestones  all we can say is that some force has gone  on or may be even now going on in the more ancient rocks which is  similar to that which produces single crystals and similar too to  that which produced the jointed crystals of basalt ie lava at the  giants causeway in ireland and staffa in the hebrides  two  philosophersmr robert were fox and mr robert huntare of opinion  that the force which has determined the cleavage of slates may be  that of the electric currents which as is well known run through  the crust of the earth  mr sharpe i believe attributes the  cleavage to the mere mechanical pressure of enormous weights of rock  especially where crushed by earthquakes  professor rogers again  points out that as these slates may have been highly heated thermal  electricity ie electricity brought out by heat may have acted on  them  one thing at least is clear  that the best slates are found among  ancient lavas and also in rocks which are faulted and tilted  enormously all which could not have happened without a  proportionately enormous pressure and therefore heat and next that  the best slates are invariably found in the oldest bedsthat is in  the beds which have had most time to endure the changes whether  mechanical or chemical which have made the earths surface what we  see it now  another startling fact the section of snowdonia and i believe of  most mountain chains in these islands would provenamely that the  contour of the earths surface as we see it now depends very  little certainly in mountains composed of these elder rocks upon the  lie of the strata or beds but has been carved out by great forces  long after those beds were not only laid down and hardened but  faulted and tilted on end  snowdon itself is so remarkable an  instance of this fact that as it is a mountain which every one in  these happy days of excursiontrains and steamers either has seen or  can see i must say a few more words about it  any one who saw that noble peak leaping high into the air dominating  all the country round at least upon three sides and was told that  its summit consisted of beds much newer not much older than the  slatebeds fifteen hundred feet down on its northwestern flankany  one i say would have the right at first sight on hearing of  earthquake faults and upheavals to saythe peak of snowdon has been  upheaved to its present height above and out of the lower lands  around  but when he came to examine sections he would find his  reasonable guess utterly wrong  snowdon is no swelling up of the  earths crust  the beds do not as they would in that case slope up  to it  they slope up from it to the northwest in one direction  and the southsouthwest in the other and snowdon is a mere  insignificant boss left hanging on one slope of what was once an  enormous trough or valley of strata far older than itself  by  restoring these strata in the direction of the angles in which they  crop out and vanish at the surface it is found that to the north westthe direction of the menai straitsthey must once have risen  to a height of at least six or seven thousand feet and more by  restoring them specially the ashbed of snowdon towards the south eastwhich can be done by the guidance of certain patches of it left  on other hillsit is found that south of ffestiniog where the  cambrian rocks rise again to the surface the south side of the  trough must have sloped upwards to a height of from fifteen to twenty  thousand feet whether at the bottom of the sea or in the upper air  we cannot tell  but the fact is certain that off the surface of  wales south of ffestiniog a mass of solid rock as high as the andes  has been worn down and carried bodily away and that a few miles  south again the peak of arran mowddy which is now not two thousand  feet high was onceeither under the sea or above itnearer ten  thousand feet  if i am asked whither is all that enormous mass of rockmillions of  tonsgone  where is it now  i know not  but if i dared to hazard  a guess i should say it went to make the new red sandstones of  england  the new red sandstones must have come from somewhere  the most  likely region for them to have come from is from north wales where  as we know vast masses of gritty rock have been ground off such as  would make fine sandstones if they had the chance  so that many a  grain of sand in chester walls was probably once blasted out of the  bowels of the earth into the old silurian sea and after a few  hundreds of thousands of years repose in a snowdonian ashbed was  sent eastward to build the good old city and many a good town more  and the red marlthe great deposit of red marl which covers a wide  region of englandwhy should not it have come from the same quarter   why should it not be simply the remains of the snowdon slate  mud  the slate was and into mud it has returned  why not  some of the  richest red marl land i know is as i have said actually being made  now out of the black slates of ilfracombe wherever they are  weathered by rain and air  the chemical composition is the same   the difference in colour between black slate and red marl is caused  simply by the oxidation of the iron in the slate  and if my readers want a probable cause why the sandstones lie  undermost and the red marl uppermostcan they not find one for  themselves  i do not say that it is the cause but it is at least a  causa vera one which would fully explain the fact though it may be  explicable in other ways  think then or shall i think for my  readers  then do they not see that when the welsh mountains were ground down  the silurian strata being uppermost would be ground down first and  would go to make the lower strata of the great new red sandstone  lowland and that being sandy they would make the sandstones  but  wherever they were ground through the lower cambrian slates would be  laid bare and their remains being washed away by the sea the last  would be washed on to the top of the remains of the silurians and so  as in most cases the remains of the older rock when redeposited by  water would lie on the remains of the younger rock  and do they not  see that if what i just said is true these slates would grind up  into red marl such as is seen over the west and south of cheshire  and staffordshire and far away into nottinghamshire  the red marl  must almost certainly have been black slate somewhere somewhen  why  should it not have been such in snowdon  and why should not the  slates in the roof be the remnants of the very beds which are now the  marl in the fields  and thus i end my story of the slates in the roof and these papers  on town geology  i do so well knowing how imperfect they are   though not i believe inaccurate  they are after all merely  suggestive of the great amount that there is to be learnt about the  face of the earth and how it got made even by the townsman who can  escape into the country and exchange the world of man for the world  of god only perhaps on sundaysif alas even thenor only once  a year by a trip in a steamer or an excursion train  little indeed  can he learn of the planet on which he lives  little in that  direction is given to him and of him little shall be required  but  to him for that very reason all that can be given should be given  he should have every facility for learning what he can about this  earth its composition its capabilities lest his intellect crushed  and fettered by that artificial drudgery which we for a time miscall  civilisation should begin to fancy as too many do already that the  world is composed mainly of bricks and deal and governed by acts of  parliament  if i shall have awakened any townsmen here and there to  think seriously of the complexity the antiquity the grandeur the  true poetry of the commonest objects around them even the stones  beneath their feet if i shall have suggested to them the solemn  thought that all these things and they themselves still more are  ordered by laws utterly independent of mans will about them mans  belief in them if i shall at all have helped to open their eyes that  they may see and their ears that they may hear the great book which  is free to all alike to peasant as to peer to men of business as to  men of science even that great book of nature which is as lord  bacon said of old the word of god revealed in factsthen i shall  have a fresh reason for loving that science of geology which has  been my favourite study since i was
