the bonds worth allen  close on to eighty thousand dollars hardwick  phew as much as that  yes the market has been going up since the first of december  how did he happen to get hold of them  i dont know the particulars mr mason was an old friend of the family and i presume he thought he could leave them in no better hands  and where are they now  in his private safe  humph  the conversation recorded above took place one evening on a pennsylvania railroad ferryboat while the craft was making the trip from jersey city to new york  it was carried on between two men both well dressed he called allen was a tall sharpnosed individual probably fifty years of age the other was a short heavyset fellow wearing a black mustache and having a peculiar scowl on his face  they sat in the forward part of the gentlemens cabin which was but partly filled with passengers two seats on one side of them were vacant on the other side sat a shabbilydressed boy of sixteen his hands clasped on his lap and his eyes closed  the safe is often left open during the day resumed allen after a brief pause during which hardwick had offered his companion a cigar and lit one himself  that wont do replied hardwick shortly  why not  because it wont  but we can make it appear  hush the heavyset man who sat next to the vacant seats nudged his companion in the side that boy may hear you he continued in a whisper  the man addressed glanced sharply at the youth  no he wont he returned  why not  hes fast asleep  dont be too sure the heavyset man arose let us go out on the forward deck and talk it over  its too cold and besides its beginning to  wrap yourself up in that overcoat of yours and you will be all right we dont want to run any chances allen  some one may hear us out there just as well as in here growled the elderly man  nevertheless he pulled up his coat collar and followed his companion through the heavy swinging doors  as the two walked outside the eyes of the boy opened and he glanced sharply after the pair  that was a queer conversation they held he muttered to himself i am half of the opinion that they are up to no good if i were a policeman i believe i would follow them and find out who they are  hal carson hesitated for a moment and then arose and walked to the doors  stepping outside he saw the two men standing in the gangway for horses in deep conversation  they are hatching out some scheme thought hal as he watched the pair  but it was bitter cold outside for one without an overcoat and the youth soon returned to his seat in the cabin leaving the two men to themselves  hal was a poorhouse boy having lived at the fairham poorhouse ever since he could remember who his parents were he did not know nor could joel daggett the keeper of the institution give him any definite information on the subject  you were picked up in front of onders carpenter shop on one fourth o july night daggett had said more than once they found out some strange man was responsible but who he was nobuddy knows or leastwise they wont tell and that amounts to the same thing  there had been a peculiar golden locket about hals neck when he was found but this had never led to the establishing of his identity and after the boy was at the poorhouse a year the facts concerning his being found were almost forgotten  but hal had clung fast to that locket as a sort of birthright and it was at this moment safe in his trousers pocket  two days before the opening of this story the trustees of the fairham poorhouse had decided to bind hal out to daniel scrogg one of the most miserly farmers in the county  hal had protested stating he could make more in the town where a lawyer named gibson was willing to take the youth into his office on a salary of three dollars a week and found the trustees were obdurate and the upshot of the matter was that the youth quietly packed his clothing into a bundle and ran away  he left a note behind for joel daggett telling what he had done and stating that as soon as he was in position to do so he would reimburse the trustees for all they had paid out for his keep for the past fifteen years a big undertaking for any boy but hal was plucky and meant what he said  hals destination was new york once in the great metropolis he felt certain he would find something to do to be sure his capital was less than a dollar but he was used to being without any money and consequently this did not bother him  it was about eight oclock in the evening and as the man allen had said it was just beginning to snow the first fall of the season hal looked out of the window as the flakes glittered in the electric light and fell into the waters of the river  presently there came a bump and the ferryboat veered to one side the slip had been reached and pulling shut the rather thin jacket he wore and bringing his cap further down over his forehead hal mingled with the crowd outside and a minute later went ashore  once on west street hal stood still undecided what to do next he did not know a soul in new york did not know one street from another but understood very well that it would be next to useless to try to obtain employment at this late hour  as hal stood meditating the two men mentioned above brushed past him the boy noticed them and then almost mechanically followed the pair  the men passed up cortlandt street until they came to the sixth avenue elevated railroad hal saw them mount the stairs on the opposite side of the street and a minute after knew they had taken an uptown train  i suppose ill never see them again thought the youth  but hal was mistaken the two men were to play a most important part in the youths future life in the great metropolis  hal walked along under the elevated road until he came to barclay street he passed several fruit stands and a queer little booth where coffee and cakes were sold  the sight of the latter made him remember how hungry he was he had not had anything to eat since early morning and although he was accustomed to a very scanty fare at the poorhouse his stomach rebelled at this unusually long fast  he counted up his money and resolved to invest fifteen cents of it in a plate of pork and beans and some buttered cakes  he entered a restaurant near the corner and was soon served  while hal was eating he became interested in the conversation of several young men who stood near the counter smoking  you say nathan wants more help he heard one of the young men say  yes  thought he took on two new hands yesterday  so he did but the holiday trade is very heavy this year  then ill send billy around to see him i suppose he could do the work  anybody could who is strong and willing was the reply nathan wants three young fellows  at these words hals eyes brightened  he arose and touched the speaker on the arm  excuse me sir he began  what is it asked the man rather abruptly  i heard you telling your friend that somebody wanted help i am looking for work  the man looked hal over and gave a short laugh  im afraid you aint strong enough my boy he said  i was brought up to hard work replied hal earnestly  well that makes a difference  if you will tell me where that place is  certainly it is the first warehouse this side  the man got no further there was a commotion on the street and two or three rushed outside  bradys place just below here is on fire shouted some one  bradys place ejaculated the man by george i wonder how that happened  he seemed to forget all about hal and making a rush for the door disappeared down the street  the youth started after him he had eaten and paid for his meal and he did not wish to miss the opportunity of questioning the fellow further  on the street all was commotion wagons were scattering right and left to make way for the steam engines hose carts and hook and ladder trucks which came dashing up to the spot  hal soon found himself surrounded by a crowd the man had disappeared apparently for good and with a sigh the youth walked away there being no signs of a fire so far as he could see  the youth started to cross the street he was directly behind an elderly gentleman and was about to pass the man when there came a warning cry  get out of the way there here comes another engine  hal looked up and saw that the engine pulled by three fiery horses was close at hand he started to return to the curb as he did so the elderly gentleman slipped and went down flat on his back  hell be killed cried half a dozen who saw the accident  hals heart seemed to leap into his throat the horses were not over ten feet away a moment more and the elderly gentleman would be crushed to death  the youth leaped forward and caught the man by the arm then he gave a sudden jerk backward and both he and the gentleman went rolling into the gutter while the engine went thundering by     chapter ii  a brave youths reward   a cheer arose from the bystanders  good for the boy  thats what i call a genuine hero  he deserves a medal  paying no attention to what was said hal assisted the elderly gentleman to his feet  are you hurt sir he asked kindly  ii think not was the labored reply that was a narrow escape young man the last with a gasp  you are right sir how did you happen to go down  the snow made a slippery spot on the ice i believe my wind is almost gone  wait till i brush you off said hal and taking off his cap he commenced to strike off the snow and dirt from the gentlemans clothing  oh never mind that was the comment come along with me i dont like crowds  the gentleman caught the youth by the arm and walked him toward broadway  you did me a great service he went on as the two stood on the corner opposite the postoffice  i didnt do much replied hal modestly  dont you call saving my life much asked the man with a smile  oh i dont mean that sir but any one would have done what i did  im not so sure about that in new york it is every one for himself what is your name  hal carson  you live here i suppose  no sir  where then if i may ask  i just came to new york not over half an hour ago i intend to stay here  the elderly gentleman looked puzzled  i dont quite understand you he said  i came from a small place in pennsylvania sir and i intend to try my luck here  ah are you alone  yes sir  any friends here  no sir  yes you have  i have  yesmyself the elderly gentleman laughed at his little joke no one shall say he saved my life and i didnt appreciate it so your name is hal carson parents living  i dont know sir hal blushed in spite of himself i was brought up at the poorhouse  humph well you are a manly looking chap and a brave one have you any idea where you are going to obtain employment  no sir i intend to hunt around until i strike something  youll find that rather uphill work i fancy  i didnt expect any snap mr  my name is horace sumner i am a broker and have an office on wall street near broad i am just returning from a visit to my sister who lives in morristown have you any sort of an education  i can read and write and figure pretty well and ive read all the books i could get hold of  the reason i ask is because i think i may be able to help you to obtain employment i wont offer you money as a rewardi dont believe in such things  i would not accept your money but i would like work  horace sumner meditated for a moment  supposing you stop at my office tomorrow morning he said  i will sir what time  ten oclock  and what number please  here is my card horace sumner handed it to him do you know where you are going to stop over night  i shall hunt up some cheap hotel  mr sumner was about to say something to the effect that hal could accompany him to his house and sleep in one of the rooms over the barn but he changed his mind  let the boy hoe his own row it will do him good he thought to himself  horace sumner was a selfmade man and he knew that self reliance is one of the best traits a boy can cultivate  i am going over to the third avenue elevated now he said remember i expect to see you at ten sharp  i will be on hand sir returned hal  then goodnight  goodnight mr sumner and much obliged  hal watched the gentleman cross city hall park and then started up broadway  the brilliant holiday display in the show windows charmed him and he spent fully two hours in looking at all that was to be seen  who knows but what i may go to work tomorrow and then i wont get much chance to look around he reasoned to himself  he was accustomed to work at the poorhouse from six in the morning until eight or nine at night and he did not know but what he would have to do more in such a bustling city as new york  by ten oclock hal found himself tired out the snow was now six inches deep and was still coming down  he turned from broadway through grand street and presently found himself well over on the east side       good beds for 25 cents per night  this was the announcement on a banner strung over the sidewalk and after reading it hal glanced at the building  it was rather a dingy affair but to the youth direct from the fairham poorhouse it appeared quite comfortable he entered the office and approached the clerk at the desk  i would like a room for tonight he said  a room or a bed asked the clerk  i mean a twentyfive cent place  oh all right pay in advance  hal handed out a quarter then he was conducted to a long narrow apartment on the third floor there were eight beds in the room six of which were already occupied  to a person used to good accommodations this apartment would have almost disgusted him but quarters at the poorhouse had been but little better and hal did not complain he managed to get a bed in one corner and as the window was slightly open he slept very well  he was up and dressed at six oclock and out on the street the snow was now all of a foot deep and hal was much interested in the snowplows on the car tracks  as he passed down the street a snowball whizzed past the youths ear another followed striking him in the head he turned and saw a boy slightly taller than himself standing close at hand and laughing heartily  instead of getting angry hal laughed in return then he picked up some snow made it into a hard ball and let fly  the snowball took the other boy in the chest and in his effort to dodge he went over head first into a drift near the gutter hal burst out laughing and then ran back and helped the stranger up  say wot did yer do dat fer demanded the other boy as soon as he was once more on his feet  tit for tat you know returned hal i guess youre not hurt are you  the stranger stared at hal he had never met with such a kindly answer before  hurt o course i aint hurt he returned slowly  you threw at me first didnt you  wot if i did  nothing only thats why i threw back  the stranger stared at hal for a moment  who are you he asked abruptly  my name is hal carson whats yours  jack mccabe  hal held out his hand  im glad to know you i just came to new york and i only know one person here  git out is dat so jack mccabe shook hands rather gingerly den yer aint one o der boys is yer  what boys  der fellers around town  hardly  got work here  i expect to get work from a man in wall street  goin ter be a broker hey grinned jack  here get to work there you lazy dog shouted a man from the inside of a nearby store and jack dropped his conversation and began to clean off the sidewalk with vigor  hal walked on he did not know under what exciting circumstances he was to meet jack mccabe again  promptly at ten oclock hal presented himself at the number given him on wall street the sign over the door read sumner allen  co brokers  he opened the door and entered there was a small place in the front partitioned from the rear office by a counter and a brass grating  a man sat writing at a desk in the rear he glanced at hal and seeing it was only a boy went on with his work  five minutes passed then the man swung around leisurely got down from his stool and came forward  as soon as hal caught sight of the mans face he was astonished  it was hardwick the fellow whose conversation he had overheard on the ferry boat the evening before     chapter iii  a serious charge   what do you want asked hardwick abruptly  is mr sumner in returned hal  no  then ill wait till he comes  hardwick stared at hal  wont i do he asked sharply  im afraid not sir  what do you want to see him about  he asked me to call replied the youth he was not particularly pleased with hardwicks manner  i am the bookkeeper here and i generally transact business during mr sumners absence  mr sumner asked me to meet him here at ten oclock  oh you know him then  not very well  i thought not hardwick glanced at hals shabby clothes well you had better wait outside until he comes we dont allow loungers about the office  i will said hal and he turned to leave  it was bitter cold outside but he would have preferred being on the sidewalk than being in the way especially when such a man as felix hardwick was around  but as he turned to leave a coach drove up to the door and mr sumner alighted his face lit up with a smile when he caught sight of hal  well my young friend i see you are on time he said catching hal by the shoulder and turning him back into the office  yes sir  thats right mr sumner turned to hardwick where is dick he asked  i dont know sir returned the bookkeeper  hasnt he been here this morning  i think not  the sidewalk ought to be cleaned that boy evidently doesnt want work  i will clean the walk if you wish me to put in hal  i have an office boy who is expected to do such things replied mr sumner that is when the janitor of the building doesnt get at it in time but he is getting more negligent every day yes you might as well do the job and then come into the back office and have a talk with me  yes sir  mr hardwick just show carson where the shovel and broom are  the bookkeeper scowled  this way he said and led the boy to a small closet under a stairs  just as hal was about to leave the office with the broom and the shovel a tall well dressed boy entered  he was whistling at a lively rate but stopped short on seeing mr sumner  well ferris this is a pretty time to come around said the broker sharply  i couldnt help it returned the boy who was considerably older than hal and had coarse features and fiery red hair  why not  my aunt forgot to call me  that is a poor excuse  dick ferris began to drum on the railing with his flat hands  didnt i tell you to be here every morning at nine oclock went on the broker i am sure that is not very early for any one  taint my fault when it snows like this returned the boy my aunt ought to call me  did you arrange that file of papers yesterday afternoon after i left continued mr sumner  i was going to do that this morning  i told you to do it yesterday you had plenty of time  i aint got nothing to do this morning  there are a great number of things to do ferris but evidently you are not the boy who cares to do them i warned you only a week ago that you must mend your ways i think hereafter we will dispense with your service mr hardwick please pay him his wages in full for the week we will get some one else to fill his position  mr sumner turned to the rear office  i dont care muttered ferris hand over the stuff he said to hardwick  having received his money he calmly lit a cigarette puffed away upon it for a minute and then went out slamming the door as hard as possible after him  hal was already at work clearing away the snow at a lively rate ferris approached him  say are you the fellow that did me out of my job he asked savagely  i havent done any one out of a job returned hal do you work here  i did but i dont any more  why not  because old sumner expects the earth from me and he cant get it see ferris winked one eye im too smart to allow myself to be stepped onto i am you had better quit working he wont pay you much for your trouble  ill risk it replied hal  if i find you played me foul ill break you all up went on ferris and with this threat he hurried off  hal looked after the boy for an instant and then continued his work the sidewalk was soon cleaned and he returned to the office  hardwick let him in behind the railing giving him a sharp look as he passed  ive seen him somewhere before he muttered to himself as he continued at his books but where i cant remember  what done already exclaimed mr sumner to hal  yes sir  it didnt take long  it wasnt much of a job sir  ferris would have taken all of the morning  was that the boy who just left  yes  he said he would whip me if i played him foul  humph he is a bad boy you must be careful and not get into any trouble  i will sir but i am not afraid of him  no you look as if you could take care of yourself mr sumner rubbed his chin so you say you have no prospects ahead  no sir but i am not afraid  let me see your handwriting  the broker shoved a pad toward hal and handed him a pen filled with ink  hal put down a sentence or two and added his own name  that will do very well you say you can figure fairly  i have been through the common school arithmetic  what would my commission be on six thousand dollars worth of bonds sold at one hundred and fifteen commission onequarter of one per cent  hal figured for a moment  seventeen dollars and twentyfive cents he said  mr sumner gave him several other sums the youth answered all of them quickly and correctly  that will do firstclass said the broker now to come to business would you mind telling me why you left fairham  not at all mr sumner replied hal  and sitting down he told how the trustees had intended to use him and of his determination to do for himself  and i will not go back no matter what happens he concluded decidedly  well i cannot say as i blame you was the slow reply of course you owe them something but perhaps you can pay them back quicker in the way you have undertaken have you any idea in regard to salary  i intended to take what i could get and then look around for something better  how would you like to work for me  firstrate sir  i need an office boy to take ferris place and also somebody to help copy contracts and make out bills and statements if you could combine the two i would give you seven dollars a week at the start and increase the amount as you become more valuable  hals heart beat fast seven dollars a week it was more than twice what he could have earned at lawyer gibsons office in fairham  oh thank you he cried i did not expect so much  i expect you to earn the money replied the broker he made this remark but nevertheless he had not forgotten that hal had saved his life have you any money with you  fifty cents sir  then let me advance you a months salary half of it i would advise you to invest in an overcoat and a stout pair of shoes the remainder you will probably have to pay out for your board mr hardwick  the bookkeeper came forward  just give carson twentyeight dollars for four weeks salary in advance he will take ferris place and also help you on the copying  yes sir  hardwick gave hal a contemptuous look and then going to a large safe in the forward part of the main office brought out the cash and handed it over  you may go to work at once said mr sumner i would advise you to hunt up a boardinghouse after business hours three oclock  yes sir  and so hal was installed at sumner allen  cos place of business he cleaned up the place and then started in on the copying hardwick brought him  mr sumner was well pleased with the boys work for the day and so expressed himself  after business hours hal bought the overcoat and the pair of shoes then he started out for a boardinghouse and at last found one on tenth street kept by mrs amanda ricket where he obtained a room on the top floor with breakfast and supper for five dollars a week  on the second day at the office hal was astonished to learn that the mr allen of the firm was the man he had seen in company with mr hardwick on the pennsylvania ferryboat mr allen did not recognize him and the youth thought it just as well not to mention the meeting during the afternoon mr sumner and mr allen went out together they were hardly gone when hardwick put on his hat and coat and followed leaving the youth in sole charge  five minutes later a stranger entered and asked for mr allen finding the broker out he said he would wait and sat down inside the railing near the stove  he had hardly seated himself when a snowball crashed against the plateglass window fearful that the glass might be broken hal hurried out two boys had been snowballing each other and both ran away as fast as they could  hardly had hal returned to the office than hardwick came in he had been paying a visit to a nearby wineroom and his face was slightly flushed he nodded to the man who was waiting  anything i can do for you he asked  i want to see mr allen  gone away for the day sir  the stranger at once arose and left hardwick saw him to the door and then sat down near a desk in the rear  hal bent over the writing he was doing he proceeded with great care as it was new work to him and he did not wish to make any errors  just before three oclock mr sumner returned he walked to the rear office gave a turn to the knob of the door of his private safe and then addressed hardwick  anything new  no sir  then we might as well close up  five minutes later the main safe was locked up the rolledtop desks closed and work was over for the day  hal spent the evening at his room in the boardinghouse writing to lawyer gibson his only friend in fairham the letter finished he walked to the corner and posted it and then returned and went to bed  the next morning he was the first at the office he was engaged in cleaning up when hardwick entered the bookkeeper had been out the greater part of the night and his face plainly showed the effects of his dissipation  come get at the books he growled the place is clean enough  i will just as soon as i have dusted the rear office replied hal  do as i told you stormed hardwick  at that moment mr sumner entered and with a hasty goodmorning passed to the back hal heard him at his safe and then came a sharp cry  the safe has been robbed  whats that asked hardwick walking to the rear while hal followed  the safe has been robbed gasped mr sumner there are seventynine thousand dollars worth of bonds missing  you are sure asked the bookkeeper while hals heart seemed to fairly stop beating  yes they are gone  when did you leave them  yesterday before i went out with mr allen mr sumner gave a groan this will ruin me who could have robbed the safe  was it broken open  no look for yourself  hardwick glanced toward the iron box then he turned and faced hal  you were here alone yesterday afternoon he said sternly  did you leave him here alone cried mr sumner  i am sorry to say i did but it was only for a few minutes replied the bookkeeper i called around to mack  heaths for that rock island circular  hal grew red in the face  mr sumner he began i hope you do not think  i think that boy robbed the safe interrupted hardwick pointing to hal i thought it was a mistake to take such a stranger into the place  at these words hals eyes flashed fire  that is a falsehood he cried indignantly i never went near the safe excepting to dust the outside  mr sumner clasped and unclasped his hands nervously the ring in the youths voice made him hesitate as to how to proceed  you robbed the safe went on hardwick you know you are guilty  i know no such thing returned hal in a peculiar strained tone of voice but there is one thing i do know  and what is that asked mr sumner eagerly  i know mr hardwick contemplated robbing that safe and i feel certain in my mind that he is the one who did it  hal had hardly spoken before the bookkeeper sprang upon him forcing him over backward against the safe door  im the thief am i he cried in hals ear take that back or ill make you     chapter iv  hal stands up for himself   hal now found himself in a tight situation felix hardwick had him by the throat and was slowly but surely choking him  dont dont cried mr sumner in great alarm  the miserable tramp cried hardwick ill teach him to call a gentleman a thief  he continued his choking process paying no attention to his employers efforts to haul him away  but by this time hal began to realize that hardwick was in earnest he began to kick and presently landed a blow in the bookkeepers stomach that completely winded the man  hardwick relaxed his hold and hal sprang away  stop stop ordered mr sumner i will not have such disgraceful scenes in this office  but he intimated i was a thief said hardwick trying to catch his wind  and he said the same of me retorted hal  so you are  i never stole a thing in my life mr sumner hal turned to the broker and i am not a tramp  then supposing we make it a poorhouse beggar returned hardwick with a short laugh  hal turned red the shot was a cruel one  hush hardwick cried mr sumner there is no necessity for such language  the broker turned to hal  you just made a strange statement carson he said how do you know mr hardwick contemplated robbing the safe  because i do  that is no answer  i overheard him and mr allen talking about the bonds being in the safe  when  the evening i came to new york  what was said  i cant repeat the words but they said the bonds were worth nearly eighty thousand dollars and that the safe was often left open during the day  its an infamous story put in hardwick his face growing red mr sumner dont you believe the beggar  i am telling the truth said hal as calmly as he could  hush hardwick  but sir began the bookkeeper  one story at a time i will hear what you have to say later  do you mean to say you would take that boys word against mine demanded hardwick haughtily  i intend to listen to his story without further interruption from you responded the broker sternly so please keep silent until your turn comes  hardwick pulled at the ends of his mustache but he did not dare to reply after this  now go on carson said mr sumner to hal  i havent much to tell sir replied the youth  and he related all he could remember of the fragment of a conversation which he had overheard  the broker listened attentively but his face fell when hal had finished  and is that all  yes sir  mr sumner shook his head and then turned to hardwick  is his story true he asked  it is true we spoke of the bonds replied the bookkeeper but nothing was said about stealing them why mr sumnerwhy should your own partner and trusted bookkeeper conspire to rob you it is preposterous i have an idea  what is this  that he heard us speaking of your careless habit and endeavored to form some scheme to get into the office and get hold of the bonds  hardly it was i told him to come here he did not come of himself  then he formed his plan after he got here  i know nothing of railroad bonds put in hal i wouldnt know what to do with them if i had them  at that moment mr allen arrived he saw that something unusual had taken place  whats up he asked  the tin box containing the mason railroad bonds is missing replied mr sumner  missing ejaculated mr allen  exactly  and all the bonds  yes  phew mr allen gave a low whistle how did it happen  mr sumner related the particulars  and this boy means to say we concocted a scheme to steal them added hardwick pointing to hal  we steal them ejaculated mr allen  yes sir  mr allen turned and caught hal by the arm  boy are you crazy he demanded  thats what i would like to know said hardwick  no i am not crazy replied the youth stoutly  he overheard part of our conversation on the ferryboat the other night went on the bookkeeper hastily and from that he judged we must be plotting to rob mr sumner  well thats rich mr allen broke into a laugh excuse me sumner but i cant help it of course you dont think any such thing  no i cant say that i do replied the elderly broker slowly buthe turned to the safethe tin box is gone and i would like to know what has become of it  better call in the police suggested hardwick and in the meantime keep an eye on this boy  and also on that man added hal pointing to the bookkeeper  mr sumner was in deep perplexity he ran his hand through his hair  let us talk this matter over first he said you say hardwick you left carson alone in the office yesterday afternoon  yes sir  how long  not more than ten minutes  when was this  a few minutes after you and mr allen went out  when you came back what was carson doing  he was at the desk pretending to write  was there anybody else here  by jove yes exclaimed hardwick suddenly  ah who  i dont know sir  a man  yes rather a commonlooking fellow about thirtyfive years of age  what did he want  he asked for mr allen and when i said he wouldnt be back during the rest of the day he went off  mr sumner turned to hal the youth stood staring at the wall  what have you to say about this stranger  he came in directly after mr hardwick went out returned the youth  what was his business  he wished to see mr allen  did he go back to the safe  ii dont think so  you are not sure  not positive sir i was busy writing and did not notice him closely  did the man give any name  no sir  i suppose you didnt know him  hal shook his head he was beginning to believe he had made a big mistake by not watching the stranger during the time he was in the office back of the railing  i believe i saw the man wink at this boy as he went out put in hardwick i am pretty certain the two knew each other  that is not true burst out hal  for some reason this insinuation made him think more than ever that the bookkeeper was guilty  which way did the man go went on the elderly broker  toward broadway replied hal  did he have anything under his arm  he had a small bundle but he had that when he came in  about how large  hal illustrated with his hands  probably that was an empty box or something of that sort ventured mr allen he placed the tin box into it  quite likely returned mr sumner  and the only question in my mind went on his partner is whether or not this boy here was in with the fellow if you will take my advice sumner you will have him arrested without delay     chapter v  hal determines to act   as mr allen spoke he caught hal by the shoulder  you had better own up carson he said harshly  let go of me retorted hal trying to break away  not much do you think i am going to give you the chance to slide out of the door  i have nothing to own up to and i dont intend to run away panted the youth  he broke away and placed himself beside mr sumner who looked at him earnestly  i believe the boy speaks the truth he said firmly  you do cried hardwick and allen in concert  i mean in so far as he says he is innocent added the elderly broker hastily of course i believe he is mistaken in supposing that either of you had anything to do with this robbery  oh returned mr allen  thats different said hardwick  both of them looked relieved  i wish he had watched this stranger  i wish that myself mr sumner cried hal if he stole the tin box then i am mostly responsible although i supposed the man was some business man around here and was to be trusted  i dont understand one thing said the elderly broker i am almost sure i locked the safe when i went away yesterday afternoon  so you did said mr allen i saw you do it  then how could the stranger have opened it  didnt carson know the combination asked hardwick who seemed determined to convict hal  i think not  indeed i did not cried the youth i never worked a safe combination in my life  i saw him watching you open the door yesterday morning went on the bookkeeper do you dare deny it he continued turning to hal  i certainly do deny it retorted hal i might have been looking that way but i did not watch him and i do not know how it was done  you did not notice if the door was open after i was gone did you said mr sumner turning to the bookkeeper  it was closed replied hardwick promptly  you are certain  yes sir when i left carson here alone i saw to it that both safes and the main desks were closed  why did you do that put in mr allen knowing well what the answer would be  i saw no necessity for trusting carson who was totally unknown to us  that was right hardwick mr allen turned to his partner i believe sumner you took in carson without recommendations  i admit i did allen but his face  faces are very deceitful very it was poor business policy sumner it would never have happened while i was around  well i am the loser not you replied mr sumner rather sharply he did not like the way mr allen criticised his action  yes but still it might have been  but it was not interrupted mr sumner dryly and as we are to separate on the first of the year allen the least said on that score the better  well just as you say returned mr allen stiffly i hope you get your bonds back thats all  so do i added hardwick i dont want the least shadow hanging over my name  mr sumner began to walk up and down the office uneasily he was in a terrible state of mind the loss of the bonds might mean utter ruin  he hesitated and looked at hal the youth noticed it and springing forward caught him by the arm  mr sumner tell me you do not believe me guilty he cried with a curious lump rising in his throat  hal i believe you innocent returned the elderly broker  in after years the man looked back at those words what had led him to utter them let the reader wait and perhaps he will be able to reason the matter out  mr allen sneered at the words and hardwicks lip curled  the youth noticed neither of them the tears stood in his eyes as he replied  thank you for saying that mr sumner he returned in a low voice i may be nothing but a poorhouse boy but i am honest and will help you get back your bonds and prove my innocence to the world  again mr allens sneer was heard and hardwicks lip curled even more than before neither mr sumner nor hal paid any attention to either of them the broker stepped to the telephone  who are you going to summon asked mr allen  the chief of the police department  thats right  the proper connection was obtained and a long conversation ensued over the wires at length mr sumner closed the instrument  a couple of detectives will be here in ten minutes he said the chief says they are now with him and have nothing on hand to do  hal listened to this statement with interest he had often heard of detectives but had never seen such a personage  mr sumner continued to walk up and down hal watched him the youths heart beating rapidly  the clock hands moved slowly but at last twelve minutes had passed  then two young men entered they were very ordinary looking individuals and hal was somewhat disappointed in their appearance  we were sent here by the chief explained one as he entered my name is harry parker this is ralph hamington  i am glad to see you replied mr sumner  you have been robbed questioned harry parker coming at once to the point  yes a tin box containing seventynine thousand dollars worth of railroad bonds has been stolen from that safe  both detectives elevated their eyebrows at this statement  was the safe broken open continued parker  no  door left open  i think not  when did you see the box last  yesterday afternoon  what time  a little before two  you locked it up at that time  i am under that impression  i see when did you discover your loss  not over half an hour ago  did any one beside yourself have the combination of the safe  not to my knowledge  no one in the office  i know nothing of it replied allen  who are you  caleb allen mr sumners partner  oh  neither do i added hardwick i am the bookkeeper he explained  who is this boy  he belongs in the office replied mr sumner  i know nothing about the safe said hal speaking up for himself he began to believe detectives were very much like other men  please give me a list of the people who might have got at the safe during your absence continued parker while his companion prepared to write down the names  these gentlemen began the elderly broker  yes  the janitor of the building  what is his name  daniel mccabe  hal started and wondered if the janitor could be any relation to jack mccabe his acquaintance of the previous day  go on continued the detective  a strange man was in yesterday  ah tell us of him  mr sumner told what he knew parker turned to hal  would you know this fellow again if you saw him he asked  i believe i would  please describe him as closely as you can  the youth started and gave a pretty accurate description of his visitor both detectives listened attentively  perhaps it was larkett suggested hamington in an undertone  did the fellow have a cast in his eye asked parker  how would the boy know that asked hardwick nervously he says he hardly glanced at the man  answer me said parker paying no attention to the interruption  hal was doing his best to think had that fellow really had something the matter with his left eye  ii cant really say he returned slowly was it the left eye  yes  he might have had it runs in my mind so but i am not positive  parker exchanged glances with his companion  more than likely he was the guilty party he said to mr sumner if he is the man we imagine he is an old offender and it will not be a very difficult matter to run him down  if you recover the bonds i will give you five thousand dollars as a reward said the elderly broker  we will do what we can mr sumner  the quicker you get to work the better it will suit me  we shall start on our hunt at once eh hamington  certainly but let us take a look around the office first and mr sumner  well  it might be just as well to keep this matter a secret for a few days of course information will be sent out from headquarters but the general public need not know of it  that will suit me returned the elderly broker with a groan if the word gets out it will all but ruin me i only held the bonds in trust and will be expected to make the loss good in case they are not recovered  you will give us a list of the paper  certainly mr sumner took out a memorandum book here you are anything else  we will take a look around the premises  and the two detectives started on a tour of investigation in which hal took a lively interest  the door to the safe was carefully examined not a mark was found upon it  either left open or opened by some one who had the combination said parker  he got down on his knees and examined the carpet  anything asked hamington briefly  parker shook his head  in the rear of the office was a window opening upon a narrow court the two detectives glanced at the fastening of the window  suddenly parker gave a cry  this fastening was forced not long ago  how do you know asked mr sumner while hal pricked up his ears  here are the marks made by a knife blade they are quite fresh  here are the marks of footprints upon the windowsill added hamington see they lead toward that door yonder where does that door lead to  an alleyway replied mr allen  opening on the next street  yes  then these marks add a new feature to the case said parker has anybody been through the window to your knowledge  every one shook his head  queer said mr sumner if the thief came through the window how did he know the combination of the safe  i have it said hamington you often opened the safe during the daytime did you not  yes  then the wouldbe thief watched you from the window by looking from the left side he could easily see you work the combination without being seen himself he watched you until he was sure he had the combination down fine and last night he opened the window stepped inside opened the safe and took out the tin box closed the door again and escaped as he had come     chapter vi  a blow in the dark   was hamingtons explanation the correct one  by jove i believe thats the straight of it exclaimed hardwick  so do i said mr allen it is the only way to account for the marks on the windowframe and the sash  mr sumner said nothing indeed to tell the truth his loss had set his mind in a whirl  parker turned to hal  did you open the office this morning he asked  yes sir  you opened the window when you cleaned up  yes  was it locked  hal tried to think  i believe it was  you are not sure  no sir  he ought to be broke in mr allen i would know if i was in his place  see if you cannot think hal said mr sumner  if anything i think the window was locked said the youth candidly  you do said parker  yes for i believe i had some trouble to unfasten it  the two detectives looked at each other  if that is so it alters the case said hamington but i believe the boy is mistaken  so do i added hardwick promptly  parker opened the window again and leaping out made his way to the alley hamington went after him then several customers came in and mr allen and hardwick went forward to wait upon them  it was a quarter of an hour before the detectives came back and then they had very little to say excepting that they would report the particulars at headquarters and endeavor to run down the criminal  mr sumner was broken down by his loss he sat in his private office nearly all of the remainder of the day his head resting in his hands mr allen went off on business and hardwick stuck to his books as if his life depended on it  hal resumed his duties with a heavy weight on his heart for some reason he had expected to be discharged but nothing was said about his leaving  hardwick scowled at the youth every time their eyes met and kept piling the work upon hal the bookkeeper was nervous and the youth did not fail to notice this and it set him to thinking  if only he had listened more attentively to what had been said on the ferryboat that night hal was sure if he had done this he would have known if hardwick and allen were guilty or not  then hal began to speculate on the footmarks on the windowsill if the thief had entered the office that way why were not some of the same marks visible on the carpet in front of the safe  when hardwick went out to lunch hal watched him from the office window at the corner he saw the bookkeeper joined by dick ferris and the two seemed to be in earnest conversation as they walked along  when hardwick came back hal was given a half hour the boy put on his hat and coat and went out he did not feel like eating and he walked up to the corner and around to the back street intending to pay a visit to the alley through which the robber was supposed to have escaped  just as he was about to turn into the narrow place now piled high with snow somebody caught him by the shoulder turning he found himself confronted by dick ferris  hullo there said the tall boy  how are you returned hal coldly  i hear youve got my place went on ferris  what if i have asked hal abruptly  i thought you were hanging around trying to do me out of it  i didnt try to do you out of it mr sumner asked me to call at his office and i went then he offered me the place and i took it  did he know you  may i ask what business that is of yours  shut up you little street tramp you retorted ferris do you know what ive a good mind to do  i must admit i do not  give you a mighty good thrashing  two can play at that game replied hal with a nervous little laugh  what do you mean to say you can stand up against me demanded ferris maybe you dont know i am an athlete  and perhaps you are not aware that i am perfectly able to take care of myself returned hal  take that cried ferris  he hauled off and aimed a wicked blow at the youths nose had it struck hal it would have injured him considerably  but the youth dodged and the next instant dick ferris received a crack fairly between the eyes that made him see stars and caused him to stagger up against the side of a building  whatwhat he gasped  that for attacking me replied hal dont you try any such game again  ill fix you roared ferris he was boiling with rage you miserable street cur  he sprang at hal and caught him by both arms intending to trip the youth up  but hal stood his ground and by a sudden twist freed himself  let me alone ferris he commanded  oh of course i will replied the tall boy sarcastically  if you dont youll regret it  will i take that and that  ferris struck out twice hal parried the first blow but the second just grazed his lip causing that member to bleed slightly  told you id fix you roared ferris  he had hardly spoken the words before hal pulled himself together and went at him the youths arms shot out right and left and before he was aware of what was taking place ferris received a stinging blow on the forehead and then came one on the chin that sent him rolling over in the snow  dats right give it ter him shouted a newsboy who stood by grinning from ear to ear do him up in one round  ferris got upon his feet slowly his head felt dizzy from the shock he had received  want any more demanded hal facing him with clenched fists  cheese it here comes der cops put in the newsboy  hal looked up and saw a policeman bearing toward the spot ferris also gave a glance and he muttered something under his breath  what did you say demanded hal  ill settle with you another time replied ferris  and picking up his hat which had landed in a nearby drift he placed it on his head and sneaked down the street at a rapid gait  in a minute the policeman arrived at the spot  what is the trouble here he demanded  a fellow attacked me replied hal  i see your lips cut why did he do it  i got a job he used to have and hes angry over it  oh the policeman tossed his head did you hit back  i defended myself replied hal briefly  he was half afraid he might be called on to make some sort of a charge a thing he did not wish to do now the encounter was over  he did der feller fer keeps put in the newsboy  go on with you cried the policeman and the newsboy ran off while hal started on his way back to the office  whats the matter with your lip inquired hardwick as the youth entered  i cut it replied hal  the bookkeeper turned and smiled to himself  i guess ferris kept his word he muttered he said he was going to fix the boy i wish he had killed the tramp  that afternoon dragged heavily but at last it was time to close up mr sumner hardly spoke to either when they bade him goodevening  hardwick walked up wall street and then turned into nassau instead of continuing to broadway  suddenly an idea entered hals head to follow hardwick  despite all the evidence pointing in other directions the youth thought hardwick either guilty of the robbery or else that the bookkeeper knew much concerning it  hardwick continued up nassau street until he reached park row  hal kept out of sight behind the man and presently hardwick continued up park row until he came to one of the side streets just beyond the entrance to the brooklyn bridge  he turned into this street piled high on either side with dirty snow and then entered one of the worst thoroughfares in new york city  by this time it was quite dark and hal had to keep close for fear of losing sight of his man he was now thoroughly interested for he knew hardwick boarded somewhere uptown and it must be some special business that would bring the bookkeeper to this part of the city on such a disagreeable evening  at length hardwick paused and glanced behind him as soon as he saw the movement the boy stepped behind a billboard out of sight  presently hardwick continued on his way walking faster than ever the youth increased his speed  hi look sharp there  hal was just about to cross a street when he almost ran into a heavy truck he stepped back and allowed the truck to pass when he reached the opposite curb hardwick had disappeared  he must have gone on straight ahead thought the youth i will soon catch up to him again  but though he continued onward for more than a block he saw nothing of the bookkeeper  he looked up and down the side streets and tried to peep into the curtained windows of several saloons that were close at hand  he must have gone in somewhere thats certain said hal to himself i wonder if he discovered that i was following him  this last thought disturbed the youth not a little his experience with hardwick in the office had convinced him that the bookkeeper was an evil man when aroused  slowly he retraced his steps not certain if he could find his way back to park row a spot he had got to know fairly well since his coming to the metropolis  he was just passing a place where a new building was in the course of construction when a peculiar noise to one side of him attracted his attention by instinct he jumped toward the gutter the next instant a mass of bricks came tumbling down one struck him on the head and this knocked him insensible     chapter vii  hal determines to investigate   when hal came to his senses he found himself in the arms of a boy slightly taller than himself who was doing all in his power to restore consciousness by the application of snow to hals forehead  whatwhat he began  good yer come around at last have yer cried the boy blessed if i didnt think yer was a goner  hal put his hand up to his head  where am i he asked faintly  yer all right dont worry replied the tall boy dont yer remember me  hal pulled himself together and looked at the speaker  jack mccabe he cried  yer struck it fust clip say wot was der matter wid yer yer couldnt have been froze coz it wasnt cold enough  i was struck on the head  gee crickety who struck yer  iinobody i think it was some bricks from that building  oh dats it how do yer feel now  awfully lightheaded responded hal telling the exact truth  kin yer walk about a block i only live jest around dat corner  hal started at these words  you

janitors all lives in der buildins da takes care of explained jack  the reason i ask is because there is a daniel mccabe janitor of the building i work in  i tink dats me uncle better now  hal took a deep breath and straightened up  yes a good deal better  yer got a lump on yer forehead as big as an egg  it feels twice that size to me laughed hal jack you have done me a good turn i wont forget in a hurry  the street boy blushed  ah go on dat wasnt nuthin he replied i kinder like you tell der truth  and i like you jack replied hal giving his hand a tight squeeze  did yer git dat job  yes  how much  what do you mean  wot do da pay yer  seven dollars a week  jack mccabes eyes opened like saucers  yer foolin  its true jack  gee crickety but yer struck a snap say if deres enny more o dem jobs

der buildin an i was jest gittin ready ter call der cop an have yer tuk to der hospital when yer give a gulp an opened yer eyes  while you were sitting here did you notice anybody leave the building

come from  der back o der building  you didnt notice which way he went  up toward der east river  that way  yes  thank you dont let me keep you any longer maybe ill be up to see you soon  glad ter have yer specially if ye git dat seven dollar job fer me  and with a broad laugh jack mccabe hurried on  hal turned into the building and walked toward the rear a ladder stood lashed to the back wall the youth hesitated and then mounted to the floor above  a nearby electric light cast its rays full into the open front over the beams were placed a number of loose boards and on these the snow which had been swept in by the wind lay to the depth of several inches  taking care that he should not slip through an opening hal examined the surface of the snow with great care  it was not long before he came to a number of footprints leading to a pile of bricks close to the front  the footprints was fresh and looked as if they had been made by a mans boot  the last of them were at a spot that commanded a good view of the sidewalk below hal looked down and then shuddered  was it possible that hardwick had pushed those bricks down upon him  it looked so murmured hal to himself i must be more cautious in the future he must have seen me when i started to hide behind the billboard  hal descended the ladder and was soon upon the street once more  he thought over the situation and then started for his boardinghouse satisfied that it would do no good to search farther for the bookkeeper that night  as has been mentioned the boardinghouse was up in tenth street hal soon walked the distance and getting out his nightkey he let himself in  he was about to ascend to his room and wash up a bit before going to supper when the sounds of voices broke upon his ear coming from the parlor  and he has your place dick he heard mrs ricket the boarding mistress say  yes he has aunt amanda returned the voice of dick ferris  its too bad  how did you come to allow the tramp in the house  he paid in advance dick and he appeared to be a very nice young fellow  nice  yes what is wrong about him  he was brought up in a poorhouse  who said so  never mind i know it for a fact  well even that wouldnt make him a bad boy  but you dont want any tramps around here do you  he isnt a tramp so long as he works and pays his board  you say he paid in advance  yes for one week he said he would pay two if i wished it  then you can make sure there is something wrong about him better look out for your silverware  mrs ricket laughed  a robber would never make much out of what little i possess dick she replied  still you wouldnt want to lose it  ill trust carson  well have your own way hes a tramp and i dont want anything to do with him  what makes you so down on him  didnt i tell you he took my place away from me  how could he do that i am sure mr sumner would have kept you at work if you had done right  didnt i do right blustered dick ferris  hardly  what was wrong  you wouldnt get up the day before yesterday although i called you twice  well i was to a sparring match the night before and i was tired out  you should have stayed at home dick  huh you dont want a fellow to have any fun growled the boy  oh yes i do but not the kind that is going to lose you your place what do you intend to do now  oh ill find something else to do replied ferris in a careless fashion  i cannot support you in idleness even if you are my dead sisters son went on mrs ricket you havent paid me any board now in eight weeks  only six aunt amanda  no it is eight i have it on my account book i dont see why you let it run it is so little only three dollars a week that carson pays me five and he has not so good a room  there goes that carson again stormed dick ferris i dont want to hear a word more hes a tramp and a thief and youll be sorry you took him in before a great while  with this speech on his lips dick ferris walked across the parlor threw open the doorand confronted hal     chapter viii  felix hardwick is astonished   dick ferris started back on catching sight of hal who stood on the bottom step of the stairs  you  yes dick ferris returned hal coolly and let me say that i overheard your conversation with mrs ricket your aunt  ferris changed color  been playing the spy eh he sneered  no i just came in and overheard you speaking about me and stopped to learn what you would have to say  its the same thing  i hope you will excuse me mr carson broke in mrs ricket who was blushing furiously ii dont approve of what dick said  i know you do not mrs ricket if i thought you did i would pack up and leave at once  it would be a good job done put in ferris  stop dick i will not have you insult one of my boarders cried the woman sharply  all right have your own way returned ferris insolently if you want to take in any tramp that comes along why go ahead and do it  he had on his hat and coat and now he started for the door  hal caught him by the arm  stop he cried i am not a tramp and i wont be called one by you or anybody else  really  yes really  what are you going to do about it  if you insist in indulging in such language in the future i will give you even a worse whipping than i gave you this noon  what did you fight cried mrs ricket  he attacked me and i defended myself replied hal he is down on me for taking the situation from which he was discharged  i know that  if i had known he was boarding here i would not have applied to you  you bet he wouldnt put in ferris  not that i am afraid of your nephew went on hal but i do not wish to cause any trouble  you have caused no trouble mr carson returned mrs ricket  thats what i call cool exclaimed her nephew  it is dick is the cause of it all you know you are and you ought to be ashamed of yourself she added turning to the boy  thats right go right against me you always do howled dick ferris there aint no use for me to stay here any longer  and he marched out of the front door and down the street to his favorite hangingout place the corner poolroom  mrs ricket was profuse in her apologies to hal after ferris had gone  hes a good enough boy she said but he has got into bad company and i cant do anything with him  arent his parents living asked hal  only his father and he is a sea captain and aint home more than three or four times a year i wish he would take dick along with him some time it might do him good  so it might replied hal by the way mrs ricket do you know a man by the name of hardwick  the bookkeeper for the firm where dick used to work  yes  i saw him once when he was here to see dick  oh did he come here  yes about a week ago  he came to see your nephew did he  yes dick took him up to his room and the gentleman stayed about an hour or more  do you know where he lives  on east twentythird street near third avenue  the third avenue elevated runs close to it then  yes why do you want to know  i may have to go up on business sometime i didnt care to ask your nephew for the directions  i see  mrs ricket passed to the rear of the hall and hal continued on his to his room  so the two are friends he said to himself as he was washing himself and combing his hair and both of them are my enemies this is getting interesting to say the least he paused for a second i have half a mind to do it it wont do any harm i will  he hurried down to supper which was being served in the basement and as soon as it was over donned his coat and cap once more and made his way over to third avenue  an elevated train was just entering the station and paying his nickel he dropped his ticket in the box and rushed aboard  the fourteenth and eighteenth street stations were soon passed then came twentythird street and here hal alighted  it had begun to snow again and the youth was compelled to pull his coatcollar well up around his ears and his cap far down over his eyes to protect himself from the elements  he walked down east twentythird street slowly scanning the buildings closely as he passed it was now about halfpast eight oclock and he knew it would probably be some time before hardwick would make his appearance  having walked several blocks hal retraced his steps and then took up a position in a sheltering doorway  he had hardly done so before a wellknown form passed by  dick ferris cried hal to himself what can he be doing here  there could be but one answer to that question ferris must have come to see hardwick  he kept his eye on the tall boy and as soon as ferris was a short distance ahead hal left the doorway and followed him  ferris walked along for the space of two blocks then he came to an elegant brownstone front mansion the parlor of which was brilliantly illuminated  ascending the steps he rang the bell and the door was opened almost immediately  hal who stood near the areaway below heard him ask for hardwick  yes sir he just came in  may i see him  yes sir please step into the parlor  ferris stepped inside and the door was immediately closed  hal drew a deep breath if only he could find out ferris mission he felt certain the meeting between the bookkeeper and the former officeboy was to be an important one  he looked at the windows every one of them were tightly closed  too bad it isnt summer time muttered hal to himself  on either side of the mansion were others so there was no way to get to the rear excepting through the door below and this was tightly barred  i would like to know what a detective would do in a case of this kind thought hal i suppose he would find some way to effect an entrance  he was just about to give up trying to form some plan when the door opened and hardwick and ferris came out hal crouched near the foot of the steps and the pair passed within three feet of him  it isnt safe to talk over private matters in a house like that remarked hardwick i know a place where we will be far more at liberty to discuss the thing i have in mind  where is it asked ferris  a private clubroom just up the avenue  that will just suit me replied ferris  the two passed on hal raised himself from his cramped position and made after them  once around the corner of sixth avenue hardwick led the way into an open hallway lit up with a single gasjet the pair commenced to ascend the stairs which had several sharp turns hal was not far behind  ill find out what they are up to if i die for it he said and clenched his hands  several sentences were spoken which the youth did not catch and then came a cry from hardwick  what is that you say he demanded you saw this carson just before you left your aunts house  yes  impossible  why should it be asked ferris  hardwick did not reply  i was right thought hal with a shudder he threw those bricks on me and thought i was either dead or next door to it he is a thorough villain and no mistake  why shouldnt i see carson at the house went on ferris  whyi thought he wasnt going home till late stammered hardwick  did he say so  i believe he said something about it i didnt pay much attention hardwick was beginning to recover from his shock so you saw him  yes  you two dont get along very well do you  id like to thrash him growled ferris  why  hal did not hear the reply the two passed into a room on the third floor and the door was closed behind them  for an instant the youth hesitated then he mounted to the door and applied his eye to the keyhole  there was a brilliant light inside but no one appeared to be present  having satisfied himself on this point hal tried the knob of the door  it turned and he pushed the door open cautiously he knew he was treading on dangerous ground and was running a great risk yet a strange courage seemed to have come over him and he was not one bit nervous  once inside the room he saw that it was a club apartment papers were scattered over the table and cards and other games rested on a side stand  to the left was another door having a curtain strung over it  from beyond the curtain came the voices of hardwick and ferris and hal knew they had seated themselves and were taking it easy  approaching the outer door he locked it  now i cannot be surprised in that direction he thought and if hardwick or ferris try to leave i can hide in the closet  having made these preparations against being discovered hal approached the curtain to listen to whatever might be said  you say you wish you could fix carson he heard hardwick say  i do returned ferris i hate him and i would do almost anything to get square  then ill tell you of a little plan that you can work dick i dont like the fellow myself and it will delight me to see you get the best of him  how does the beggar do the office work  i must say first class  humph it didnt suit me hardwick if there hadnt been other money  hush cried the bookkeeper in alarm that matter must remain a secret never to be mentioned     chapter ix  the plot against hal   hal carson was sure that he had just missed a most important statement  i wish ferris had finished what he intended to say he thought  he waited breathlessly for the two to go on  what makes you so scared asked ferris can anybody hear us here  i think not still we want to be careful  yes but  not another word on that point dick hardwicks voice grew stern i am a man while you are a boy and i know what is best for both of us  well have your own way  i think it will be a wise plan for you to get carson out of the way he is altogether too smart a fellow to have around continued the bookkeeper  i dont think he looks very smart sneered ferris who could not stand hearing hal praised  hes smarter than you or most people think that yarn about his being brought up in the poorhouse may be true but i have my doubts  why asked ferris in high curiosity  i cant explain now there was a brief pause here take a cigar those nasty cigarettes make me sick  there was the striking of matches and then another pause  are you going to continue as bookkeeper when allen leaves asked ferris  certainly  i thought you were to go with allen in his new venture  i willlater on  has he made any definite plans yet  no  the reason i asked is because i want you to put in a word for me  hardwick laughed  dick you are getting to be a pretty big boy  didnt i do what you wished of me demanded ferris  i must say you did  then you ought to be willing  all right it shall be as you say  at this instant came a heavy hand on the doorknob outside  whos that cried ferris  must be churchley or wister replied hardwick  as the door was locked the person outside began to knock  i must have locked the door added the bookkeeper wait till i open it  as soon as the noise outside reached his ears hal made for the closet which stood in one corner of the room he found the door unlocked and the interior empty save for a broom and a duster and several similar things  he entered the closet transferring the key to the inside as he did so and locked the door behind him  a second later hardwick entered from the inner room and opened the door leading to the hall  hullo churchley hal heard him exclaim  how are you hardwick returned the newcomer locked me out did you  i must have turned the key without thinking replied the bookkeeper  all alone  no there is a young fellow with me  who  ferris  dont know him  i just brought him around to show him the place and have a quiet smoke he is in the other room  then dont let me disturb you replied churchley i just want to look over the newspapers and find out how that prizefight over in hoboken came off  hal heard the man drop into a seat by the table and after a few more words concerning the prizefight churchley had mentioned hardwick rejoined ferris in the other apartment  who is it asked ferris  a man named churchley replied hardwick in a low tone so that he might not be overheard  one of the club members  yes  will he overhear us  i guess not he is reading about the prizefight and when churchley gets on to anything of that kind he gets completely absorbed  then we can go on with our talk  yes but not too loud  i want to know about this plan against carson said ferris in a whisper  are you willing to go in against him  didnt i say i was  but i mean seriously  ferris changed color  of course i dont want to kill him he faltered  i understand but you are willing to get him into serious trouble  i am  then listen to me can you get into his room at your aunts house  i think i can  i mean without being seen  i have the whole run of the place  then supposing somethings belonging to the others were found in carsons trunk  he has no trunk interrupted ferris  so much the better for you can merely hide the stuff in among his things  do you mean for me to take them  some of them  some of them questioned ferris  yes those from your aunts boarders at the same time i will give you several articles belonging to the office that you can place with the others is there any one of the boarders you know well  i know saunders pretty well  then let saunders lose most of the stuff and put a flea in his ear to the effect that you think carson is the guilty party this will cause the fellows room to be searched and the stuff will be found you must be on hand to identify the office stuff see  i do  carson will be arrested and you will have your revenge  thats a boss plan exclaimed ferris when will you furnish me with stuff from the office  tomorrow noon if you will meet me at the corner of wall and nassau  ill be on hand it made me sick the way my aunt stuck up for carson of course i wouldnt go into the thing only i know the tramps a bad egg returned ferris trying to excuse his willingness to enter into such an outrageous plot  of course he is a bad egg and it is our duty to get him out of the way replied hardwick you will be on hand sure tomorrow  yes  and when will you put the things in his room  sometime during the afternoon that will bring matters to a head as soon as saunders and the others get home  you must expose carson while he is in his room if possible  oh hell be home with the rest  then thats all right of course there is no necessity to caution you to be careful  wasnt i careful before  hush  then dont talk that way say do you know these cigars are mighty strong  hardwick laughed  thats because you are not used to them dick now i generally smoke them twice as strong  just at this instant the two heard churchley jump to his feet  whos there he demanded  whats the matter with churchley said hardwick  hes talking to somebody replied ferris  hullo the doors locked they heard churchley continue  whats up churchley called out hardwick walking toward the other room  there is somebody in this closet was the startling reply i heard a noise half a dozen times     chapter x  hal is accused   when hal carson locked himself into the closet of the clubroom he realized that he was in a perilous position  supposing somebody undertook to open the door they might suppose it very strange to find the door locked and think it necessary to open it in which case he would be discovered in short order  he remained perfectly quiet for a long while and heard churchley admitted and heard the man seat himself at the center table and rustle the paper he was perusing  of the conversation carried on by ferris and hardwick he heard nothing further and he was consequently totally in the dark concerning the nefarious plot that had been formed to get him into serious trouble  ten minutes passed and the youth began to wonder how long he would have to remain a selfmade prisoner  then all became quiet in the room beyond and he wondered if churchley had not joined the two in the adjoining apartment  he peered through the keyhole but could see nothing but a portion of the wall opposite  growing bolder he turned the key in the lock and cautiously opened the door for the space of several inches looking out he saw that churchley still sat at the table which was but a few feet away  at that instant the man moved and gave a deep breath hal thought he intended to look around and hastily closed the door once more  the youths movement was so quick that the door made a sharp sound as the catch clicked this was followed by the sound made by the key in the lock as hal once more imprisoned himself  hal almost held his breath as he heard churchley jump up  whos there called the man  hal made no reply  then churchley came and tried the door  hullo the doors locked  at that moment hardwick entered followed by ferris  somebody in the closet cried hardwick  there seems to be  open the door  i cant its locked  who is in there called the bookkeeper  of course hal did not answer  perhaps it was a rat suggested ferris  might have been grumbled churchley i know there are plenty of them in the building because i once ran across one in the hallway  where is the key asked hardwick well soon find out  i dont know  it ought to be in the lock  perhaps jackson carted it off hes an odd sort of a coon  hardwick looked around on the mantel and in several other places  its gone  he came over and shook the door  see if the key is on the inside of the lock suggested ferris  at these words hal put down his hand and felt to make sure that the key was turned to one side  i cant see anything said hardwick after an examination  then jackson must have put it in his pocket said churchley  perhaps it was nothing but a rat after all said ferris  i have half a mind to run up and ask jackson said hardwick he lives right on the floor above  oh dont bother returned churchley if its a rat you may be sure he has gone back to his hole long ago  a little more conversation followed to which hal listened intently and then the youth heard hardwick and ferris go out  churchley continued to read the papers and during that time the youth hardly dared to move for fear the man might recommence his investigation  but at the end of the hour churchley gave a yawn and arose then two more men entered the room and the trio adjourned to the other apartment  making sure that the coast was clear this time hal unlocked the door and let himself out then he locked the door again and threw the key under the table  that will tend to stop suspicion he reasoned and i must be sharp in dealing with these rascals  he tiptoed his way to the door leading to the hallway and was soon outside  hardwick and ferris had gone long before and below all looked deserted it was still snowing heavily and hal made up his mind that the best thing he could do would be to return to his boardinghouse  he was soon on the elevated train and riding downtown  happening to glance toward the other end of the car in which he was seated he saw dick ferris sitting in the corner apparently absorbed in thought  im glad i spotted him thought hal i must take care he does not see me  east tenth street was soon reached in making for the house hal crossed over the street and ran ahead by this means he managed to get inside and up to his room before dick ferris put his key in the door  to tell the truth hal did not sleep much that night his mind seemed to be in a whirl what was the plot hardwick and dick ferris had hatched out against him  he was up early on the following morning at the breakfast table he had a pleasant word with saunders who was a clerk in a drygoods store and a pretty good sort of a fellow ferris did not appear but this was not strange as he had not been down early since his discharge from sumner allen  cos establishment  hal was the first to appear at the office in wall street he opened up as usual and after cleaning and dusting began copying from the point at which he had left off on the previous day  at quarter past nine hardwick hurried in the bookkeepers face was very red but whether from the cold or from drink it was hard to determine  mr allen soon followed hardwick and the two entered into a low and earnest conversation in the rear hal did not dare to approach them but he strained his ears to their utmost and caught the words he must be watched and the detectives will learn nothing and these set him to thinking deeply  presently mr sumner arrived the elderly brokers face showed deep lines of care and anxiety he had been up to the police headquarters to see if the detectives could give him any words of encouragement but he had been disappointed  we shall have every one about your establishment watched mr sumner the superintendent had said and i would advise you to go on with business as if nothing had happened  and to this the elderly broker had agreed  hal watched hardwick narrowly and the bookkeeper showed plainly that he did not appreciate the attention once he put his hand on hals arm and glared at him  what are you looking at me for he demanded in a low tone so that mr sumner might not hear  was i looking at you asked hal innocently  yes you were and i dont like it  hal bowed and turned away nevertheless he still kept watch on the sly  presently just before the time that hardwick usually went out for lunch he saw something which he thought rather odd although of no great importance  on a small shelf over one of the desks rested two new inkstands and several boxes of pens going to the desk hardwick pretended to be busy examining some papers while thus engaged hal saw the bookkeeper transfer the inkstands and the boxes of pens to his overcoat pocket  now what is he up to thought the youth  having transferred the articles to his clothes hardwick put down the papers and walked to where mr sumner sat busily engaged over his correspondence  shall i go to lunch now mr sumner he asked  the elderly broker glanced at the clock  yes  hardwick at once went out and presently mr allen followed mr sumner continued to write for a minute and then called hal  you may mail these letters and then get your lunch also he said  yes sir replied the youth  then he hesitated as he took up the letters  well what is it hal asked the broker  nothing much mr sumner i wished to ask you about those inkstands and the pens that were on the shelf over there  what of them you may use whatever you find necessary  it isnt that sir i just saw mr hardwick slip the things into his pocket  indeed mr sumner looked surprised did he say what he intended to do with them  no sir  i will ask him when he comes in  hal hesitated  i wish you would not mr sumner he said  the elderly broker looked surprised  why not  because i think mr hardwick is hatching up some plot against me and i wish to find out what it is  a plot  yes sir he is on friendly terms with dick ferris your former officeboy and both of them hate me  this is certainly news i knew hardwick did not like you because you suspected him but i thought that had passed over  no sir he is down on me worse than ever and i feel certain he is up to something to get me into trouble  and you think the inkstands and pens have something to do with the matter  yes sir perhaps hell say i stole them  i cant think hardwick so bad mused mr sumner why if he would do that he would steal the tin box  hal said nothing to this he preferred to discover more than he had before making any revelation  you saw them this morning didnt you went on the youth  yes i got a pen only ten minutes ago  then you know i didnt take them  yes  and you will keep silentthat is for the present  if you wish it hal  and mr sumner turned away and heaved a sigh it is terrible to have around you somebody you cannot trust  five minutes later hal went out to luncha light affair as the youth had spent ten cents more than intended in following hardwick the previous evening and he knew he must be sparing of his capital  he was just about returning to the office when chancing to glance up the street he saw hardwick and ferris just separating at the corner  he entered the office and a minute later hardwick followed neither spoke and but little was said all the afternoon excepting such as pertained to the business on hand  although his thoughts were busy on other matters hal paid strict attention to his work and mr sumner was well pleased with all the youth did  a good manly fellow he muttered to himself he could never have had anything to do with the robbery of the bonds i would rather suspect my own son were he still alive but poor howard is gone  sudden tears sprang into the brokers eyes which he as suddenly brushed away afraid that some customer might drop in and see his weakness  hal did not leave the office until after four oclock there being a number of things to be written up before he could go hardwick had gone an hour before and hal did not know in what direction  there being nothing else to do hal proceeded leisurely up to his boardinghouse never dreaming of the surprise in store for him the streets were filled with snow and he enjoyed the jingle of the sleighbells and the bustle of metropolitan life around him several times he was strongly tempted to follow the newsboys and bootblacks into the street and catch a ride  when he entered mrs rickets house he found saunders and several others already there dick ferris was in the group in the front parlor and at a glance hal saw that something unusual was going on  he nodded pleasantly and was about to pass up the stairs when mrs ricket called him back  what is it he asked  mr saunders room has been robbed burst out the woman  what exclaimed hal was there much taken  a pair of cuffbuttons a gold watchchain and my pocketbook with fourteen dollars in it replied saunders  its too bad sobbed mrs ricket i would not have had that happen in my house for a hundred dollars i wonder who could have done it  suddenly dick ferris pulled saunders aside and whispered something into his ear  the drygoods clerk looked astonished  you dont mean it he gasped  i do replied ferris  saunders advanced toward hal  were you in my room this morning after i left he asked sharply  me returned hal with a start no  dick says you were and he thinks you are the thief continued saunders     chapter xi  for and against   saunders was excited or he would not have spoken so hastily or so bluntly  hal grew very pale and clenched his hands  you say i entered mr saunders room he demanded turning to ferris  i do replied the tall boy  he had hardly spoken when hal strode over with such a determined air that ferris was forced to beat a retreat until he backed up against a side table  you know you are saying what isnt so said hal in a low voice and i want you to take it back  ii am telling the truth stammered ferris  it is false it is more likely that you entered mr saunders room yourself  when did you see carson enter my room put in the drygoods clerk  just as i was getting ready to come down  why didnt you speak of it before asked mrs ricket  i thought he had gone in to see tom  there is not a word of truth in what he says and he knows it said hal calmly it is merely a scheme to get me into trouble because he does not like me  no scheme about it blustered ferris if i were you id search his room  if the stolen things are there ferris put them there added hal quickly  mean to say im a thief roared ferris turning red in the face  i do  take care or ill give you a sound thrashing  similar to the one you gave me the other day i presume replied hal i am ready for you at any time  we dont want any fighting in the house cried mrs ricket this affair is bad enough without making it worse mr carson do you object to me and mr saunders going up to your room  not at all come on  hal led the way followed by the others dick ferris smiled darkly to himself as he came on behind  hell find out he cant insult me for nothing he muttered to himself  the room reached hal threw open the door and allowed mrs ricket to pass him  you had better make the search he said that will be fair all around  i will oh what a trouble all this is and crying softly to herself the landlady began her investigation  nothing was found in the closet nor in the drawer of the table then hals meager possessions were hauled over and still nothing came to light  look in the bureau drawer suggested saunders anxiously  mrs ricket did so from the rear the woman brought forth a large flat box rolled up in a newspaper  the newspaper was cast aside and the box opened out came a pair of cuffbuttons a gold watchchain a flat pocketbook two inkstands and several boxes of pens  the instant hal saw the articles he understood the trick that had been practiced upon him  saunders gave a cry  those are mine let me see if the money is safe he opened the pocketbook gone every dollar of it  he turned upon hal  give me that fourteen dollars or i will have you locked up at once  mr saunders i never took these things replied hal as calmly as he could  yes but the drygoods clerk was so angry he could hardly speak  i know it looks black against me but perhaps i can clear myself went on the youth  yes you can sneered ferris look here he pointed to the inkstands and the pens aunt amanda do you know who those things belong to  who  they belong to sumner allen  co replied ferris triumphantly  you are sure asked saunders  i am unless carson will stick out for it that the firm gave them to him returned ferris  is that so questioned mrs ricket  they were not given to me replied hal promptly but i know who brought them into the house  who  your nephew mrs ricket i am sorry for you but i am telling the truth  dick a thief  see here do you know what you are saying blustered ferris taken aback by this statement  i do  i wont have you talking to me in this fashion  then you had better own up to what you have done replied hal calmly  how could i get the things demanded ferris the firm knows they were there after i left  i know they do returned hal significantly and they know more than that  dick ferris grew almost white at these last words he seemed about to say something in return but suddenly changed his mind  carson this is a serious matter said saunders i hate to say much about it but the stuff has been found here and i dont see how i can do otherwise than look to you for that fourteen dollars  mr saunders i didnt take the things and i dont know anything about your money  easy enough to say but and saunders finished with a shrug of his shoulders  of course i cant prove what i say but i can give you my word of honor that i am telling the truth  thats all very well but it doesnt restore my money which i cant afford to lose replied saunders sharply  hal looked around in perplexity what was he to do  i cant believe you guilty said mrs ricket but if you have the money you had better return it  of course hes got the money put in ferris who had somewhat recovered from the effects of hals last words to him  hal picked up the newspaper which had been around the box and crumpled it nervously suddenly a peculiar look lit up his features  i guess i had better send for a policeman said saunders after a moment of silence  just wait a moment said hal  what for  i wish to ask a few questions  better see that he doesnt escape suggested ferris  let that remark apply to ferris as well as myself said hal  saunders walked to the door and locked it putting the key in his pocket  when did you miss your things asked hal  about an hour ago  at five oclock  a little before i got off early to visit my uncle in nyack but i cant go without my money  were you home to dinner  yes  did dick ferris come home  no  when did your nephew come home asked hal turning to mrs ricket  dont answer him aunt cried ferris he was beginning to get alarmed again  what harm will it do questioned the woman if you are innocent dick it wont matter  he wants to get me into trouble  please answer my question said hal decidedly  dick came home about two oclock  has he been home ever since  i believe so  now mrs ricket where were you all the afternoon  me  yes  i hope you dont suspect me cried the landlady in alarm  no i do not but please answer me  after dinner i cleaned all the halls from top to bottom and then saw to it that katie cleaned the front stoop and the windows  then you were in the halls and around the front door most of the time  i was  did i come in at any time during the afternoon  i didnt see you  wouldnt you have seen me if i had  i suppose i would admitted the woman  what does all this talk amount to put in ferris  shut up cried hal sharply i am not addressing you  he turned to saunders  you hear what mrs ricket says i was not here to steal your things  humph they might have been stolen this morning exclaimed ferris  or last night added saunders the last i saw of the cuffbuttons was last night and the pocketbook yesterday noon  i dont see how that can be possible replied hal quietly  its easy enough exclaimed ferris just because i was home during the afternoon and you were not doesnt prove that you didnt take the things  no that doesnt but something else does replied hal  what  this newspaper which was wrapped around the box  at these words ferris grew white and trembled from head to foot  what about the paper asked saunders curiously  it is an afternoon paper dated today it could not possibly have been put around the box before one oclock this afternoon     chapter xii  hal in a fearful situation   every one in the room was surprised at hal carsons unexpected statement  let me see the paper cried saunders  hal handed it over and the drygoods clerk scanned it eagerly  you are right he muttered and shook his head  that cant be the same paper that was around the box put in dick ferris very red in the face  it certainly is replied hal  yes i saw carson pick it up from the spot where i threw it returned saunders this puts a new face on the matter he added with a sharp look at ferris  mrs ricket also looked at her nephew  dick come here she commanded  what do you want he demanded doggedly  i want you to return mr saunders fourteen dollars  i havent got it  i know better  what aunt amanda are you going back on me too cried ferris in a pretended reproachful tone  i tried to believe all along against my better judgment that you were innocent said the landlady but i cant believe it any longer and when you try to throw the blame on somebody who is innocent ive got to speak my mind mrs rickets voice began to grow stern give up the money and ask mr saunders to forgive you before he sends for a policeman and has you arrested  this was a long speech for mrs ricket and she almost gasped for breath after she had finished  dick ferris face grew black as he listened to the words  youre a nice aunt to me he stormed just wait till i tell dad about it when he comes home next time  but now saunders had the fellow by the collar  which is it the money or the stationhouse he asked shortly  dick ferris looked into the determined black eyes and then his courage oozed away  will you promise not to do anything if i give you fourteen dollars he asked  yes  then here you are he brought forth his pocketbook and took out a roll of bills i didnt take your money but its no fun to be hauled up  why dick where did you get so much money cried mrs ricket in amazement  i earned it replied the fellow coolly here you are saunders now unlock the door and let me out  saunders took the fourteen dollars counted them over and then did as requested without another word ferris hurried out and down the stairs  i hope you are satisfied said hal to the drygoods clerk  i am sorry i suspected you returned saunders what a mean dog ferris is  he is down on me because i am filling the position he was discharged from explained hal  unless he takes a turn for the better i shall tell him to leave the house cried mrs ricket trying to dry away her tears ever since he came two years ago he has been a torment to me i only keep him for my poor dead sisters sake  how about this stuff questioned saunders pointing to the inkstands and the boxes of pens  i shall return them to sumner allen  co  queer how that boy got hold of those things said mrs ricket  hal pretended not to hear the remark and a moment later saunders and the landlady left the room  so that was the plot against me muttered hal as he fixed up to go to supper i wonder what hardwick will say when he hears how it turned out  the youth was compelled to smile to himself the bookkeeper would no doubt be very angry  it was lucky i looked at the newspaper hal went on it was that saved me and nothing else ferris overreached himself i wish i could gain such an important point in that bond matter it would be a great feather in my cap to recover the tin box and its contents  a little later hal went down to supper ferris did not appear and nothing was said about the recent happening upstairs  please keep it quiet whispered mrs ricket to him as he was about to leave the room it will only hurt my reputation to say anything  the next morning when hal arrived at the office he found mr sumner already there this was most unusual and the youth could not help but show his surprise  the elderly broker was pouring over the books but as soon as hal appeared he put them away  hal had the inkstands and the pens in his overcoat pocket and he at once handed them over much to mr sumners astonishment  where did they come from he asked  i will explain later replied hal please put them out of sight now for mr hardwick is coming and i wish he wouldnt see them  mr sumner promptly swept the things into his desk and began to write a letter  when the bookkeeper entered he was astonished to see hal at work cleaning up he had fully expected that the youth would be arrested for the robbery at mrs rickets and that hal was now in jail  then he looked back and saw mr sumner at his desk and his astonishment increased  why really mr sumner he began  im early this morning eh returned the broker well i wanted to get this correspondence off my hands and i seem to be able to do better work early in the morning  you are a hard worker commented hardwick and that was all he said  when hal was dusting near the rear mr sumner looked up to see that the bookkeeper was not noticing and then motioned to the youth  dont say anything about my being at the books whispered the broker in a low tone  hal nodded and then he went on as if nothing had been said but the words set him to thinking deeply  at the end of an hour mr sumner arose  i am going out for a couple of hours he said if mr allen comes in tell him to let that wabash matter rest until tomorrow  i will replied hardwick  you may continue on that copying carson went on the broker mr hardwick will direct you  yes sir replied the youth  mr sumner quitted the place and hurried up the street  dick ferris stood on the opposite side near the corner he then waved his hand to hardwick  the bookkeeper at once put on his hat and coat and went out hal did not see the man join ferris  hal did his best to concentrate his thoughts upon his work but found it almost impossible to do so  a halfhour dragged by slowly  then the door burst open and hardwick rushed in he was pale and terribly excited rushing up to hal he caught the youth roughly by the arm  see here i want to have a talk with you he cried  what about asked hal as coolly as he could  you know well enough you miserable sneak hissed hardwick tell me at once all you know  know about what asked hal trying to stand his ground  hardwick glared at him for an instant he seemed to be in a fearful rage suddenly he caught hal by the throat with one hand and picked up a heavy brassbound ruler with the other  now carson are you going to speak up or not he demanded     chapter xiii  hal shows his mettle   hal understood perfectly well that a crisis had come hardwick had him by the throat and unless he acceded to the bookkeepers demand he would be in immediate danger of being choked to death  letlet go of me he gasped  not until you do as i say replied hardwick i want you to understand that you cant get the best of me  hal tried to push hardwick away but the bookkeeper made a pass at him with the heavy ruler  keep quiet if you value your head roared hardwick  let me go  not until you have told me what you mean by your doings  what doings  your doings up to mrs rickets  who told you about what happened up there  never mind i know all about it  then ferris saw you last night  no he didnt  or this morning  shut up you implicated me  did dick ferris say i did asked hal  never mind who said so i want to know what you mean by such work  hal did not reply he was trying to think what was ferris object in telling hardwick he had been mentioned in connection with the matter  clearly there could be but one reason ferris knew hardwick already disliked hal and he wished to put the bookkeeper against the youth so as to get hal into more difficulties  do you hear me demanded hardwick giving hal an extra squeeze on the throat  i do gulped hal letgoof me  not until you have answered  hal commenced to struggle seeing this hardwick tried to strike him with the ruler which on account of its brassbound edge was an ugly weapon the ruler came down twice the second time cutting a gash on the youths neck from which the blood flowed copiously  this last blow aroused all the lion in hals nature as the reader knows he was a wellbuilt boy and strong for his age he gave a sudden wrench and broke away  stand back he cried dont you dare to touch me again  hardwick glanced toward the door to see that no one was coming  ill show you he hissed passionately  he rushed at hal again the youth saw him coming and drawing back his arm he planted a blow on hardwicks nose that sent the blood spurting in all directions  hardwick was more surprised than hurt had that poor house chap dared to hit him he turned first red and then white  ill fix you he cried  stand back i tell you commanded hal he was getting excited himself  but hardwick would not stand back and as a consequence he received a blow on the forehead that almost stunned him  you beggar youve got muscle havent you he cried well try a different method with you  he ran toward his desk and opened it an instant later hal saw a revolver in his hand  now we will see who is on top here said hardwick  it would be useless to deny that hal was frightened at the sight of the shining barrel he backed several feet  i thought that would bring you to terms said hardwick now will you answer my question  you will not dare to shoot me returned the youth as calmly as he could  dont be too sure i intend that you shall answer me  hal looked about him he had backed toward the rear of the office the window was unlocked could he leap through it  hardwick followed the youths look and understood it  no you dont he said and moving toward the window he locked it  the only way that now remained to escape was by the street door hardwick placed himself in front of this  give me the key to this door he demanded  the key hung on a nail close to where hal was standing  instead of complying hal took down the key and placed it in his pocket  did you hear me went on the bookkeeper  i did  you are playing with fire young man  am i  you are you think i havent nerve enough to go ahead but youll find out your mistake ill give you just ten seconds in which to hand me that key  hal made no reply  did you hear  i did  are you going to mind  no  hardwick aimed the pistol at hals head whether or not he would have fired cannot be told for at that instant the door opened and mr sumner stepped in  i forgot my he began and then stopped short in amazement  mr sumner cried hal i am glad you have come  what is the meaning of this gasped the elderly broker  he looked at hardwick and then at the pistol  the bookkeeper dropped back unable for the moment to say a word  he intended to shoot me said hal  that is a falsehood exclaimed hardwick  its the truth retorted the youth  no such thing the young tramp pulled this pistol and i just snatched it away from him  hal was amazed at this deliberate falsehood mr sumner turned to him  did you have that pistol first he asked  no sir  i say he did put in hardwick  i never owned a pistol added hal  then he must have stolen it sneered hardwick i tell you mr sumner he is a bad egg and he ought to be discharged  perhaps responded the elderly broker dryly just hand the weapon to me  hardwick did so and mr sumner examined it  do you carry such a weapon he asked shortly  no sir  dont own one i presume  i must say i do not  humph so you say carson drew it on you  he did  mr sumner began hal  stop carson until i get through with mr hardwick what was the cause of this quarrel  the boy got impudent and i threatened to report him and have him discharged  is that all  yes he is an unmannerly dog  i didnt think so when i hired him  he is mr sumner  the elderly broker examined the pistol again  i wish you would explain one thing to me mr hardwick he said slowly  what is that sir  it is this if you do not own a pistol how does it happen that i saw this very weapon in your desk over a week ago  the bookkeeper started back and changed color  whatwhat do you mean he faltered  just what i say about a week ago i had occasion to go to your desk for a certain paper and i saw this very weapon lying in one corner  therethere must be some mistake  none sir this is your pistol and i believe you pulled it upon this boy  hals face beamed the cloud that had gathered so suddenly seemed to be breaking away  why should i draw it on the young cub growled hardwick not knowing exactly what to say  because you have a spite against carson and you wish to get him into trouble i used to think you a fair and square man hardwick but i find i am mistaken     chapter xiv  hal expressed his opinion   the perspiration was standing out upon mr sumners forehead he took out his handkerchief and mopped himself hardwick shot an angry glance at him  i dont see what you find so interesting in the boy he muttered  i am interested in him because he saved my life  saved your life  exactly it is true that he came from the poorhouse but he is a young hero and i will not have him imposed on especially when he is doing his best to get along  well every one to his taste returned hardwick  i want none of your impudence cried the broker you were not as much of a man as this boy when i took you in eight years ago  thanks returned hardwick coolly perhaps you would just as soon i would quit your service  i would  then i will quit on the first of the year  you will quit today and without recommendations  without recommendations  yes let me tell you something all last evening and this morning early i spent the time examining your books i find you have made false entries how many i do not know and that you are a defaulter in the sum of several thousands of dollars  hal was almost as much surprised at mr sumners statement as hardwick  youhaveexaminedthebooks said the bookkeeper slowly  i have  hardwick breathed hard it was a terrible blow mr sumner had dealt him he had supposed his little crooked actions in the office well hidden from prying eyes  you may have to prove what you say he exclaimed haughtily  i can easily do so returned mr sumner coolly shall i send for an officer to take charge of you in the meanwhile  at the mention of an officer hardwick grew white and his lips trembled  nno he cried there must be some mistake  there is no mistake whatever do you deny that you have appropriated the bank funds of the firm  mr allen gave me the right to  mr allen had no rights as you are aware our partnership is a limited one and i shall settle with mr allen later  you cant hold me accountable for that money  i can but i wont for i imagine the greater part of it has been spent how much have you in your pocket now  sir  you heard my question answer me  i will not im no fool  very well hal will you call a policeman  hal started for the door hardwick caught him by the arm and shoved him back  stay here there is my pocketbook  hal you may remain mr sumner took the pocketbook and counted the money in it a hundred and eighty dollars he went on have you any more with you  no  is that a genuine diamond you are wearing  yes  what is it worth  it cost seventyfive dollars  then listen to me i have found out that you are a pretty high liver hardwick and you have probably squandered nearly all of what you have stolen  look here i  stop or hal shall go at once for the officer now what i propose to do is this i will keep this money and that pin and the one hundred and twentyfive dollars of salary coming to you and let the matter drop so far as that crookedness in the books is concerned  and if i refuse  then hal shall go for an officer and you can stand trial  hardwick muttered something under his breath not at all complimentary to his employer he felt that he was in a tight place  there is no alternative he asked  none  and you will let this matter rest  yes i wish to give you a chance to turn over a new leaf if there is any turn over in you  hardwick hesitated for a moment  i accept he said doggedly  very well hand over the pin  the diamond scarf pin was transferred to the brokers hand  here is your pocketbook and ten dollars i dont wish to see you go away without a cent  keep the money you might as well rob me of all of it exclaimed hardwick he reached for his hat and coat you will rue this day horace sumner mark my word for it and you you young tramphardwick turned to hali will get square and dont you forget it  he went out slamming the door behind him hal watched him from the window and saw him turn down broad street  mr sumner gave a long sigh  i am glad i am rid of that man he said  so am i responded hal he is a worse villain than you think mr sumner  the elderly broker smiled faintly  you still think him connected with the disappearance of the tin box i suppose  i do  the police are almost certain they are on the right track of the criminal i cannot give you the details but the party is not hardwick  the police dont know everything hardwick is thoroughly bad and he is in league with dick ferris and mr allen  you speak very positively hal  because i know what i am speaking about sir  you say hardwick is in with dick ferris  yes sir  how do you know  because they formed a plot to have me arrested but that is not the worst of it hardwick made an attempt on my life because i followed him  is it possible mr sumner was now thoroughly interested why did you not tell me of this before  because i wished to follow out the matter on my own hook and besides i am almost a stranger to you and you might think i was making up a yarn  no hal i trust you thoroughly i dont know why but you have something about you that seems perfectly honest  thank you the youth was blushing i will never deceive you mr sumner and you may depend on it  tell me about this attempt on your life said the broker  standing by mr sumners desk hal related very nearly all that had occurred since his first appearance at the office the broker listened with eager attention  you are right he said when hal had concluded and apparently ferris is as bad a villain as hardwick but how do you account for mr allen being in with them  on account of that conversation i overheard on the ferryboat that night they may try to explain it away as they please i am convinced that they were talking of robbing your private safe  but mr allen comes of very fine connections began the broker  that may be but didnt you just say he didnt do just right  so i did and it is true but that might be put down to a mere matter of sharp business practice legally right if not morally so but this other  and the elderly broker shook his head  if a man will cheat legally i dont think he will stop at cheating any other way replied hal he may for a while but his conscience soon gets blunted and thats the end of it you say the police think somebody else is guilty  yes  do they think the thief came through the window  yes  that the man who came in while i was here had nothing to do with it  that is their theory  but that doesnt explain one point  and what is that  why the marks on the windowsill which are very plain and made by dirt and ashes did not extend to the safe  didnt they  no  humph who discovered that  i did  when  the day the two detectives were here  did you say anything about it  no sir  why not  because as i said before i wished to sift the matter myself if i could i know i am nothing but a boy but i intend to do all i can toward getting back your bonds  well you are smart hal there is no denying that what is your opinion of the marks  i think they were only a blind  put there to form a wrong impression  exactly sir that robbery was committed by somebody who came in through the office and who knew the combination of the safe  possibly but that doesnt fasten the crime on hardwick  it does not but i look at it in this light as one of the detectives said it is possible that somebody stood outside of the rear window and saw you work the combination but i doubt very much if they could learn the process in that way there is a glare of light on the window that renders it very difficult to see at all  yes but  now wait a moment please hal was growing enthusiastic do you keep the combination written down anywhere  i do not i gave it to my daughter laura in case something happened to me and i suppose she has it down but i do not know  then it isnt likely any one could get the combination unless they watched you  i suppose not  very well now the only persons employed in the office were you mr allen hardwick ferris and myself i know you and i are innocent now who knew of the bonds being in the tin box  mr sumner started  by jove i never thought of that  please answer me  we all knew of it  did any outsider know  i think not  was the tin box locked  yes  after you placed the bonds in it no outsider heard of their being there  not unless the others told them  which they would not likely do now tell me was anything else taken  not a thing  not even placed out of position  as far as i could see no  was there any trace of the tin box having been opened  mr sumner shook his head  doesnt it seem probable that if the thieves had not been certain of what was in the box they would have opened it and if they were ordinary fellows that they would have taken something else of value  hal you ought to be a detective cried the broker in admiration of the bodys logical reasoning  i tell you that robbery was committed by somebody who knew all about your private affairs and was here to obtain the combination of your safe and that somebody was either hardwick mr allen ferris or else the three of them     chapter xv  hal defends a girl   hal carsons face glowed with earnestness as he spoke  it was easy to see that he was fully convinced of the truth of what he had just said  it would seem as if you must be right replied mr sumner after rather a long pause  you may depend on it i am sir  but to think that of allen  many a man in a high position has fallen before now did you ever inquire into his financial standingthat is outside of your business relationships  no  then he may not be as well fixed as you think could he use the bonds if he had them  yes they were not registered and there are several ways in which they might have been worked off  you are to dissolve partnership on new years day i believe  yes i am not satisfied with the way matters are running and i intend to run the place alone as i used to  perhaps the dissolution may bring other matters to light sir  ha i never thought of that  that is if mr allen doesnt wipe them out in the meantime  mr sumner jumped to his feet and began to walk up and down nervously  i understand what you are driving at hal he cried where do you get such keen wit i never saw your equal in a boy  i dont know sir unless it may be because i take such a strong personal interest in the mattera thing that most detectives do not  it must be that i must have the books investigated by an expert i am too old to go over them myself and do the work as it ought to be done  i think that would be best but i would not let mr allen know of it  i will not  not even if you find he has been robbing you  what  no  but he ought to be arrested  not until you have your bonds back mr sumner  i see  if you arrest him that wont bring your bonds back i have a plan to propose if you will let me carry it out  what is it  that while i nominally remain here as clerk and officeboy you allow me to watch him as well as hardwick and dick ferris  you may get into trouble see how hardwick threatened you and attacked you in the dark  i am not afraid sir  i would not have you go on such a mission for me and get hurt for all the bonds on the street  i would be very careful sir  well supposing i let you do that what would you do first  that will depend on circumstances where is mr allen now  gone to philadelphia on business  for the firm  no for himself  then you are not sure if he has gone there or not  i only know what he said  when do you expect him back  not until tomorrow  will you tell me where he lives  on fiftythird street the number is on the card over there  hal took it down  is there anything special to do just now  i must have those papers written up that hardwick was at work on the books i can write up myself  then with your permission ill write up the papers and then begin my hunt  very well but mind and keep out of trouble  hal smiled and turned at once to the desk a strange feeling filled his breast he was really going to turn detectivehe a country boy and that too in new york  it sounds like the wildest kind of a romance he thought to himself but it isnt its sober truth and i may find it a mighty hard truth before i get through  he fairly flew at the work and by two oclock it was finished he handed it to mr sumner  that is excellent said the broker glancing over the written pages and now i suppose you are ready to go  if you are willing sir  there is nothing more to be done today tomorrow i shall get a firstclass bookkeeper whom i happen to know to take hardwicks place  in a minute more hal was off he knew not exactly in what direction to go but thought he would cross broadway and take the sixth avenue elevated cars to fiftythird street  as he stepped on the sidewalk in front of trinity church which stands at the beginning of wall street he happened to glance up and not far away saw hardwick  the exbookkeeper was smoking a cigar and scowling he did not see hal and the youth soon put himself where he was not likely to be seen  five minutes passed then hardwick began to move slowly up broadway casting sharp glances to his right and left hal slowly followed keeping several people between himself and the man he was shadowing  at length hardwick stopped at the corner of cedar street here he was joined by dick ferris and the two at once began an animated conversation which hal managed to overhear  got the bounce were the first words he heard well thats rich hardwick  i dont see the point growled the exbookkeeper i wish i had fixed the young tramp  he seems to be worrying us pretty bad said ferris but say how about that money i was to have  i cant give it to you now  why not  i havent got it  tell that to your grandmother  its a fact old sumner made me fork over every cent i had about me  what for  he claims i have been getting in on him  ill bet hes right too  well he isnt  no of course not returned ferris sarcastically a fellow who would  shut up you monkey cried hardwick getting angry you know too much  well when am i to have that money  tomorrow  sure  yes ill get it for you  what will you dobleed old allen  never mind ill get it and thats enough by the way i want you to do something for me  what is it  deliver a letter to tommy macklin i have got an engagement tonight and i want tommy to get the letter before morning  all right hand it over where are you going now  home to get shaved and fixed up and have a nap i was up all night and i feel it  youre going it pretty strong  dont preach dicky my boy for your age i think you go it pretty well yourself  ferris laughed and stuffed the letter hardwick handed him into his pocket then the two separated  hal pondered for a moment and then concluded to follow dick ferris hardwick was going home i wish i knew what was in that letter thought hal as he shadowed ferris up broadway to park row it may be something that has to do with the missing tin box  ferris passed the entrance to the brooklyn bridge and then turned into a side street  ill wager hes going to the same place hardwick visited the other night exclaimed hal to himself  with increased interest he followed ferris until the latter came to a narrow and dirty alleyway piled high on one side with empty boxes and barrels  here a number of children were playing some making snowmen and others coasting on homemade breadshovel sleds  ferris tried to walk between them and in doing so got directly in the way of a small sled upon which was seated a ragged girl not over ten years of age  the sled brushed against ferris leg and angered him  what do you mean by doing that you dirty thing he exclaimed take that and learn better manners  he hauled off and struck the girl in the face it was a heavy blow and it caused her nose to bleed and her cheek to swell  youyou brute sobbed the girl  whats that howled ferris a brute am i theres another for you  he stepped back to hit the girl again but now there was a rush from the rear and on the instant the bully found himself in the strong grasp of hal carson     chapter xvi  hal on the watch   let up there you brute  dick ferris looked around with a startled air  when he caught sight of hal his face fell and he released the girl  what you he exclaimed  exactly what do you mean by treating this girl so rudely  you are following me went on ferris ignoring the question which had been put to him  what if i am  you think youre smart dont you sneered ferris  hes a mean ugly thing put in the girl between her sobs i wish he was arrested  shut up roared ferris turning to her you ran into me on purpose  i didnt weve got a right to coast in this alley mamma said so  you ought to be arrested for striking the little girl said hal i am awfully glad i arrived in the nick of time to save her from more punishment  good fer you mister cried a small youth standing near give him one in der eye  yes do him up mister cried several others  ferris turned upon them like a savage animal  get out of here every one of you he howled unless you want to be hammered to death  dont you move said hal you evidently have more right here than he has  indeed said ferris turning to hal i wish you would keep your nose out of my affairs  dont let him sass you mister put in one of the urchins he didnt have no cause ter hit katie  ferris pounced upon the boy at once and cuffed him right and left in the midst of the castication however hal caught the bully by the arm and a second later dick ferris measured his length in the gutter  a shout went up from the boys and girls  dats der way ter do it  aint der gent got muckle dough  then somebody threw a snowball and in a trice the entire crowd were snowballing ferris as furiously as they could  hal looked on and he was compelled to laugh then a sudden idea struck him like a flash he darted out of sight behind the pile of empty boxes and barrels  muttering something under his breath dick ferris struggled to his feet as soon as he did this the street children took to their legs dragging their sleds after them ferris made after one or two of them but was unable to effect a capture  run off wid yerself  we aint got no use fer bullies  spat  a snowball took ferris right in the ear and caused him to utter a sharp cry of pain  then another took him in the face and in trying to dodge he slipped and went into a snowdrift  he was quickly on his feet and this time ran after the crowd so fast that he caught one of the boys  lemme go howled the youngster  not much you rat take that  ferris struck the boy in the mouth and the little fellow let out a yell  hal was just about to dart to his assistance when a policeman came along and touched ferris on the shoulder  whats the trouble here he demanded  ferris turned savagely but his manner changed when he beheld the officer of the law  this chap is a rascal he explained  in what way  he fired a snowball at me and hit me in the ear  i didnt howled the urchin it was anudder fellow wot fired dat snowball  and he began to cry bitterly  it was only done in fun i suppose said the officer  fun fumed ferris look at my clothes  the officer did so ferris was covered with snow and dirt principally the latter  the snowball couldnt have done that said the policeman  he was in sympathy with the small boy whom he knew as the son of one of his friends  i know but this boy and a lot of his chums got to throwing at me and in trying to dodge i went down  the policeman paused for a moment and then turned to the urchin  see here bubby if i let you go will you promise not to throw any more snowballs  yes sir came in one breath and very eagerly  then run  what aint you going to arrest him cried dick ferris in some excitement  i think not  but he ought to be  i fancy i know my own business best was the short reply  but he is a little imp and  better let it go i dare say you throw snowballs yourself once in a while  and with this remark the policeman moved on  well thats a fine way to treat a fellow muttered ferris to himself i suppose that policeman would let the whole ward pounce on me without doing anything toward helping me i wonder where that hal carson is  the tall youth brushed off his clothing hastily and returned to the entrance to the alley he looked around carefully but hal kept well hidden  dick ferris was undecided what to do should he deliver the letter intrusted to him by hardwick he hesitated and then continued up the alleyway upon which a number of dirty dingy tenement houses were situated  arriving at the very last of these he ascended the front stoop and knocked loudly upon the door there was no reply and while he was waiting for some one to answer his summons hal managed to skulk up behind the other buildings and approach within hearing distance  at last ferris got tired of waiting and he tried the door it was unlocked and pushing it open the tall boy entered  hal waited for a moment and then mounting the stoop peered in at the door which ferris had left partly open  as the youth had surmised the hallway was quite dark he heard ferris mounting the rickety stairs and like a shadow he followed fairly holding his breath lest some sound might betray his presence  ferris mounted almost to the top of the tenement and then hammered on a door in the rear  come cried a voice from inside and ferris entered  no sooner was the door closed than hal approached it and applied his eye to the keyhole he saw a small apartment scantily furnished with a small cookstove a table three chairs and some kitchen utensils  a man sat before the stove smoking a short briar pipe he was unshaved but his face bore evidence of former gentility and manhood in spite of the fact that it was now dissipated  hullo ferris he exclaimed  how are you macklin returned the tall boy  not very well i can tell you returned macklin removing his pipe and spitting into the stove ive got rheumatism yer know  rheumatism laughed ferris more likely its rumatism tommy  dont give me any o yer jokes ferris wot brings yer  ive got a letter for you  from hardwick  ferris nodded  i thought i would hear from him before long hand it over  ferris did so macklin tore open the epistle and began to peruse it hastily as he did so ferris tried to glance over his shoulder  here none o dat cried macklin savagely wots my business is my business  he finished reading the letter and put it in his coat pocket then he pulled away on his pipe for a moment  well said ferris by way of inquiry  tell him its all right if he doubles the figger  makes the amount twice as large  dats it its a ticklish piece o business  what is the work macklin questioned ferris sitting down on the opposite side of the stove  the man closed one eye  hardwick knows he replied shortly  i know that replied ferris and i know something about this new deal too  wot do yer know  never mind i know  dats all put on ferris yer dont know a ting see cried macklin with a laugh that sounded more like a croak  dick ferris colored slightly  hardwick said there was something new on he explained lamely  yes but he didnt tell yer wot it was  ferris arose thinking that further attempts at pumping would be useless  say dont be in no hurry went on macklin sit down an git warmed up  i aint cold  ferris started for the door but the man pulled him back  how did yer make out wid hardwick on dat last deal he asked  all right responded the tall boy hurriedly  wot do you call all right  thats my affair tommy  dont git on yer high horse ferris  i can keep as mum as you can tommy and dont you forget it  did he give you more dan a hundred  is that what you got out of it  naw i didnt git half o dat  hardwick is a close one  dats so but some day hell have ter pony up yer see if he dont  i suppose it will be you who will squeeze him said ferris with another laugh  you bet  he ought to be squeezed a little said ferris reflectively he makes a small fortune alongside of what we get out of it  yes but der trouble is yer cant corner him responded macklin if yer try yer git yerself in trouble but before long he did not finish in words but bobbed his head vigorously  wheres your wife asked ferris glancing around  der old womans gone to der market  aint any one else here is there  ferris glanced around suspiciously no  then supposing we come to an understanding went on ferris in a low tone we both do work for hardwick and we ought to get more money for it  well  unless we get together we cant do anything but when he finds we are both of a mind he may listen to us and both of us will make by it  hal listened to every word of this conversation with deep interest from it he discovered that macklin was a tool of hardwick as well as ferris and both were in the habit of doing underhand work for the exbookkeeper  if either of them would only mention something definite he thought the tin box robbery for instance then i would be certain i was on the right track  thats an idea ferris replied macklin it aint fair fer hardwick ter be rollin in money an me livin here  thats it  i uster be jest as fine a liver as him ferris in the flush days an when old sumner took hardwick in an bounced me  macklin did not finish there was a racket in the hallway and then came the tones of an excited irishwoman  phots this phot be yez doin here young mon snakin along like a thafe tommy macklin cum here     chapter xvii  near to death   the irishwoman had come up behind hal so softlyshe wore rubbersthat the youth did not hear her and he was therefore thoroughly startled when she made the exclamation quoted at the end of the preceding chapter  ferris and macklin jumped to their feet and both rushed out in the hall  whats the row mary cried the latter  sure an thats phot oi want to know replied the woman oi found this fellow pakin in the kayhole of your dure so oi did  its hal carson exclaimed ferris so this is the way you followed me eh he continued  who is hal carson asked macklin grasping the youth by the arm  old sumners new clerk and office boy replied ferris dont let him get away  macklin gave a whistle  dats kinder serious if he follered yer here wot have yer got ter say fer yerself he demanded turning to hal  let go of my arm returned hal are you the only one who lives in this building  no  then i presume i have a right to enter the hallway havent i  that wont wash carson exclaimed ferris you are doing nothing but following me and you know it  just you step inside do you hear commanded macklin thats all right mary ill take care o him he added to the woman  oi wondher if he was up in me apartment she said suspiciously oill go up an see if there is anything missing  the woman departed and macklin tried to shove hal into the room  stop that ordered the youth  dont pay no attention to him cried ferris hes a regular spy and hes trying his best to get us all into trouble  macklin caught hal by the arm the next instant hal received a terrible blow behind the right ear that almost stunned him  now i think yer will come in an mind howled macklin take hold o him ferris  the tall boy came out and before hal could recover he was dragged into the apartment and the door was closed and locked  when he came to realize what had happened he found himself confronted by the angry pair  thats what you get for spying on us said ferris  taint no healthy business fer a feller ter be in around here added macklin with a coarse laugh  i want you to open the door returned hal as calmly as he could  thats right laughed ferris i suppose you think you can command us to do anything dont you  hal walked toward the door and shook it it was strongly built and to break it down was out of the question  give me the key he said  another laugh followed this speech  hal glanced out of the window it was tightly closed and the distance to the court below was fully twenty feet  the youth looked at macklin who had resumed his smoking  what do you propose to do with me he asked  that is hard ter tell replied the tough it all depends on wot ferris is got ter say  you have the key of the door  i kinder think its in my pocket  give it to me  macklin chuckled  dont waste yer breath yer may need it  he had hardly spoken when hal sprang upon him the youth was thoroughly aroused and a well directed blow sent macklin sprawling in one corner while his pipe went flying in another  the tough uttered a howl as he went down and ferris gave a cry of consternation  now will you give me the key demanded hal  git orf of me spluttered macklin  let up there put in ferris  stand back ferris cried hal i am not to be trifled with  pull him orf roared macklin  ferris advanced but rather gingerly  he knew hals strength and he had a great horror of being struck  macklin tried to rise but hal hit once more and he went down a second time then hal sat down on his body  hand over the key  hal had an idea the key was in macklins outer pocket and into this he inserted his hand  it soon came in contact with what he was searching for he tried to withdraw the key but now macklin began to squirm worse than ever and he had hard work to master the fellow  help me ferris howled the tough  dont you dare come near said hal  dont mind himhelp me said macklin again  ferris hesitated but at last approached and caught hal by the arm  let macklin up he said  instead of replying hal sprang to his feet in one hand he held the key and with the other he shoved ferris up against the wall  now let me pass  dont do it howled macklin  i wont replied ferris  he caught hal by the coat tail this compelled the youth to turn once more he aimed a blow at ferris head and the fellow went down over the table  hal now thought he saw his way clear to escape he bounded toward the door and was just inserting the key into the lock when macklin sprang up  beside the stove lay a heavy billet of wood which the man had intended to split up for kindlings macklin caught up the stick and jumping behind hal hit the youth a fearful blow directly on the top of the head  with a low cry hal sank down in a heap macklin gave a sudden gasp and ferris straightened up  have youkilled him asked ferris in a tone of horror  i dont know replied the tough dat was a kinder heavy crack wasnt it  ferris shuddered a thin stream of blood was issuing from hals head and this made the tall boy sick he approached and gazed at hals pallid face and motionless form  im afraid you have killed him macklin he said  me killed him cried the tough i kinder think you had as much ter do wid it as me  ferris had a sudden chill dart down his backbone at these words if anything was wrong it was certain macklin did not intend to shoulder the blame  what made you hit him so hard he asked  i couldnt help it lets see how bad he is  macklin approached hal and turned over the limp body then he placed his hand over the youths heart  he aint dead yet dat was a hard crack but hes got a strong constitution dat feller has say  well  macklin came up close to dick ferris who was now as white as a sheet  we is good friends ferris aint we  yeas  den let me do sumthin fer yer  what is it  ill tell yer yer see der feller aint  macklin broke off short as a footstep sounded in the hallway  its der old woman comin back he muttered  your wife  yes  oh what shall we do with thethe body cried ferris in alarm  as he spoke the doorknob was turned and then came the tones of a womans voice  let me in tommy     chapter xviii  hal in a tight situation   before dick ferris could say a word or move macklin clapped his hand over the tall boys mouth  hush he muttered ill fix it all right  a square table stood in one corner of the room and under it was a quantity of old bagging  macklin seized hold of hals body and dragged it toward the table  then he shoved the motionless form under the piece of furniture and covered it with the loose bagging  the key to the door lay on the floor and picking it up macklin inserted it in the lock and gave it a turn  in a second the door was opened and a stout and harshlooking woman appeared  it was tommy macklins wife  she was a heavy drinker but she was not a really bad woman at heart  had she been as unscrupulous as macklin himself the tough would never have pursued the course he did  before the woman could enter the room he met her and cut her short  i want you to go upstairs he said taking the market basket she carried from her  she looked surprised  what for  there was a sneakthief around and i want you to see if mary lost anything  a thief did he get  no i didnt give him the chance  the woman at once turned and went up the flight of stairs leading to the top floor she had not seen ferris and the tall boy breathed a sigh of relief as he turned to listen to what macklin had to say  weve got a good chance ter git him out o der way  out of the way whispered ferris  dats wot i said  you dont mean  ferris stopped short  yes i do you say hes an enemy ter you an hardwick  he is that  den id git him outer der way  ferris lip twitched  what would you do with him  ill show yer macklin scratched his matted hair give me dat potato bag in der closet  ferris hesitated and then opening the closet in the corner brought forth an unusually long potato sack  raising up the top part of hals body macklin slipped the sack over head and shoulders then he tied the string of the sack fast around hals waist  the tough opened the door and passed out into the hall way  no one was in sight macklin returned to the room  quick catch him by der legs he said to ferris ill take him by der shoulders an well have him outer sight in a jiffy  wherewhere will you take him faltered ferris his teeth were chattering and his face was as pale as death  ill show yer catch hold  macklins tones were angry ones and ferris complied with the body of hal between them the pair passed down one flight of stairs and then to a narrow stairway in the rear leading to a dirty washshed  wait here wid him till i come back said macklin and he darted out of the washshed door  ferris stood beside hals body presently he thought he heard a low moan and he imagined that hal moved one arm his teeth chattered worse than ever and it was all he could do to keep from rushing away  at length after what seemed to be an age but which was really less than five minutes macklin reappeared  weve got der boss chance he exclaimed in a low tone chuck dat piece of rag carpet over him dats it now pick him up agin  once more the two took up hals body their course was now through the court and into a narrow lane here the snow was piled high but neither seemed to mind it  here we are  it was macklin who spoke he stood at the basement door of an old stone structure which in years gone by had been a vinegar and pickle factory pushing open the door he motioned to ferris and hals body was taken inside and the door once more closed  wait till i strike a light said macklin  what is this place asked ferris  its a factory wot aint in use was the reply his body wont be found here for two or tree months if da finds it at all  macklin struck a match and lit a bit of dirty tallow candle which he carried  see dat big hole in der floor over dare he asked  yes what is it  sum kind of a vat i tink dats der place hold der glim will yer  ferris took the candle his hand shook so that the tallow dropped all over it  wots der matter wid yer nerves asked macklin sarcastically  nothing returned the tall boy briefly  yer shakin like a leaf  i am cold  and for once ferris told the truth an icy chill seemed to have struck his heart  catching hold of hals body macklin dragged it to the edge of the vat there was a slight scraping sound as the body was pushed over the edge of the hole and then all became quiet  dat settles it said macklin come on back  and hal was left to his fate     chapter xix  a narrow escape   hal came to himself with a shiver where was he and what had happened  for a moment he could not collect his scattered senses then the cold water in the vat reached his mouth and nose and he gave a gulp  he put out his hands they were tight in the sack with a struggle he stood up the water in the vat reached his waist and it was icy cold  presently the string of the sack gave way and he pulled the article off of him then he realized what had happened up in the tenement and felt the blood trickling over his forehead  they have put me here thinking i was dead he thought i wonder what sort of a place this is  he stepped around in the water and applied some of it to his head this stopped the flow of blood and appeared to clear his brain  it was semidark in the vat but presently his eyes grew accustomed to this and he saw where he was  he gave a shiver the top of the vat was fully three feet above his reach what if he could not get out he would soon perish from the extreme cold  the vat was some ten or twelve feet in diameter and hal walked around the bottom in hopes of finding some spot higher than that upon which he was standing  in this he was disappointed the bottom of the vat was perfectly level by the time he had discovered this fact he was shivering so he could hardly stand upright  he jumped up several times in hopes of getting out by that means but though his hands once touched the upper edge of the vat he could gain no hold and immediately slipped back again  help help he cried  then he listened there was no reply macklin and ferris had returned to the tenement  im all alone he muttered to himself i will die here and no one will ever know what became of me  this thought filled hal with despair and he again cried out louder than before  the cry went echoing through the vast and gloomy building but there was no response  this will never do thought the youth must i die like a rat in a trap  the very thought was maddening and again he essayed to reach the top of the vat  it was utterly useless  the building must be deserted he said to himself and i suppose it is too far to the street for any one to hear my call  five minutes passed hal was getting weaker fast oh how his head ached  filled with something akin to desperation hal cried out again this time at the very top of his lungs a deep and profound silence followed  its no use he thought this is some old building that no one will visit all winter i suppose ferris and that macklin think  he held his breath what was that sound overhead  he strained his ears yes it was footsteps  help help come down in the cellar he cried  again and again his voice rang out and the footsteps came closer then his heart seemed to stop beating supposing it should be ferris or macklin returning  whats the trouble suddenly cried a voice from the stairs in the corner  help me out of the vat replied hal quick i am freezing to death  wall i swan ejaculated the voice  then came more footsteps and an elderly man carrying a lantern appeared at the edge of the vat  give me your hand he said setting down the lantern this is a nice fix ter git into  he leaned down and hal held up his hand the newcomer grasped the youths wrist and in a moment hal was upon the cellar floor  oh thank you chattered hal iicouldnt have stood it another minute  most froze be you returned the man here strip off that coat of yourn and put on mine thats a most allfired cold bath how did you git in  i was pushed in replied hal he tried to pull off his coat but had not the strength will you help me  of course in a twinkle the man had the coat off and his own on hals shivering form belong around here  no  then come with me i live right across the way and ill soon warm you up its lucky i came over to see if everything was all right im looking after the place till spring  the man took up his lantern once more and led the way up stairs and across the street the two entered a neatlooking tenement and the man took hal to a set of rooms on the second floor  a hot fire was blazing in the kitchen and drawing up a chair the man motioned for hal to sit down  maybe the old woman kin lend you some clothes said the man but i allow as how you may be better off if you let the wet ones dry onto you it may save you from a spell of sickness  i am doing very nicely now replied hal i am used to some pretty tough knocks he added and he spoke the truth for life at the fairham poorhouse had been anything but easy  at that moment the door opened and a girl rushed in she looked at hal and then gave a cry of surprise  hullo what brings you here she asked  whats that put in the man  he saved me from getting a beating said the girl didnt you  hal turned and looked at the girl it was the same that ferris had attacked at the entrance to the alley  he smiled and nodded  it was awful good of you she went on hes a brave man pop  who was going to beat you  the girl gave her version of the affair the man listened attentively and then turned to hal  im doubly glad i did you that service he said katie is my only girl and i dont want her abused may i ask your name  hal carson  mine is mccabe  mccabe cried hal are you jack mccabes father  i am do you know my boy  do i he saved my life only the other night  so it was you he saved exclaimed mccabe  yes  he told me about it it seems you have enemies  yes  and they are the ones who pushed you into the vat  one of them did aided by a chum  you have been struck on the head here let me bind it up i suppose you are in no hurry to go  no sir  mccabe brought out a handkerchief and a strip of cloth and bound up the wound which was but a slight one  you ought to have the pair of them arrested he said  i have my reasons for not doing so replied hal but you may rest assured their time will come  they must be villains  they are but mr mccabe let me thank you for what you have done  oh dont say a word  i shall never forget it but for you i might at this moment be dead  i only hope you down the rascals every one of them now i must go and finish looking after the place come along katie well be back in quarter of an hour you had better take off your shoes and warm your feet in the oven  thank you  mccabe and his daughter departed after they were gone hal locked the door and took off part of his clothing and also did as the man had advised  the roaring fire soon dried the clothing and warmed hal through and through as soon as he heard mccabes footsteps on the stairs he rearranged his toilet  katie says she saw the fellow that wanted to hit her down in the street just now said mccabe  hal jumped up  which way did he go  over toward park row  the youth thought for a moment  mr mccabe  what is it mr carson  will you do me a great favor  lets hear what it is  please keep the fact that you saved me a secret  a secret cried the old watchman in considerable astonishment  yes sir  what for  i have my reasons for it  the villains that attacked you ought to be punished they ought to be in the hands of the police this blessed minute  you are right ordinarily speaking but i have work to do before i have them locked up  well ill do as you say  you see i want to have them believe that i am really done for  i see  if they think that i can follow them up wherever they go quite easily  i dont see how if they see yer  i will be disguised  oh goin ter play a kind of detective part be you  that is what it amounts to i suppose  its a great plan mr carson you have a long head on yer shoulders  and the old man chuckled  thank you then i can depend or you to  i wont say a blessed word  and please caution katie  all right i will sir  thank you  but when you get through ill expect to learn how you come out said mccabe hastily  you can rest assured that i will let you know the full particulars and i am not going to forget what you have done for me either  shoo thats all right and say  at that moment katie came flying into the apartment her tangled hair floating in all directions  hes downstairs and coming up she cried shrilly  who questioned her father while hal stood still in wonder  the tall boy who hit me  dick ferris muttered hal under his breath what can he want here     chapter xx  following allen   hal was astonished to learn from katie mccabe that dick ferris was coming up the tenement stairs  he cant be coming here exclaimed the youth  what shall we do if he does asked mccabe  i dont know perhaps i had better hide he may  at that instant came a knock on the door  its him whispered katie  andy mccabe the father pointed to a closet hal tiptoed his way to it and motioned for katie to follow the door was closed and then andy mccabe answered the summons  ferris stood at the door his hair disheveled and his lips trembling  may i ask who lives here he asked  my name is mccabe  isnt there a man by the name of macklin living here went on ferris  macklin repeated mccabe slowly  yes tommy macklin  not as i know on what does he do  i dont know i have a letter to deliver to him so you dont know where he lives  no sir  its too bad will you please tell me what time it is  andy mccabe glanced at the alarm clock that stood on the mantelshelf  quarter to six  as late as that cried ferris i must hurry and catch him before six only quarter of an hour goodday sir  goodday  in a moment ferris was gone mccabe closed the door and hal came out of the closet followed by katie  what does he mean questioned the man  ill tell you what it means said hal he is trying to prove an alibi in case a body was found in the vat he thinks you can remember he was here looking for macklin at quarter to six if that was true how could he have helped macklin at five oclock  well well hes a smart villain so he is exclaimed andy mccabe i wonder what he would have done if you had stepped out of the closet  i was strongly tempted to do that laughed hal but now i must be off mr mccabe please keep quiet as i told you  i will mr carson but where be you going  to follow ferris say have you an old slouch hat you will exchange for this cap of mine  here is one of jacks  that will do firstrate  hal put on the hat and drew it down over his brow  going to turn spy be you remarked andy mccabe  yes  well i wish you luck  hal was soon out of the house once in the street he looked up and down  ferris was not in view but he soon caught sight of the fellow coming out of a tenement across the way he crossed over and followed ferris toward park row and then to the boarding house  here hal heard the youth say something to his aunt about changing his clothing and the boy slipped into the house unobserved by anyone and did likewise ferris then left again followed by hal  i suppose he thinks he has laid good groundwork for his alibi thought hal well let him think so he will be surprised before long to learn the truth  at fourteenth street dick ferris turned and walked toward broadway hal followed close behind but in the crowd at the corner he lost track of the fellow he was after  he looked this way and that and into the restaurants but ferris had disappeared  what was to do next it was past suppertime but hal was in no humor for eating  suddenly somebody brushed him rudely it was a man wearing a heavy cape coat hal glanced at the individual sharply and was astonished to see it was mr caleb allen  allen had not seen hal and the boy at once placed himself where he was not likely to be noticed  i wonder if he and ferris met thought hal it isnt likely but yet it may be so the three of them are into this and so is that fellow macklin i must be careful and keep my eyes wide open  allen passed up union square on the west side and hal made it a point to follow close behind  arriving at seventeenth street allen turned down toward the north river he passed over several blocks and finally ascended the steps of a small mansion on the left  the front of the mansion was totally dark but when the door was opened hal saw that the interior was brilliantly illuminated  as soon as allen passed in the door was closed and all became as dark as before hal hesitated and then ascending the steps looked for a doorplate  there was the number in bright silver numerals but nothing was to be seen of any name  most of them have a name he said to himself i wonder who lives here  hal descended again to the street and walked on to the end of the block  here was a small stand with a flaring gasoline torch at which an old german was selling apples and other fruit  hal entered into conversation with the proprietor of the stand and at length asked if he knew who lived at the place mentioning the number  dot blace the man gave a low laugh i dinks me nopody vos lif dere  nobody  nein  but there must be somebody urged hal i saw a man go in  dots so too the german laughed again but da dont vos lif dere  well what are they doing there then  the apple man put his long finger up beside his nose  dot vos a blace ver dere rich fool vos plow in his money see  a gamblingplace  oxactly  who runs it  dot i dont vos know i dinks me a fellow named ditson  do many men go there  yah somedimes so many as two dozen by von night  and they do nothing there but gamble  the german nodded of you got some money you dont vont to kept dots der blace to lose it  thank you but i need all i have laughed hal  den you dont better keep away aint it  i think that would be best  dake mine vort it vos  did you see many men go in tonight  vot you ask dot for hey  im looking for a man i know  i seen nine or ten men go in by dere front door i dont vos know how many go py der pack  then there is a back door  yah on der next street  i see well i guess i wont wait for the man  hal walked back slowly and passed the house what should he do next would it be worth while to track allen farther at present  suddenly an idea popped into his mind farther up the street he had passed a costumers establishment where everything in the shape of a makeup for detective or actor was to be had  he walked back to the place and entered it back of the counter stood a young who came up and asked what was wished  can i get a small black mustache cheap asked hal  we have them for twentyfive cents  will they stay on  yes if you adjust them properly  then let me have one  the clerk brought forth the false mustache and helped hal to put it on the youth looked in a mirror at the effect  changes me completely he said  it does sir makes you look five years older too  here is your money  the clerk took hals quarter and the boy walked forth from the place without taking the trouble to remove the mustache once outside he could not help but laugh  i am certainly going into the detective business and no mistake he thought i trust i am successful in what i undertake to do  hal walked back toward the gamblinghouse and after some hesitation ascended the stone steps and rang the bell  a negro answered his summons  is mr arnold here asked the lad as coolly as he could  mr arnold the negro shook his head  but he must be persisted hal he said he was coming here  dont tink i see him sah what kind ob a lookin genmen he is  about medium built with a dark mustache replied hal i have important news for him he said he was going to try his luck here tonight  i see sah den you knows dis place sah  oh yes  come in sah  hal entered and the door was closed and locked behind him  now you kin go upstairs an see if de genmen am here said the negro he might be yo know an i not know his name sah  all right ill take a look around replied hal     chapter xxi  in a dangerous place   hal felt that his situation was a delicate one and that he must go slow were it discovered that he had entered the den of vice merely for the purpose of spying it might go hard with him  the negro waved his hand toward the thickly carpeted stairway and hal ascended to the second floor of the mansion  he looked behind to see if the negro had followed but that burly individual had disappeared  the upper hallway was as dark as below but from under several doors a bright light was streaming  hal approached the first one he came to and removing his hat tried the handle  the door came open and hal peered into the apartment  no one was present but a young man asleep in an armchair and hal stepped inside  the room was gorgeously furnished costly rugs covering the floor and heavy curtains hanging over the doors on the walls were beautiful paintings and on a stand to one side of the room rested a remarkable piece of statuary representing three jolly gamblers at the gamingtable  it must be some sort of a waitingroom thought hal i wonder who the fellow asleep in the chair is  he gave a slight cough and the young man slowly opened his eyes  did anybody call me he asked in a heavy tone  where is the playingroom please asked hal  eh playingroom repeated the young man go right in the next room  he pointed with his finger and bowing hal did as directed  the sight that met hals eyes as he opened the door filled the youth with wonder he had often heard of such places but he had never dreamed of them being as they are he saw a long hall brilliantly lighted crowded about the table some standing and some sitting were young men and old all intent on the games that were going on  the table was piled with money which seemed to change hands rapidly for the resort was a wellknown one among club men  what do you make it  a twenty charley  hal recognized the last voice it was that of mr caleb allen  the boy looked at the man there was an excited appearance upon the brokers features  he looks as if he has been losing thought hal i wonder how much he has staked  no one appeared to notice his coming and he stood just back of the crowd taking in everything so far as it concerned allen  the game went on and allen lost then the broker played once more and lost again  a hundred this time he said  the broker played with extreme caution as indeed did all of the others in consequence the game lasted fully quarter of an hour  hal saw by the brokers actions that the game was going against the man and he was not surprised when the play ended to hear that allen had lost  allen turned away from the table as he did so he came face to face with hal he started back and gave the youth a keen look  where have i met that fellow before he muttered to himself  he had not recognized hal with the false mustache  the game went on but allen took no more interest and soon disappeared from the room  hal was about to follow when a tall man stepped up to him and tapped him on the shoulder  i want to have a talk with you my friend he said in a low tone come this way please  somewhat astonished the youth followed the man into a side apartment  what is it he asked  i want to know what your game is was the cool response you havent put up a cent and that mustache of yours is false i have an idea you are a spy     chapter xxii  hal meets laura sumner   hal was somewhat taken aback by the statement made to him by one of the proprietors of the resort he had entered but he quickly recovered  it is true the mustache is false but it is not true that i am spying upon you he said  and this was true for he cared nothing as to what took place in the resort so long as it did not appertain to mr allen or hardwick  thats easy enough to say but how can you prove it was the short reply  is it necessary to prove it returned hal just as quickly  well the case is just here we dont want spies around here  hal could not help but smile  do you know how i learned of this resort he asked  one of the dudes who didnt know how to keep his mouth shut told you i suppose  no an old applestand fellow told me  is that true  it is so if the police wanted to stop you they could easily do so  the proprietor muttered something under his breath  well you are sure you dont intend to give us away then  i do not  what brought you  curiosity concerning a fellow who played here  what fellow  mr caleb allen  what the man who just left  yes  are you spotting him  excuse me but thats my business he has gone and with your permission i will follow him  the man looked at hal for a second in silence  ill trust you for you have the right kind of eyes you are following allen for a purpose but thats none of my affair when you go just forget all about this place unless you want to come in some time and try a hand  thank you i dont gamble and without another word hal left the room and hurried down stairs  a hasty look into the various rooms convinced him that allen had left the building and then hal lost no time in doing likewise  what he had seen disgusted him beyond measure  how men can stay up all night and gamble in a place like that i cant understand he murmured to himself i would rather be in bed and asleep and it stands to reason the proprietors have the best of it otherwise how could they run such a gorgeous house  hal was soon on the snowcovered pavement  he looked up and down but allen was nowhere in sight  it is no use to try to follow him any farther tonight thought the youth i may as well get home and get some sleepbut no i cant do that i must find a new boarding house and go under a different name for the present one thing is sure mr allen cant gamble in that fashion with what he makes honestly he and hardwick are a couple of deep rogues and thats all there is to it and dick ferris and that macklin are their tools  it was now too late to hunt up a regular boarding place and upon second thought hal resolved for the present to put up at one of the cheap hotels  this he did and slept soundly until morning  when he slouched into the office at ten oclock still wearing the false mustache and jack mccabes hat mr sumner did not at first recognize him  what do you want he asked from the bookkeepers desk where he was busy instructing the new man in his work  i wish to see you in private sir was hals reply and he winked  for a second mr sumner was puzzled then he smiled and led the way to his private office  hal i hardly knew you he burst out the instant the door was closed  i hardly know myself mr sumner was the youths reply  the mustache is almost a complete disguise  i have news for you mr allen was not in philadelphia yesterday  no where then  he spent a great part of the time in the evening in a gamblinghouse uptown  you are certain  yes sir i followed him into the place and watched him play  humph did he win  no sir he lost heavily  horace sumner gave something like a groan  i am being deceived on all sides he said if a man is a gambler he is often something worse how about hardwick  i have reason to believe he went home last night he gave a note to dick ferris and i followed ferris it nearly cost me my life  and hal related the particulars horace sumner listened with keen interest when he learned how hal had been struck down and afterward found himself in the icy vat he shuddered  that will never do he cried hal you must give up running such risks i would not have you lose your life for all the bonds in new york we will call in one of the regular detectives and  no mr sumner i started on my theory and i wish to finish the work i did not know how desperate the men were with whom i have to deal but in the future i shall be prepared for them and i wish to ask a favor  what is it  will you advance me a little money i may need it in traveling around and my disguises may cost  you shall have what you please hal you are the only one i have in the office to depend on and you are doing a remarkable work for one so young  if you will let me have say ten or fifteen dollars  here are fifty returned mr sumner handing over five crisp tendollar bills when you need more let me know  butbut i wont want this much gasped hal  yes you will if you are determined to go ahead dont let dollars stand in the way why i have already spent one hundred and fifty dollars on the detectives and they have done absolutely nothing  without another word hal pocketed the bills as he did so there was a knock on the door then it was flung open and a girl rushed in  she was apparently a year or two younger than hal and had blue eyes light hair and a remarkably pretty face she rushed up to mr sumner and kissed him  oh papa why didnt you tell me she burst out with something like a sob in her voice  tell you what pet asked mr sumner with a shadow on his face  about all those bonds being gone lucy cavaler mentioned it to me this morning when i called on her to go shopping have you got them back  not yet pet  and who stole them  i dont know this young man and i have just been trying to find out  the girl turned to hal who took off his hat bowed and then blushed furiously  this is mr hal carson one of my employees went on mr sumner hal this is my daughter laura  laura sumner extended her hand and hal took it their eyes met and from that instant the two were friends  you are trying to help papa find the stolen bonds she said  yes miss sumner  he has done some excellent work on the case said mr sumner he is disguised now as you can see he added with a faint smile which made poor hal blush again  oh i trust you get the bonds back for papa cried laura if you do ill be friends with you for life  its a whacki mean a bargain returned hal and then both laughed  but you havent told me why you did not mention the matter to me papa went on laura turning to horace sumner  i did not wish to worry you pet since your mother died you have had enough on your shoulders running the household  and havent you had more than your share papa with troubles in the office and trying to find a trace of baby howard  i have given up all hopes of ever learning of the fate of my little boy sighed mr sumner and as he spoke a tear stole down his cheek which he hastily brushed away     chapter xxiii  hals bold scheme   hal could not help but feel a keen interest in the conversation between mr sumner and his daughter evidently there was some deep family sorrow behind the words that had been uttered  he stood respectfully by until laura turned to him suddenly  excuse me but i suppose i interrupted you when i came in  no i had about finished replied hal you have no further instructions he continued turning to mr sumner  no save that you must keep from trouble hal  i will keep my eyes open sir  then that is all  for the present you will get along without me in the office i hope  yes the new bookkeeper is a very rapid man and we shall not attempt to do anything more until mr allen and i dissolve partnership  then i will go goodday miss sumner and with a deep bow hal withdrew  what a nice young man murmured laura as the outer door closed  he is little more than a boy pet said her father that mustache he wears is a false one  why papa  he is playing a part he is a very smart young man  i am glad to hear it where did you meet him  it was he who saved my life the night i told you of  indeed that was grand of him but papa lauras voice grew serious these missing bondsare they goinggoing to ruin you  horace sumner turned away  if they are not recovered yes he answered in a low tone  my poor papa  they are worth seventynine thousand dollars and that coupled with some bad investments made through allen will send me to the wall  can nothing be done to get the bonds back  i am doing everything i can besides carson there are two regular detectives from the department on the case and a private man from the agency  then all together ought to bring in a good result  we will hope for the best laura said the old broker bravely  if you do not recover the bonds cannot you get outside help to tide over the crisis  i could have done so years ago but i find that i made a big mistake in going into partnership with caleb allen while many are willing to help me individually they do not trust allen and therefore will not now assist me  is mr allen then such a bad man  i dont know how bad he is he is in with hardwick so carson says and hardwick is a villain  at the mention of the exbookkeepers name laura drew herself up  i never liked him papa and i am glad to find that you have discovered his true character  horace sumner looked in surprise at his daughter  why pet i do not understand you  then let me tell you something for the past two months mr hardwick has been paying his addresses to me and  laura  yes its so i did not mention it to you because i did not wish to humiliate him i told him there was no hope for him and asked him to drop the matter  and has the villain done so  partly but he frequently follows me about when he gets the chance and i do not like it  if he does so in the future ill cowhide him cried horace sumner but i have discovered his true character and sent him off and in the future i imagine he will not dare approach you  if he does not i will be thankful papa  horace sumner passed his hand over his brow and heaved a deep sigh  everything seems to go wrong of late years he said the disappearance of little howard has undermined my whole prosperity  and you have given up looking for him questioned laura  yes what is the use i have had detectives on the case for years and it has cost me thousands of dollars  and they have learned nothing  nothing further than that a man took the child to philadelphia  they could not trace him in that city  no the halfdecomposed body of a man was found a month later in the schuylkill river and the detectives thought it must be his remains  but there was no child with him  no nor had the police seen anything of the little one  howard must be dead said laura softly and her blue eyes filled with tears  i am afraid so returned the father and then the subject changed  meanwhile hal had left the outer office and hurried up nassau street in the direction of park row on a previous visit to this vicinity he had noticed a firstclass costumers establishment where everything in the shape of a disguise could be bought  at the door he hesitated for a moment and then entered with a brisk step  a fat pleasantlooking man came to wait on him  i wish to obtain a perfect disguise hal explained something for my face besides some clothing  yes sir what sort of a character  a young business man  please step this way  hal stepped to the rear of the establishment here fully half an hour was spent in selecting this thing and that and trying the effect before the mirror  at last the business was finished and hal came forth looking for all the world like a spruce clerk of twenty or twentytwo he wore a silken mustache and small muttonchop whiskers and the color of his skin was several shades paler than was natural  the cheap suit and overcoat he had worn were cast aside and a nobby check outfit took their place  gracious i hardly know myself he murmured this ought to deceive almost anybody  hal had only rented the things he was to pay two dollars a day for them besides leaving a deposit of forty dollars for their safe return  when this transaction was finished the youth visited a hardware store and there bought a pistol and some cartridges  now i imagine i am ready for them he said to himself although i sincerely hope i will not have occasion to draw the pistol  once out on the sidewalk hal did not know exactly how to proceed he was about to take an elevated train to allens house uptown when looking toward the entrance to the brooklyn bridge he caught sight of dick ferris standing at the foot of the elevated railroad stairs smoking his usual cigarette  hal approached him and then passed by ferris looked at him but not the faintest gleam of recognition passed over his features  he is deceived at any rate thought hal i wonder if he is waiting for somebody or merely hanging around i think i will remain for a while and find out  hal crossed park row and took up a stand by the railing to city hall park a gang of men were clearing off the snow and the streetcars and wagons were running in all directions making the scene a lively one  presently an elevated train rolled in at the station and in a moment a stream of people came down the stairs on both sides of the street  hal saw ferris straighten up and keep his eyes on the crowd  that settles it he is looking for somebody was hals mental conclusion now ill wait and see if it isnt hardwick  the crowd passed by ferris had met no one and he resumed his old stand and puffed away as before  presently another train rolled in again ferris watched out in a moment he had halted a man wrapped up in an immense ulster and with his hat pulled far down over his eyes  hal once more crossed the street he passed ferris and saw that the man the tall boy had stopped was caleb allen  hal was surprised at this he was under the impression that allen used the sixth avenue elevated to come down from his home had the broker spent the night away from home instead of going to that place after leaving the gambling den  standing not over fifteen feet away hal saw ferris talk earnestly to allen for fully five minutes then the broker put his hand in his vest pocket and passed over several bank bills this was followed by a small package from his overcoat pocket which the tall boy quickly placed in his breast  i wonder what that package contains mused hal as the two separated  allen continued on the way downtown calling a cab for that purpose hal felt certain the broker was going to the office so there was no use of following him for the present  he turned to ferris and saw the tall youth stride up park row and then turn into a side street  is it possible he is going to see macklin again was hals comment  such seemed to be ferris purpose and it left hal in perplexity as to whether he should follow or not  then he thought of his mission and a bold plan came into his mind  i will follow he said to himself the only way to get at the bottom of the tin box mystery is to learn of all the plans this band of evildoers form     chapter xxiv  hal in a new role   instead of continuing toward the east river dick ferris soon turned northward and presently reached grand street  this neighborhood was entirely new to hal and he was at once satisfied that the tall boy was not going to pay a visit to tommy macklin  passing down grand street ferris presently came to a tall white building with a large open hallway the entrance to which was covered on either side with signs  entering the hallway ferris mounted the stairs to the third floor and then passed to a small office in the rear  hal was not far behind and he had no difficulty in locating the apartment ferris entered  the upper part of the office door contained a groundglass panel upon which was painted in black letters          robert e hamilton     fine law and blank printing  for a second hal studied how to get into the place but soon an idea struck him and he lost no time in entering  he saw ferris in earnest conversation at a small counter which ran across the office which was narrow but quite deep hal edged up and listened to what passed between the tall youth and a man in charge  ferris had a number of slips in his hand and these the proprietor was examining with great care  you wish all of them duplicated he asked  yes replied dick ferris  its a nice piece of work  i suppose it is but the firm is willing to pay for it  who are the blanks for  mr albert schwartz but i am to call for them  i do not know the gentleman  i will leave a deposit on the work replied ferris promptly  oh all right and how many of each of these blanks do you want  twenty of each  what no more  no next year we are going to have an entirely new set if you do these right mr schwartz says he may give you the new work  ill do them in the best style how soon do you want them  as soon as possible we are in a great hurry for them  in two days do  oh yes  very well they will cost thirtysix dollars  as much as that  yes i will have to take my workmen from another job and we always charge a little more for a rush  how much of a deposit shall i leave  five dollars will do  then here you are  dick ferris pulled a fivedollar bill from his pocket and after receiving his receipt walked out of the office  he glanced at hal as he passed but our heros back was turned to him and hal seemed to be interested in some prints which hung upon the wall  now sir what can i do for you questioned the proprietor turning to hal  he left the slips ferris had brought lying upon the counter  i would like to know how much you charge for printing wedding invitations replied hal approaching the counter where the slips lay  wedding invitations eh the proprietor smiled here is a young man about to get married he thought by his looks i think he wants something rather nice  yes sir said hal  with an engraved plate i suppose  of course  ill show you our book of specimens  the man turned away to where a number of books were lying upon a side desk as he did so hal carelessly picked up the slips ferris had left and examined them  he could make nothing of them excepting that one had the words bonds of the second class receivable printed across its face and another sumner allen  co transfer slip of limited calls december  here you are said the man coming up with one of the books and he gathered up the slips and put them away with a memorandum  hal looked over the book and noted down the prices of several styles of invitations  i do not want to order he said i merely wanted the prices  very well glad to see you at any time returned the man  once down in the street again hal looked up and down but could see nothing of ferris  but when the youth reached grand street he beheld ferris making for downtown as rapidly as his long legs would carry him  i suppose he is going to stand outside and meet mr allen when he comes out thought hal i will follow him and see what turns up next  dick ferris walked up grand street until he came to broadway here he stood upon the corner and presently waved his hand toward a passing horsecar  immediately a man descended from the car and came toward the tall youth it was hardwick  hullo this cant be a chance meeting said hal to himself no wonder ferris hurried to the corner he almost missed his man  as hardwick stepped from the street to the sidewalk he glanced toward where hal was standing gazing into a shop window then he turned to ferris and the two began an earnest conversation  hal passed the pair but did not catch a word of what was said nor did the young watcher notice dick ferris quick nervous look in his direction  a few minutes later hardwick and ferris walked back down grand street reaching chrystie they turned into it and walked along several blocks until they came to a narrow alley leading to a lumberyard  both passed into the lumberyard and out of hals sight wondering what had become of them the boy passed the place  no one was in sight  thats queer i wonder if they entered that building in the rear  for fully ten minutes hal hung around but neither hardwick nor ferris put in an appearance  a wagon was leading up on one side of the yard but presently this drove off and then all became quiet  watching his chance when he thought no one was observing him hal entered the gate of the lumberyard and hurried down to the building in the rear  there was a window beside the door to the place and hal gazed inside  an elderly man was present he was seated beside a hot stove toasting his shins and reading a morning paper  they didnt enter the office thats certain said hal to himself now where did they go  suddenly he stopped short was it possible that hardwick and ferris had discovered that they were being followed and had slipped through the lumberyard merely to throw him off the scent  it certainly looks like it thought hal ill sneak around the back way and see what i can discover  back of the office were great piles of lumber all thickly covered with snow among them could plainly be seen the footsteps of two people the marks were fresh and led along the back fence and then to the right  hal followed the marks among the piles of lumber until he came to a spot where all became mixed as if some one had retraced his steps  as he paused examining the tracks he heard a noise behind him and turning he found himself confronted by hardwick  i want to know what you are following me about for demanded the man savagely     chapter xxv  hals escape from hardwick   hal could not help but shrink back as hardwick advanced  did you hear what i said demanded the man after a second of silence  i did replied hal in a disguised voice he did not know whether or not hardwick had discovered his real identity and he intended to run no risk in the matter  then answer me  supposing i refuse to do so  it wont help you fumed hardwick i know perfectly well who you are  you do cried hal and he was taken aback by the exbookkeepers words  exactly you are one of those mighty smart detectives old sumner has employed to shadow me  hal could not help but breathe a sigh of relief his identity was still a secret  aint i right went on hardwick seeing the youth did not reply  i decline to answer replied hal firmly  oh you do sneered hardwick  i do  then you understand ive got you in a corner  i understand nothing of the sort  supposing i should pull out my pistol  you wont dare to do so  and pray why how do i know but what you are not a footpad cried hardwick getting angry at hals apparent coolness  because a shot might bring others to the spot said the youth bravely  no one is around  you forget that in new york detectives often travel in pairs  it was a random remark but it told hardwick turned pale and shifted uneasily  youre a cool customer he said eyeing hal sharply  detectives have to be cool  you wont gain anything by following me  i havent said that i was following you  but you have admitted that you are a detective and that amounts to the same thing  perhaps it does and perhaps it doesnt  as hal spoke he looked around for dick ferris the tall youth was nowhere to be seen  what are you looking for  thats my business  come dont get cheeky  then dont question me  hardwicks eyes flashed fire a dark look of hatred came into his face and he made a spring forward  ill teach you a lesson he hissed  stand back cried hal stand back or take the consequence  hardly had hal spoken the words when a sudden shadow caused him to glance upward  it was well that he did so  on a large pile of lumber stood dick ferris and in his hands he held a heavy beam which he was just on the point of letting fall upon hals head  the boy had barely time enough to spring to one side when with a boom the beam came down and buried itself in the snow  you mean coward cried the youth wait till i catch you  he made a dash to the side of the pile which was arranged like steps intending to mount to where ferris stood  as he did so hardwick shouted something to the tall boy and then leaped the fence of the lumberyard and ran out on the side street  ferris could not see hal now but he understood what hardwick said and as hal mounted to the top of the pile the tall boy got down and let himself drop off the edge  he landed in the deep snow and was not hurt in the least before hal could discover his flight he was over the fence and on his way to join hardwick  it took hal but a minute to learn of the direction the two escaping evildoers had taken and then he made after them with all possible speed  but the pursuit was a useless one and at the end of several blocks hal gave it up and dropped into a walk  what was best to do next hal revolved the question in his mind a number of times and then without wasting time made his way back to the costumers establishment  i wish my disguise changed he said  what already said the proprietor in astonishment  yes something has happened since i was here and now i wish you to fix me up differently  but the same sort of a character  yes  then supposing i give you a different colored mustache and a beard for those side whiskers  that will do if you will also change this suit and overcoat  certainly  the exchange was quickly made and looking like an entirely different person hal left the costumers and hurried down to wall street  making sure that no one but the new bookkeeper and mr sumner were about the place he entered  thats a splendid disguise said the old broker when the two were alone  its the second ive had today said hal  the second  yes since i saw you last ive had quite a few adventures  of what nature hal i trust you had no more trouble  it didnt amount to much  and sitting down hal related all that had occurred  dick ferris must be a very wicked boy remarked the broker when hal had finished but about these slips that he is going to have printed are you positive mr allen gave them to him  no sir but i think he did he gave ferris something and some money and ferris lost no time in getting to the printing establishment  humph mr sumner mused for a moment i can hardly believe it even though the evidence seems plain enough  what are the slips asked hal with considerable curiosity  they are of the kind which we use in our daily business since mr allen and myself agreed to end our limited partnership i have kept the regular slips in my safe formerly they were in hardwicks charge where both of us could have easy access to them but nowwell to be plain i allow no business to be conducted unless under my supervision  and that is right mr sumner  now if mr allen is really having these extra slips printed it would seem as if hehe  intended to make use of them without consulting you finished hal bluntly  yes  he is none too good for that sir but wasnt he here this morning  yes we had a very stormy interview he is angry because i discharged hardwick and would not believe me when i said hardwick was a defaulter  thats part of his plan  you may be right hal you are a wonderful boy as i was saying we had a stormy interview and i doubt if he spends a great deal of time here during the remaining days of our partnership  the partnership ends on new years day doesnt it  that was the day set but by mutual agreement we have made the date the twentieth of december  why that is day after tomorrow  yes  the day the slips are to be finished  so it is  no wonder ferris wished them as soon as possible  horace sumner arose and walked up and down the office  if there is to be any crooked work in the matter of the slips i will take good care to head it off i might be swindled out of thousands of dollars in that way  you will look over the genuine slips i suppose  i will in the presence of the new bookkeeper and another witness there shall be no underhanded work in the matter i believe you are altogether right hal i have been surrounded by villains and they would pluck me to the end if i but gave them the chance     chapter xxvi  hal obtains another situation   for a moment there was silence and then horace sumner stopped short before hal  there is another matter i might mention he said caleb allen is going or rather has gone into business for himself  what kind of business asked the youth in surprise  a brokerage and loan office  near here  yes right around the corner of broad street not five minutes walk he hired the place from the first and i understand he and another man are already doing business there  who is the other man  a fellow named parsons  has he a good reputation  far from it he was arrested for forgery five years ago but his friends hushed the matter up  have you the number of the place  yes here it is what do you intend to do  i dont know ill take a look at the place that will do no harm perhaps hardwick will call on mr allen  after a few words more hal left the private office and passed out on wall street  he soon turned the corner into broad street the second great money center of new york and presently came to the building in which was situated the offices now occupied by the firm of allen  parsons  the offices were down three steps and as hal passed on the pavement above a small sign pasted in the corner of the window attracted his attention       young man wanted rapid writer  stopping short hal descended the steps and peered into the window a middleaged man stood at the front desk smoking a cigar and writing  that must be either mr parsons or a bookkeeper thought hal  then a sudden determination sprang up in his mind without a second thought he entered the office and walked up to the desk  the man looked up and laid down his cigar  well sir what is it he asked in a pleasant voice  is this one of the proprietors  yes i am mr parsons  i see you want a young man sir  we do most of the pleasantness vanished and a sharp look came to the mans face you are looking for a situation  yes sir  are you a good writer  i will show you my hand sir  all right here is paper and ink write a sheetful as rapidly as you can do so in good style  hal took up the pen he was really a rapid writer and in five minutes the job was done parsons looked at the work  that might do have you any recommendations  no sir i am a stranger in new york  ah a stranger a certain pleased look came into the brokers eyes whats your idea of salary  i hardly know i must support myself  all alone  yes sir  parsons appeared better pleased than ever  just the kind of a fellow allen and i want he muttered to himself  i will give you a trial on seven dollars a week and if you suit i will raise you to eight  thank you sir  what is your name  frank hallen replied hal using the cognomen of one of his poorhouse associates  very well hallen are you ready to go to work at once  yes sir  then come inside  hal walked behind the railing and parsons showed him where to place his coat and hat  here is a copy of a letter i wish duplicated ten times you can go to work at this second desk at one oclock you can take half an hour for lunch  yes sir  hal gathered his material about him and went to work as if his very life depended on it  he seems to be an awfully shrewd man he thought meaning parsons i wonder what he would say if he knew i had taken the job merely as a blind  he could not help but smile to himself and parsons saw the smile but misinterpreted it  he feels good over dropping into a situation i suppose he muttered well if hes a stranger in new york and alone he is probably just the fellow for allens work it wont do to have a chap around who is too well acquainted  hal had made four copies of the letter when the front door opened and caleb allen entered  the broker looked rather surprised when he saw hal but he did not recognize the youth and hal drew a deep sigh of relief  got a clerk eh said allen to his new partner  yes replied parsons hallen this is mr allen your other employer  hal bowed then allen turned to an office in the rear and parsons immediately followed him  the door which was partly of ground glass was tightly closed  hal waited for an instant and then leaving the desk tiptoed his way to the rear  by listening intently he could just catch what was said  you say he is a stranger in new york were the first words he heard coming from allen  yes  humph he will have a job finding his way around im thinking  he looks bright enough i thought it would be better than to hire somebody who knew too much about financial matters here returned parsons  thats so cried allen a good idea has samuels called yet  no  he ought to be here by this time  samuels is always slow but tell me how did you make out over at the old place  we had a deuce of a racket exclaimed allen savagely since hardwick was found out sumner has watched me like a cat  of course you didnt give him any satisfaction  not much but i can tell you i had to talk mighty smooth to keep things down  how about dissolving  the affair comes off on the twentieth  what can you get ready by that time  luckily yes  are you going to do as i suggested about those slips  yes i was just after the boy who ordered them for me and he says they are to be done in two days sure it wont take an hour to fix them up after i get them  nothing like being a slick penman caleb  and parsons chuckled  hush that new man might hear you  thats so but i fancy hes rather green in spite of the fact that he wants to appear like a new yorker  if hes green so much the better now about this business with samuels do you think he can be trusted  yes i know samuels thoroughly and besides i have a hold on him  a good hold  i could send him to prison if i wished  and he will undertake to work off the bonds in chicago  i believe so but he wants big pay  how much  twenty per cent  twenty per cent cried allen is he crazy  he says he will run a big risk  any more than hardwick and i ran in obtaining them  no indeed perhaps you can make him come down  i certainly shall hardwick hasnt shown up has he  no do you expect him  yes  is it prudent old sumner may have his detectives around  i thought of that and wrote to hardwick about it hereafter he will disguise himself and  hal heard no more the front door opened and a stranger hurried in     chapter xxvii  hal plays a daring part   hal lost no time in confronting the newcomer  is mr parsons in asked the stranger  yes sir  tell him mr samuels is here  i will sir  hal walked back and knocked on the rear office door  come said allen  a mr samuels to see mr parsons said the youth  show him in  mr samuels was conducted to the rear office and once more the door was tightly closed  hal was slightly disturbed had the newcomer caught him listening in the back or had he taken no notice  the only way to learn was to remain where he had been before and this the youth did  well samuels on hand i see said parsons mr allen just came in  then we can come to business without delay replied samuels  he was a smallfaced jew with eyes that appeared to be more than half closed as he spoke he drew up a chair close to where the other two were sitting  say he went on who is the young fellow outside  our new clerk  can you trust him  i think so why  he might overhear what was said  he wont if you dont talk too loud  very well  hold on put in allen parsons send him off to mail some letters  the junior partner at once walked outside and taking up a bunch of letters handed them to hal  mail these he said and then you can go to lunch  yes sir  hal at once put on his overcoat and hat and walked out with the letters he wished he could have remained in the office for he felt certain the conversation about to ensue would be a most important one  he dropped the letters into the nearest box and then stood undecided what to do next  mr allen has those bonds thats certain he said to himself i wonder if it would do any good to notify the police  but this plan did not appear to be just the right one if arrested allen would of course deny any knowledge of the stolen property and all the proof hal had was his own word and that might not go very far in a court of law  no the only thing to do is to find those bonds and get them back myself he muttered perhaps allen only has part of them and hardwick the other part besides i have not yet learned what macklin and ferris have to do with the case  he knew there was a window in the back of the rear office this was tightly closed so it would be of no use to attempt to hear anything from that direction  at last hal took his stand opposite the entrance to the office he had hardly done so when parsons and samuels came out and hurried up the street at the top of their walking powers  something is up thought hal shall i follow them or remain behind with allen  he knew if he wished to keep his place as clerk he ought to go back soon he hesitated and then decided to remain so procuring a sandwich and an apple he munched them down and then walked in  caleb allen looked at him darkly as he entered but said nothing and hanging up his coat and hat hal resumed the copying of the letter  half an hour later a tall man came in he was well dressed and wore a heavy black mustache and beard  he glanced at hal and then walked over to where allen sat at a desk writing a letter  i want to see you in private he said in a low tone  the voice of the stranger sounded strangely familiar to hal where had he heard it before  allen looked perplexed for an instant and then seemed to comprehend the situation he at once led the way to the office in the rear the stranger entered and the door was once more tightly closed  our young hero at once left off writing and tiptoed his way back an idea had struck him concerning the strangers identity and the first words from behind the thin partition proved that he was correct  so you have donned the disguise hardwick were allens words  yes deuce take the luck i was forced to do it  you got my letter advising it  i did but that wasnt what brought me to it i was followed by one of old sumners detectives  ha did he discover anything  not from me but im afraid he did in another direction  allen turned pale and shifted uneasily  what way he exclaimed hoarsely  i am pretty well satisfied the same fellow followed ferris to the establishment where you are having those bogus bills printed  and what did he learn  i am not sure he really followed and of course i dont know how much he learned  too bad did you come face to face with the man  i did but he got away from us  who do you meanwas ferris with you  yes he thought he recognized the man as one who followed him to the printing office  i see we must be careful hardwick very careful  if it hadnt been for that carson it would be all right growled the exbookkeeper i would like to wring that boys neck  so would i but what has become of him he was not at the office this morning when i was there  i dont know he boarded with ferris aunt but he has left there too  thats queer  i have an idea he isnt so much of a boy as we think said hardwick with a shake of his head  what do you mean  i believe if he isnt a regular detective he is next door to it and was hired by sumner to spot me that scene in the office when i accused him was a putup job on his part and sumners see how easily sumner sided with him in every instance  by jove you may be right cried allen we must be more than careful or  hal did not catch the words that followed for the door of the office opened and a slouching figure entered it was tommy macklin  veiling his astonishment as best he could hal approached the tough  what is it he asked briefly  is der boss in asked macklin  do you mean mr allen or mr parsons asked hal although he knew very well  mr allen  i will see what name  wots dat  what is your name  me name aint got nothin ter do wid it tell him a gent from der east side wants ter talk ter him a few minits  i will  hal rapped on the door it was quickly opened by mr allen  here is a man wants to see you sir said hal he says hes from the east side and wont give any name  allen looked out toward macklin he looked disturbed when he recognized the tough  step this way he called out and macklin entered the office  now what brings you demanded allen as soon as the door was shut  instead of replying macklin looked at hardwick who had taken off part of his disguise  wot you here he faltered  yes tommy you didnt expect it did you returned hardwick with a short laugh  no i didnt  what brought you  i want money said the tough coming forward and putting on a bold front i want money from both of yer see  how much asked allen  a tousand dollars  you are crazy cried the broker  no i aint i mean just wot i say allen i want five hundred from you an der udder from hardwick  supposing we wont pay it  den ill tell der police wot i know i aint doin yer work fer nothin  and the tough poked his nose close to that of caleb allen  nonsense tommy put in hardwick i agreed to give you a hundred dollars for keeping quiet about what you know and thats all youll get  den illwots dat  a loud noise in the outer office startled macklin hal listening at the door suddenly found himself in the hands of parsons and samuels  a spy as i thought cried samuels hardwick allen  the two called rushed out and hal was surrounded  a spy is he cried allen who can  that beard is false exclaimed hardwick tearing it as well as the mustache from our heros face hal carson boys lock the front door if he escapes we shall be ruined     chapter xxviii  hal is exposed   the moment that hardwick made his announcement parsons sprang to the front door and locked it  carson muttered allen hardwick you were right he is nothing more nor less than a spy  when tommy macklin saw the face of hal he grew pale as death  carson he gasped falling back  whats the matter with you demanded hardwick  dats der chap wot followed ferris ter my house  followed ferris when  der night he brung me dat letter from you about dat busness over to deryou know  you are sure  sure repeated macklin in deep disgust i tink i am  how did you happen to catch him  he was spyin at der door same as here we collared him and knocked him down i tought he was dead an me an ferris chucked him in a vat in der cellar of der old pickle factory  ferris said nothing of this to me said hardwick  he was most scared stiff dat feller was replied macklin disdainfully i guess he tought he would not say nuthin ter nobody  during this time hal had not said a word but now he spoke up  what do you intend to do with me he asked  youll see fast enough replied hardwick we have got you fast this time do you know what i think i think you are the same fellow that i met in the lumberyard  and if i am hardwick what of it  it will go so much the harder with you  let us bind him so he cannot escape said allen he is a dangerous young man to have loose  there is a rope in the closet said parsons bind him with that if you want to  the rope was speedily brought forth and hal was bound hands and feet there was no use trying to escape and consequently he did not undertake to do so  put him in the closet ordered the broker when the job of binding hal was completed  gag him first cautioned hardwick we dont want him to raise the roof if hes left alone well fix him later  the gag was inserted in hals mouth and then he was lifted up by macklin and the others and dumped into the corner of the closet and the door was closed and locked upon him  from the closet which was damp and cold he could hear the confused murmur of voices but could not make out a word of what was being said the murmur continued fully half an hour and then all became as silent as the grave  hal was all but suffocated by the rude gag which had been forced into his mouth all was dark and his position was a painful one not only mentally but bodily as well  what the rogues intended to do with him he did not know if only he could free himself and get away  with might and main he tugged at the rope which bound his hands at first it remained tight but at last it loosened sufficiently to allow him to slip out his right hand  the left soon followed and hals next work was to remove the gag from his mouth what a relief it was to once more close his mouth  his feet freed the boy looked about for some means by which to escape from the closet the door was locked as has been mentioned but it was a poor affair and hal knew he could easily force it open with his shoulder  before proceeding to this extremity he listened intently it must be near three oclock and he wondered if all the others had left  suddenly voices broke upon his ear and he heard hardwick and macklin enter the rear office by applying his ear to the keyhole hal heard what was said if they opened the closet door he determined to make a bold dash for liberty  how much is der in dis new ob macklin asked  two hundred dollars if he never comes back  den pass over der cash  ill pay you after the job is done tommy  no yer dont dis is a cashinadvance job  cant you trust me  i kin but i aint goin ter  its to your interest as much as ours to have him out of the way  dats all right too but its pay or no job hardwick  if i pay you now you may make a balk as you did before  no dis will be a sure ting ill give yer me word  then here you are  a silence followed  is that right asked hardwick  yes but remember dis aint part of dat tousand im ter have fer dat udder work  i understand now go for the coach and ill stay till you come back its getting dark and the street is almost deserted  i will better lock der door and dont unlock it again till yer hear four knocks see  yes  macklin at once went off and hal heard hardwick lock the door after him as agreed but the key was left in the lock  by the conversation hal knew it must be later than he had supposed under cover of the darkness macklin was going to bring a coach to the place for what purpose  in spite of his naturally brave spirit hal shivered he was in the power of a desperate set of men and he had learned enough of their secrets to convict every one of them they would not hesitate to do anything to escape their just deserts  i must fight for it he muttered to himself and now is the best time to do it  he opened the closet door cautiously and peeped out hardwick sat in an easychair smoking savagely as if he were out of humor no one else was in the place  the office was heavily carpeted so hal made no noise as he stepped out of the closet he had to pass within five feet of hardwick who sat with his back half turned to the boy  hardly daring to breathe hal tiptoed his way past hardwick and into the outer office the door to which stood wide open here it was quite dark and the boy saw through the window that it was again snowing heavily  at last the door was reached and his hand was upon the key ready to turn it in the lock  suddenly as if struck by an idea hardwick jumped to his feet and came out his intention was to examine something on one of the outer desks and when he beheld hal he stared at the youth in blank amazement  wherewhere he began  without saying a word hal turned the key and caught hold of the latch of the door then with something that sounded like the growl of a wild animal hardwick pounced upon him  no you dont he hissed you shant escape this time come back here  he caught hal by the coat collar the youth struggled and then struck out with all force  the blow landed on hardwicks chin and knocked his head back with such force that for the instant he let slip his grasp and hal was free  but before the plucky youth could open the door the man had him fast again and was punching him with all his might  ill teach you a lesson he cried take that and that you are smart but you are not smart enough for me  let go cried hal  but hardwick continued to pound him then in sheer desperation hal closed in and fought tooth and nail as if his very life depended on it  hardwick was a heavybuilt man but he was no match for the youth who all his life had been used to hard labor and whose muscles consequently were like steel he struck hal many times but the youth squirmed and twisted and suddenly hit him a crack between the eyes that made him see stars  oh he howled and dropped back while hal taking advantage of this stroke of good luck made another dash for the front door  he opened the door and was halfway out when hardwick realizing what escape meant leaped forward and caught him by the coat  let go cried hal and with a jerk he tore away and started up the steps leading to the street  he had scarcely taken half a dozen steps when he ran full tilt into macklin who had just driven up on the box of a closed coach  wots dis cried the tough carson no yer dont  he carried his whip in his hand and as he spoke he brought the butt down on hals head with full force  there was a strange flash of fire through hals brain and then all became a dark blank     chapter xxix  hal makes a lively move   when hal came to his senses he found himself bound and gagged as before but instead of being in a closet he was now in a coach that was whirling along as fast as the deep snow would permit  the curtains of the vehicle were tightly drawn so the youth had no chance of seeing where he was being taken  his head ached fearfully from the blow tommy macklin had administered and for several minutes he could hardly collect himself  missed it he groaned to himself and now those villains have me completely in their power  it was not a pleasant thought and therefore hal did not allow his mind to dwell upon it  he wondered if he could get open one of the doors of the coach and leap or rather tumble to the ground it would be a dangerous experiment considering how he was tied up but hal was willing to assume desperate risks just now  he fumbled around with his bound hands for fully five minutes and at last succeeded in turning the handle to one of the coach doors which immediately swung open  hal looked out they were on an almost deserted road it was quite dark and still snowing  if i drop out here i may be frozen to death before i can free myself he thought i will wait until we pass a house of some sort  hal had hardly reached this conclusion before the coach rolled past an elegant roadhouse brilliantly illuminated from top to bottom  now is my chance he thought there ought to be somebody around to pick me up  losing no time for they had now passed several rods beyond the roadhouse the plucky boy wriggled his body toward the open door of the coach  watching for what he thought a favorable opportunity hal gave himself a lurch forward and tumbled out into the snow but as he did so one of the rear wheels of the coach struck him on the side of the head and the blow rendered him unconscious  his body lay where it had fallen for several minutes then two young men in a cutter came driving from the roadhouse  hullo ike whats that cried one of them pulling up  looks like a tramp in the snow replied the other lets drive out of the way  we cant leave him here hell be frozen to death  by jove will youre right wait ill jump out and investigate  the speaker leaped out into the snow and bent over the motionless form  by jove it isnt a tramp at all he burst out its a welldressed young man go back and get help hes hurt on the head  the young fellow remaining in the cutter at once did as directed and returned with a negro and a white man  hals body was lifted up and he was carried to the roadhouse and placed on a lounge in the waitingroom  restoratives were applied and presently hal gave a gasp and sat up the cords with which he had been bound having been cut  wherewhere am i he asked in bewilderment  youre safe indoors was the reply what was the matter how came you to be bound  i was trapped and a man was carrying me off in a coach  what a regular abduction eh  yes sir  whats the matter did the fellow want to get your money  no i know too much and he or rather the men who employ him want to get me out of the way  humph they ought to be locked

one of the rigs here said the policeman but its more than likely hell be back  will you arrest him for me  sure  a few minutes passed then the door opened and the negro who had helped to pick hal up came in  a feller wid an empty coach jess drove up he said somewhat excitedly  it must be macklin exclaimed hal where is he  jess gitting ready ter cum in i reckon sah  well go down and meet him said the policeman and he led the way  the door leading to the barroom was partly of glass beaching it the policeman pointed to a man standing at the bar gulping down a glass of liquor  is that the chap he asked  hal gave a look  yes thats macklin dont let him get away  no fear ive dealt with many a tough customer and i know how to handle them  i will step in first and give him a surprise said the youth and he opened the door  macklins back was turned at the time and he did not see our hero until hal tapped him on the shoulder  well macklin were you looking for me  the tough turned quickly then he grew pale and the glass almost dropped from his hand  wotwhere he stammered  you didnt expect to meet me here did you went on hal pleasantly  nodat iswhere did yer cum from  from your coach macklin i got tired of riding in such a cramped fashion  the tough shifted uneasily hal beckoned to the policeman  here officer is the rascal  macklin wheeled about and gave the policeman a single glance when muttering something he made a dash for the door  but both hal and the policeman were after him and our hero caught him by the arm and held him until the officer had slipped a pair of handcuffs onto him  ill fix yer fer dis hissed macklin in hals ear  your days for fixing people are about over macklin replied the youth you and the others have overreached yourselves for once  i didnt do nuthin  we will see about that later where are hardwick and allen  i dont know dem replied the tough sullenly  all right then you want to take the whole responsibility of this matter on your own shoulders  at this the tough winced it was putting the matter in a different light  say supposin i put you on to dere game will yer be easy wid me  that depends on how much you have to tell said hal  i knows more

settle wid yer in der mornin  where is the old house  der flack mansion  i know the place said the policeman it has been unoccupied for years  what time were they coming up  hardwick said at eight oclock sharp replied macklin he seemed anxious now to inform on his companions in villainy  very well we will see what happens at that time returned hal briefly  his words meant a good deal     chapter xxx  the missing tin box   less than an hour later macklin was taken to the police station in his own coach and locked up  as soon as this was accomplished hal lost no time in making his way to horace sumners elegant mansion  it was now quite late and only a single light gleamed out from the mansion and that from the library where the old broker sat busy with his accounts  his face was furrowed with care and just before hal rang the bell he heaved a deep sigh  unless the tin box containing the stolen bonds is recovered i will be a ruined man he groaned it is impossible to cover the loss allen has ruined me and even though he tries to use those slips and i have him arrested it will do no good  the ring at the bell aroused him and as the servants had retired he answered the summons himself  what hal he cried you must have important news or you would not come at this hour of the night  i have important news mr sumner replied the youth and i came because i want your assistance the first thing in the morning  you shall have it hal but what news do you bring come into the library and tell me  the two passed into the sumptuouslyfurnished apartment and seated by the open grate fire the youth told of all that had occurred since he had obtained employment at allen  parsons  you have had several narrow escapes my boy cried the old broker shuddering you must be more careful really you must  i think we have about reached the end of the matter returned hal  why what do you mean the tin box  i have an idea hardwick allen and the others intend to come to some sort of a settlement tomorrow either at the old house or at the office in broad street this samuels is about to take some of the bonds to chicago and we must be on hand to stop the scheme  you are right hal and mighty smart what do you propose you have done so well thus far i must really allow you to go on  i propose we go to the old house accompanied by a couple of officers and lay low for hardwick and allen when they come i can appear before them with my hands and feet bound and accuse them of the crime they will not know that macklin has been arrestedi have taken care of thatand they may give themselves away  a good plan what rogues they are and how blind i have been hal i shall not forget all you have done for me  a little more conversation ensued and then the youth arose  where are you going now  to the hotel to get some sleep  no need of going to the hotel i will call up one of the servants and she can show you to a room  you are very kind mr sumner  it is nothing hal in comparison to what you have done for me i shall reward you well if the missing box is recovered  quarter of an hour later hal was shown to a bedroom on the second floor it was quite the finest apartment of the kind he had ever entered the servant opened the bed and drew the curtains and then retired  gracious this is style murmured the youth as he began to disrobe i wonder if i will ever own anything as nice  on the walls were a number of steel engravings and etchings and on the mantel rested a large photograph of a handsome middleaged lady  hal gazed at the portrait for fully five minutes the features were so motherly they appealed to his heart  it must be a picture of the late mrs sumner he thought what a good woman she must have been no wonder mr sumner and miss laura miss her  and then as he thought of his own conditionthat of a mere poorhouse foundlinghis eyes grew moist  how i wish i had known a mother and that she was like her was his soliloquy or that i had a father like kind mr sumnerand such a girl like miss laura for a sister he added suddenly and then he blushed  his mind presently turned back to the missing tin box and thinking over this he soon fell asleep  he was up bright and early when he went down to the library he found laura sumner there and the old broker soon joined them  a hasty breakfast was had livened by the bright conversation of laura who was of a vivacious turn of mind and then mr sumner and hal hurried off to police headquarters  their quest was soon explained to the officer in charge and two men were detailed to accompany them to the old mansion up on the jerome avenue road  it had stopped snowing and the early morning sun made everything glisten a large sleigh was procured and one of the policemen and hal mounted the box and off they drove  it was twenty minutes to eight when the vicinity of the old flack mansion was reached the sleigh was driven around a bend and into a clump of trees and then the party dismounted  ill go ahead and see if anybody is around said hal if its all right ill wave a handkerchief from one of the windows  the youth was somewhat excited supposing macklin had made up the story of the meeting between hardwick and allen such a thing was possible  but no he wouldnt dare thought hal he is thoroughly scared and wants to gain our good graces by giving the others away  the deserted mansion was in a dilapidated condition more than half the shutters were gone and the front door stood wide open  sneaking up along an old hedge hal gained the halftumbleddown piazza and glided swiftly into the hall now more than quarter filled with snow which the sharp wind had driven in  certainly a cheerless place he thought but i suppose they thought no one would come here and so they would be free from interruption  he entered the parlor of the house and then walked through to the diningroom the library and then the kitchen nothing was disturbed and the smooth snow wherever it had drifted in did not show the first sign of a footstep  good i am in plenty of time said hal to himself i must tramp around a bit and then bind myself up as best i can  he waved his handkerchief out of one of the windows and then proceeded to tie his feet together  he had just finished the work when horace sumner and two officers rushed in  they are coming exclaimed the old broker there are allen hardwick and two strangers  the strangers must be parsons and samuels said hal here bind my hands and shove me into the closet and then hide  this was done and less than a minute later a stamping was heard and allen hardwick parsons and samuels entered the parlor  hullo macklin where are you cried hardwick  of course there was no reply  must have gone off to get his breakfast said allen wonder what he did with the boy  boy cried hardwick better say man carson is altogether too smart to be called a boy  we must get him out of the way and then finish this bond matter went on allen  yes and hurry up put in samuels i want to catch the twelve oclock train to chicago and you might as well give me the bonds to take along the sooner they are worked off the better  thats an easy matter to settle said hardwick i have the tin box right here with me i didnt dare leave it behind for fear old sumner might get a search warrant and go through my house  as the exbookkeeper spoke he unbuttoned his great coat and brought forth the missing tin box for which hal and the others had been so long searching     chapter xxxi  hardwicks dash for liberty   hal and the others listened with keen interest to hardwicks words the exbookkeeper had the missing railroad bonds with him and he intended to transfer them to samuels to be disposed of to the best advantage  now is the time to capture the gang thought hal i wish my hands were free  let us see what has become of carson first said allen nervously somehow i dont feel safe as long as that boy is within possible hearing  dont get afraid replied parsons tommy macklin has probably done him up or you would hear something from him  macklin tried to remove him once before returned allen with a shake of his head that boy beats all for shrewdness  i would like to settle him myself growled hardwick we would never have had the least bit of trouble if it hadnt been for him like as not i would still have been sumners head and confidential clerk he added with a sarcastic laugh  yes and i could have made life bitterness itself for horace sumner cried allen i wanted to do more than ruin him  what makes you so bitter against sumner asked parsons  thats my affair replied allen shortly  its because sumner married the girl allen wanted put in samuels allen was clean gone on her and when she married sumner it broke him all up  shut up samuels exclaimed allen evidently angry at having the matter mentioned there are but few know of it and i dont want it to reach horace sumners ears or  it wont reach him through me allen and he will never suspect that you had anything to do with his sons  will you shut up roared allen turning white with rage one would think by the way your tongue rattles that you had been drinking  only had a couple of glasses returned samuels coolly so dont get worked up allen  hal listened to this conversation with deep interest it revealed why allen was so bitter against horace sumner and so willing to cheat his partner  but i dont understand about that child business yet muttered hal to himself  while the others were talking hardwick had been examining the closets and he now came to the one in which the others had placed hal  hullo here he is he shouted well how do you feel you beggar the last to the boy  not very well replied hal coolly his hands were now loose but he kept them behind him  youll feel a sight worse before we are done with you returned hardwick grimly  what do you intend to do with me  youll see soon enough said the exbookkeeper  he turned to the others and as he did so hal bent down and freed his feet  by jove hes loose cried parsons glancing around  yes and i intend to stay so cried hal stepping into the room hardwick i want that tin box  ho ho hear him talk exclaimed hardwick jump on him boys  stand back every one of you cried hal i am not alone here there is plenty of help  he uttered the last word loudly and on the instant the doors leading to the diningroom and the one from the library opened and horace sumner stepped into the parlor followed by the two officers  trapped howled allen macklin has either been outwitted or he has played us false  the two officers held pistols in their hands and they lost no time in coming to the front  surrender all of you cried one of them  never cried allen do you think i am to be caught like a rat in a trap  he made a dash for the hallway and was quickly followed by samuels  but the two policemen were too quick for the pair and they were speedily overtaken and then a desperate struggle ensued  in the meantime parsons tried to jump through the doorway leading to the library in order to do this he had to pass horace sumner and putting out his foot the old broker sent the man sprawling to the floor and then ended his struggles by sitting down on him so suddenly that parsons wind was knocked completely out of him  hal still confronted hardwick whose eyes were fairly blazing with passion  give me the box commanded hal quick i mean what i say  instead of complying hardwick made a vicious blow for hals head the boy dodged but in doing so slipped and went down on his back  before he could recover hardwick sprang for one of the open windows and leaped through carrying part of the long sash with him  he had hardly disappeared when hal was on his feet again without hesitation the youth followed through the broken window hardwick was making for the road where stood a team of horses attached to a fine sleigh  if he gets away in that he and the tin box are goners was hals rapid conclusion i must stop him at all hazards  hardwick had a good start but hal made quick time after him and when the exbookkeeper reached the sleigh the boy was not a dozen yards behind  stop hardwick he cried  not much carson take that  hardwick pulled out his weapon there were two reports in rapid succession hal was struck in the side and hardwick stumbled down  hal was quite badly hurt but he braced up and staggered to where hardwick lay  now give up the tin box he ordered in as steady a voice as he could  never to you roared hardwick you have been the cause of all my trouble take that  he fired one bullet grazed hals shoulder the others flew wide of their mark then the boy took the butt of his own weapon and with one blow on hardwicks head knocked the villain unconscious  the mist was swimming before his eyes as he gathered up the tin box and its precious contents and staggered toward the house the policemen had made prisoners of the gang and horace sumner ran out to meet the youth  you are shot hal he cried in quick alarm  yes mr sumnerii am shot was the low reply but here is the tin box andthebondssafe  and with these words hal pitched over insensible into the brokers arms     chapter xxxii  a surprising revelation   horace sumner was terribly alarmed paying no attention to the tin box he knelt down and raised hal up on his knee  shot in the shoulder and in the side he murmured after a brief examination oh i trust it be not serious  all of the prisoners had been handcuffed and one of the officers followed mr sumner out  hullo is he shot he cried  yes  where is the fellow with the tin box  the box is here safe there lies the fellow arrest him and fix it so he cannot get away  the policeman at once hurried to hardwicks side and before the exbookkeeper had fully recovered consciousness he was handcuffed and then placed in a room with the other prisoners  what are you going to do with us he demanded of the policeman who stood guard at the door pistol in hand  you will see later not another word now  and hardwick was forced to keep silent as were also the others  there was another house not far distant and getting the sleigh mr sumner placed hals form into it and drove him around to the door  matters were quickly explained and as the broker showed that he was a wealthy man and well able to pay for accommodations hal was at once lifted into the house and placed on a comfortable bed in one of the upper rooms  send for the nearest doctor please said horace sumner and tell him he must come at once no matter what the expense tell him i am horace sumner the broker of wall street  the man about the place at once hurried off and placing the tin box which he had picked up out of the snow on the table horace sumner bent over hals motionless form and sought by every means in his power to restore him to consciousness  in working over hals clothing the golden locket the youth considered his birthright came to light for the moment horace sumner paid no attention to it but placed it on top of the tin box  at last hal opened his eyes and stared around him  hal how do you feel questioned the old broker with real anxiety in his tones  mr sumner the boxdid you  it is safe hal  i am so glad and a smile came over the pallid face  but my poor boy you are hurthardwick shot you cant you feel it  yes in my side and my shoulder but i dont think its very bad and ill soon  before hal could finish he fainted away less than ten minutes later the man about the place returned with an experienced physician  not dangerously wounded was his opinion after a thorough examination he will be as sound as a dollar in a couple of months but he ought not to be moved for several weeks  he shall not be said horace sumner  and he at once made arrangements with the owner of the house to have the use of that room and the next for the entire time mentioned with board and care for a nurse and hal  an hour later hal was resting easier and then horace sumner arose to leave and find out what the officers had done with the captured criminals  as he turned to pick up the tin box he noticed the golden locket he took it up rather carelessly but suddenly a peculiar look stole into his eyes and dropping the tin box he hurriedly opened the locket  my heavens he ejaculated  the exclamation was so pronounced that it awoke hal and the youth opened his eyes wide and stared at the man  wherewhere did you get this locket demanded horace sumner in a voice husky with emotion  it is my birthrightor at least all i have of one replied the youth  your birthright  thats what i call it sir it was around my neck when i was found on the streets of fairham  can this be true when was this  about sixteen years ago but whatwhat  stop what part of the year hal answer me quickly  it was one fourth of july night  horace sumner staggered back  fourth of july he muttered to himself and little howard disappeared on the twentyseventh of june can it be  you say you do not know anything about yourself he asked of hal  no sir the people at fairham tried to find out but they didnt make a very great effort im thinking and so iiwell you can see how it is  you are not to blame hal a better or more noble boy never livedandand i thank god that is so for iti will explain later i must see caleb allen without delay  and with his tin box under his arm horace sumner rushed from the house taking the golden locket with him  when he appeared at the stationhouse he seemed almost like a crazy man so eager was he to interview allen a private meeting between the two was speedily arranged  allen i have come on an important mission began horace sumner  have you i thought you had your bonds returned the swindler as cooly as he could  i am not referring to the bonds this matter is far more important  indeed  when you and the others were at the old flack mansion samuels mentioned a subject that lies close to my heart  samuels didnt know what he was saying growled allen turning pale  he did allen i have been blind but my eyes are now wide open caleb allen years ago you stole my son my little baby boy  its not true almost shouted allen but he trembled from head to foot  it is true i have the evidence to prove it do you deny that you took the little one first to philadelphia and then to the village of fairham and on the night of the fourth of july  caleb allen jumped up as if shot  so tommy macklin has been blabbing had he he screamed but it wont do you any good horace sumner the boy is lost to youyou will never hear of him again  so the old broker pulled the golden locket from his pocket look at this it was around his neck when he was stolen and it has been the connecting link to prove his identity he is found and my little boy howard ishal carson the youth who helped to bring you to justice  here we must bring our tale to a close  what horace sumner had said was true hal carson was really his son who had been stolen by caleb allen and tommy macklin the latter having even in those days been a ready tool of the swindler  even after having robbed sumner of his only son allens hatred was not satisfied and he entered into the limited partnership only for the purpose of ruining the man  allen had fallen in with hardwick at a gambling house uptown and the two soon became firm friends at that time dick ferris was a great admirer of hardwick who found the tall boy a fellow without scruples of any kind  hal was amazed when he learned the truth concerning himself at first he could not believe it but when it came home to him he was overjoyed he speedily recovered from the wounds hardwick had inflicted and one fine day in the early part of the following year horace sumner and laura took him to the elegant mansion which was in future to be his home as well as theirs  hardwick allen macklin and samuels were all tried and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment parsons escaped and went to england  when the police started to find dick ferris they found that the tall boy had shipped on a three years whaling voyage to this day he has not returned to new york  the recovery of the tin box containing the railroad bonds saved horace sumner from ruin he and his son are now in partnership on wall street and trusty jack mccabe is their office boy hal or howard as he is now called is rich and is surrounded by friends but it is not likely that he will ever forget the time he came to new york a poor boy and solved the mystery of the missing tin box  the end
