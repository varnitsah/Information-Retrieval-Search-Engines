mary of whom everybody including the old lecturer is in great awe    20      preface to the second edition   i have seldom been more disappointed by the result of my best pains given to any of my books than by the earnest request of my publisher after the opinion of the public had been taken on the ethics of the dust that i would write no more in dialogue however i bowed to public judgment in this matter at once knowing also my inventive powers to be of the feeblest but in reprinting the book at the prevailing request of my kind friend mr henry willett i would pray the readers whom it may at first offend by its disconnected method to examine nevertheless with care the passages in which the principal speaker sums the conclusions of any dialogue for these summaries were written as introductions for young people to all that i have said on the same matters in my larger books and on rereading them they satisfy me better and seem to me calculated to be more generally useful than anything else i have done of the kind      preface to the second edition   the summary of the contents of the whole book beginning you may at least earnestly believe at p 215 is thus the clearest exposition i have ever yet given of the general conditions under which the personal creative power manifests itself in the forms of matter and the analysis of heathen conceptions of deity beginning at p 217 and closing at p 229 not only prefaces but very nearly supersedes all that in more lengthy terms i have since asserted or pleaded for in aratra pentelici and the queen of the air  and thus however the book may fail in its intention of suggesting new occupations or interests to its younger readers i think it worth reprinting in the way i have also reprinted unto this lastpage for page that the students of my more advanced works may be able to refer to these as the original documents of them of which the most essential in this book are these following  i the explanation of the baseness of the avaricious functions of the lower pthah p 54 with his beetlegospel p 59 that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its virtues explains the main motive of all my books on political economy  ii the examination of the connection between stupidity and crime pp 8796 anticipated all that i have had to urge in fors clavigera against the commonly alleged excuse for public wickednessthey dont mean itthey dont know any better  iii the examination of the roots of moral power pp 145149 is a summary of what is afterwards developed with utmost care in my inaugural lecture at oxford on the relation of art to morals compare in that lecture sections 8385 with the sentence in p 147 of this book nothing is ever done so as really to please our father unless we would also have done it though we had had no father to know of it  this sentence however it must be observed regards only the general conditions of action in the children of god in consequence of which it is foretold of them by christ that they will say at the judgment when saw we thee it does not refer to the distinct cases in which virtue consists in faith given to command appearing to foolish human judgment inconsistent with the moral law as in the sacrifice of isaac nor to those in which any directlygiven command requires nothing more of virtue than obedience  iv the subsequent pages 149158 were written especially to check the dangerous impulses natural to the minds of many amiable young women in the direction of narrow and selfish religious sentiment and they contain therefore nearly everything which i believe it necessary that young people should be made to observe respecting the errors of monastic life but they in nowise enter on the reverse or favorable side of which indeed i did not and as yet do not feel myself able to speak with any decisiveness the evidence on that side as stated in the text having never yet been dispassionately examined  v the dialogue with lucilla beginning at p 96 is to my own fancy the best bit of conversation in the book and the issue of it at p 103 the most practically and immediately useful for on the idea of the inevitable weakness and corruption of human nature has logically followed in our daily life the horrible creed of modern social science that all social action must be scientifically founded on vicious impulses but on the habit of measuring and reverencing our powers and talents that we may kindly use them will be founded a true social science developing by the employment of them all the real powers and honorable feelings of the race  vi finally the account given in the second and third lectures of the real nature and marvelousness of the laws of crystallization is necessary to the understanding of what farther teaching of the beauty of inorganic form i may be able to give either in deucalion or in my elements of drawing i wish however that the second lecture had been made the beginning of the book and would fain now cancel the first altogether which i perceive to be both obscure and dull it was meant for a metaphorical description of the pleasures and dangers in the kingdom of mammon or of worldly wealth its waters mixed with blood its fruits entangled in thickets of trouble and poisonous when gathered and the final captivity of its inhabitants within frozen walls of cruelty and disdain but the imagery is stupid and ineffective throughout and i retain this chapter only because i am resolved to leave no room for any one to say that i have withdrawn as erroneous in principle so much as a single sentence of any of my books written since 1860  one license taken in this book however though often permitted to essaywriters for the relief of their dullness i never mean to take morethe relation of composed metaphor as of actual dream pp 27 and 171 i assumed it is true that in these places the supposed dream would be easily seen to be an invention but must not any more even under so transparent disguise pretend to any share in the real powers of vision possessed by great poets and true painters  brantwood  10th october 1877      preface   the following lectures were really given in substance at a girls school far in the country which in the course of various experiments on the possibility of introducing some better practice of drawing into the modern scheme of female education i visited frequently enough to enable the children to regard me as a friend the lectures always fell more or less into the form of fragmentary answers to questions and they are allowed to retain that form as on the whole likely to be more interesting than the symmetries of a continuous treatise many children for the school was large took part at different times in the conversations but i have endeavored without confusedly multiplying the number of imaginary speakers to represent as far as i could the general tone of comment and inquiry among young people  footnote i do not mean in saying imaginary that i have not permitted to myself in several instances the affectionate discourtesy of some reminiscence of personal character for which i must hope to be forgiven by my old pupils and their friends as i could not otherwise have written the book at all but only two sentences in all the dialogues and the anecdote of dotty are literally historical  it will be at once seen that these lectures were not intended for an introduction to mineralogy their purpose was merely to awaken in the minds of young girls who were ready to work earnestly and systematically a vital interest in the subject of their study no science can be learned in play but it is often possible in play to bring good fruit out of past labor or show sufficient reasons for the labor of the future  the narrowness of this aim does not indeed justify the absence of all reference to many important principles of structure and many of the most interesting orders of minerals but i felt it impossible to go far into detail without illustrations and if readers find this book useful i may perhaps endeavor to supplement it by illustrated notes of the more interesting phenomena in separate groups of familiar mineralsflints of the chalkagates of the basaltsand the fantastic and exquisitely beautiful varieties of the veinores of the two commonest metals lead and iron but i have always found that the less we speak of our intentions the more chance there is of our realizing them and this poor little book will sufficiently have done its work for the present if it engages any of its young readers in study which may enable them to despise it for its shortcomings  denmark hill christmas 1865      lecture 1  the valley of diamonds   a very idle talk by the diningroom fire after raisinandalmond time  old lecturer florrie isabel may lily and sibyl  old lecturer l come here isabel and tell me what the make believe was this afternoon  isabel arranging herself very primly on the footstool such a dreadful one florrie and i were lost in the valley of diamonds  l what sindbads which nobody could get out of isabel yes but florrie and i got out of it  l so i see at least i see you did but are you sure florrie did  isabel quite sure  florrie putting her head round from behind ls sofacushion quite sure disappears again  l i think i could be made to feel surer about it  florrie reappears gives l a kiss and again exit  l i suppose its all right but how did you manage it  isabel well you know the eagle that took up sindbad was very largevery very largethe largest of all the eagles  l how large were the others  isabel i dont quite knowthey were so far off but this one was oh so big and it had great wings as wide astwice over the ceiling so when it was picking up sindbad florrie and i thought it wouldnt know if we got on its back too so i got up first and then i pulled up florrie and we put our arms round its neck and away it flew  l but why did you want to get out of the valley and why havent you brought me some diamonds  isabel it was because of the serpents i couldnt pick up even the least little bit of a diamond i was so frightened  l you should not have minded the serpents  isabel oh but suppose that they had minded me  l we all of us mind you a little too much isabel im afraid  isabel nonono indeed  l i tell you what isabeli dont believe either sindbad or florrie or you ever were in the valley of diamonds  isabel you naughty when i tell you we were  l because you say you were frightened at the serpents  isabel and wouldnt you have been  l not at those serpents nobody who really goes into the valley is ever frightened at themthey are so beautiful  isabel suddenly serious but theres no real valley of diamonds is there  l yes isabel very real indeed  florrie reappearing oh where tell me about it  l i cannot tell you a great deal about it only i know it is very different from sindbads in his valley there was only a diamond lying here and there but in the real valley there are diamonds covering the grass in showers every morning instead of dew and there are clusters of trees which look like lilac trees but in spring all their blossoms are of amethyst  florrie but there cant be any serpents there then  l why not  florrie because they dont come into such beautiful places  l i never said it was a beautiful place  florrie what not with diamonds strewed about it like dew  l thats according to your fancy florrie for myself i like dew better  isabel oh but the dew wont stay it all dries  l yes and it would be much nicer if the diamonds dried too for the people in the valley have to sweep them off the grass in heaps whenever they want to walk on it and then the heaps glitter so they hurt ones eyes  florrie now youre just playing you know  l so are you you know  florrie yes but you mustnt play  l thats very hard florrie why mustnt i if you may  florrie oh i may because im little but you mustnt because yourehesitates for a delicate expression of magnitude  l rudely taking the first that comes because im big no thats not the way of it at all florrie because youre little you should have very little play and because im big i should have a great deal  isabel and florrie both nononono that isnt it at all isabel sola quoting miss ingelow the lambs play alwaysthey know no better putting her head very much on one side ah now pleasepleasetell us true we want to know  l but why do you want me to tell you true any more than the man who wrote the arabian nights  isabel becausebecause we like to know about real things and you can tell us and we cant ask the man who wrote the stories  l what do you call real things  isabel now you know things that really are  l whether you can see them or not  isabel yes if somebody else saw them  l but if nobody has ever seen them  isabel evading the point well but you know if there were a real valley of diamonds somebody must have seen it  l you cannot be so sure of that isabel many people go to real places and never see them and many people pass through this valley and never see it  florrie what stupid people they must be  l no florrie they are much wiser than the people who do see it  may i think i know where it is  isabel tell us more about it and then well guess  l well theres a great broad road by a riverside leading up into it  may gravely cunning with emphasis on the last word does the road really go up  l you think it should go down into a valley no it goes up this is a valley among the hills and it is as high as the clouds and is often full of them so that even the people who most want to see it cannot always  isabel and what is the river beside the road like  l it ought to be very beautiful because it flows over diamond sandonly the water is thick and red  isabel red water  l it isnt all water  may oh please never mind that isabel just now i want to hear about the valley  l so the entrance to it is very wide under a steep rock only such numbers of people are always trying to get in that they keep jostling each other and manage it but slowly some weak ones are pushed back and never get in at all and make great moaning as they go away but perhaps they are none the worse in the end  may and when one gets in what is it like  l it is up and down broken kind of ground the road stops directly and there are great dark rocks covered all over with wild gourds and wild vines the gourds if you cut them are red with black seeds like watermelons and look ever so nice and the people of the place make a red pottage of them but you must take care not to eat any if you ever want to leave the valley though i believe putting plenty of meal in it makes it wholesome then the wild vines have clusters of the color of amber and the people of the country say they are the grape of eshcol and sweeter than honey but indeed if anybody else tastes them they are like gall then there are thickets of bramble so thorny that they would be cut away directly anywhere else but here they are covered with little cinquefoiled blossoms of pure silver and for berries they have clusters of rubies dark rubies which you only see are red after gathering them but you may fancy what blackberry parties the children have only they get their frocks and hands sadly torn  lily but rubies cant spot ones frocks as blackberries do  l no but ill tell you what spots themthe mulberries there are great forests of them all up the hills covered with silk worms some munching the leaves so loud that it is like mills at work and some spinning but the berries are the blackest you ever saw and wherever they fall they stain a deep red and nothing ever washes it out again and it is their juice soaking through the grass which makes the river so red because all its springs are in this wood and the boughs of the trees are twisted as if in pain like old olive branches and their leaves are dark and it is in these forests that the serpents are but nobody is afraid of them they have fine crimson crests and they are wreathed about the wild branches one in every tree nearly and they are singing serpents for the serpents are in this forest what birds are in ours  florrie oh i dont want to go there at all now  l you would like it very much indeed florrie if you were there the serpents would not bite you the only fear would be of your turning into one  florrie oh dear but thats worse  l you wouldnt think so if you really were turned into one florrie you would be very proud of your crest and as long as you were yourself not that you could get there if you remained quite the little florrie you are now you would like to hear the serpents sing they hiss a little through it like the cicadas in italy but they keep good time and sing delightful melodies and most of them have seven heads with throats which each take a note of the octave so that they can sing chordsit is very fine indeed and the fireflies fly round the edge of the forests all the night long you wade in fireflies they make the fields look like a lake trembling with reflection of stars but you must take care not to touch them for they are not like italian fireflies but burn like real sparks  florrie i dont like it at all ill never go there  l i hope not florrie or at least that you will get out again if you do and it is very difficult to get out for beyond these serpent forests there are great cliffs of dead gold which form a labyrinth winding always higher and higher till the gold is all split asunder by wedges of ice and glaciers welded half of ice seven times frozen and half of gold seven times frozen hang down from them and fall in thunder cleaving into deadly splinters like the cretan arrowheads and into a mixed dust of snow and gold ponderous yet which the mountain whirlwinds are able to lift and drive in wreaths and pillars hiding the paths with a burial cloud fatal at once with wintry chill and weight of golden ashes so the wanderers in the labyrinth fall one by one and are buried thereyet over the drifted graves those who are spared climb to the last through coil on coil of the pathfor at the end of it they see the king of the valley sitting on his throne and beside him but it is only a false vision spectra of creatures like themselves sit on thrones from which they seem to look down on all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and on the canopy of his throne there is an inscription in fiery letters which they strive to read but cannot for it is written in words which are like the words of all languages and yet are of none men say it is more like their own tongue to the english than it is to any other nation but the only record of it is by an italian who heard the king himself cry it as a war cry pape satan pape satan aleppe footnote dante inf 7 i  sibyl but do they all perish there you said there was a way through the valley and out of it  l yes but few find it if any of them keep to the grass paths where the diamonds are swept aside and hold their hands over their eyes so as not to be dazzled the grass paths lead forward gradually to a place where one sees a little opening in the golden rocks you were at chamouni last year sibyl did your guide chance to show you the pierced rock of the aiguille du midi  sibyl no indeed we only got up from geneva on monday night and it rained all tuesday and we had to be back at geneva again early on wednesday morning  l of course that is the way to see a country in a sibylline manner by inner consciousness but you might have seen the pierced rock in your drive up or down if the clouds broke not that there is much to see in it one of the crags of the aiguille edge on the southern slope of it is struck sharply through as by an awl into a little eyelet hole which you may see seven thousand feet above the valley as the clouds flit past behind it or leave the sky first white and then dark blue well theres just such an eyelet hole in one of the upper crags of the diamond valley and from a distance you think that it is no bigger than the eye of a needle but if you get up to it they say you may drive a loaded camel through it and that there are fine things on the other side but i have never spoken with anybody who had been through  sibyl i think we understand it now we will try to write it down and think of it  l meantime florrie though all that i have been telling you is very true yet you must not think the sort of diamonds that people wear in rings and necklaces are found lying about on the grass would you like to see how they really are found  florrie oh yesyes  l isabelor lilyrun up to my room and fetch me the little box with a glass lid out of the top drawer of the chest of drawers race between lily and isabel  reenter isabel with the box very much out of breath lily behind  l why you never can beat lily in a race on the stairs can you isabel  isabel panting lilybeat meever so farbut she gave methe boxto carry in  l take off the lid then gently  florrie after peeping in disappointed theres only a great ugly brown stone  l not much more than that certainly florrie if people were wise but look it is not a single stone but a knot of pebbles fastened together by gravel and in the gravel or compressed sand if you look close you will see grains of gold glittering everywhere all through and then do you see these two white beads which shine as if they had been covered with grease  florrie may i touch them  l yes you will find they are not greasy only very smooth well those are the fatal jewels native here in their dust with gold so that you may see cradled here together the two great enemies of mankindthe strongest of all malignant physical powers that have tormented our race  sibyl is that really so i know they do great harm but do they not also do great good  l my dear child what good was any woman do you suppose ever the better for possessing diamonds but how many have been made base frivolous and miserable by desiring them was ever man the better for having coffers full of gold but who shall measure the guilt that is incurred to fill them look into the history of any civilized nations analyze with reference to this one cause of crime and misery the lives and thoughts of their nobles priests merchants and men of luxurious life every other temptation is at last concentrated into this pride and lust and envy and anger all give up their strength to avarice the sin of the whole world is essentially the sin of judas men do not disbelieve their christ but they sell him  sibyl but surely that is the fault of human nature it is not caused by the accident as it were of there being a pretty metal like gold to be found by digging if people could not find that would they not find something else and quarrel for it instead  l no wherever legislators have succeeded in excluding for a time jewels and precious metals from among national possessions the national spirit has remained healthy covetousness is not natural to mangenerosity is but covetousness must be excited by a special cause as a given disease by a given miasma and the essential nature of a material for the excitement of covetousness is that it shall be a beautiful thing which can be retained without a use the moment we can use our possessions to any good purpose ourselves the instinct of communicating that use to others rises side by side with our power if you can read a book rightly you will want others to hear it if you can enjoy a picture rightly you will want others to see it learn how to manage a horse a plough or a ship and you will desire to make your subordinates good horsemen ploughmen or sailors you will never be able to see the fine instrument you are master of abused but once fix your desire on anything useless and all the purest pride and folly in your heart will mix with the desire and make you at last wholly inhuman a mere ugly lump of stomach and suckers like a cuttlefish  sibyl but surely these two beautiful things gold and diamonds must have been appointed to some good purpose  l quite conceivably so my dear as also earthquakes and pestilences but of such ultimate purposes we can have no sight the practical immediate office of the earthquake and pestilence is to slay us like moths and as moths we shall be wise to live out of their way so the practical immediate office of gold and diamonds is the multiplied destruction of souls in whatever sense you have been taught to understand that phrase and the paralysis of wholesome human effort and thought on the face of gods earth and a wise nation will live out of the way of them the money which the english habitually spend in cutting diamonds would in ten years if it were applied to cutting rocks instead leave no dangerous reef nor difficult harbor round the whole island coast great britain would be a diamond worth cutting indeed a true piece of regalia leaves this to their thoughts for a little while then also we poor mineralogists might sometimes have the chance of seeing a fine crystal of diamond unhacked by the jeweler  sibyl would it be more beautiful uncut  l no but of infinite interest we might even come to know something about the making of diamonds  sibyl i thought the chemists could make them already  l in very small black crystals yes but no one knows how they are formed where they are found or if indeed they are formed there at all these in my hand look as if they had been swept down with the gravel and gold only we can trace the gravel and gold to their native rocks but not the diamonds read the account given of the diamond in any good work on mineralogyyou will find nothing but lists of localities of gravel or conglomerate rock which is only an old indurated gravel some say it was once a vegetable gum but it may have been charred wood but what one would like to know is mainly why charcoal should make itself into diamonds in india and only into black lead in borrowdale  sibyl are they wholly the same then  l there is a little iron mixed with our black lead but nothing to hinder its crystallization your pencils in fact are all pointed with formless diamond though they would be h h h pencils to purpose if it crystallized  sibyl but what is crystallization  l a pleasant question when ones half asleep and it has been teatime these two hours what thoughtless things girls are  sybil yes we are but we want to know for all that  l my dear it would take a week to tell you  sibyl well take it and tell us  l but nobody knows anything about it  sibyl then tell us something that nobody knows  l get along with you and tell dora to make tea  the house rises but of course the lecturer wanted to be forced to lecture again and was      lecture 2  the pyramid builders   in the large schoolroom to which everybody has been summoned by ringing of the great bell  l so you have all actually come to hear about crystallization i cannot conceive why unless the little ones think that the discussion may involve some reference to sugarcandy  symptoms of high displeasure among the younger members of council isabel frowns severely at l and shakes her head violently  my dear children if you knew it you are yourselves at this moment as you sit in your ranks nothing in the eye of a mineralogist but a lovely group of rosy sugarcandy arranged by atomic forces and even admitting you to be something more you have certainly been crystallizing without knowing it did not i hear a great hurrying and whispering ten minutes ago when you were late in from the playground and thought you would not all be quietly seated by the time i was readybesides some discussion about placessomething about its not being fair that the little ones should always be nearest well you were then all being crystallized when you ran in from the garden and against one another in the passages you were in what mineralogists would call a state of solution and gradual confluence when you got seated in those orderly rows each in her proper place you became crystalline that is just what the atoms of a mineral do if they can whenever they get disordered they get into order again as soon as may be  i hope you feel inclined to interrupt me and say but we know our places how do the atoms know theirs and sometimes we dispute about our places do the atomsand besides we dont like being compared to atoms at allnever dispute about theirs two wise questions these if you had a mind to put them it was long before i asked them myself of myself and i will not call you atoms any more may i call youlet me seeprimary molecules general dissent indicated in subdued but decisive murmurs no not even in familiar saxon dust  pause with expression on faces of sorrowful doubt lily gives voice to the general sentiment in a timid please dont  no children i wont call you that and mind as you grow up that you do not get into an idle and wicked habit of calling yourselves that you are something better than dust and have other duties to do than ever dust can do and the bonds of affection you will enter into are better than merely getting in to order but see to it on the other hand that you always behave at least as well as dust remember it is only on compulsion and while it has no free permission to do as it likes that it ever gets out of order but sometimes with some of us the compulsion has to be the other wayhasnt it remonstratory whispers expressive of opinion that the lecturer is becoming too personal im not looking at anybody in particularindeed i am not nay if you blush so kathleen how can one help looking well go back to the atoms  how do they know their places you asked or should have asked yes and they have to do much more than know them they have to find their way to them and that quietly and at once without running against each other  we may indeed state it briefly thussuppose you have to build a castle with towers and roofs and buttresses out of bricks of a given shape and that these bricks are all lying in a huge heap at the bottom in utter confusion upset out of carts at random you would have to draw a great many plans and count all your bricks and be sure you had enough for this and that tower before you began and then you would have to lay your foundation and add layer by layer in order slowly  but how would you be astonished in these melancholy days when children dont read childrens books nor believe any more in fairies if suddenly a real benevolent fairy in a bright brick red gown were to rise in the midst of the red bricks and to tap the heap of them with her wand and say bricks bricks to your places and then you saw in an instant the whole heap rise in the air like a swarm of red bees andyou have been used to see bees make a honeycomb and to think that strange enough but now you would see the honeycomb make itselfyou want to ask something florrie by the look of your eyes  florrie are they turned into real bees with stings  l no florrie you are only to fancy flying bricks as you saw the slates flying from the roof the other day in the storm only those slates didnt seem to know where they were going and besides were going where they had no business but my spellbound bricks though they have no wings and what is worse no heads and no eyes yet find their way in the air just where they should settle into towers and roofs each flying to his place and fastening there at the right moment so that every other one shall fit to him in his turn  lily but who are the fairies then who build the crystals  l there is one great fairy lily who builds much more than crystals but she builds these also i dreamed that i saw her building a pyramid the other day as she used to do for the pharaohs  isabel but that was only a dream  l some dreams are truer than some wakings isabel but i wont tell it you unless you like  isabel oh please please  l you are all such wise children theres no talking to you you wont believe anything  lily no we are not wise and we will believe anything when you say we ought  l well it came about this way sibyl do you recollect that evening when we had been looking at your old cave by cumae and wondering why you didnt live there still and then we wondered how old you were and egypt said you wouldnt tell and nobody else could tell but she and you laughedi thought very gayly for a sibyland said you would harness a flock of cranes for us and we might fly over to egypt if we liked and see  sibyl yes and you went and couldnt find out after all  l why you know egypt had been just doubling that third pyramid of hers footnote note i and making a new entrance into it and a fine entrance it was first we had to go through an ante room which had both its doors blocked up with stones and then we had three granite portcullises to pull up one after another and the moment we had got under them egypt signed to somebody above and down they came again behind us with a roar like thunder only louder then we got into a passage fit for nobody but rats and egypt wouldnt go any further herself but said we might go on if we liked and so we came to a hole in the pavement and then to a granite trapdoorand then we thought we had gone quite far enough and came back and egypt laughed at us  egypt you would not have had me take my crown off and stoop all the way down a passage fit only for rats  l it was not the crown egyptyou know that very well it was the flounces that would not let you go any further i suppose however you wear them as typical of the inundation of the nile so it is all right  isabel why didnt you take me with you where rats can go mice can i wouldnt have come back  l no mousie you would have gone on by yourself and you might have waked one of pashts catsfootnote note iii and it would have eaten you i was very glad you were not there but after all this i suppose the imagination of the heavy granite blocks and the underground ways had troubled me and dreams are often shaped in a strange opposition to the impressions that have caused them and from all that we had been reading in bunsen about stones that couldnt be lifted with levers i began to dream about stones that lifted themselves with wings  sibyl now you must just tell us all about it  l i dreamed that i was standing beside the lake out of whose clay the bricks were made for the great pyramid of asychis footnote note ii they had just been all finished and were lying by the lake margin in long ridges like waves it was near evening and as i looked towards the sunset i saw a thing like a dark pillar standing where the rock of the desert stoops to the nile valley i did not know there was a pillar there and wondered at it and it grew larger and glided nearer becoming like the form of a man but vast and it did not move its feet but glided like a pillar of sand and as it drew nearer i looked by chance past it towards the sun and saw a silver cloud which was of all the clouds closest to the sun and in one place crossed it draw itself back from the sun suddenly and it turned and shot towards the dark pillar leaping in an arch like an arrow out of a bow and i thought it was lightning but when it came near the shadowy pillar it sank slowly down beside it and changed into the shape of a woman very beautiful and with a strength of deep calm in her blue eyes she was robed to the feet with a white robe and above that to her knees by the cloud which i had seen across the sun but all the golden ripples of it had become plumes so that it had changed into two bright wings like those of a vulture which wrapped round her to her knees she had a weavers shuttle hanging over her shoulder by the thread of it and in her left hand arrows tipped with fire  isabel clapping her hands oh it was neith it was neith i know now  l yes it was neith herself and as the two great spirits came nearer to me i saw they were the brother and sisterthe pillared shadow was the greater pthahfootnote note iii and i heard them speak and the sound of their words was like a distant singing i could not understand the words one by one yet their sense came to me and so i knew that neith had come down to see her brothers work and the work that he had put into the mind of the king to make his servants do and she was displeased at it because she saw only pieces of dark clay and no porphyry nor marble nor any fair stone that men might engrave the figures of the gods upon and she blamed her brother and said oh lord of truth is this then thy will that men should mold only foursquare pieces of clay and the forms of the gods no more then the lord of truth sighed and said oh sister in truth they do not love us why should they set up our images let them do what they may and not lielet them make their clay foursquare and labor and perish  then neiths dark blue eyes grew darker and she said oh lord of truth why should they love us their love is vain or fear us for their fear is base yet let them testify of us that they knew we lived forever  but the lord of truth answered they know and yet they know not let them keep silence for their silence only is truth  but neith answered brother wilt thou also make league with death because death is true oh thou potter who hast cast these human things from thy wheel many to dishonor and few to honor wilt thou not let them so much as see my face but slay them in slavery  but pthah only answered let them build sister let them build  and neith answered what shall they build if i build not with them  and pthah drew with his measuring rod upon the sand and i saw suddenly drawn on the sand the outlines of great cities and of vaults and domes and aqueducts and bastions and towers greater than obelisks covered with black clouds and the wind blew ripples of sand amidst the lines that pthah drew and the moving sand was like the marching of men but i saw that wherever neith looked at the lines they faded and were effaced  oh brother she said at last what is this vanity if i who am lady of wisdom do not mock the children of men why shouldst thou mock them who art lord of truth but pthah answered they thought to bind me and they shall be bound they shall labor in the fire for vanity  and neith said looking at the sand brother there is no true labor herethere is only weary life and wasteful death  and pthah answered is it not truer labor sister than thy sculpture of dreams then neith smiled and stopped suddenly  she looked to the sun its edge touched the horizonedge of the desert then she looked to the long heaps of pieces of clay that lay each with its blue shadow by the lake shore  brother she said how long will this pyramid of thine be in building  thoth will have sealed the scroll of the years ten times before the summit is laid  brother thou knowest not how to teach thy children to labor answered neith look i must follow phre beyond atlas shall i build your pyramid for you before he goes down and pthah answered yea sister if thou canst put thy winged shoulders to such work and neith drew herself to her height and i heard a clashing pass through the plumes of her wings and the asp stood up on her helmet and fire gathered in her eyes and she took one of the flaming arrows out of the sheaf in her left hand and stretched it out over the heaps of clay and they rose up like flights of locusts and spread themselves in the air so that it grew dark in a moment then neith designed them places with her arrow point and they drew into ranks like dark clouds laid level at morning then neith pointed with her arrow to the north and to the south and to the east and to the west and the flying motes of earth drew asunder into four great ranked crowds and stood one in the north and one in the south and one in the east and one in the westone against another then neith spread her wings wide for an instant and closed them with a sound like the sound of a rushing sea and waved her hand towards the foundation of the pyramid where it was laid on the brow of the desert and the four flocks drew together and sank down like seabirds settling to a level rock and when they met there was a sudden flame as broad as the pyramid and as high as the clouds and it dazzled me and i closed my eyes for an instant and when i looked again the pyramid stood on its rock perfect and purple with the light from the edge of the sinking sun  the younger children variously pleased im so glad how nice but what did pthah say  l neith did not wait to hear what he would say when i turned back to look at her she was gone and i only saw the level white cloud form itself again close to the arch of the sun as it sank and as the last edge of the sun disappeared the form of pthah faded into a mighty shadow and so passed away  egypt and was neiths pyramid left  l yes but you could not think egypt what a strange feeling of utter loneliness came over me when the presence of the two gods passed away it seemed as if i had never known what it was to be alone before and the unbroken line of the desert was terrible  egypt i used to feel that when i was queen sometimes i had to carve gods for company all over my palace i would fain have seen real ones if i could  l but listen a moment yet for that was not quite all my dream the twilight drew swiftly to the dark and i could hardly see the great pyramid when there came a heavy murmuring sound in the air and a horned beetle with terrible claws fell on the sand at my feet with a blow like the beat of a hammer then it stood up on its hind claws and waved its pincers at me and its fore claws became strong arms and hands one grasping real iron pincers and the other a huge hammer and it had a helmet on its head without any eyelet holes that i could see and its two hind claws became strong crooked legs with feet bent inwards and so there stood by me a dwarf in glossy black armor ribbed and embossed like a beetles back leaning on his hammer and i could not speak for wonder but he spoke with a murmur like the dying away of a beat upon a bell he said i will make neiths great pyramid small i am the lower pthah and have power over fire i can wither the strong things and strengthen the weak and everything that is great i can make small and everything that is little i can make great then he turned to the angle of the pyramid and limped towards it and the pyramid grew deep purple and then red like blood and then pale rosecolor like fire and i saw that it glowed with fire from within and the lower pthah touched it with the hand that held the pincers and it sank down like the sand in an hourglassthen drew itself together and sank still and became nothing it seemed to me but the armed dwarf stooped down and took it into his hand and brought it to me saying everything that is great i can make like this pyramid and give into mens hands to destroy and i saw that he had a little pyramid in his hand with as many courses in it as the large one and built like thatonly so small and because it glowed still i was afraid to touch it but pthah said touch itfor i have bound the fire within it so that it cannot burn so i touched it and took it into my own hand and it was cold only red like a ruby and pthah laughed and became like a beetle again and buried himself in the sand fiercely throwing it back over his shoulders and it seemed to me as if he would draw me down with him into the sand and i started back and woke holding the little pyramid so fast in my hand that it hurt me  egypt holding what in your hand  l the little pyramid  egypt neiths pyramid  l neiths i believe though not built for asychis i know only that it is a little rosy transparent pyramid built of more courses of bricks than i can count it being made so small you dont believe me of course egyptian infidel but there it is giving crystal of rose fluor  confused examination by crowded audience over each others shoulders and under each others arms disappointment begins to manifest itself  sibyl not quite knowing why she and others are disappointed but you showed us this the other day  l yes but you would not look at it the other day  sibyl but was all that fine dream only about this  l what finer thing could a dream be about than this it is small if you will but when you begin to think of things rightly the ideas of smallness and largeness pass away the making of this pyramid was in reality just as wonderful as the dream i have been telling you and just as incomprehensible it was not i suppose as swift but quite as grand things are done as swiftly when neith makes crystals of snow it needs a great deal more marshaling of the atoms by her flaming arrows than it does to make crystals like this one and that is done in a moment  egypt but how you do puzzle us why do you say neith does it you dont mean that she is a real spirit do you  l what i mean is of little consequence what the egyptians meant who called her neithor homer who called her athenaor solomon who called her by a word which the greeks render as sophia you must judge for yourselves but her testimony is always the same and all nations have received it i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth and my delights were with the sons of men  mary but is not that only a personification  l if it be what will you gain by unpersonifying it or what right have you to do so cannot you accept the image given you in its life and listen like children to the words which chiefly belong to you as children i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me  they are all quiet for a minute or two questions begin to appear in their eyes  i cannot talk to you any more today take that rosecrystal away with you and think      lecture 3  the crystal life   a very dull lecture willfully brought upon themselves by the elder children some of the young ones have however managed to get in by mistake scene the schoolroom  l so i am to stand up here merely to be asked questions today miss mary am i  mary yes and you must answer them plainly without telling us any more stories you are quite spoiling the children the poor little things heads are turning round like kaleidoscopes and they dont know in the least what you mean nor do we old ones either for that matter today you must really tell us nothing but facts  l i am sworn but you wont like it a bit  mary now first of all what do you mean by bricksare the smallest particles of minerals all of some accurate shape like bricks  l i do not know miss mary i do not even know if anybody knows the smallest atoms which are visibly and practically put together to make large crystals may better be described as limited in fixed directions than as of fixed forms but i can tell you nothing clear about ultimate atoms you will find the idea of little bricks or perhaps of little spheres available for all the uses you will have to put it to  mary well its very provoking one seems always to be stopped just when one is coming to the very thing one wants to know  l no mary for we should not wish to know anything but what is easily and assuredly knowable theres no end to it if i could show you or myself a group of ultimate atoms quite clearly in this magnifying glass we should both be presently vexed because we could not break them in two pieces and see their insides  mary well then next what do you mean by the flying of the bricks what is it the atoms do that is like flying  l when they are dissolved or uncrystallized they are really separated from each other like a swarm of gnats in the air or like a shoal of fish in the seagenerally at about equal distances in currents of solutions or at different depths of them one part may be more full of the dissolved atoms than another but on the whole you may think of them as equidistant like the spots in the print of your gown if they are separated by force of heat only the substance is said to be melted if they are separated by any other substance as particles of sugar by water they are said to be dissolved note this distinction carefully all of you  dora i will be very particular when next you tell me there isnt sugar enough in your tea i will say it is not yet dissolved sir  l i tell you what shall be dissolved miss dora and thats the present parliament if the members get too saucy  dora folds her hands and casts down her eyes  l proceeds in state now miss mary you know already i believe that nearly everything will melt under a sufficient heat like wax limestone melts under pressure sand melts granite melts the lava of a volcano is a mixed mass of many kinds of rocks melted and any melted substance nearly always if not always crystallizes as it cools the more slowly the more perfectly water melts at what we call the freezing but might just as wisely though not as conveniently call the melting point and radiates as it cools into the most beautiful of all known crystals glass melts at a greater heat and will crystallize if you let it cool slowly enough in stars much like snow gold needs more heat to melt it but crystallizes also exquisitely as i will presently show you arsenic and sulphur crystallize from their vapors now in any of these cases either of melted dissolved or vaporous bodies the particles are usually separated from each other either by heat or by an intermediate substance and in crystallizing they are both brought nearer to each other and packed so as to fit as closely as possible the essential part of the business being not the bringing together but the packing who packed your trunk for you last holidays isabel  isabel lily does always  l and how much can you allow for lilys good packing in guessing what will go into the trunk  isabel oh i bring twice as much as the trunk holds lily always gets everything in  lily ah but isey if you only knew what a time it takes and since youve had those great hard buttons on your frocks i cant do anything with them buttons wont go anywhere you know  l yes lily it would be well if she only knew what a time it takes and i wish any of us knew what a time crystallization takes for that is consummately fine packing the particles of the rock are thrown down just as isabel brings her thingsin a heap and innumerable lilies not of the valley but of the rock come to pack them but it takes such a time  however the bestout and out the bestway of understanding the thing is to crystallize yourselves  the audience ourselves  l yes not merely as you did the other day carelessly on the schoolroom forms but carefully and finely out in the playground you can play at crystallization there as much as you please  kathleen and jessie oh howhow  l first you must put yourselves together as close as you can in the middle of the grass and form for first practice any figure you like  jessie any dancing figure do you mean  l no i mean a square or a cross or a diamond any figure you like standing close together you had better outline it first on the turf with sticks or pebbles so as to see that it is rightly drawn then get into it and enlarge or diminish it at one side till you are all quite in it and no empty space left  dora crinoline and all  l the crinoline may stand eventually for rough crystalline surface unless you pin it in and then you may make a polished crystal of yourselves  lily oh well pin it inwell pin it in  l then when you are all in the figure let every one note her place and who is next her on each side and let the outsiders count how many places they stand from the corners  kathleen yes yesand then  l then you must scatter all over the playgroundright over it from side to side and end to end and put yourselves all at equal distances from each other everywhere you neednt mind doing it very accurately but so as to be nearly equidistant not less than about three yards apart from each other on every side  jessie we can easily cut pieces of string of equal length to hold and then l then at a given signal let everybody walk at the same rate towards the outlined figure in the middle you had better sing as you walk that will keep you in good time and as you close in towards it let each take her place and the next comers fit themselves in beside the first ones till you are all in the figure again  kathleen oh how we shall run against each other what fun it will be  l no no miss katie i cant allow any running against each other the atoms never do that whatever human creatures do you must all know your places and find your way to them without jostling  lily but how ever shall we do that  isabel mustnt the ones in the middle be the nearest and the outside ones farther offwhen we go away to scatter i mean  l yes you must be very careful to keep your order you will soon find out how to do it it is only like soldiers forming square except that each must stand still in her place as she reaches it and the others come round her and you will have much more complicated figures afterwards to form than squares  isabel ill put a stone at my place then i shall know it  l you might each nail a bit of paper to the turf at your place with your name upon it but it would be of no use for if you dont know your places you will make a fine piece of business of it while you are looking for your names and isabel if with a little head and eyes and a brain all of them very good and serviceable of their kind as such things go you think you cannot know your place without a stone at it after examining it wellhow do you think each atom knows its place when it never was there before and theres no stone at it  isabel but does every atom know its place  l how else could it get there  mary are they not attracted into their places  l cover a piece of paper with spots at equal intervals and then imagine any kind of attraction you choose or any law of attraction to exist between the spots and try how on that permitted supposition you can attract them into the figure of a maltese cross in the middle of the paper  mary having tried it yes i see that i cannotone would need all kinds of attractions in different ways at different places but you do not mean that the atoms are alive  l what is it to be alive  dora there now youre going to be provoking i know  l i do not see why it should be provoking to be asked what it is to be alive do you think you dont know whether you are alive or not  isabel skips to the end of the room and back  l yes isabel thats all very fine and you and i may call that being alive but a modern philosopher calls it being in a mode of motion it requires a certain quantity of heat to take you to the sideboard and exactly the same quantity to bring you back again thats all  isabel no it isnt and besides im not hot  l i am sometimes at the way they talk however you know isabel you might have been a particle of a mineral and yet have been carried round the room or anywhere else by chemical forces in the liveliest way  isabel yes but i wasnt carried i carried myself  l the fact is mousie the difficulty is not so much to say what makes a thing alive as what makes it a self as soon as you are shut off from the rest of the universe into a self you begin to be alive  violet indignant oh surelysurely that cannot be so is not all the life of the soul in communion not separation  l there can be no communion where there is no distinction but we shall be in an abyss of metaphysics presently if we dont look out and besides we must not be too grand today for the younger children well be grand some day by ourselves if we must the younger children are not pleased and prepare to remonstrate but knowing by experience that all conversations in which the word communion occurs are unintelligible think better of it meantime for broad answer about the atoms i do not think we should use the word life of any energy which does not belong to a given form a seed or an egg or a young animal are properly called alive with respect to the force belonging to those forms which consistently develops that form and no other but the force which crystallizes a mineral appears to be chiefly external and it does not produce an entirely determinate and individual form limited in size but only an aggregation in which some limiting laws must be observed  mary but i do not see much difference that way between a crystal and a tree  l add then that the mode of the energy in a living thing implies a continual change in its elements and a period for its end so you may define life by its attached negative death and still more by its attached positive birth but i wont be plagued any more about this just now if you choose to think the crystals alive do and welcome rocks have always been called living in their native place  mary theres one question more then ive done  l only one  mary only one  l but if it is answered wont it turn into two  mary no i think it will remain single and be comfortable  l let me hear it  mary you know we are to crystallize ourselves out of the whole playground now what playground have the minerals where are they scattered before they are crystallized and where are the crystals generally made  l that sounds to me more like three questions than one mary if it is only one it is a wide one  mary i did not say anything about the width of it  l well i must keep it within the best compass i can when rocks either dry from a moist state or cool from a heated state they necessarily alter in bulk and cracks or open spaces form in them in all directions these cracks must be filled up with solid matter or the rock would eventually become a ruinous heap so sometimes by water sometimes by vapor sometimes nobody knows how crystallizable matter is brought from somewhere and fastens itself in these open spaces so as to bind the rock together again with crystal cement a vast quantity of hollows are formed in lavas by bubbles of gas just as the holes are left in bread well baked in process of time these cavities are generally filled with various crystals  mary but where does the crystallizing substance come from  l sometimes out of the rock itself sometimes from below or above through the veins the entire substance of the contracting rock may be filled with liquid pressed into it so as to fill every poreor with mineral vaporor it may be so charged at one place and empty at another theres no end to the may bes but all that you need fancy for our present purpose is that hollows in the rocks like the caves in derbyshire are traversed by liquids or vapor containing certain elements in a more or less free or separate state which crystallize on the cave walls  sibyl there nowmary has had all her questions answered its my turn to have mine  l ah theres a conspiracy among you i see i might have guessed as much  dora im sure you ask us questions enough how can you have the heart when you dislike so to be asked them yourself  l my dear child if people do not answer questions it does not matter how many they are asked because theyve no trouble with them now when i ask you questions i never expect to be answered but when you ask me you always do and its not fair  dora very well we shall understand next time  sibyl no but seriously we all want to ask one thing more quite dreadfully  l and i dont want to be asked it quite dreadfully but youll have your own way of course  sibyl we none of us understand about the lower pthah it was not merely yesterday but in all we have read about him in wilkinson or in any book we cannot understand what the egyptians put their god into that ugly little deformed shape for  l well im glad its that sort of question because i can answer anything i like to that  egypt anything you like will do quite well for us we shall be pleased with the answer if you are  l i am not so sure of that most gracious queen for i must begin by the statement that queens seem to have disliked all sorts of work in those days as much as some queens dislike sewing today  egypt now its too bad and just when i was trying to say the civillest thing i could  l but egypt why did you tell me you disliked sewing so  egypt did not i show you how the thread cuts my fingers and i always get cramp somehow in my neck if i sew long  l well i suppose the egyptian queens thought everybody got cramp in their neck if they sewed long and that thread always cut peoples fingers at all events every kind of manual labor was despised both by them and the greeks and while they owned the real good and fruit of it they yet held it a degradation to all who practiced it also knowing the laws of life thoroughly they perceived that the special practice necessary to bring any manual art to perfection strengthened the body distortedly one energy or member gaining at the expense of the rest they especially dreaded and despised any kind of work that had to be done near fire yet feeling what they owed to it in metalwork as the basis of all other work they expressed this mixed reverence and scorn in the varied types of the lame hephaestus and the lower pthah  sibyl but what did you mean by making him say everything great i can make small and everything small great  l i had my own separate meaning in that we have seen in modern times the power of the lower pthah developed in a separate way which no greek nor egyptian could have conceived it is the character of pure and eyeless manual labor to conceive everything as subjected to it and in reality to disgrace and diminish all that is so subjected aggrandizing itself and the thought of itself at the expense of all noble things i heard an orator and a good one too at the working mens college the other day make a great point in a description of our railroads saying with grandly conducted emphasis they have made man greater and the world less his working audience were mightily pleased they thought it so very fine a thing to be made bigger themselves and all the rest of the world less i should have enjoyed asking them but it would have been a pitythey were so pleased how much less they would like to have the world madeand whether at present those of them really felt the biggest men who lived in the least houses  sibyl but then why did you make pthah say that he could make weak things strong and small things great  l my dear he is a boaster and selfassertor by nature but it is so far true for instance we used to have a fair in our neighborhooda very fine fair we thought it you never saw such an one but if you look at the engraving of turners st catherines hill you will see what it was like there were curious booths carried on poles and peepshows and music with plenty of drums and cymbals and much barleysugar and gingerbread and the like and in the alleys of this fair the london populace would enjoy themselves after their fashion very thoroughly well the little pthah set to work upon it one day he made the wooden poles into iron ones and put them across like his own crooked legs so that you always fall over them if you dont look where you are going and he turned all the canvas into panes of glass and put it up on his iron crosspoles and made all the little booths into one great boothand people said it was very fine and a new style of architecture and mr dickens said nothing was ever like it in fairyland which was very true and then the little pthah set to work to put fine fairings in it and he painted the nineveh bulls afresh with the blackest eyes he could paint because he had none himself and he got the angels down from lincoln choir and gilded their wings like his gingerbread of old times and he sent for everything else he could think of and put it in his booth there are the casts of niobe and her children and the chimpanzee and the wooden caffres and newzealanders and the shakespeare house and le grand blondin and le petit blondin and handel and mozart and no end of shops and buns and beer and all the littlepthahworshippers say never was anything so sublime  sibyl now do you mean to say you never go to these crystal palace concerts theyre as good as good can be  l i dont go to the thundering things with a million of bad voices in them when i want a song i get julia mannering and lucy bertram and counselor pleydell to sing we be three poor mariners to me then ive no headache next morning but i do go to the smaller concerts when i can for they are very good as you say sibyl and i always get a reserved seat somewhere near the orchestra where i am sure i can see the kettledrummer drum  sibyl now do be serious for one minute  l i am seriousnever was more so you know one cant see the modulation of violinists fingers but one can see the vibration of the drummers hand and its lovely  sibyl but fancy going to a concert not to hear but to see  l yes it is very absurd the quite right thing i believe is to go there to talk i confess however that in most music when very well done the doing of it is to me the chiefly interesting part of the business im always thinking how good it would be for the fat supercilious people who care so little for their half crowns worth to be set to try and do a halfcrowns worth of anything like it  mary but surely that crystal palace is a great good and help to the people of london  l the fresh air of the norwood hills is or was my dear but they are spoiling that with smoke as fast as they can and the palace as they call it is a better place for them by much than the old fair and it is always there instead of for three days only and it shuts up at proper hours of night and good use may be made of the things in it if you know how but as for its teaching the people it will teach them nothing but the lowest of the lower pthahs worknothing but hammer and tongs i saw a wonderful piece of his doing in the place only the other day some unhappy metalworkeri am not sure if it was not a metal working firmhad taken three years to make a golden eagle  sibyl of real gold  l no of bronze or copper or some of their foul patent metals it is no matter what i meant a model of our chief british eagle every feather was made separately and every filament of every feather separately and so joined on and all the quills modeled of the right length and right section and at last the whole cluster of them fastened together you know children i dont think much of my own drawing but take my proud word for once that when i go to the zoological gardens and happen to have a bit of chalk in my pocket and the gray harpy will sit without screwing his head round for thirty secondsi can do a better thing of him in that time than the three years work of this industrious firm for during the thirty seconds the eagle is my objectnot myself and during the three years the firms object in every fiber of bronze it made was itself and not the eagle that is the true meaning of the little pthahs having no eyeshe can see only himself the egyptian beetle was not quite the full type of him our northern ground beetle is a truer one it is beautiful to see it at work gathering its treasures such as they are into little round balls and pushing them home with the strong wrong end of ithead downmost all the waylike a modern political economist with his ball of capital declaring that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its virtues but away with you children now for im getting cross  dora im going downstairs i shall take care at any rate that there are no little pthahs in the kitchen cupboards      lecture 4  the crystal orders   a working lecture in the large schoolroom with experimental interludes the great bell has rung unexpectedly  kathleen entering disconsolate though first at the summons oh dear oh dear what a day was ever anything so provoking just when we wanted to crystallize ourselvesand im sure its going to rain all day long  l so am i kate the sky has quite an irish way with it but i dont see why irish girls should also look so dismal fancy that you dont want to crystallize yourselves you didnt the day before yesterday and you were not unhappy when it rained then  florrie ah but we do want today and the rains so tiresome  l that is to say children that because you are all the richer by the expectation of playing at a new game you choose to make yourselves unhappier than when you had nothing to look forward to but the old ones  isabel but then to have to waitwaitwait and before weve tried itand perhaps it will rain tomorrow too  l it may also rain the day after tomorrow we can make ourselves uncomfortable to any extent with perhapses isabel you may stick perhapses into your little minds like pins till you are as uncomfortable as the lilliputians made gulliver with their arrows when he would not lie quiet  isabel but what are we to do today  l to be quiet for one thing like gulliver when he saw there was nothing better to be done and to practice patience i can tell you children that requires nearly as much practicing as music and we are continually losing our lessons when the master comes now today heres a nice little adagio lesson for us if we play it properly  isabel but i dont like that sort of lesson i cant play it properly  l can you play a mozart sonata yet isabel the more need to practice all ones life is a music if one touches the notes rightly and in time but there must be no hurry  kathleen im sure theres no music in stopping in on a rainy day  l theres no music in a rest katie that i know of but theres the making of music in it and people are always missing that part of the lifemelody and scrambling on without counting not that its easy to count but nothing on which so much depends ever is easy people are always talking of perseverance and courage and fortitude but patience is the finest and worthiest part of fortitudeand the rarest too i know twenty persevering girls for one patient one but it is only that twentyfirst who can do her work out and out or enjoy it for patience lies at the root of all pleasures as well as of all powers hope herself ceases to be happiness when impatience companions her  isabel and lily sit down on the floor and fold their hands the others follow their example  good children but thats not quite the way of it neither folded hands are not necessarily resigned ones the patience who really smiles at grief usually stands or walks or even runs she seldom sits though she may sometimes have to do it for many a day poor thing by monuments or like chaucers with face pale upon a hill of sand but we are not reduced to that today suppose we use this calamitous forenoon to choose the shapes we are to crystallize into we know nothing about them yet  the pictures of resignation rise from the floor not in the patientest manner general applause  mary with one or two others the very thing we wanted to ask you about  lily we looked at the books about crystals but they are so dreadful  l well lily we must go through a little dreadfulness thats a fact no road to any good knowledge is wholly among the lilies and the grass there is rough climbing to be done always but the crystalbooks are a little too dreadful most of them i admit and we shall have to be content with very little of their help you know as you cannot stand on each others heads you can only make yourselves into the sections of crystalsthe figures they show when they are cut through and we will choose some that will be quite easy you shall make diamonds of yourselves  isabel oh no no we wont be diamonds please  l yes you shall isabel they are very pretty things if the jewelers and the kings and queens would only let them alone you shall make diamonds of yourselves and rubies of yourselves and emeralds and irish diamonds two of thosewith lily in the middle of one which will be very orderly of course and kathleen in the middle of the other for which we will hope the best and you shall make derbyshire spar of yourselves and iceland spar and gold and silver andquicksilver theres enough of in you without any making  mary now you know the children will be getting quite wild we must really get pencils and paper and begin properly  l wait a minute miss mary i think as we the schoolroom clear today ill try to give you some notion of the three great orders or ranks of crystals into which all the others seem more or less to fall we shall only want one figure a day in the playground and that can be drawn in a minute but the general ideas had better be fastened first i must show you a great many minerals so let me have three tables wheeled into the three windows that we may keep our specimens separatewe will keep the three orders of crystals on separate tables  first interlude of pushing and pulling and spreading of baize covers violet not particularly minding what she is about gets herself jammed into a corner and bid to stand out of the way on which she devotes herself to meditation  violet after interval of meditation how strange it is that everything seems to divide into threes  l everything doesnt divide into threes ivy wont though shamrock will and daisies wont though lilies will  violet but all the nicest things seem to divide into threes  l violets wont  violet no i should think not indeed but i mean the great things  l ive always heard the globe had four quarters  isabel well but you know you said it hadnt any quarters at all so maynt it really be divided into three  l if it were divided into no more than three on the outside of it isabel it would be a fine world to live in and if it were divided into three in the inside of it it would soon be no world to live in at all  dora we shall never get to the crystals at this rate aside to mary he will get off into political economy before we know where we are aloud but the crystals are divided into three then  l no but there are three general notions by which we may best get hold of them then between these notions there are other notions  lily alarmed a great many and shall we have to learn them all  l more than a great manya quite infinite many so you cannot learn them all  lily greatly relieved then may we only learn the three  l certainly unless when you have got those three notions you want to have some more notionswhich would not surprise me but well try for the three first katie you broke your coral necklace this morning  kathleen oh who told you it was in jumping im so sorry  l im very glad can you fetch me the beads of it  kathleen ive lost some here are the rest in my pocket if i can only get them out  l you mean to get them out some day i suppose so try now i want them  kathleen empties her pocket on the floor the beads disperse the school disperses also second interludehunting piece  l after waiting patiently for a quarter of an hour to isabel who comes up from under the table with her hair all about her ears and the last findable beads in her hand mice are useful little things sometimes now mousie i want all those beads crystallized how many ways are there of putting them in order  isabel well first one would string them i suppose  l yes thats the first way you cannot string ultimate atoms but you can put them in a row and then they fasten themselves together somehow into a long rod or needle we will call these needlecrystals what would be the next way  isabel i suppose as we are to get together in the playground when it stops raining in different shapes  l yes put the beads together then in the simplest form you can to begin with put them into a square and pack them close  isabel after careful endeavor i cant get them closer  l that will do now you may see beforehand that if you try to throw yourselves into square in this confused way you will never know your places so you had better consider every square as made of rods put side by side take four beads of equal size first isabel put them into a little square that you may consider as made up of two rods of two beads each then you can make a square a size larger out of three rods of three then the next square may be a size larger how many rods lily  lily four rods of four beads each i suppose  l yes and then five rods of five and so on but now look here make another square of four beads again you see they leave a little opening in the center  isabel pushing two opposite ones closer together now they dont  l no but now it isnt a square and by pushing the two together you have pushed the two others farther apart  isabel and yet somehow they all seem closer than they were  l yes for before each of them only touched two of the others but now each of the two in the middle touches the other three take away one of the outsiders isabel now you have three in a trianglethe smallest triangle you can make out of the beads now put a rod of three beads on at one side so you have a triangle of six beads but just the shape of the first one next a rod of four on the side of that and you have a triangle of ten beads then a rod of five on the side of that and you have a triangle of fifteen thus you have a square with five beads on the side and a triangle with five beads on the side equalsided therefore like the square so however few or many you may be you may soon learn how to crystallize quickly into these two figures which are the foundation of form in the commonest and therefore actually the most important as well as in the rarest and therefore by our esteem the most important minerals of the world look at this in my hand  violet why it is leaf gold  l yes but beaten by no mans hammer or rather not beaten at all but woven besides feel the weight of it there is gold enough there to gild the walls and ceiling if it were beaten thin  violet how beautiful and it glitters like a leaf covered with frost  l you only think it so beautiful because you know it is gold it is not prettier in reality than a bit of brass for it is transylvanian gold and they say there is a foolish gnome in the mines there who is always wanting to live in the moon and so alloys all the gold with a little silver i dont know how that may be but the silver always is in the gold and if he does it its very provoking of him for no gold is woven so fine anywhere else  mary who has been looking through her magnifying glass but this is not woven this is all made of little triangles  l say patched then if you must be so particular but if you fancy all those triangles small as they are and many of them are infinitely small made up again of rods and those of grains as we built our great triangle of the beads what word will you take for the manufacture  may theres no wordit is beyond words  l yes and that would matter little were it not beyond thoughts too but at all events this yellow leaf of dead gold shed not from the ruined woodlands but the ruined rocks will help you to remember the second kind of crystals leafcrystals or foliated crystals though i show you the form in gold first only to make a strong impression on you for gold is not generally or characteristically crystallized in leaves the real type of foliated crystals is this thing mica which if you once feel well and break well you will always know again and you will often have occasion to know it for you will find it everywhere nearly in hill countries  kathleen if we break it well may we break it  l to powder if you like  surrenders plate of brown mica to public investigation third interlude it sustains severely philosophic al treatment at all hands  florrie to whom the last fragments have descended always leaves and leaves and nothing but leaves or white dust  l that dust itself is nothing but finer leaves  shows them to florrie through magnifying glass  isabel peeping over florries shoulder but then this bit under the glass looks like that bit out of the glass if we could break this bit under the glass what would it be like  l it would be all leaves still  isabel and then if we broke those again  l all less leaves still  isabel impatient and if we broke them again and again and again and again and again  l well i suppose you would come to a limit if you could only see it notice that the little flakes already differ somewhat from the large ones because i can bend them up and down and they stay bent while the large flake though it bent easily a little way sprang back when you let it go and broke when you tried to bend it far and a large mass would not bend at all  mary would that leaf gold separate into finer leaves in the same way  l no and therefore as i told you it is not a characteristic specimen of a foliated crystallization the little triangles are portions of solid crystals and so they are in this which looks like a black mica but you see it is made up of triangles like the gold and stands almost accurately as an intermediate link in crystals between mica and gold yet this is the commonest as gold the rarest of metals  mary is it iron i never saw iron so bright  l it is rust of iron finely crystallized from its resemblance to mica it is often called micaceous iron  kathleen may we break this too  l no for i could not easily get such another crystal besides it would not break like the mica it is much harder but take the glass again and look at the fineness of the jagged edges of the triangles where they lap over each other the gold has the same but you see them better here terrace above terrace countless and in successive angles like superb fortified bastions  may but all foliated crystals are not made of triangles  l far from it mica is occasionally so but usually of hexagons and here is a foliated crystal made of squares which will show you that the leaves of the rockland have their summer green as well as their autumnal gold  florrie oh oh oh jumps for joy  l did you never see a bit of green leaf before florrie  florrie yes but never so bright as that and not in a stone  l if you will look at the leaves of the trees in sunshine after a shower you will find they are much brighter than that and surely they are none the worse for being on stalks instead of in stones  florrie yes but then there are so many of them one never looks i suppose  l now you have it florrie  violet sighing there are so many beautiful things we never see  l you need not sigh for that violet but i will tell you what we should all sigh forthat there are so many ugly things we never see  violet but we dont want to see ugly things  l you had better say we dont want to suffer them you ought to be glad in thinking how much more beauty god has made than human eyes can ever see but not glad in thinking how much more evil man has made than his own soul can ever conceive much more than his hands can ever heal  violet i dont understandhow is that like the leaves  l the same law holds in our neglect of multiplied pain as in our neglect of multiplied beauty florrie jumps for joy at sight of half an inch of a green leaf in a brown stone and takes more notice of it than of all the green in the wood and you or i or any of us would be unhappy if any single human creature beside us were in sharp pain but we can read at breakfast day after day of men being killed and of women and children dying of hunger faster than the leaves strew the brooks in vallombrosaand then go out to play croquet as if nothing had happened  may but we do not see the people being killed or dying  l you did not see your brother when you got the telegram the other day saying he was ill may but you cried for him and played no croquet but we cannot talk of these things now and what is more you must let me talk straight on for a little while and ask no questions till ive done for we branch exfoliate i should say mineralogically always into something elsethough thats my fault more than yours but i must go straight on now you have got a distinct notion i hope of leaf crystals and you see the sort of look they have you can easily remember that folium is latin for a leaf and that the separate flakes of mica or any other such stones are called folia but because mica is the most characteristic of these stones other things that are like it in structure are called micas thus we have uranmica which is the green leaf i showed you and copper mica which is another like it made chiefly of copper and this foliated iron is called micaceous iron you have then these two great orders needlecrystals made probably of grains in rows and leafcrystals made probably of needles interwoven now lastly there are crystals of a third order in heaps or knots or masses which may be made either of leaves laid one upon another or of needles bound like roman fasces and mica itself when it is well crystallized puts itself into such masses as if to show us how others are made here is a brown sixsided crystal quite as beautifully chiseled at the sides as any castle tower but you see it is entirely built of folia of mica one laid above another which break away the moment i touch the edge with my knife now here is another hexagonal tower of just the same size and color which i want you to compare with the mica carefully but as i cannot wait for you to do it just now i must tell you quickly what main differences to look for first you will feel it far heavier than the mica then though its surface looks quite micaceous in the folia of it when you try them with the knife you will find you cannot break them away  kathleen may i try  l yes you mistrusting katie heres my strong knife for you experimental pause kathleen doing her best youll have that knife shutting on your finger presently kate and i dont know a girl who would like less to have her hand tied up for a week  kathleen who also does not like to be beatengiving up the knife despondently what can the nasty hard thing be  l it is nothing but indurated clay kate very hard set certainly yet not so hard as it might be if it were thoroughly well crystallized you would see none of those micaceous fractures and the stone would be quite red and clear all through  kathleen oh cannot you show us one  l egypt can if you ask her she has a beautiful one in the clasp of her favorite bracelet  kathleen why thats a ruby  l well so is that thing youve been scratching at  kathleen my goodness takes up the stone again very delicately and drops it general consternation  l never mind katie you might drop it from the top of the house and do it no harm but though you really are a very good girl and as goodnatured as anybody can possibly be remember you have your faults like other people and if i were you the next time i wanted to assert anything energetically i would assert it by my badness not my goodness  kathleen ah now its too bad of you  l well then ill invoke on occasion my toobadness but you may as well pick up the ruby now you have dropped it and look carefully at the beautiful hexagonal lines which gleam on its surface and here is a pretty white sapphire essentially the same stone as the ruby in which you will see the same lovely structure like the threads of the finest white cobweb i do not know what is the exact method of a rubys construction but you see by these lines what fine construction there is even in this hardest of stones after the diamond which usually appears as a massive lump or knot there is therefore no real mineralogical distinction between needle crystals and knotted crystals but practically crystallized masses throw themselves into one of the three groups we have been examining today and appear either as needles as folia or as knots when they are in needles or fibers they make the stones or rocks formed out of them fibrous when they are in folia they make them foliated when they are in knots or grains granular fibrous rocks are comparatively rare in mass but fibrous minerals are innumerable and it is often a question which really no one but a young lady could possibly settle whether one should call the fibers composing them threads or needles here is amianthus for instance which is quite as fine and soft as any cotton thread you ever sewed with and here is sulphide of bismuth with sharper points and brighter luster than your finest needles have and fastened in white webs of quartz more delicate than your finest lace and here is sulphide of antimony which looks like mere purple wool but it is all of purple needle crystals and here is red oxide of copper you must not breathe on it as you look or you may blow some of the films of it off the stone which is simply a woven tissue of scarlet silk however these finer threadforms are comparatively rare while the bolder and needle like crystals occur constantly so that i believe needle crystal is the best word the grand one is acicular crystal but sibyl will tell you it is all the same only less easily understood and therefore more scientific then the leaf crystals as i said form an immense mass of foliated rocks and the granular crystals which are of many kinds form essentially granular or granitic and porphyritic rocks and it is always a point of more interest to me and i think will ultimately be to you to consider the causes which force a given mineral to take any one of these three general forms than what the peculiar geometrical limitations are belonging to its own crystals footnote note iv it is more interesting to me for instance to try and find out why the red oxide of copper usually crystallizing in cubes or octahedrons makes itself exquisitely out of its cubes into this red silk in one particular cornish mine than what are the absolutely necessary angles of the octahedron which is its common form at all events that mathematical part of crystallography is quite beyond girls strength but these questions of the various tempers and manners of crystals are not only comprehensible by you but full of the most curious teaching for you for in the fulfillment to the best of their power of their adopted form under given circumstances there are conditions entirely resembling those of human virtue and indeed expressible under no term so proper as that of the virtue or courage of crystalswhich if you are not afraid of the crystals making you ashamed of yourselves we will by to get some notion of tomorrow but it will be a byelecture and more about yourselves than the minerals dont come unless you like  mary im sure the crystals will make us ashamed of ourselves but well come for all that  l meantime look well and quietly over these needle or thread crystals and those on the other two tables with magnifying glasses and see what thoughts will come into your little heads about them for the best thoughts are generally those which come without being forced one does not know how and so i hope you will get through your wet day patiently      lecture 5  crystal virtues   a quiet talk in the afternoon by the sunniest window of the drawingroom present florrie isabel may lucilla kathleen dora mary and some others who have saved time for the bye lecture  l so you have really come like good girls to be made ashamed of yourselves  dora very meekly no we neednt be made so we always are  l well i believe thats truer than most pretty speeches but you know you saucy girl some people have more reason to be so than others are you sure everybody is as well as you  the general voice yes yes everybody  l what florrie ashamed of herself  florrie hides behind the curtain  l and isabel  isabel hides under the table  l and mary  mary runs into the corner behind the piano  l and lucilla  lucilla hides her face in her hands  l dear dear but this will never do i shall have to tell you of the faults of the crystals instead of virtues to put you in heart again  may coming out of her corner oh have the crystals faults like us  l certainly may their best virtues are shown in fighting their faults and some have a great many faults and some are very naughty crystals indeed  florrie from behind her curtain as naughty as me  isabel peeping out from under the tablecloth or me  l well i dont know they never forget their syntax children when once theyve been taught it but i think some of them are on the whole worse than any of you not that its amiable of you to look so radiant all in a minute on that account  dora oh but its so much more comfortable  everybody seems to recover their spirits eclipse of florrie and isabel terminates  l what kindly creatures girls are after all to their neighbors failings i think you may be ashamed of yourselves indeed now children i can tell you you shall hear of the highest crystalline merits that i can think of today and i wish there were more of them but crystals have a limited though a stern code of morals and their essential virtues are but twothe first is to be pure and the second to be well shaped  mary pure does that mean cleartransparent  l no unless in the case of a transparent substance you cannot have a transparent crystal of gold but you may have a perfectly pure one  isabel but you said it was the shape that made things be crystals therefore oughtnt their shape to be their first virtue not their second  l right you troublesome mousie but i call their shape only their second virtue because it depends on time and accident and things which the crystal cannot help if it is cooled too quickly or shaken it must take what shape it can but it seems as if even then it had in itself the power of rejecting impurity if it has crystalline life enough here is a crystal of quartz well enough shaped in its way but it seems to have been languid and sick at heart and some white milky substance has got into it and mixed itself up with it all through it makes the quartz quite yellow if you hold it up to the light and milky blue on the surface here is another broken into a thousand separate facets and out of all traceable shape but as pure as a mountain spring i like this one best  the audience so do iand iand i  mary would a crystallographer  l i think so he would find many more laws curiously exemplified in the irregularly grouped but pure crystal but it is a futile question this of first or second purity is in most cases a prior if not a nobler virtue at all events it is most convenient to think about it first  mary but what ought we to think about it is there much to be thoughti mean much to puzzle one  l i dont know what you call much it is a long time since i met with anything in which there was little theres not much in this perhaps the crystal must be either dirty or cleanand theres an end so it is with ones hands and with ones heart only you can wash your hands without changing them but not hearts nor crystals on the whole while you are young it will be as well to take care that your hearts dont want much washing for they may perhaps need wringing also when they do  audience doubtful and uncomfortable lucilla at last takes courage  lucilla oh but surely sir we cannot make our hearts clean  l not easily lucilla so you had better keep them so when they are  lucilla when they are but sir  l well  lucilla sirsurelyare we not told that they are all evil  l wait a little lucilla that is difficult ground you are getting upon and we must keep to our crystals till at least we understand what their good and evil consist in they may help us afterwards to some useful hints about our own i said that their goodness consisted chiefly in purity of substance and perfectness of form but those are rather the effects of their goodness than the goodness itself the inherent virtues of the crystals resulting in these outer conditions might really seem to be best described in the words we should use respecting living creatures force of heart and steadiness of purpose there seem to be in some crystals from the beginning an unconquerable purity of vital power and strength of crystal spirit whatever dead substance unacceptant of this energy comes in their way is either rejected or forced to take some beautiful subordinate form the purity of the crystal remains unsullied and every atom of it bright with coherent energy then the second condition is that from the beginning of its whole structure a fine crystal seems to have determined that it will be of a certain size and of a certain shape it persists in this plan and completes it here is a perfect crystal of quartz for you it is of an unusual form and one which it might seem very difficult to builda pyramid with convex sides composed of other minor pyramids but there is not a flaw in its contour throughout not one of its myriads of component sides but is as bright as a jewelers faceted work and far finer if you saw it close the crystal points are as sharp as javelins their edges will cut glass with a touch anything more resolute consummate determinate in form cannot be conceived here on the other hand is a crystal of the same substance in a perfectly simple type of forma plain sixsided prism but from its base to its pointand it is nine inches longit has never for one instant made up its mind what thickness it will have it seems to have begun by making itself as thick as it thought possible with the quantity of material at command still not being as thick as it would like to be it has clumsily glued on more substance at one of its sides then it has thinned itself in a panic of economy then puffed itself out again then starved one side to enlarge another then warped itself quite out of its first line opaque roughsurfaced jagged on the edge distorted in the spine it exhibits a quite human image of decrepitude and dishonor but the worst of all the signs of its decay and helplessness is that halfway up a parasite crystal smaller but just as sickly has rooted itself in the side of the larger one eating out a cavity round its root and then growing backwards or downwards contrary to the direction of the main crystal yet i cannot trace the least difference in purity of substance between the first most noble stone and this ignoble and dissolute one the impurity of the last is in its will or want of will  mary oh if we could but understand the meaning of it all  l we can understand all that is good for us it is just as true for us as for the crystal that the nobleness of life depends on its consistencyclearness of purposequiet and ceaseless energy all doubt and repenting and botching and retouching and wondering what will it be best to do next are vice as well as misery  mary much wondering but must not one repent when one does wrong and hesitate when one cant see ones way  l you have no business at all to do wrong nor to get into any way that you cannot see your intelligence should always be far in advance of your act whenever you do not know what you are about you are sure to be doing wrong  kathleen oh dear but i never know what i am about  l very true katie but it is a great deal to know if you know that and you find that you have done wrong afterwards and perhaps some day you may begin to know or at least think what you are about  isabel but surely people cant do very wrong if they dont know can they i mean they cant be very naughty they can be wrong like kathleen or me when we make mistakes but not wrong in the dreadful way i cant express what i mean but there are two sorts of wrong are there not  l yes isabel but you will find that the great difference is between kind and unkind wrongs not between meant and unmeant wrong very few people really mean to do wrongin a deep sense none they only dont know what they are about cain did not mean to do wrong when he killed abel  isabel draws a deep breath and opens her eyes very wide  l no isabel and there are countless cains among us now who kill their brothers by the score a day not only for less provocation than cain had but for no provocationand merely for what they can make of their bonesyet do not think they are doing wrong in the least then sometimes you have the business reversed as over in america these last years where you have seen abel resolutely killing cain and not thinking he is doing wrong the great difficulty is always to open peoples eyes to touch their feelings and break their hearts is easy the difficult thing is to break their heads what does it matter as long as they remain stupid whether you change their feelings or not you cannot be always at their elbow to tell them what is right and they may just do as wrong as before or worse and their best intentions merely make the road smooth for themyou know where children for it is not the place itself that is paved with them as people say so often you cant pave the bottomless pit but you may the road to it  may well but if people do as well as they can see how surely that is the right for them isnt it  l no may not a bit of it right is right and wrong is wrong it is only the fool who does wrong and says he did it for the best and if theres one sort of person in the world that the bible speaks harder of than another it is fools their particular and chief way of saying there is no god is this of declaring that whatever their public opinion may be is right and that gods opinion is of no consequence  may but surely nobody can always know what is right  l yes you always can for today and if you do what you see of it today you will see more of it and more clearly tomorrow here for instance you children are at school and have to learn french and arithmetic and music and several other such things that is your right for the present the right for us your teachers is to see that you learn as much as you can without spoiling your dinner your sleep or your play and that what you do learn you learn well you all know when you learn with a will and when you dawdle theres no doubt of conscience about that i suppose  violet no but if one wants to read an amusing book instead of learning ones lesson  l you dont call that a question seriously violet you are then merely deciding whether you will resolutely do wrong or not  mary but in after life how many fearful difficulties may arise however one tries to know or to do what is right  l you are much too sensible a girl mary to have felt that whatever you may have seen a great many of young ladies difficulties arise from their falling in love with a wrong person but they have no business to let themselves fall in love till they know he is the right one  dora how many thousands ought he to have a year  l disdaining reply there are of course certain crises of fortune when one has to take care of oneself and mind shrewdly what one is about there is never any real doubt about the path but you may have to walk very slowly  mary and if one is forced to do a wrong thing by some one who has authority over you  l my dear no one can be forced to do a wrong thing for the guilt is in the will but you may any day be forced to do a fatal thing as you might be forced to take poison the remarkable law of nature in such cases being that it is always unfortunate you who are poisoned and not the person who gives you the dose it is a very strange law but it is a law nature merely sees to the carrying out of the normal operation of arsenic she never troubles herself to ask who gave it you so also you may be starved to death morally as well as physically by other peoples faults you are on the whole very good children sitting here to day do you think that your goodness comes all by your own contriving or that you are gentle and kind because your dispositions are naturally more angelic than those of the poor girls who are playing with wild eyes on the dustheaps in the alleys of our great towns and who will one day fill their prisonsor better their graves heaven only knows where they and we who have cast them there shall stand at last but the main judgment question will be i suppose for all of us did you keep a good heart through it what you were others may answer for what you tried to be you must answer for yourself was the heart pure and truetell us that  and so we come back to your sorrowful question lucilla which i put aside a little ago you would be afraid to answer that your heart was pure and true would not you  lucilla yes indeed sir  l because you have been taught that it is all evilonly evil continually somehow often as people say that they never seem to me to believe it do you really believe it  lucilla yes sir i hope so  l that you have an entirely bad heart  lucilla a little uncomfortable at the substitution of the monosyllable for the dissyllable nevertheless persisting in her orthodoxy yes sir  l florrie i am sure you are tired i never like you to stay when you are tired but you know you must not play with the kitten while were talking  florrie oh but im not tired and im only nursing her shell be asleep in my lap directly  l stop that puts me in mind of something i had to show you about minerals that are like hair i want a hair out of titties tail  florrie quite rude in her surprise even to the point of repeating expressions out of titties tail  l yes a brown one lucilla you can get at the tip of it nicely under florries arm just pull one out for me  lucilla oh but sir it will hurt her so  l never mind she cant scratch you while florrie is holding her now that i think of it you had better pull out two  lucilla but then she may scratch florrie and it will hurt her so sir if you only want brown hairs wouldnt two of mine do  l would you really rather pull out your own than titties  lucilla oh of course if mine will do  l but thats very wicked lucilla  lucilla wicked sir  l yes if your heart was not so bad you would much rather pull all the cats hairs out than one of your own  lucilla oh but sir i didnt mean bad like that  l i believe if the truth were told lucilla you would like to tie a kettle to titties tail and hunt her round the playground  lucilla indeed i should not sir  l thats not true lucilla you know it cannot be  lucilla sir  l certainly it is nothow can you possibly speak any truth out of such a heart as you have it is wholly deceitful  lucilla oh no no i dont mean that way i dont mean that it makes me tell lies quite out  l only that it tells lies within you  lucilla yes  l then outside of it you know what is true and say so and i may trust the outside of your heart but within it is all foul and false is that the way  lucilla i suppose so i dont understand it quite  l there is no occasion for understanding it but do you feel it are you sure that your heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked  lucilla much relieved by finding herself among phrases with which she is acquainted yes sir im sure of that  l pensively im sorry for it lucilla  lucilla so am i indeed  l what are you sorry with lucilla  lucilla sorry with sir  l yes i mean where do you feel sorry in your feet  lucilla laughing a little no sir of course  l in your shoulders then  lucilla no sir  l you are sure of that because i fear sorrow in the shoulders would not be worth much  lucilla i suppose i feel it in my heart if i really am sorry  l if you really are do you mean to say that you are sure you are utterly wicked and yet do not care  lucilla no indeed i have cried about it often  l well then you are sorry in your heart  lucilla yes when the sorrow is worth anything  l even if it be not it cannot be anywhere else but there it is not the crystalline lens of your eyes which is sorry when you cry  lucilla no sir of course  l then have you two hearts one of which is wicked and the other grieved or is one side of it sorry for the other side  lucilla weary of crossexamination and a little vexed indeed sir you know i cant understand it but you know how it is writtenanother law in my members warring against the law of my mind  l yes lucilla i know how it is written but i do not see that it will help us to know that if we neither understand what is written nor feel it and you will not get nearer to the meaning of one verse if as soon as you are puzzled by it you escape to another introducing three new wordslaw members and mind not one of which you at present know the meaning of and respecting which you probably never will be much wiser since men like montesquieu and locke have spent great part of their lives in endeavoring to explain two of them  lucilla oh please sir ask somebody else  l if i thought any one else could answer better than you lucilla i would but suppose i try instead myself to explain your feelings to you  lucilla oh yes please do  l mind i say your feelings not your belief for i cannot undertake to explain anybodys beliefs still i must try a little first to explain the belief also because i want to draw it to some issue as far as i understand what you say or any one else taught as you have been taught says on this matteryou think that there is an external goodness a whitedsepulcher kind of goodness which appears beautiful outwardly but is within full of uncleanness a deep secret guilt of which we ourselves are not sensible and which can only be seen by the maker of us all approving murmurs from audience  l is it not so with the body as well as the soul  looked notes of interrogation  l a skull for instance is not a beautiful thing grave faces signifying certainly not and what next  l and if you all could see in each other with clear eyes whatever god sees beneath those fair faces of yours you would not like it  murmured nos  l nor would it be good for you  silence  l the probability being that what god does not allow you to see he does not wish you to see nor even to think of  silence prolonged  l it would not at all be good for you for instance whenever you were washing your faces and braiding your hair to be thinking of the shapes of the jawbones and of the cartilage of the nose and of the jagged sutures of the scalp  resolutely whispered nos  l still less to see through a clear glass the daily processes of nourishment and decay  no  l still less if instead of merely inferior and preparatory conditions of structure as in the skeletonor inferior offices of structure as in operations of life and deaththere were actual disease in the body ghastly and dreadful you would try to cure it but having taken such measures as were necessary you would not think the cure likely to be promoted by perpetually watching the wounds or thinking of them on the contrary you would be thankful for every moment of forgetfulness as in daily health you must be thankful that your maker has veiled whatever is fearful in your frame under a sweet and manifest beauty and has made it your duty and your only safety to rejoice in that both in yourself and in othersnot indeed concealing or refusing to believe in sickness if it come but never dwelling on it  now your wisdom and duty touching soulsickness are just the same ascertain clearly what is wrong with you and so far as you know any means of mending it take those means and have done when you are examining yourself never call yourself merely a sinner that is very cheap abuse and utterly useless you may even get to like it and be proud of it but call yourself a liar a coward a sluggard a glutton or an evileyed jealous wretch if you indeed find yourself to be in any wise any of these take steady means to check yourself in whatever fault you have ascertained and justly accused yourself of and as soon as you are in active way of mending you will be no more inclined to moan over an undefined corruption for the rest you will find it less easy to uproot faults than to choke them by gaining virtues do not think of your faults still less of others faults in every person who comes near you look for what is good and strong honor that rejoice in it and as you can try to imitate it and your faults will drop off like dead leaves when their time comes if on looking back your whole life should seem rugged as a palmtree stem still never mind so long as it has been growing and has its grand green shade of leaves and weight of honeyed fruit at top and even if you cannot find much good in yourself at last think that it does not much matter to the universe either what you were or are think how many people are noble if you cannot be and rejoice in their nobleness an immense quantity of modern confession of sin even when honest is merely a sickly egotism which will rather gloat over its own evil than lose the centralization of its interest in itself  mary but then if we ought to forget ourselves so much how did the old greek proverb know thyself come to be so highly esteemed  l my dear it is the proverb of proverbs apollos proverb and the sunsbut do you think you can know yourself by looking into yourself never you can know what you are only by looking out of yourself measure your own powers with those of others compare your own interests with those of others try to understand what you appear to them as well as what they appear to you and judge of yourselves in all things relatively and subordinately not positively starting always with a wholesome conviction of the probability that there is nothing particular about you for instance some of you perhaps think you can write poetry dwell on your own feelings and doingsand you will soon think yourselves tenth muses but forget your own feeling and try instead to understand a line or two of chaucer or dante and you will soon begin to feel yourselves very foolish girlswhich is much like the fact  so something which befalls you may seem a great misfortuneyou meditate over its effects on you personally and begin to think that it is a chastisement or a warning or a this or that or the other of profound significance and that all the angels in heaven have left their business for a little while that they may watch its effects on your mind but give up this egotistic indulgence of your fancy examine a little what misfortunes greater a thousand fold are happening every second to twenty times worthier persons and your selfconsciousness will change into pity and humility and you will know yourself so far as to understand that there hath nothing taken thee but what is common to man  now lucilla these are the practical conclusions which any person of sense would arrive at supposing the texts which relate to the inner evil of the heart were as many and as prominent as they are often supposed to be by careless readers but the way in which common people read their bibles is just like the way that the old monks thought hedgehogs ate grapes they rolled themselves it was said over and over where the grapes lay on the ground what fruit stuck to their spines they carried off and ate so your hedgehoggy readers roll themselves over and over their bibles and declare that whatever sticks to their own spines is scripture and that nothing else is but you can only get the skins of the texts that way if you want their juice you must press them in cluster now the clustered texts about the human heart insist as a body not on any inherent corruption in all hearts but on the terrific distinction between the bad and the good ones a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil they on the rock are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it delight thyself in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart the wicked have bent their bow that they may privily shoot at him that is upright in heart and so on they are countless to the same effect and for all of us the question is not at all to ascertain how much or how little corruption there is in human nature but to ascertain whether out of all the mass of that nature we are of the sheep or the goat breed whether we are people of upright heart being shot at or people of crooked heart shooting and of all the texts bearing on the subject this which is a quite simple and practical order is the one you have chiefly to hold in mind keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life  lucilla and yet how inconsistent the texts seem  l nonsense lucilla do you think the universe is bound to look consistent to a girl of fifteen look up at your own room window you can just see it from where you sit im glad that it is left open as it ought to be in so fine a day but do you see what a black spot it looks in the sunlighted wall  lucilla yes it looks as black as ink  l yet you know it is a very bright room when you are inside of it quite as bright as there is any occasion for it to be that its little lady may see to keep it tidy well it is very probable also that if you could look into your heart from the suns point of view it might appear a very black hole indeed nay the sun may sometimes think good to tell you that it looks so to him but he will come into it and make it very cheerful for you for all that if you dont put the shutters up and the one question for you remember is not dark or light but tidy or untidy look well to your sweeping and garnishing and be sure it is only the banished spirit or some of the seven wickeder ones at his back who will still whisper to you that it is all black      lecture 6  crystal quarrels   full conclave in schoolroom there has been a game of crystallization in the morning of which various account has to be rendered in particular everybody has to explain why they were always where they were not intended to be  l having received and considered the report you have got on pretty well children but you know these were easy figures you have been trying wait till i have drawn you out the plans of some crystals of snow  mary i dont think those will be the most difficultthey are so beautiful that we shall remember our places better and then they are all regular and in stars it is those twisty oblique ones we are afraid of  l read carlyles account of the battle of leuthen and learn friedrichs oblique order you will get it done for once i think provided you can march as a pair of compasses would but remember when you can construct the most difficult single figures you have only learned half the gamenothing so much as the half indeed as the crystals themselves play it  mary indeed what else is there  l it is seldom that any mineral crystallizes alone usually two or three under quite different crystalline laws form together they do this absolutely without flaw or fault when they are in fine temper and observe what this signifies it signifies that the two or more minerals of different natures agree somehow between themselves how much space each will wantagree which of them shall give way to the other at their junction or in what measure each will accommodate itself to the others shape and then each takes its permitted shape and allotted share of space yielding or being yielded to as it builds till each crystal has fitted itself perfectly and gracefully to its differentlynatured neighbor so that in order to practice this in even the simplest terms you must divide into two parties wearing different colors each must choose a different figure to construct and you must form one of these figures through the other both going on at the same time  mary i think we may perhaps manage it but i cannot at all understand how the crystals do it seems to imply so much preconcerting of plan and so much giving way to each other as if they really were living  l yes it implies both the concurrence and compromise regulating all wilfulness of design and more curious still the crystals do not always give way to each other they show exactly the same varieties of temper that human creatures might sometimes they yield the required place with perfect grace and courtesy forming fantastic but exquisitely finished groups and sometimes they will not yield at all but fight furiously for their places losing all shape and honor and even their own likeness in the contest  mary but is not that wholly wonderful how is it that one never sees it spoken of in books  l the scientific men are all busy in determining the constant laws under which the struggle takes place these indefinite humors of the elements are of no interest to them and unscientific people rarely give themselves the trouble of thinking at all when they look at stones not that it is of much use to think the more one thinks the more one is puzzled  mary surely it is more wonderful than anything in botany  l everything has its own wonders but given the nature of the plant it is easier to understand what a flower will do and why it does it than given anything we as yet know of stonenature to understand what a crystal will do and why it does it you at once admit a kind of volition and choice in the flower but we are not accustomed to attribute anything of the kind to the crystal yet there is in reality more likeness to some conditions of human feeling among stones than among plants there is a far greater difference between kindlytempered and ill tempered crystals of the same mineral than between any two specimens of the same flower and the friendships and wars of crystals depend more definitely and curiously on their varieties of disposition than any associations of flowers here for instance is a good garnet living with good mica one rich red and the other silver white the mica leaves exactly room enough for the garnet to crystallize comfortably in and the garnet lives happily in its little white house fitted to it like a pholas in its cell but here are wicked garnets living with wicked mica see what ruin they make of each other you cannot tell which is which the garnets look like dull red stains on the crumbling stone by the way i never could understand if st gothard is a real saint why he cant keep his garnets in better order these are all under his care but i suppose there are too many of them for him to look after the streets of airolo are paved with them  may paved with garnets  l with micaslate and garnets i broke this bit out of a paving stone now garnets and mica are natural friends and generally fond of each other but you see how they quarrel when they are ill brought up so it is always good crystals are friendly with almost all other good crystals however little they chance to see of each other or however opposite their habits may be while wicked crystals quarrel with one another though they may be exactly alike in habits and see each other continually and of course the wicked crystals quarrel with the good ones  isabel then do the good ones get angry  l no never they attend to their own work and life and live it as well as they can though they are always the sufferers here for instance is a rock crystal of the purest race and finest temper who was born unhappily for him in a bad neighborhood near beaufort in savoy and he has had to fight with vile calcareous mud all his life see here when he was but a child it came down on him and nearly buried him a weaker crystal would have died in despair but he only gathered himself together like hercules against the serpents and threw a layer of crystal over the clay conquered itimprisoned itand lived on then when he was a little older came more clay and poured itself upon him here at the side and he has laid crystal over that and lived on in his purity then the clay came on at his angles and tried to cover them and round them away but upon that he threw out buttresscrystals at his angles all as true to his own central line as chapels round a cathedral apse and clustered them round the clay and conquered it again at last the clay came on at his summit and tried to blunt his summit but he could not endure that for an instant and left his flanks all rough but pure and fought the clay at his crest and built crest over crest and peak over peak till the clay surrendered at last and here is his summit smooth and pure terminating a pyramid of alternate clay and crystal half a foot high  lily oh how nice of him what a dear brave crystal but i cant bear to see his flanks all broken and the clay within them  l yes it was an evil chance for him the being born to such contention there are some enemies so base that even to hold them captive is a kind of dishonor but look here has been quite a different kind of struggle the adverse power has been more orderly and has fought the pure crystal in ranks as firm as its own this is not mere rage and impediment of crowded evil here is a disciplined hostility army against army  lily oh but this is much more beautiful  l yes for both the elements have true virtue in them it is a pity they are at war but they war grandly  mary but is this the same clay as in the other crystal  l i used the word clay for shortness in both the enemy is really limestone but in the first disordered and mixed with true clay while here it is nearly pure and crystallizes into its own primitive form the oblique sixsided one which you know and out of these it makes regiments and then squares of the regiments and so charges the rock crystal literally in square against column  isabel please please let me see and what does the rock crystal do  l the rock crystal seems able to do nothing the calcite cuts it through at every charge look hereand here the loveliest crystal in the whole group is hewn fairly into two pieces  isabel oh dear but is the calcite harder than the crystal then  l no softer very much softer  mary but then how can it possibly cut the crystal  l it did not really cut it though it passes through it the two were formed together as i told you but no one knows how still it is strange that this hard quartz has in all cases a good natured way with it of yielding to everything else all sorts of soft things make nests for themselves in it and it never makes a nest for itself in anything it has all the rough outside work and every sort of cowardly and weak mineral can shelter itself within it look these are hexagonal plates of mica if they were outside of this crystal they would break like burnt paper but they are inside of itnothing can hurt themthe crystal has taken them into its very heart keeping all their delicate edges as sharp as if they were under water instead of bathed in rock here is a piece of branched silver you can bend it with a touch of your finger but the stamp of its every fiber is on the rock in which it lay as if the quartz had been as soft as wool  lily oh the good good quartz but does it never get inside of anything  l as it is a little irish girl who asks i may perhaps answer without being laughed at that it gets inside of itself sometimes but i dont remember seeing quartz make a nest for itself in anything else  isabel please there as something i heard you talking about last time with miss mary i was at my lessons but i heard something about nests and i thought it was birds nests and i couldnt help listening and then i remember it was about nests of quartz in granite i remember because i was so disappointed  l yes mousie you remember quite rightly but i cant tell you about those nests today nor perhaps tomorrow but theres no contradiction between my saying then and now i will show you that there is not some day will you trust me meanwhile  isabel wont i  l well then look lastly at this piece of courtesy in quartz it is on a small scale but wonderfully pretty here is nobly born quartz living with a green mineral called epidote and they are immense friends now you see a comparatively large and strong quartzcrystal and a very weak and slender little one of epidote have begun to grow close by each other and sloping unluckily towards each other so that at last they meet they cannot go on growing together the quartz crystal is five times as thick and more than twenty times as strongfootnote quartz is not much harder than epidote the strength is only supposed to be in some proportion to the squares of the diameters as the epidote but he stops at once just in the very crowning moment of his life when he is building his own summit he lets the pale little film of epidote grow right past him stopping his own summit for it and he never himself grows any more  lily after some silence of wonder but is the quartz never wicked then  l yes but the wickedest quartz seems goodnatured compared to other things here are two very characteristic examples one is good quartz living with good pearlspar and the other wicked quartz living with wicked pearl spar in both the quartz yields to the soft carbonate of iron but in the first place the iron takes only what it needs of room and is inserted into the planes of the rock crystal with such precision that you must break it away before you can tell whether it really penetrates the quartz or not while the crystals of iron are perfectly formed and have a lovely bloom on their surface besides but here when the two minerals quarrel the unhappy quartz has all its surfaces jagged and torn to pieces and there is not a single iron crystal whose shape you can completely trace but the quartz has the worst of it in both instances  violet might we look at that piece of broken quartz again with the weak little film across it it seems such a strange lovely thing like the selfsacrifice of a human being  l the selfsacrifice of a human being is not a lovely thing violet it is often a necessary and noble thing but no form nor degree of suicide can be ever lovely  violet but selfsacrifice is not suicide  l what is it then  violet giving up ones self for another  l well and what do you mean by giving up ones self  violet giving up ones tastes ones feelings ones time ones happiness and so on to make others happy  l i hope you will never marry anybody violet who expects you to make him happy in that way  violet hesitating in what way  l by giving up your tastes and sacrificing your feelings and happiness  violet no no i dont mean that but you know for other people one must  l for people who dont love you and whom you know nothing about be it so but how does this giving up differ from suicide then  violet why giving up ones pleasures is not killing ones self  l giving up wrong pleasure is not neither is it selfsacrifice but selfculture but giving up right pleasure is if you surrender the pleasure of walking your foot will wither you may as well cut it off if you surrender the pleasure of seeing your eyes will soon be unable to bear the light you may as well pluck them out and to maim yourself is partly to kill yourself do but go on maiming and you will soon slay  violet but why do you make me think of that verse then about the foot and the eye  l you are indeed commanded to cut off and to pluck out if foot or eye offend you but why should they offend you  violet i dont know i never quite understood that  l yet it is a sharp order one needing to be well understood if it is to be well obeyed when helen sprained her ankle the other day you saw how strongly it had to be bandaged that is to say prevented from all work to recover it but the bandage was not lovely  violet no indeed  l and if her foot had been crushed or diseased or snakebitten instead of sprained it might have been needful to cut it off but the amputation would not have been lovely  violet no  l well if eye and foot are dead already and betray youif the light that is in you be darkness and your feet run into mischief or are taken in the snareit is indeed time to pluck out and cut off i think but so crippled you can never be what you might have been otherwise you enter into life at best halt or maimed and the sacrifice is not beautiful though necessary  violet after a pause but when one sacrifices ones self for others  l why not rather others for you  violet oh but i couldnt bear that  l then why should they bear it  dora bursting in indignant and thermopylae and protesilaus and marcus curtius and arnold de winkelried and iphigenia and jephthahs daughter  l sustaining the indignation unmoved and the samaritan womans son  dora which samaritan womans  l read 2 kings vi 29  dora obeys how horrid as if we meant anything like that  l you dont seem to me to know in the least what you do mean children what practical difference is there between that and what you are talking about the samaritan children had no voice of their own in the business it is true but neither had iphigenia the greek girl was certainly neither boiled nor eaten but that only makes a difference in the dramatic effect not in the principle  dora biting her lip well then tell us what we ought to mean as if you didnt teach it all to us and mean it yourself at this moment more than we do if you wouldnt be tiresome  l i mean and always have meant simply this dorathat the will of god respecting us is that we shall live by each others happiness and life not by each others misery or death i made you read that verse which so shocked you just now because the relations of parent and child are typical of all beautiful human help a child may have to die for its parents but the purpose of heaven is that it shall rather live for themthat not by its sacrifice but by its strength its joy its force of being it shall be to them renewal of strength and as the arrow in the hand of the giant so it is in all other right relations men help each other by their joy not by their sorrow they are not intended to slay themselves for each other but to strengthen themselves for each other and among the many apparently beautiful things which turn through mistaken use to utter evil i am not sure but that the thoughtlessly meek and selfsacrificing spirit of good men must be named as one of the fatalest they have so often been taught that there is a virtue in mere suffering as such and foolishly to hope that good may be brought by heaven out of all on which heaven itself has set the stamp of evil that we may avoid itthat they accept pain and defeat as if these were their appointed portion never understanding that their defeat is not the less to be mourned because it is more fatal to their enemies than to them the one thing that a good man has to do and to see done is justice he is neither to slay himself nor others causelessly so far from denying himself since he is pleased by good he is to do his utmost to get his pleasure accomplished and i only wish there were strength fidelity and sense enough among the good englishmen of this day to render it possible for them to band together in a vowed brotherhood to enforce by strength of heart and hand the doing of human justice among all who came within their sphere and finally for your own teaching observe although there may be need for much selfsacrifice and selfdenial in the correction of faults of character the moment the character is formed the selfdenial ceases nothing is really well done which it costs you pain to do  violet but surely sir you are always pleased with us when we try to please others and not ourselves  l my dear child in the daily course and discipline of right life we must continually and reciprocally submit and surrender in all kind and courteous and affectionate ways and these submissions and ministries to each other of which you all know none better the practice and the preciousness are as good for the yielder as the receiver they strengthen and perfect as much as they soften and refine but the real sacrifice of all our strength or life or happiness to others though it may be needed and though all brave creatures hold their lives in their hand to be given when such need comes as frankly as a soldier gives his life in battle is yet always a mournful and momentary necessity not the fulfillment of the continuous law of being selfsacrifice which is sought after and triumphed in is usually foolish and calamitous in its issue and by the sentimental proclamation and pursuit of it good people have not only made most of their own lives useless but the whole framework of their religion so hollow that at this moment while the english nation with its lips pretends to teach every man to love his neighbor as himself with its hands and feet it clutches and tramples like a wild beast and practically lives every soul of it that can on other peoples labor briefly the constant duty of every man to his fellows is to ascertain his own powers and special gifts and to strengthen them for the help of others do you think titian would have helped the world better by denying himself and not painting or casella by denying himself and not singing the real virtue is to be ready to sing the moment people ask us as he was even in purgatory the very word virtue means not conduct but strength vital energy in the heart were not you reading about that group of words beginning with vvital virtuous vigorous and so onin max muller the other day sibyl cant you tell the others about it  sibyl no i cant will you tell us please  l not now it is too late come to me some idle time tomorrow and ill tell you about it if alls well but the gist of it is children that you should at least know two latin words recollect that mors means death and delaying and vita means life and growing and try always not to mortify yourselves but to vivify yourselves  violet but then are we not to mortify our earthly affections and surely we are to sacrifice ourselves at least in gods service if not in mans  l really violet we are getting too serious ive given you enough ethics for one talk i think do let us have a little play lily what were you so busy about at the anthill in the wood this morning  lily oh it was the ants who were busy not i i was only trying to help them a little  l and they wouldnt be helped i suppose  lily no indeed i cant think why ants are always so tiresome when one tries to help them they were carrying bits of stick as fast as they could through a piece of grass and pulling and pushing so hard and tumbling over and overit made one quite pity them so i took some of the bits of stick and carried them forward a little where i thought they wanted to put them but instead of being pleased they left them directly and ran about looking quite angry and frightened and at last ever so many of them got up my sleeves and bit me all over and i had to come away  l i couldnt think what you were about i saw your french grammar lying on the grass behind you and thought perhaps you had gone to ask the ants to hear you a french verb  isabel ah but you didnt though  l why not isabel i knew well enough lily couldnt learn that verb by herself  isabel no but the ants couldnt help her  l are you sure the ants could not have helped you lily  lily thinking i ought to have learned something from them perhaps  l but none of them left their sticks to help you through the irregular verb  lily no indeed laughing with some others  l what are you laughing at children i cannot see why the ants should not have left their tasks to help lily in herssince here is violet thinking she ought to leave her tasks to help god in his perhaps however she takes lilys more modest view and thinks only that he ought to learn something from her  tears in violets eyes  dora scarlet its too badits a shamepoor violet  l my dear children theres no reason why one should be so red and the other so pale merely because you are made for a moment to feel the absurdity of a phrase which you have been taught to use in common with half the religious world there is but one way in which man can ever help godthat is by letting god help him and there is no way in which his name is more guiltily taken in vain than by calling the abandonment of our own work the performance of his  god is a kind father he sets us all in the places where he wishes us to be employed and that employment is truly our fathers business he chooses work for every creature which will be delightful to them if they do it simply and humbly he gives us always strength enough and sense enough for what he wants us to do if we either tire ourselves or puzzle ourselves it is ourselves it is our own fault and we may always be sure whatever we are doing that we cannot be pleasing him if we are not happy ourselves now away with you children and be as happy as you can and when you cannot at least dont plume yourselves upon pouting      lecture 7  home virtues   by the fireside in the drawingroom evening  dora now the curtains are drawn and the fires bright and heres your armchairand youre to tell us all about what you promised  l all about what  dora all about virtue  kathleen yes and about the words that begin with v  l i heard you singing about a word that begins with v in the playground this morning miss katie  kathleen me singing  may oh tell ustell us  l vilikens and his  kathleen stopping his mouth oh please dont where were you  isabel im sure i wish i had known where he was we lost him among the rhododendrons and i dont know where he got to oh you naughtynaughtyclimbs on his knee  dora now isabel we really want to talk  l i dont  dora oh but you must you promised you know  l yes if all was well but alls ill im tired and cross and i wont  dora youre not a bit tired and youre not crosser than two sticks and well make you talk if you were crosser than six come here egypt and get on the other side of him  egypt takes up a commanding position near the hearthbrush  dora reviewing her forces now lily come and sit on the rug in front  lily does as she is bid  l seeing he has no chance against the odds well well but im really tired go and dance a little first and let me think  dora no you mustnt think you will be wanting to make us think next that will be tiresome  l well go and dance first to get quit of thinking and then ill talk as long as you like  dora oh but we cant dance tonight there isnt time and we want to hear about virtue  l let me see a little of it first dancing is the first of girls virtues  egypt indeed and the second  l dressing  egypt now you neednt say that i mended that tear the first thing before breakfast this morning  l i cannot otherwise express the ethical principle egypt whether you have mended your gown or not  dora now dont be tiresome we really must hear about virtue please seriously  l well im telling you about it as fast as i can  dora what the first of girls virtues is dancing  l more accurately it is wishing to dance and not wishing to tease nor hear about virtue  dora to egypt isnt he cross  egypt how many balls must we go to in the season to be perfectly virtuous  l as many as you can without losing your color but i did not say you should wish to go to balls i said you should be always wanting to dance  egypt so we do but everybody says it is very wrong  l why egypt i thought      there was a lady once     that would not be a queenthat would she not     for all the mud in egypt  you were complaining the other day of having to go out a great deal oftener than you liked  egypt yes so i was but then it isnt to dance theres no room to dance itspausing to consider what it is for  l it is only to be seen i suppose well theres no harm in that girls ought to like to be seen  dora her eyes flashing now you dont mean that and youre too provoking and we wont dance again for a month  l it will answer every purpose of revenge dora if you only banish me to the library and dance by yourselves but i dont think jessie and lily will agree to that you like me to see you dancing dont you lily  lily yes certainlywhen we do it rightly  l and besides miss dora if young ladies really do not want to be seen they should take care not to let their eyes flash when they dislike what people say and more than that it is all nonsense from beginning to end about not wanting to be seen i dont know any more tiresome flower in the borders than your especially modest snowdrop which one always has to stoop down and take all sorts of tiresome trouble with and nearly break its poor little head off before you can see it and then half of it is not worth seeing girls should be like daisies nice and white with an edge of red if you look close making the ground bright wherever they are knowing simply and quietly that they do it and are meant to do it and that it would be very wrong if they didnt do it not want to be seen indeed how long were you in doing up your back hair this afternoon jessie  jessie not immediately answering dora comes to her assistance  dora not above threequarters of an hour i think jess  jessie putting her finger up now dorothy you neednt talk you know  l i know she neednt jessie i shall ask her about those dark plaits presently dora looks round to see if there is any way open for retreat but never mind it was worth the time whatever it was and nobody will ever mistake that golden wreath for a chignon but if you dont want it to be seen you had better wear a cap  jessie ah now are you really going to do nothing but play and we all have been thinking and thinking all day and hoping you would tell us things and now  l and now i am telling you things and true things and things good for you and you wont believe me you might as well have let me go to sleep at once as i wanted to endeavors again to make himself comfortable  isabel oh no no you shant go to sleep you naughty kathleen come here  l knowing what he has to expect if kathleen comes get away isabel youre too heavy sitting up what have i been saying  dora i do believe he has been asleep all the time you never heard anything like the things youve been saying  l perhaps not if you have heard them and anything like them it is all i want  egypt yes but we dont understand and you know we dont and we want to  l what did i say first  dora that the first virtue of girls was wanting to go to balls  l i said nothing of the kind  jessie always wanting to dance you said  l yes and thats true their first virtue is to be intensely happyso happy that they dont know what to do with themselves for happinessand dance instead of walking dont you recollect louisa      no fountain from a rocky cave     eer tripped with foot so free     she seemed as happy as a wave     that dances on the sea  a girl is always like that when everythings right with her  violet but surely one must be sad sometimes  l yes violet and dull sometimes and stupid sometimes and cross sometimes what must be must but it is always either our own fault or somebody elses the last and worst thing that can be said of a nation is that it has made its young girls sad and weary  may but i am sure i have heard a great many good people speak against dancing  l yes may but it does not follow they were wise as well as good i suppose they think jeremiah liked better to have to write lamentations for his people than to have to write that promise for them which everybody seems to hurry past that they may get on quickly to the verse about rachel weeping for her children though the verse they pass is the counter blessing to that one then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance and both young men and old together and i will turn their mourning into joy  the children get very serious but look at each other as if pleased  mary they understand now but do you know what you said next  l yes i was not more than half asleep i said their second virtue was dressing  mary well what did you mean by that  l what do you mean by dressing  mary wearing fine clothes  l ah theres the mistake i mean wearing plain ones  mary yes i daresay i but thats not what girls understand by dressing you know  l i cant help that if they understand by dressing buying dresses perhaps they also understand by drawing buying pictures but when i hear them say they can draw i understand that they can make a drawing and when i hear them say they can dress i understand that they can make a dress andwhich is quite as difficultwear one  dora im not sure about the making for the wearing we can all wear themout before anybody expects it  egypt aside to l piteously indeed i have mended that torn flounce quite neatly look if i havent  l aside to egypt all right dont be afraid aloud to dora yes doubtless but you know that is only a slow way of undressing  dora then we are all to learn dressmaking are we  l yes and always to dress yourselves beautifullynot finely unless on occasion but then very finely and beautifully too also you are to dress as many other people as you can and to teach them how to dress if they dont know and to consider every illdressed woman or child whom you see anywhere as a personal disgrace and to get at them somehow until everybody is as beautifully dressed as birds  silence the children drawing their breaths hard as if they had come from under a shower bath  l seeing objections begin to express themselves in the eyes now you neednt say you cant for you can and its what you were meant to do always and to dress your houses and your gardens too and to do very little else i believe except singing and dancing as we said of course andone thing more  dora our third and last virtue i suppose  l yes on violets system of triplicities  dora well we are prepared for anything now what is it  l cooking  dora cardinal indeed if only beatrice were here with her seven handmaids that she might see what a fine eighth we had found for her  mary and the interpretation what does cooking mean  l it means the knowledge of medea and of circe and of calypso and of helen and of rebekah and of the queen of sheba it means the knowledge of all herbs and fruits and balms and spices and of all that is healing and sweet in fields and groves and savory in meats it means carefulness and inventiveness and watchfulness and willingness and readiness of appliance it means the economy of your greatgrandmothers and the science of modern chemists it means much tasting and no wasting it means english thoroughness and french art and arabian hospitality and it means in fine that you are to be perfectly and always ladiesloafgivers and as you are to see imperatively that everybody has something pretty to put onso you are to see yet more imperatively that everybody has something nice to eat  another pause and long drawn breath  dora slowly recovering herself to egypt we had better have let him go to sleep i think after all  l you had better let the younger ones go to sleep now for i havent half done  isabel panicstruck oh please please just one quarter of an hour  l no isabel i cannot say what ive got to say in a quarter of an hour and it is too hard for you besidesyou would be lying awake and trying to make it out half the night that will never do  isabel oh please  l it would please me exceedingly mousie but there are times when we must both be displeased mores the pity lily may stay for half an hour if she likes  lily i cant because isey never goes to sleep if she is waiting for me to come  isabel oh yes lily ill go to sleep tonight i will indeed  lily yes its very likely isey with those fine round eyes to l youll tell me something of what you we been saying to morrow wont you  l no i wont lily you must choose its only in miss edgeworths novels that one can do right and have ones cake and sugar afterwards as well not that i consider the dilemma to night so grave  lily sighing takes isabels hand  yes lily dear it will be better in the outcome of it so than if you were to hear all the talks that eer were talked and all the stories that ever were told goodnight  the door leading to the condemned cells of the dormitory closes on lily isabel florrie and other diminutive and submissive victims  jessie after a pause why i thought you were so fond of miss edgeworth  l so i am and so you ought all to be i can read her over and over again without ever tiring theres no one whose every page is so full and so delightful no one who brings you into the company of pleasanter or wiser people no one who tells you more truly how to do right and it is very nice in the midst of a wild world to have the very ideal of poetical justice done always to ones handto have everybody found out who tells lies and everybody decorated with a red riband who doesnt and to see the good laura who gave away her half sovereign receiving a grand ovation from an entire dinner party disturbed for the purpose and poor dear little rosamond who chooses purple jars instead of new shoes left at last without either her shoes or her bottle but it isnt life and in the way children might easily understand it it isnt morals  jessie how do you mean we might understand it  l you might think miss edgeworth meant that the right was to be done mainly because one was always rewarded for doing it it is an injustice to her to say that her heroines always do right simply for its own sake as they should and her examples of conduct and motive are wholly admirable but her representation of events is false and misleading her good characters never are brought into the deadly trial of goodnessthe doing right and suffering for it quite finally and that is life as god arranges it taking up ones cross does not at all mean having ovations at dinner parties and being put over everybody elses head  dora but what does it mean then that is just what we couldnt understand when you were telling us about not sacrificing ourselves yesterday  l my dear it means simply that you are to go the road which you see to be the straight one carrying whatever you find is given you to carry as well and stoutly as you can without making faces or calling people to come and look at you above all you are neither to load nor unload yourself nor cut your cross to your own liking some people think it would be better for them to have it large and many that they could carry it much faster if it were small and even those who like it largest are usually very particular about its being ornamental and made of the best ebony but all that you have really to do is to keep your back as straight as you can and not think about what is upon itabove all not to boast of what is upon it the real and essential meaning of virtue is in that straightness of back yes you may laugh children but it is you know i was to tell you about the words that began with v sibyl what does virtue mean literally  sibyl does it mean courage  l yes but a particular kind of courage it means courage of the nerve vital courage that first syllable of it if you look in max muller you will find really means nerve and from it come vis and vir and virgin through vireo and the connected word virgaa rodthe green rod or springing bough of a tree being the type of perfect human strength both in the use of it in the mosaic story when it becomes a serpent or strikes the rock or when aarons bears its almonds and in the metaphorical expressions the rod out of the stem of jesse and the man whose name is the branch and so on and the essential idea of real virtue is that of a vital human strength which instinctively constantly and without motive does what is right you must train men to this by habit as you would the branch of a tree and give them instincts and manners or morals of purity justice kindness and courage once rightly trained they act as they should irrespectively of all motive of fear or of reward it is the blackest sign of putrescence in a national religion when men speak as if it were the only safeguard of conduct and assume that but for the fear of being burned or for the hope of being rewarded everybody would pass their lives in lying stealing and murdering i think quite one of the notablest historical events of this century perhaps the very notablest was that council of clergymen horrorstruck at the idea of any diminution in our dread of hell at which the last of english clergymen whom one would have expected to see in such a function rose as the devils advocate to tell us how impossible it was we could get on without him  violet after a pause but surely if people werent afraid hesitates again  l they should be afraid of doing wrong and of that only my dear otherwise if they only dont do wrong for fear of being punished they have done wrong in their hearts already  violet well but surely at least one ought to be afraid of displeasing god and ones desire to please him should be ones first motive  l he never would be pleased with us if it were my dear when a father sends his son out into the worldsuppose as an apprentice fancy the boys coming home at night and saying father i could have robbed the till today but i didnt because i thought you wouldnt like it do you think the father would be particularly pleased  violet is silent  he would answer would he not if he were wise and good my boy though you had no father you must not rob tills and nothing is ever done so as really to please our great father unless we would also have done it though we had had no father to know of it  violet after long pause but then what continual threatenings and promises of reward there are  l and how vain both with the jews and with all of us but the fact is that the threat and promise are simply statements of the divine law and of its consequences the fact is truly told you make what use you may of it and as collateral warning or encouragement or comfort the knowledge of future consequences may often be helpful to us but helpful chiefly to the better state when we can act without reference to them and theres no measuring the poisoned influence of that notion of future reward on the mind of christian europe in the early ages half the monastic system rose out of that acting on the occult pride and ambition of good people as the other half of it came of their follies and misfortunes there is always a considerable quantity of pride to begin with in what is called giving ones self to god as if one had ever belonged to anybody else  dora but surely great good has come out of the monastic system our booksour sciencesall saved by the monks  l saved from what my dear from the abyss of misery and ruin which that false christianity allowed the whole active world to live in when it had become the principal amusement and the most admired art of christian men to cut one anothers throats and burn one anothers towns of course the few feeble or reasonable persons left who desired quiet safety and kind fellowship got into cloisters and the gentlest thoughtfullest noblest men and women shut themselves up precisely where they could be of least use they are very fine things for us painters nowthe towers and white arches upon the tops of the rocks always in places where it takes a days climbing to get at them but the intense tragicomedy of the thing when one thinks of it is unspeakable all the good people of the world getting themselves hung up out of the way of mischief like bailie nicol jarviepoor little lambs as it were dangling there for the sign of the golden fleece or like socrates in his basket in the clouds i must read you that bit of aristophanes again by the way and believe me children i am no warped witness as far as regards monasteries or if i am it is in their favor i have always had a strong leaning that way and have pensively shivered with augustines at st bernard and happily made hay with franciscans at fesole and sat silent with carthusians in their little gardens south of florence and mourned through many a daydream at melrose and bolton but the wonder is always to me not how much but how little the monks have on the whole done with all that leisure and all that goodwill what nonsense monks characteristically wrotewhat little progress they made in the sciences to which they devoted themselves as a dutymedicine especiallyand last and worst what depths of degradation they can sometimes see one another and the population round them sink into without either doubting their system or reforming it  seeing questions rising to lips hold your little tongues children its very late and youll make me forget what ive to say fancy yourselves in pews for five minutes theres one point of possible good in the conventual system which is always attractive to young girls and the idea is a very dangerous one 0the notion of a merit or exalting virtue consisting in a habit of meditation on the things above or things of the next world now it is quite true that a person of beautiful mind dwelling on whatever appears to them most desirable and lovely in a possible future will not only pass their time pleasantly but will even acquire at last a vague and wildly gentle charm of manner and feature which will give them an air of peculiar sanctity in the eyes of others whatever real or apparent good there may be in this result i want you to observe children that we have no real authority for the reveries to which it is owing we are told nothing distinctly of the heavenly world except that it will be free from sorrow and pure from sin what is said of pearl gates golden floors and the like is accepted as merely figurative by religious enthusiasts themselves and whatever they pass their time in conceiving whether of the happiness of risen souls of their intercourse or of the appearance and employment of the heavenly powers is entirely the product of their own imagination and as completely and distinctly a work of fiction or romantic invention as any novel of sir walter scotts that the romance is founded on religious theory or doctrinethat no disagreeable or wicked persons are admitted into the storyand that the inventor fervently hopes that some portion of it may hereafter come true does not in the least alter the real nature of the effort or enjoyment  now whatever indulgence may be granted to amiable people for pleasing themselves in this innocent way it is beyond question that to seclude themselves from the rough duties of life merely to write religious romances or as in most cases merely to dream them without taking so much trouble as is implied in writing ought not to be received as an act of heroic virtue but observe even in admitting thus much i have assumed that the fancies are just and beautiful though fictitious now what right have any of us to assume that our own fancies will assuredly be either the one or the other that they delight us and appear lovely to us is no real proof of its not being wasted time to form them and we may surely be led somewhat to distrust our judgment of them by observing what ignoble imaginations have sometimes sufficiently or even enthusiastically occupied the hearts of others the principal source of the spirit of religious contemplation is the east now i have here in my hand a byzantine image of christ which if you will look at it seriously may i think at once and forever render you cautious in the indulgence of a merely contemplative habit of mind observe it is the fashion to look at such a thing only as a piece of barbarous art that is the smallest part of its interest what i want you to see is the baseness and falseness of a religious state of enthusiasm in which such a work could be dwelt upon with pious pleasure that a figure with two small round black beads for eyes a gilded face deep cut into horrible wrinkles an open gash for a mouth and a distorted skeleton for a body wrapped about to make it fine with striped enamel of blue and goldthat such a figure i say should ever have been thought helpful towards the conception of a redeeming deity may make you i think very doubtful even of the divine approvalmuch more of the divine inspirationof religious reverie in general you feel doubtless that your own idea of christ would be something very different from this but in what does the difference consist not in any more divine authority in your imagination but in the intellectual work of six intervening centuries which simply by artistic discipline has refined this crude conception for you and filled you partly with an innate sensation partly with an acquired knowledge of higher formswhich render this byzantine crucifix as horrible to you as it was pleasing to its maker more is required to excite your fancy but your fancy is of no more authority than his was and a point of national artskill is quite conceivable in which the best we can do now will be as offensive to the religious dreamers of the more highly cultivated time as this byzantine crucifix is to you  mary but surely angelico will always retain his power over everybody  l yes i should think always as the gentle words of a child will but you would be much surprised mary if you thoroughly took the pains to analyze and had the perfect means of analyzing that power of angelicoto discover its real sources of course it is natural at first to attribute it to the pure religious fervor by which he was inspired but do you suppose angelico was really the only monk in all the christian world of the middle ages who labored in art with a sincere religious enthusiasm  mary no certainly not  l anything more frightful more destructive of all religious faith whatever than such a supposition could not be and yet what other monk ever produced such work i have myself examined carefully upwards of two thousand illuminated missals with especial view to the discovery of any evidence of a similar result upon the art from the monkish devotion and utterly in vain  mary but then was not fra angelico a man of entirely separate and exalted genius  l unquestionably and granting him to be that the peculiar phenomenon in his art is to me not its loveliness but its weakness the effect of inspiration had it been real on a man of consummate genius should have been one would have thought to make everything that he did faultless and strong no less than lovely but of all men deserving to be called great fra angelico permits to himself the least pardonable faults and the most palpable follies there is evidently within him a sense of grace and power of invention as great as ghibertiswe are in the habit of attributing those high qualities to his religious enthusiasm but if they were produced by that enthusiasm in him they ought to be produced by the same feelings in others and we see they are not whereas comparing him with contemporary great artists of equal grace and invention one peculiar character remains notable in himwhich logically we ought therefore to attribute to the religious fervorand that distinctive character is the contented indulgence of his own weaknesses and perseverance in his own ignorances  mary but thats dreadful and what is the source of the peculiar charm which we all feel in his work  l there are many sources of it mary united and seeming like one you would never feel that charm but in the work of an entirely good man be sure of that but the goodness is only the recipient and modifying element not the creative one consider carefully what delights you in any original picture of angelicos you will find for one minor thing an exquisite variety and brightness of ornamental work that is not angelicos inspiration it is the final result of the labor and thought of millions of artists of all nations from the earliest egyptian potters downwardsgreeks byzantines hindoos arabs gauls and northmenall joining in the toil and consummating it in florence in that century with such embroidery of robe and inlaying of armor as had never been seen till then nor probably ever will be seen more angelico merely takes his share of this inheritance and applies it in the tenderest way to subjects which are peculiarly acceptant of it but the inspiration if it exist anywhere flashes on the knights shield quite as radiantly as on the monks picture examining farther into the sources of your emotion in the angelico work you will find much of the impression of sanctity dependent on a singular repose and grace of gesture consummating itself in the floating flying and above all in the dancing groups that is not angelicos inspiration it is only a peculiarly tender use of systems of grouping which had been long before developed by giotto memmi and orcagna and the real root of it all is simplywhat do you think children the beautiful dancing of the florentine maidens  dora indignant again now i wonder what next why not say it all depended on herodias daughter at once  l yes it is certainly a great argument against singing that there were once sirens  dora well it may be all very fine and philosophical but shouldnt i just like to read you the end of the second volume of modern painters  l my dear do you think any teacher could be worth your listening to or anybody elses listening to who had learned nothing and altered his mind in nothing from seven and twenty to seven and forty but that second volume is very good for you as far as it goes it is a great advance and a thoroughly straight and swift one to be led as it is the main business of that second volume to lead you from dutch cattlepieces and ruffianpieces to fra angelico and it is right for you also as you grow older to be strengthened in the general sense and judgment which may enable you to distinguish the weaknesses from the virtues of what you love else you might come to love both alike or even the weaknesses without the virtues you might end by liking overbeck and cornelius as well as angelico however i have perhaps been leaning a little too much to the merely practical side of things in tonights talk and you are always to remember children that i do not deny though i cannot affirm the spiritual advantages resulting in certain cases from enthusiastic religious reverie and from the other practices of saints and anchorites the evidence respecting them has never yet been honestly collected much less dispassionately examined but assuredly there is in that direction a probability and more than a probability of dangerous error while there is none whatever in the practice of an active cheerful and benevolent life the hope of attaining a higher religious position which induces us to encounter for its exalted alternative the risk of unhealthy error is often as i said founded more on pride than piety and those who in modest usefulness have accepted what seemed to them here the lowliest place in the kingdom of their father are not i believe the least likely to receive hereafter the command then unmistakable friend go up higher      lecture 8  crystal caprice   formal lecture in schoolroom after some practical examination of minerals  l we have seen enough children though very little of what might be seen if we had more time of mineral structures produced by visible opposition or contest among elements structures of which the variety however great need not surprise us for we quarrel ourselves for many and slight causesmuch more one should think may crystals who can only feel the antagonism not argue about it but there is a yet more singular mimicry of our human ways in the varieties of form which appear owing to no antagonistic force but merely to the variable humor and caprice of the crystals themselves and i have asked you all to come into the schoolroom today because of course this is a part of the crystal mind which must be peculiarly interesting to a feminine audience great symptoms of disapproval on the part of said audience now you need not pretend that it will not interest you why should it not it is true that we men are never capricious but that only makes us the more dull and disagreeable you who are crystalline in brightness as well as in caprice charm infinitely by infinitude of change audible murmurs of worse and worse as if we could be got over that way etc the lecturer however observing the expression of the features to be more complacent proceeds and the most curious mimicry if not of your changes of fashion at least of your various modes in healthy periods of national costume takes place among the crystals of different countries with a little experience it is quite possible to say at a glance in what districts certain crystals have been found and although if we had knowledge extended and accurate enough we might of course ascertain the laws and circumstances which have necessarily produced the form peculiar to each locality this would be just as true of the fancies of the human mind if we could know the exact circumstances which affect it we could foretell what now seems to us only caprice of thought as well as what now seems to us only caprice of crystal nay so far as our knowledge reaches it is on the whole easier to find some reason why the peasant girls of berne should wear their caps in the shape of butterflies and the peasant girls of munich theirs in the shape of shells than to say why the rockcrystals of dauphine should all have their summits of the shape of lippieces of flageolets while those of st gothard are symmetrical or why the fluor of chamouni is rosecolored and in octahedrons while the fluor of weardale is green and in cubes still farther removed is the hope at present of accounting for minor differences in modes of grouping and construction take for instance the caprices of this single mineral quartvariations upon a single theme it has many forms but see what it will make out of this one the sixsided prism for shortness sake i shall call the body of the prism its column and the pyramid at the extremities its cap now here first you have a straight column as long and thin as a stalk of asparagus with two little caps at the ends and here you have a short thick column as solid as a haystack with two fat caps at the ends and here you have two caps fastened together and no column at all between them then here is a crystal with its column fat in the middle and tapering to a little cap and here is one stalked like a mushroom with a huge cap put on the top of a slender column then here is a column built wholly out of little caps with a large smooth cap at the top and here is a column built of columns and caps the caps all truncated about halfway to their points and in both these last the little crystals are set anyhow and build the large one in a disorderly way but here is a crystal made of columns and truncated caps set in regular terraces all the way up  mary but are not these groups of crystals rather than one crystal  l what do you mean by a group and what by one crystal  dora audibly aside to mary who is brought to pause you know you are never expected to answer mary  l im sure this is easy enough what do you mean by a group of people  mary three or four together or a good many together like the caps in these crystals  l but when a great many persons get together they dont take the shape of one person  mary still at pause  isabel no because they cant but you know the crystals can so why shouldnt they  l well they dont that is to say they dont always nor even often look here isabel  isabel what a nasty ugly thing  l im glad you think it so ugly yet it is made of beautiful crystals they are a little gray and cold in color but most of them are clear  isabel but theyre in such horrid horrid disorder  l yes all disorder is horrid when it is among things that are naturally orderly some little girls rooms are naturally orderly i suppose or i dont know how they could live in them if they cry out so when they only see quartz crystals in confusion  isabel oh but how come they to be like that  l you may well ask and yet you will always hear people talking as if they thought order more wonderful than disorder it is wonderfulas we have seen but to me as to you child the supremely wonderful thing is that nature should ever be ruinous or wasteful or deathful i look at this wild piece of crystallization with endless astonishment  mary where does it come from  l the tete noire of chamonix what makes it more strange is that it should be in a vein of fine quartz if it were in a mouldering rock it would be natural enough but in the midst of so fine substance here are the crystals tossed in a heap some large myriads small almost as small as dust tumbling over each other like a terrified crowd and glued together by the sides and edges and backs and heads some warped and some pushed out and in and all spoiled and each spoiling the rest  mary and how flat they all are  l yes thats the fashion at the tete noire  mary but surely this is ruin not caprice  l i believe it is in great part misfortune and we will examine these crystal troubles in next lecture but if you want to see the gracefullest and happiest caprices of which dust is capable you must go to the hartz not that i ever mean to go there myself for i want to retain the romantic feeling about the name and i have done myself some harm already by seeing the monotonous and heavy form of the brocken from the suburbs of brunswick but whether the mountains be picturesque or not the tricks which the goblins as i am told teach the crystals in them are incomparably pretty they work chiefly on the mind of a docile bluishcolored carbonate of lime which comes out of a gray limestone the goblins take the greatest possible care of its education and see that nothing happens to it to hurt its temper and when it may be supposed to have arrived at the crisis which is to a well brought up mineral what presentation at court is to a young ladyafter which it is expected to set fashionstheres no end to its pretty ways of behaving first it will make itself into pointed darts as fine as hoarfrost here it is changed into a white fur as fine as silk here into little crowns and circlets as bright as silver as if for the gnome princesses to wear here it is in beautiful little plates for them to eat off presently it is in towers which they might be imprisoned in presently in caves and cells where they may make nungnomes of themselves and no gnome ever hear of them more here is some of it in sheaves like corn here some in drifts like snow here some in rays like stars and though these are all of them necessarily shapes that the mineral takes in other places they are all taken here with such a grace that you recognize the high caste and breeding of the crystals wherever you meet them and know at once they are hartz born  of course such fine things as these are only done by crystals which are perfectly good and goodhumored and of course also there are illhumored crystals who torment each other and annoy quieter crystals yet without coming to anything like serious war here for once is some illdisposed quartz tormenting a peaceable octahedron of fluor in mere caprice i looked at it the other night so long and so wonderingly just before putting my candle out that i fell into another strange dream but you dont care about dreams  dora no we didnt yesterday but you know we are made up of caprice so we do today and you must tell it us directly  l well you see neith and her work were still much in my mind and then i had been looking over these hartz things for you and thinking of the sort of grotesque sympathy there seemed to be in them with the beautiful fringe and pinnacle work of northern architecture so when i fell asleep i thought i saw neith and st barbara talking together  dora but what had st barbara to do with it  l my dear i am quite sure st barbara is the patroness of good architects not st thomas whatever the old builders thought it might be very fine according to the monks notions in st thomas to give all his employers money away to the poor but breaches of contract are bad foundations and i believe it was not he but st barbara who overlooked the work in all the buildings you and i care about however that may be it was certainly she whom i saw in my dream with neith neith was sitting weaving and i thought she looked sad and threw her shuttle slowly and st barbara was standing at her side in a stiff little gown all ins and outs and angles but so bright with embroidery that it dazzled me whenever she moved the train of it was just like a heap of broken jewels it was so stiff and full of corners and so manycolored and bright her hair fell over her shoulders in long delicate waves from under a little three pinnacled crown like a tower she was asking neith about the laws of architecture in egypt and greece and when neith told her the measures of the pyramids st barbara said she thought they would have been better threecornered and when neith told her the measures of the parthenon st barbara said she thought it ought to have had two transepts but she was pleased when neith told her of the temple of the dew and of the caryan maidens bearing its frieze and then she thought that perhaps neith would like to hear what sort of temples she was building herself in the french valleys and on the crags of the rhine so she began gossiping just as one of you might to an old lady and certainly she talked in the sweetest way in the world to neith and explained to her all about crockets and pinnacles and neith sat looking very grave and always graver as st barbara went on till at last im sorry to say st barbara lost her temper a little  mary very grave herself st barbara  l yes mary why shouldnt she it was very tiresome of neith to sit looking like that  may but then st barbara was a saint  l whats that may  may a saint a saint isi am sure you know  l if i did it would not make me sure that you knew too may but i dont  violet expressing the incredulity of the audience ohsir  l that is to say i know that people are called saints who are supposed to be better than others but i dont know how much better they must be in order to be saints nor how nearly anybody may be a saint and yet not be quite one nor whether everybody who is called a saint was one nor whether everybody who isnt called a saint isnt one  general silence the audience feeling themselves on the verge of the infinitiesand a little shockedand much puzzled by so many questions at once  l besides did you never hear that verse about beingcalled to be saints  may repeats rom i 7  l quite right may well then who are called to be that people in rome only  may everybody i suppose whom god loves  l what little girls as well as other people  may all grownup people i mean  l why not little girls are they wickeder when they are little  may oh i hope not  l why not little girls then pause  lily because you know we cant be worth anything if were ever so goodi mean if we try to be ever so good and we cant do difficult thingslike saints  l i am afraid my dear that old people are not more able or willing for their difficulties than you children are for yours all i can say is that if ever i see any of you when you are seven or eight and twenty knitting your brows over any work you want to do or to understand as i saw you lily knitting your brows over your slate this morning i should think you very noble women butto come back to my dreamst barbara did lose her temper a little and i was not surprised for you cant think how provoking neith looked sitting there just like a statue of sandstone only going on weaving like a machine and never quickening the cast of her shuttle while st barbara was telling her so eagerly all about the most beautiful things and chattering away as fast as bells ring on christmas eve till she saw that neilh didnt care and then st barbara got as red as a rose and stopped just in time or i think she would really have said something naughty  isabel oh please but didnt neith say anything then  l yes she said quite quietly it may be very pretty my love but it is all nonsense  isabel oh dear oh dear and then  l well then i was a little angry myself and hoped st barbara would be quite angry but she wasnt she bit her lips first and then gave a great sighsuch a wild sweet sighand then she knelt down and hid her face on neiths knees then neith smiled a little and was moved  isabel oh i am so glad  l and she touched st barbaras forehead with a flower of white lotus and st barbara sobbed once or twice and then said if you only could see how beautiful it is and how much it makes people feel what is good and lovely and if you could only hear the children singing in the lady chapels and neith smiledbut still sadlyand said how do you know what i have seen or heard my love do you think all those vaults and towers of yours have been built without me there was not a pillar in your giottos santa maria del fiore which i did not set true by my spearshaft as it rose but this pinnacle and flame work which has set your little heart on fire is all vanity and you will see what it will come to and that soon and none will grieve for it more than i and then every one will disbelieve your pretty symbols and types men must be spoken simply to my dear if you would guide them kindly and long but st barbara answered that indeed she thought every one liked her work and that the people of different towns were as eager about their cathedral towers as about their privileges or their markets and then she asked neith to come and build something with her wall against tower and see whether the people will be as much pleased with your building as with mine but neith answered i will not contend with you my dear i strive not with those who love me and for those who hate me it is not well to strive with me as weaver arachne knows and remember child that nothing is ever done beautifully which is done in rivalship nor nobly which is done in pride  then st barbara hung her head quite down and said she was very sorry she had been so foolish and kissed neith and stood thinking a minute and then her eyes got bright again and she said she would go directly and build a chapel with five windows in it four for the four cardinal virtues and one for humility in the middle bigger than the rest and neith very nearly laughed quite out i thought certainly her beautiful lips lost all their sternness for an instant then she said well love build it but do not put so many colors into your windows as you usually do else no one will be able to see to read inside and when it is built let a poor village priest consecrate it and not an archbishop st barbara started a little i thought and turned as if to say something but changed her mind and gathered up her train and went out and neith bent herself again to her loom in which she was weaving a web of strange dark colors i thought but perhaps it was only after the glittering of st barbaras embroidered train and i tried to make out the figures in neiths web and confused myself among them as one always does in dreams and then the dream changed altogether and i found myself all at once among a crowd of little gothic and egyptian spirits who were quarreling at least the gothic ones were trying to quarrel for the egyptian ones only sat with their hands on their knees and their aprons sticking out very stiffly and stared and after a while i began to understand what the matter was it seemed that some of the troublesome building imps who meddle and make continually even in the best gothic work had been listening to st barbaras talk with neith and had made up their minds that neith had no workpeople who could build against them they were but dull imps as you may fancy by their thinking that and never had done much except disturbing the great gothic building angels at their work and playing tricks to each other indeed of late they had been living years and years like bats up under the cornices of strasbourg and cologne cathedrals with nothing to do but to make mouths at the people below however they thought they knew everything about tower building and those who had heard what neith said told the rest and they all flew down directly chattering in german like jackdaws to show neiths people what they could do and they had found some of neiths old workpeople somewhere near sais sitting in the sun with their hands on their knees and abused them heartily and neiths people did not mind at first but after a while they seemed to get tired of the noise and one or two rose up slowly and laid hold of their measuring rods and said if st barbaras people liked to build with them tower against pyramid they would show them how to lay stones  then the gothic little spirits threw a great many double somersaults for joy and put the tips of their tongues out slyly to each other on one side and i heard the egyptians say they must be some new kind of frogthey didnt think there was much building in them however the stiff old workers took their rods as i said and measured out a square space of sand but as soon as the german spirits saw that they declared they wanted exactly that bit of ground to build on themselves then the egyptian builders offered to go farther off and the german ones said ja wohl but as soon as the egyptians had measured out another square the little germans said they must have some of that too then neiths people laughed and said they might take as much as they liked but they would not move the plan of their pyramid again then the little germans took three pieces and began to build three spires directly one large and two little and when the egyptians saw they had fairly begun they laid their foundation all round of large square stones and began to build so steadily that they had like to have swallowed up the three little german spires so when the gothic spirits saw that they built their spires leaning like the tower of pisa that they might stick out at the side of the pyramid and neiths people stared at them and thought it very clever but very wrong and on they went in their own way and said nothing then the little gothic spirits were terribly provoked because they could not spoil the shape of the pyramid and they sat down all along the ledges of it to make faces but that did no good then they ran to the corners and put their elbows on their knees and stuck themselves out as far as they could and made more faces but that did no good neither then they looked up to the sky and opened their mouths wide and gobbled and said it was too hot for work and wondered when it would rain but that did no good neither and all the while the egyptian spirits were laying step above step patiently but when the gothic ones looked and saw how big they had got they said ach himmel and flew down in a great black cluster to the bottom and swept out a level spot in the sand with their wings in no time and began building a tower straight up as fast as they could and the egyptians stood still again to stare at them for the gothic spirits had got quite into a passion and were really working very wonderfully they cut the sandstone into strips as fine as reeds and put one reed on the top of another so that you could not see where they fitted and they twisted them in and out like basket work and knotted them into likenesses of ugly faces and of strange beasts biting each other and up they went and up still and they made spiral staircases at the corners for the loaded workers to come up by for i saw they were but weak imps and could not fly with stones on their backs and then they made traceried galleries for them to run round by and so up again with finer and finer work till the egyptians wondered whether they meant the thing for a tower or a pillar and i heard them saying to one another it was nearly as pretty as lotus stalks and if it were not for the ugly faces there would be a fine temple if they were going to build it all with pillars as big as that but in a minute afterwardsjust as the gothic spirits had carried their work as high as the upper course but three or four of the pyramidthe egyptians called out to them to mind what they were about for the sand was running away from under one of their tower corners but it was too late to mind what they were about for in another instant the whole tower sloped aside and the gothic imps rose out of it like a flight of puffins in a single cloud but screaming worse than any puffins you ever heard and down came the tower all in a piece like a falling poplar with its head right on the flank of the pyramid against which it snapped short off and of course that waked me  mary what a shame of you to have such a dream after all you have told us about gothic architecture  l if you have understood anything i ever told you about it you know that no architecture was ever corrupted more miserably or abolished more justly by the accomplishment of its own follies besides even in its days of power it was subject to catastrophes of this kind i have stood too often mourning by the grand fragment of the apse of beauvais not to have that fact well burnt into me still you must have seen surely that these imps were of the flamboyant school or at least of the german schools correspondent with it in extravagance  mary but then where is the crystal about which you dreamed all this  l here but i suppose little pthah has touched it again for it is very small but you see here is the pyramid built of great square stones of fluor spar straight up and here are the three little pinnacles of mischievous quartz which have set themselves at the same time on the same foundation only they lean like the tower of pisa and come out obliquely at the side and here is one great spire of quartz which seems as if it had been meant to stand straight up a little way off and then had fallen down against the pyramid base breaking its pinnacle away in reality it has crystallized horizontally and terminated imperfectly but then by what caprice does one crystal form horizontally when all the rest stand upright but this is nothing to the phantasies of fluor and quartz and some other such companions when they get leave to do anything they like i could show you fifty specimens about every one of which you might fancy a new fairy tale not that in truth any crystals get leave to do quite what they like and many of them are sadly tried and have little time for capricespoor things  mary i thought they always looked as if they were either in play or in mischief what trials have they  l trials much like our own sickness and starvation fevers and agues and palsy oppression and old age and the necessity of passing away in their time like all else if theres any pity in you you must come tomorrow and take some part in these crystal griefs  dora i am sure we shall cry till our eyes are red l ah you may laugh dora but ive been made grave not once nor twice to see that even crystals cannot choose but be old at last it may be but a shallow proverb of the justices but it is a shrewdly wide one  dora pensive for once i suppose it is very dreadful to be old but then brightening again what should we do without our dear old friends and our nice old lecturers  l if all nice old lecturers were minded as little as one i know of  dora and if they all meant as little what they say would they not deserve it but well comewell come and cry      lecture 9  crystal sorrows   working lecture in schoolroom  l we have been hitherto talking children as if crystals might live and play and quarrel and behave ill or well according to their characters without interruption from anything else but so far from this being so nearly all crystals whatever their characters have to live a hard life of it and meet with many misfortunes if we could see far enough we should find indeed that at the root all their vices were misfortunes but today i want you to see what sort of troubles the best crystals have to go through occasionally by no fault of their own  this black thing which is one of the prettiest of the very few pretty black things in the world is called tourmaline it may be transparent and green or red as well as black and then no stone can be prettier only all the light that gets into it i believe comes out a good deal the worse and is not itself again for a long while but this is the commonest state of itopaque and as black as jet  mary what does tourmaline mean  l they say it is ceylanese and i dont know ceylanese but we may always be thankful for a graceful word whatever it means  mary and what is it made of  l a little of everything theres always flint and clay and magnesia in it and the black is iron according to its fancy and theres boracic acid if you know what that is and if you dont i cannot tell you today and it doesnt signify and theres potash and soda and on the whole the chemistry of it is more like a mediaeval doctors prescription than the making of a respectable mineral but it may perhaps be owing to the strange complexity of its make that it has a notable habit which makes it to me one of the most interesting of minerals you see these two crystals are broken right across in many places just as if they had been shafts of black marble fallen from a ruinous temple and here they lie imbedded in white quartz fragment succeeding fragment keeping the line of the original crystal while the quartz fills up the intervening spaces now tourmaline has a trick of doing this more than any other mineral i know here is another bit which i picked up on the glacier of macugnaga it is broken like a pillar built of very flat broad stones into about thirty joints and all these are heaved and warped away from each other sideways almost into a line of steps and then all is tilled up with quartz paste and here lastly is a green indian piece in which the pillar is first disjointed and then wrung round into the shape of an s  mary how can this have been done  l there are a thousand ways in which it may have been done the difficulty is not to account for the doing of it but for the showing of it in some crystals and not in others you never by any chance get a quartz crystal broken or twisted in this way if it break or twist at all which it does sometimes like the spire of dijon it is by its own will or fault it never seems to have been passively crushed but for the forces which cause this passive ruin of the tourmalinehere is a stone which will show you multitudes of them in operation at once it is known as biecciated agate beautiful as you see and highly valued as a pebble yet so far as i can read or hear no one has ever looked at it with the least attention at the first glance you see it is made of very fine red striped agates which have been broken into small pieces and fastened together again by paste also of agate there would be nothing wonderful in this if this were all it is well known that by the movements of strata portions of rock are often shattered to pieceswell known also that agate is a deposit of flint by water under certain conditions of heat and pressure there is therefore nothing wonderful in an agates being broken and nothing wonderful in its being mended with the solution out of which it was itself originally congealed and with this explanation most people looking at a brecciated agate or brecciated anything seem to be satisfied i was so myself for twenty years but lately happening to stay for some time at the swiss baden where the beach of the limmat is almost wholly composed of brecciated limestones i began to examine them thoughtfully and perceived in the end that they were one and all knots of as rich mystery as any poor little human brain was ever lost in that piece of agate in your hand mary will show you many of the common phenomena of breccias but you need not knit your brows over it in that way depend upon it neither you nor i shall ever know anything about the way it was made as long as we live  dora that does not seem much to depend upon  l pardon me puss when once we gain some real notion of the extent and unconquerableness of our ignorance it is a very broad and restful thing to depend upon you can throw yourself upon it at ease as on a cloud to feast with the gods you do not thenceforward trouble yourselfnor any one elsewith theories or the contradiction of theories you neither get headache nor heartburning and you nevermore waste your poor little store of strength or allowance of time  however there are certain facts about this agatemaking which i can tell you and then you may look at it in a pleasant wonder as long as you like pleasant wonder is no loss of time  first then it is not broken freely by a blow it is slowly wrung or ground to pieces you can only with extreme dimness conceive the force exerted on mountains in transitional states of movement you have all read a little geology and you know how coolly geologists talk of mountains being raised or depressed they talk coolly of it because they are accustomed to the fact but the very universality of the fact prevents us from ever conceiving distinctly the conditions of force involved you know i was living last year in savoy my house was on the back of a sloping mountain which rose gradually for two miles behind it and then fell at once in a great precipice toward geneva going down three thousand feet in four or five cliffs or steps now that whole group of cliffs had simply been torn away by sheer strength from the rocks below as if the whole mass had been as soft as biscuit put four or five captains biscuits on the floor on the top of one another and try to break them all in half not by bending but by holding one half down and tearing the other halves straight upof course you will not be able to do it but you will feel and comprehend the sort of force needed then fancy each captains biscuit a bed of rock six or seven hundred feet thick and the whole mass torn straight through and one half heaved up three thousand feet grinding against the other as it roseand you will have some idea of the making of the mont saleve  may but it must crush the rocks all to dust  l no for there is no room for dust the pressure is too great probably the heat developed also so great that the rock is made partly ductile but the worst of it is that we never can see these parts of mountains in the state they were left in at the time of their elevation for it is precisely in these rents and dislocations that the crystalline power principally exerts itself it is essentially a styptic power and wherever the earth is torn it heals and binds nay the torture and grieving of the earth seem necessary to bring out its full energy for you only find the crystalline living power fully in action where the rents and faults are deep and many  dora if you please sirwould you tell uswhat are faults  l you never heard of such things  dora never in all our lives  l when a vein of rock which is going on smoothly is interrupted by another troublesome little vein which stops it and puts it out so that it has to begin again in another placethat is called a fault i always think it ought to be called the fault of the vein that interrupts it but the miners always call it the fault of the vein that is interrupted  dora so it is if it does not begin again where it left off  l well that is certainly the gist of the business but whatever goodnatured old lecturers may do the rocks have a bad habit when they are once interrupted of never asking where was i  dora when the two halves of the diningtable came separate yesterday was that a fault  l yes but not the tables however it is not a bad illustration dora when beds of rock are only interrupted by a fissure but remain at the same level like the two halves of the table it is not called a fault but only a fissure but if one half of the table be either tilted higher than the other or pushed to the side so that the two parts will not fit it is a fault you had better read the chapter on faults in jukess geology then you will know all about it and this rent that i am telling you of in the saleve is one only of myriads to which are owing the forms of the alps as i believe of all great mountain chains wherever you see a precipice on any scale of real magnificence you will nearly always find it owing to some dislocation of this kind but the point of chief wonder to me is the delicacy of the touch by which these gigantic rents have been apparently accomplished note however that we have no clear evidence hitherto of the time taken to produce any of them we know that a change of temperature alters the position and the angles of the atoms of crystals and also the entire bulk of rocks we know that in all volcanic and the greater part of all subterranean action temperatures are continually changing and therefore masses of rock must be expanding or contracting with infinite slowness but with infinite force this pressure must result in mechanical strain somewhere both in their own substance and in that of the rocks surrounding them and we can form no conception of the result of irresistible pressure applied so as to rend and raise with imperceptible slowness of gradation masses thousands of feet in thickness we want some experiments tried on masses of iron and stone and we cant get them tried because christian creatures never will seriously and sufficiently spend money except to find out the shortest ways of killing each other but besides this slow kind of pressure there is evidence of more or less sudden violence on the same terrific scale and through it all the wonder as i said is always to me the delicacy of touch i cut a block of the saleve limestone from the edge of one of the principal faults which have formed the precipice it is a lovely compact limestone and the fault itself is filled up with a red breccia formed of the crushed fragments of the torn rock cemented by a rich red crystalline paste i have had the piece i cut from it smoothed and polished across the junction here it is and you may now pass your soft little fingers over the surface without so much as feeling the place where a rock which all the hills of england might have been sunk in the body of and not a summit seen was torn asunder through that whole thickness as a thin dress is torn when you tread upon it  the audience examine the stone and touch it timidly but the matter remains inconceivable to them  mary struck by the beauty of the stone but this is almost marble  l it is quite marble and another singular point in the business to my mind is that these stones which men have been cutting into slabs for thousands of years to ornament their principal buildings withand which under the general name of marble have been the delight of the eyes and the wealth of architecture among all civilized nationsare precisely those on which the signs and brands of these earth agonies have been chiefly struck and there is not a purple vein nor flaming zone in them which is not the record of their ancient torture what a boundless capacity for sleep and for serene stupidity there is in the human mind fancy reflective beings who cut and polish stones for three thousand years for the sake of the pretty stains upon them and educate themselves to an art at last such as it is of imitating these veins by dexterous painting and never a curious soul of them all that while asks what painted the rocks  the audience look dejected and ashamed of themselves  the fact is we are all and always asleep through our lives and it is only by pinching ourselves very hard that we ever come to see or understand anything at least it is not always we who pinch ourselves sometimes other people pinch us which i suppose is very good of themor other things which i suppose is very proper of them but it is a sad life made up chiefly of naps and pinches  some of the audience on this appearing to think that the others require pinching the lecturer changes the subject  now however for once look at a piece of marble carefully and think about it you see this is one side of the fault the other side is down or up nobody knows where but on this side you can trace the evidence of the dragging and tearing action all along the edge of this marble the ends of the fibers of the rock are torn here an inch and there half an inch away from each other and you see the exact places where they fitted before they were torn separate and you see the rents are now all filled up with the sanguine paste full of the broken pieces of the rock the paste itself seems to have been half melted and partly to have also melted the edge of the fragments it contains and then to have crystallized with them and round them and the brecciated agate i first showed you contains exactly the same phenomena a zoned crystallization going on amidst the cemented fragments partly altering the structure of those fragments themselves and subject to continual change either in the intensity of its own power or in the nature of the materials submitted to itso that at one time gravity acts upon them and disposes them in horizontal layers or causes them to droop in stalactites and at another gravity is entirely defied and the substances in solution are crystallized in bands of equal thickness on every side of the cell it would require a course of lectures longer than these i have a great mindyou have behaved so saucilyto stay and give them to describe to you the phenomena of this kind in agates and chalcedonies onlynay there is a single sarcophagus in the british museum covered with grand sculpture of the 18th dynasty which contains in magnificent breccia agates and jaspers imbedded in porphyry out of which it is hewn material for the thought of years and record of the earthsorrow of ages in comparison with the duration of which the egyptian letters tell us but the history of the evening and morning of a day  agates i think of all stones confess most of their past history but all crystallization goes on under and partly records circumstances of this kindcircumstances of infinite variety but always involving difficulty interruption and change of condition at different times observe first you have the whole mass of the rock in motion either contracting itself and so gradually widening the cracks or being compressed and thereby closing them and crushing their edgesand if one part of its substance be softer at the given temperature than another probably squeezing that softer substance out into the veins then the veins themselves when the rock leaves them open by its contraction act with various power of suction upon its substanceby capillary attraction when they are fineby that of pure vacuity when they are larger or by changes in the constitution and condensation of the mixed gases with which they have been originally filled those gases themselves may be supplied in all variation of volume and power from below or slowly by the decomposition of the rocks themselves and at changing temperatures must exert relatively changing forces of decomposition and combination on the walls of the veins they fill while water at every degree of heat and pressure from beds of everlasting ice alternate with cliffs of native rock to volumes of red hot or white hot steam congeals and drips and throbs and thrills from crag to crag and breathes from pulse to pulse of foaming or fiery arteries whose beating is felt through chains of the great islands of the indian seas as your own pulses lift your bracelets and makes whole kingdoms of the world quiver in deadly earthquake as if they were light as aspen leaves and remember the poor little crystals have to live their lives and mind their own affairs in the midst of all this as best they may they are wonderfully like human creaturesforget all that is going on if they dont see it however dreadful and never think what is to happen tomorrow they are spiteful or loving and indolent or painstaking and orderly or licentious with no thought whatever of the lava or the flood which may break over them any day and evaporate them into airbubbles or wash them into a solution of salts and you may look at them once understanding the surrounding conditions of their fate with an endless interest you will see crowds of unfortunate little crystals who have been forced to constitute themselves in a hurry their dissolving element being fiercely scorched away you will see them doing their best bright and numberless but tiny then you will find indulged crystals who have had centuries to form themselves in and have changed their mind and ways continually and have been tired and taken heart again and have been sick and got well again and thought they would try a different diet and then thought better of it and made but a poor use of their advantages after all and others you will see who have begun life as wicked crystals and then have been impressed by alarming circumstances and have become converted crystals and behaved amazingly for a little while and fallen away again and ended but discreditably perhaps even in decomposition so that one doesnt know what will become of them and sometimes you will see deceitful crystals that look as soft as velvet and are deadly to all near them and sometimes you will see deceitful crystals that seem flintedged like our little quartzcrystal of a housekeeper here hush dora and are endlessly gentle and true wherever gentleness and truth are needed and sometimes you will see little childcrystals put to school like schoolgirls and made to stand in rows and taken the greatest care of and taught how to hold themselves up and behave and sometimes you will see unhappy little childcrystals left to lie about in the dirt and pick up their living and learn manners where they can and sometimes you will see fat crystals eating up thin ones like great capitalists and little laborers and politicoeconomic crystals teaching the stupid ones how to eat each other and cheat each other and foolish crystals getting in the way of wise ones and impatient crystals spoiling the plans of patient ones irreparably just as things go on in the world and sometimes you may see hypocritical crystals taking the shape of others though they are nothing like in their minds and vampire crystals eating out the hearts of others and hermitcrab crystals living in the shells of others and parasite crystals living on the means of others and courtier crystals glittering in attendance upon others and all these besides the two great companies of war and peace who ally themselves resolutely to attack or resolutely to defend and for the close you see the broad shadow and deadly force of inevitable fate above all this you see the multitudes of crystals whose time has come not a set time as with us but yet a time sooner or later when they all must give up their crystal ghostswhen the strength by which they grew and the breath given them to breathe pass away from them and they fail and are consumed and vanish away and another generation is brought to life framed out of their ashes  mary it is very terrible is it not the complete fulfillment down into the very dust of that verse the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain  l i do not know that it is in pain mary at least the evidence tends to show that there is much more pleasure than pain as soon as sensation becomes possible  lucilla but then surely if we are told that it is pain it must be pain  l yes if we are told and told in the way you mean lucilla but nothing is said of the proportion to pleasure unmitigated pain would kill any of us in a few hours pain equal to our pleasures would make us loathe life the word itself cannot be applied to the lower conditions of matter in its ordinary sense but wait till tomorrow to ask me about this tomorrow is to be kept for questions and difficulties let us keep to the plain facts today there is yet one group of facts connected with this rending of the rocks which i especially want you to notice you know when you have mended a very old dress quite meritoriously till it wont mend any more  egypt interrupting could not you sometimes take gentlemens work to illustrate by  l gentlemens work is rarely so useful as yours egypt and when it is useful girls cannot easily understand it  dora i am sure we should understand it better than gentlemen understand about sewing  l my dear i hope i always speak modestly and under correction when i touch upon matters of the kind too high for me and besides i never intend to speak otherwise than respectfully of sewingthough you always seem to think i am laughing at you in all seriousness illustrations from sewing are those which neith likes me best to use and which young ladies ought to like everybody to use what do you think the beautiful word wife comes from  dora tossing her head i dont think it is a particularly beautiful word  l perhaps not at your ages you may think bride sounds better but wifes the word for wear depend upon it it is the great word in which the english and latin languages conquer the french and the greek i hope the french will some day get a word for it yet instead of their dreadful femme but what do you think it comes from  dora i never did think about it  l nor you sibyl  sibyl no i thought it was saxon and stopped there  l yes but the great good of saxon words is that they usually do mean something wife means weaver you have all the right to call yourselves little housewives when you sew neatly  dora but i don t think we want to call ourselves little housewives  l you must either be housewives or housemoths remember that in the deep sense you must either weave mens fortunes and embroider them or feed upon and bring them to decay you had better let me keep my sewing illustration and help me out with it  dora well well hear it under protest  l you have heard it before but with reference to other matters when it is said no man putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else it taketh from the old does it not mean that the new piece tears the old one away at the sewn edge  dora yes certainly  l and when you mend a decayed stuff with strong thread does not the whole edge come away sometimes when it tears again  dora yes and then it is of no use to mend it any more  l well the rocks dont seem to think that but the same thing happens to them continually i told you they were full of rents or veins large masses of mountain are sometimes as full of veins as your hand is and of veins nearly as fine only you know a rock vein does not mean a tube but a crack or cleft now these clefts are mended usually with the strongest material the rock can find and often literally with threads for the gradually opening rent seems to draw the substance it is filled with into fibers which cross from one side of it to the other and are partly crystalline so that when the crystals become distinct the fissure has often exactly the look of a tear brought together with strong cross stitches now when this is completely done and all has been fastened and made firm perhaps some new change of temperature may occur and the rock begin to contract again then the old vein must open wider or else another open elsewhere if the old vein widen it may do so at its center but it constantly happens with well filled veins that the cross stitches are too strong to break the walls of the vein instead are torn away by them and another little supplementary veinoften three or four successivelywill be thus formed at the side of the first  mary that is really very much like our work but what do the mountains use to sew with  l quartz whenever they can get it pure limestones are obliged to be content with carbonate of lime but most mixed rocks can find some quartz for themselves here is a piece of black slate from the buet it looks merely like dry dark mud you could not think there was any quartz in it but you see its rents are all stitched together with beautiful white thread which is the purest quartz so close drawn that you can break it like flint in the mass but where it has been exposed to the weather the fine fibrous structure is shown and more than that you see the threads have been all twisted and pulled aside this way and the other by the warpings and shifting of the sides of the vein as it widened  mary it is wonderful but is that going on still are the mountains being torn and sewn together again at this moment  l yes certainly my dear but i think just as certainly though geologists differ on this matter not with the violence or on the scale of their ancient ruin and renewal all things seem to be tending towards a condition of at least temporary rest and that groaning and travailing of the creation as assuredly not wholly in pain is not in the full sense until now  mary i want so much to ask you about that  sibyl yes and we all want to ask you about a great many other things besides  l it seems to me that you have got quite as many new ideas as are good for any of you at present and i should not like to burden you with more but i must see that those you have are clear if i can make them so so we will have one more talk for answer of questions mainly think over all the ground and make your difficulties thoroughly presentable then well see what we can make of them  dora they shall all be dressed in their very best and curtsey as they come in  l no no dora no curtseys if you please i had enough of them the day you all took a fit of reverence and curtsied me out of the room  dora but you know we cured ourselves of the fault at once by that fit we have never been the least respectful since and the difficulties will only curtsey themselves out of the room i hopecome in at one doorvanish at the other  l what a pleasant world it would be if all its difficulties were taught to behave so however one can generally make something or better still nothing or at least less of them if they thoroughly know their own minds and your difficultiesi must say that for you childrengenerally do know their own minds as you do yourselves  dora that is very kindly said for us some people would not allow so much as that girls had any minds to know  l they will at least admit that you have minds to change dora  mary you might have left us the last speech without a retouch but well put our little minds such as they are in the best trim we can for tomorrow      lecture 10  the crystal rest   evening the fireside ls armchair in the comfortablest corner  l perceiving various arrangements being made of footstool cushion screen and the like yes yes its all very fine and i am to sit here to be asked questions till suppertime am i  dora i dont think you can have any supper tonightweve got so much to ask  lily oh miss dora we can fetch it him here you know so nicely  l yes lily that will be pleasant with competitive examination going on over ones plate the competition being among the examiners really now that i know what teasing things girls are i dont so much wonder that people used to put up patiently with the dragons who took them for supper but i cant help myself i supposeno thanks to st george ask away children and ill answer as civilly as may be  dora we dont so much care about being answered civilly as about not being asked things back again  l ayez seulement la patience que je le parle there shall be no requitals  dora well then first of allwhat shall we ask first mary  mary it does not matter i think all the questions come into one at last nearly  dora you know you always talk as if the crystals were alive and we never understand how much you are in play and how much in earnest thats the first thing  l neither do i understand myself my dear how much i am in earnest the stones puzzle me as much as i puzzle you they look as if they were alive and make me speak as if they were and i do not in the least know how much truth there is in the appearance im not to ask things back again tonight but all questions of this sort lead necessarily to the one main question which we asked before in vain what is it to be alive  dora yes but we want to come back to that for weve been reading scientific books about the conservation of forces and it seems all so grand and wonderful and the experiments are so pretty and i suppose it must be all right but then the books never speak as if there were any such thing as life  l they mostly omit that part of the subject certainly dora but they are beautifully right as far as they go and life is not a convenient element to deal with they seem to have been getting some of it into and out of bottles in their ozone and antizone lately but they still know little of it and certainly i know less  dora you promised not to be provoking tonight  l wait a minute though quite truly i know less of the secrets of life than the philosophers do i yet know one corner of ground on which we artists can stand literally as life guards at bay as steadily as the guards at inkermann however hard the philosophers push and you may stand with us if once you learn to draw nicely  dora im sure we are all trying but tell us where we may stand  l you may always stand by form against force to a painter the essential character of anything is the form of it and the philosophers cannot touch that they come and tell you for instance that there is as much heat or motion or calorific energy or whatever else they like to call it in a teakettle as in a giereagle very good that is so and it is very interesting it requires just as much heat as will boil the kettle to take the giereagle up to his nest and as much more to bring him down again on a hare or a partridge but we painters acknowledging the equality and similarity of the kettle and the bird in all scientific respects attach for our part our principal interest to the difference in their forms for us the primarily cognizable facts in the two things are that the kettle has a spout and the eagle a beak the one a lid on its back the other a pair of wingsnot to speak of the distinction also of volition which the philosophers may properly call merely a form or mode of forcebut then to an artist the form or mode is the gist of the business the kettle chooses to sit still on the hob the eagle to recline on the air it is the fact of the choice not the equal degree of temperature in the fulfillment of it which appears to us the more interesting circumstancethough the other is very interesting too exceedingly so dont laugh children the philosophers have been doing quite splendid work lately in their own way especially the transformation of force into light is a great piece of systematized discovery and this notion about the sun being supplied with his flame by ceaseless meteoric hail is grand and looks very likely to be true of course it is only the old gunlockflint and steelon a large scale but the order and majesty of it are sublime still we sculptors and painters care little about it it is very fine we say and very useful this knocking the light out of the sun or into it by an eternal cataract of planets but you may hail away so forever and you will not knock out what we can here is a bit of silver not the size of halfacrown on which with a single hammer stroke one of us two thousand and odd years ago hit out the head of the apollo of clazomenas it is merely a matter of form but if any of you philosophers with your whole planetary system to hammer with can hit out such another bit of silver as thiswe will take off our hats to you for the present we keep them on  mary yes i understand and that is nice but i dont think we shall any of us like having only form to depend upon  l it was not neglected in the making of eve my dear  mary it does not seem to separate us from the dust of the ground it is that breathing of the life which we want to understand  l so you should but hold fast to the form and defend that first as distinguished from the mere transition of forces discern the molding hand of the potter commanding the clay from his merely beating foot as it turns the wheel if you can find incense in the vase afterwardswell but it is curious how far mere form will carry you ahead of the philosophers for instance with regard to the most interesting of all their modes of force lightthey never consider how far the existence of it depends on the putting of certain vitreous and nervous substances into the formal arrangement which we call an eye the german philosophers began the attack long ago on the other side by telling us there was no such thingas light at all unless we chose to see it now german and english both have reversed their engines and insist that light would be exactly the same light that it is though nobody could ever see it the fact being that the force must be there and the eyes there and light means the effect of the one on the otherand perhaps alsoplato saw farther into that mystery than any one has since that i know ofon something a little way within the eyes but we may stand quite safe close behind the retina and defy the philosophers  sibyl but i dont care so much about defying the philosophers if only one could get a clear idea of life or soul for ones self  l well sibyl you used to know more about it in that cave of yours than any of us i was just going to ask you about inspiration and the golden bough and the like only i remembered i was not to ask anything but will not you at least tell us whether the ideas of life as the power of putting things together or making them and of death as the power of pushing things separate or unmaking them may not be very simply held in balance against each other  sibyl no i am not in my cave tonight and cannot tell you anything  l i think they may modern philosophy is a great separator it is little more than the expansion of molieres great sentence il sensuit de la que tout ce quily a de beau est dans les dictionnaires il ny a que les mots qui sont transposes but when you used to be in your cave sibyl and to be inspired there was and there remains still in some small measure beyond the merely formative and sustaining power another which we painters call passioni dont know what the philosophers call it we know it makes people red or white and therefore it must be something itself and perhaps it is the most truly poetic or making force of all creating a world of its own out of a glance or a sigh and the want of passion is perhaps the truest death or unmaking of everythingeven of stones by the way you were all reading about that ascent of the aiguille verte the other day  sibyl because you had told us it was so difficult you thought it could not be ascended  l yes i believed the aiguille verte would have held its own but do you recollect what one of the climbers exclaimed when he first felt sure of reaching the summit  sibyl yes it was oh aiguille verte vous etes morte vous etes morte  l that was true instinct real philosophic joy now can you at all fancy the difference between that feeling of triumph in a mountains death and the exultation of your beloved poet in its life  quantus athos aut quantus eryx aut ipse coruscis quum fremit ilicibus quantus gaudetque nivali vertice se attollens pater apenninus ad auras  dora you must translate for us mere housekeepers please whatever the carekeepers may know about it  may ill try then to  l no dryden is a far way worse than nothing and nobody will do you cant translate it but this is all you need know that the lines are full of a passionate sense of the apennines fatherhood or protecting power over italy and of sympathy with their joy in their snowy strength in heaven and with the same joy shuddering through all the leaves of their forests  mary yes that is a difference indeed but then you know one cant help feeling that it is fanciful it is very delightful to imagine the mountains to be alive but thenare they alive  l it seems to me on the whole mary that the feelings of the purest and most mightily passioned human souls are likely to be the truest not indeed if they do not desire to know the truth or blind themselves to it that they may please themselves with passion for then they are no longer pure but if continually seeking and accepting the truth as far as it is discernible they trust their maker for the integrity of the instincts he has gifted them with and rest in the sense of a higher truth which they cannot demonstrate i think they will be most in the right so  dora and jessie clapping their hands then we really may believe that the mountains are living  l you may at least earnestly believe that the presence of the spirit which culminates in your own life shows itself in dawning wherever the dust of the earth begins to assume any orderly and lovely state you will find it impossible to separate this idea of gradated manifestation from that of the vital power things are not either wholly alive or wholly dead they are less or more alive take the nearest most easily examined instancethe life of a flower notice what a different degree and kind of life there is in the calyx and the corolla the calyx is nothing but the swaddling clothes of the flower the childblossom is bound up in it hand and foot guarded in it restrained by it till the time of birth the shell is hardly more subordinate to the germ in the egg than the calyx to the blossom it bursts at last but it never lives as the corolla does it may fall at the moment its task is fulfilled as in the poppy or wither gradually as in the buttercup or persist in a ligneous apathy after the flower is dead as in the rose or harmonize itself so as to share in the aspect of the real flower as in the lily but it never shares in the corollas bright passion of life and the gradations which thus exist between the different members of organic creatures exist no less between the different ranges of organism we know no higher or more energetic life than our own but there seems to me this great good in the idea of gradation of lifeit admits the idea of a life above us in other creatures as much nobler than ours as ours is nobler than that of the dust  mary i am glad you have said that for i know violet and lucilla and may want to ask you something indeed we all do only you frightened violet so about the anthill that she cant say a word and may is afraid of your teasing her too but i know they are wondering why you are always telling them about heathen gods and goddesses as if you half believed in them and you represent them as good and then we see there is really a kind of truth in the stories about them and we are all puzzled and in this we cannot even make our difficulty quite clear to ourselvesit would be such a long confused question if we could ask you all we should like to know  l nor is it any wonder mary for this is indeed the longest and the most wildly confused question that reason can deal with but i will try to give you quickly a few clear ideas about the heathen gods which you may follow out afterwards as your knowledge increases  every heathen conception of deity in which you are likely to be interested has three distinct characters  i it has a physical character it represents some of the great powers or objects of naturesun or moon or heaven or the winds or the sea and the fables first related about each deity represent figuratively the action or the natural power which it represents such as the rising and setting of the sun the tides of the sea and so on  ii it has an ethical character and represents in its history the moral dealings of god with man thus apollo is first physically the sun contending with darkness but morally the power of divine life contending with corruption athena is physically the air morally the breathing of the divine spirit of wisdom neptune is physically the sea morally the supreme power of agitating passion and so on  iii it has at last a personal character and is realized in the minds of its worshipers as a living spirit with whom men may speak face to face as a man speaks to his friend  now it is impossible to define exactly how far at any period of a national religion these three ideas are mingled or how far one prevails over the other each inquirer usually takes up one of these ideas and pursues it to the exclusion of the others no impartial effort seems to have been made to discern the real state of the heathen imagination in its successive phases for the question is not at all what a mythological figure meant in its origin but what it became in each subsequent mental development of the nation inheriting the thought exactly in proportion to the mental and moral insight of any race its mythological figures mean more to it and become more real an early and savage race means nothing more because it has nothing more to mean by its apollo than the sun while a cultivated greek means every operation of divine intellect and justice the neith of egypt meant physically little more than the blue of the air but the greek in a climate of alternate storm and calm represented the wild fringes of the stormcloud by the serpents of her aegis and the lightning and cold of the highest thunderclouds by the gorgon on her shield while morally the same types represented to him the mystery and changeful terror of knowledge as her spear and helm its ruling and defensive power and no study can be more interesting or more useful to you than that of the different meanings which have been created by great nations and great poets out of mythological figures given them at first in utter simplicity but when we approach them in their third or personal character and for its power over the whole national mind this is far the leading one we are met at once by questions which may well put all of you at pause were they idly imagined to be real beings and did they so usurp the place of the true god or were they actually real beingsevil spiritsleading men away from the true god or is it conceivable that they might have been real beingsgood spiritsentrusted with some message from the true god these were the questions you wanted to ask were they not lucilla  lucilla yes indeed  l well lucilla the answer will much depend upon the clearness of your faith in the personality of the spirits which are described in the book of your own religiontheir personality observe as distinguished from merely symbolical visions for instance when jeremiah has the vision of the seething pot with its mouth to the north you know that this which he sees is not a real thing but merely a significant dream also when zachariah sees the speckled horses among the myrtle trees in the bottom you still may suppose the vision symbolicalyou do not think of them as real spirits like pegasus seen in the form of horses but when you are told of the four riders in the apocalypse a distinct sense of personality begins to force itself upon you and though you might in a dull temper think that for one instance of all the fourth rider on the pale horse was merely a symbol of the power of deathin your stronger and more earnest moods you will rather conceive of him as a real and living angel and when you look back from the vision of the apocalypse to the account of the destruction of the egyptian firstborn and of the army of sennacherib and again to davids vision at the threshing floor of araunah the idea of personality in this deathangel becomes entirely defined just as in the appearance of the angels to abraham manoah or mary  now when you have once consented to this idea of a personal spirit must not the question instantly follow does this spirit exercise its functions towards one race of men only or towards all men was it an angel of death to the jew only or to the gentile also you find a certain divine agency made visible to a king of israel as an armed angel executing vengeance of which one special purpose was to lower his kingly pride you find another or perhaps the same agency made visible to a christian prophet as an angel standing in the sun calling to the birds that fly under heaven to come that they may eat the flesh of kings is there anything impious in the thought that the same agency might have been expressed to a greek king or greek seer by similar visionsthat this figure standing in the sun and armed with the sword or the bow whose arrows were drunk with blood and exercising especially its power in the humiliation of the proud might at first have been called only destroyer and afterwards as the light or sun of justice was recognized in the chastisement called also physician or healer if you feel hesitation in admitting the possibility of such a manifestation i believe you will find it is caused partly indeed by such trivial things as the difference to your ear between greek and english terms but far more by uncertainty in your own mind respecting the nature and truth of the visions spoken of in the bible have any of you intently examined the nature of your belief in them you for instance lucilla who think often and seriously of such things  lucilla no i never could tell what to believe about them i know they must be true in some way or other and i like reading about them  l yes and i like reading about them too lucilla as i like reading other grand poetry but surely we ought both to do more than like it will god be satisfied with us think you if we read his words merely for the sake of an entirely meaningless poetical sensation  lucilla but do not the people who give themselves to seek out the meaning of these things often get very strange and extravagant  l more than that lucilla they often go mad that abandonment of the mind to religious theory or contemplation is the very thing i have been pleading with you against i never said you should set yourself to discover the meanings but you should take careful pains to understand them so far as they are clear and you should always accurately ascertain the state of your mind about them i want you never to read merely for the pleasure of fancy still less as a formal religious duty else you might as well take to repeating paters at once for it is surely wiser to repeat one thing we understand than read a thousand which we cannot either therefore acknowledge the passages to be for the present unintelligible to you or else determine the sense in which you at present receive them or at all events the different senses between which you clearly see that you must choose make either your belief or your difficulty definite but do not go on all through your life believing nothing intelligently and yet supposing that your having read the words of a divine book must give you the right to despise every religion but your own i assure you strange as it may seem our scorn of greek tradition depends not on our belief but our disbelief of our own traditions we have as yet no sufficient clue to the meaning of either but you will always find that in proportion to the earnestness of our own faith its tendency to accept a spiritual personality increases and that the most vital and beautiful christian temper rests joyfully in its conviction of the multitudinous ministry of living angels infinitely varied in rank and power you all know one expression of the purest and happiest form of such faith as it exists in modern times in richters lovely illustrations of the lords prayer the real and living deathangel girt as a pilgrim for journey and softly crowned with flowers beckons at the dying mothers door childangels sit talking face to face with mortal children among the flowers hold them by their little coats lest they fall on the stairs whisper dreams of heaven to them leaning over their pillows carry the sound of the church bells for them far through the air and even descending lower in service fill little cups with honey to hold out to the weary bee by the way lily did you tell the other children that story about your little sister and alice and the sea  lily i told it to alice and to miss dora i dont think i did to anybody else i thought it wasnt worth  l we shall think it worth a great deal now lily if you will tell it us how old is dotty again i forgot  lily she is not quite three but she has such odd little old ways sometimes  l and she was very fond of alice  lily yes alice was so good to her always  l and so when alice went away  lily oh it was nothing you know to tell about only it was strange at the time  l well but i want you to tell it  lily the morning after alice had gone dotty was very sad and restless when she got up and went about looking into all the corners as if she could find alice in them and at last she came to me and said is alie gone over the great sea and i said yes she is gone over the great deep sea but she will come back again some day then dotty looked round the room and i had just poured some water out into the basin and dotty ran to it and got up on a chair and dashed her hands through the water again and again and cried oh deep deep sea send little alie back to me  l isnt that pretty children theres a dear little heathen for you the whole heart of greek mythology is in that the idea of a personal being in the elemental powerof its being moved by prayerand of its presence everywhere making the broken diffusion of the element sacred  now remember the measure in which we may permit ourselves to think of this trusted and adored personality in greek or in any other mythology as conceivably a shadow of truth will depend on the degree in which we hold the greeks or other great nations equal or inferior in privilege and character to the jews or to ourselves if we believe that the great father would use the imagination of the jew as an instrument by which to exalt and lead him but the imagination of the greek only to degrade and mislead him if we can suppose that real angels were sent to minister to the jews and to punish them but no angels or only mocking spectra of angels or even devils in the shapes of angels to lead lycurgus and leonidas from desolate cradle to hopeless graveand if we can think that it was only the influence of specters or the teaching of demons which issued in the making of mothers like cornelia and of sons like cleobis and bito we may of course reject the heathen mythology in our privileged scorn but at least we are bound to examine strictly by what faults of our own it has come to pass that the ministry of real angels among ourselves is occasionally so ineffectual as to end in the production of cornelias who entrust their childjewels to charlotte winsors for the better keeping of them and of sons like that one who the other day in france beat his mother to death with a stick and was brought in by the jury guilty with extenuating circumstances  may was that really possible  l yes my dear i am not sure that i can lay my hand on the reference to it and i should not have said the other dayit was a year or two ago but you may depend on the fact and i could give you many like it if i chose there was a murder done in russia very lately on a traveler the murderesss little daughter was in the way and found it out somehow her mother killed her too and put her into the oven there is a peculiar horror about the relations between parent and child which are being now brought about by our variously degraded forms of european white slavery here is one reference i see in my notes on that story of cleobis and bito though i suppose i marked this chiefly for its quaintness and the beautifully christian names of the sons but it is a good instance of the power of the king of the valley of diamonds footnote notes vi among us  in galignani of july 2122 1862 is reported a trial of a farmers son in the department of the yonne the father two years ago at malay le grand gave up his property to his two sons on condition of being maintained by them simon fulfilled his agreement but pierre would not the tribunal of sens condemns pierre to pay eightyfour francs a year to his father pierre replies he would rather die than pay it actually returning home he throws himself into the river and the body is not found till next day  mary butbuti cant tell what you would have us think do you seriously mean that the greeks were better than we are and that their gods were real angels  l no my dear i mean only that we know in reality less than nothing of the dealings of our maker with our fellowmen and can only reason or conjecture safely about them when we have sincerely humble thoughts of ourselves and our creeds  we owe to the greeks every noble discipline in literature every radical principle of art and every form of convenient beauty in our household furniture and daily occupations of life we are unable ourselves to make rational use of half that we have received from them and of our own we have nothing but discoveries in science and fine mechanical adaptations of the discovered physical powers on the other hand the vice existing among certain classes both of the rich and poor in london paris and vienna could have been conceived by a spartan or roman of the heroic ages only as possible in a tartarus where fiends were employed to teach but not to punish crime it little becomes us to speak contemptuously of the religion of races to whom we stand in such relations nor do i think any man of modesty or thoughtfulness will ever speak so of any religion in which god has allowed one good man to die trusting  the more readily we admit the possibility of our own cherished convictions being mixed with error the more vital and helpful whatever is right in them will become and no error is so conclusively fatal as the idea that god will not allow us to err though he has allowed all other men to do so there may be doubt of the meaning of other visions but there is none respecting that of the dream of st peter and you may trust the rock of the churchs foundation for true interpreting when he learned from it that in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted with him see that you understand what that righteousness means and set hand to it stoutly you will always measure your neighbors creed kindly in proportion to the substantial fruits of your own do not think you will ever get harm by striving to enter into the faith of others and to sympathize in imagination with the guiding principles of their lives so only can you justly love them or pity them or praise by the gracious effort you will double treblenay indefinitely multiply at once the pleasure the reverence and the intelligence with which you read and believe me it is wiser and holier by the fire of your own faith to kindle the ashes of expired religions than to let your soul shiver and stumble among their graves through the gathering darkness and communicable cold  mary after some pause we shall all like reading greek history so much better after this but it has put everything else out of our heads that we wanted to ask  l i can tell you one of the things and i might take credit for generosity in telling you but i have a personal reasonlucillas verse about the creation  dora oh yesyes and its pain together until now  l i call you back to that because i must warn you against an old error of my own somewhere in the fourth volume of modern painters i said that the earth seemed to have passed through its highest state and that after ascending by a series of phases culminating in its habitation by man it seems to be now gradually becoming less fit for that habitation  mary yes i remember  l i wrote those passages under a very bitter impression of the gradual perishing of beauty from the loveliest scenes which i knew in the physical worldnot in any doubtful way such as i might have attributed to loss of sensation in myselfbut by violent and definite physical action such as the filling up of the lac de chede by landslips from the rochers des fizthe narrowing of the lake lucerne by the gaining delta of the stream of the muotta thal which in the course of years will cut the lake into two as that of brientz has been divided from that of thunthe steady diminishing of the glaciers north of the alps and still more of the sheets of snow on their southern slopes which supply the refreshing streams of lombardythe equally steady increase of deadly maremma round pisa and venice and other such phenomena quite measurably traceable within the limits even of short life and unaccompanied as it seemed by redeeming or compensatory agencies i am still under the same impression respecting the existing phenomena but i feel more strongly every day that no evidence to be collected within historical periods can be accepted as any clue to the great tendencies of geological change but that the great laws which never fail and to which all change is subordinate appear such as to accomplish a gradual advance to lovelier order and more calmly yet more deeply animated rest nor has this conviction ever fastened itself upon me more distinctly than during my endeavor to trace the laws which govern the lowly framework of the dust for through all the phases of its transition and dissolution there seems to be a continual effort to raise itself into a higher state and a measured gain through the fierce revulsion and slow renewal of the earths frame in beauty and order and permanence the soft white sediments of the sea draw themselves in process of time into smooth knots of sphered symmetry burdened and strained under increase of pressure they pass into a nascent marble scorched by fervent heat they brighten and blanch into the snowy rock of paros and carrara the dark drift of the inland river or stagnant slime of inland pool and lake divides or resolves itself as it dries into layers of its several elements slowly purifying each by the patient withdrawal of it from the anarchy of the mass in which it was mingled contracted by increasing drought till it must shatter into fragments it infuses continually a finer ichor into the opening veins and finds in its weakness the first rudiments of a perfect strength rent at last rock from rock nay atom from atom and tormented in lambent fire it knits through the fusion the fibers of a perennial endurance and during countless subsequent centuries declining or rather let me say rising to repose finishes the infallible luster of its crystalline beauty under harmonies of law which are wholly beneficent because wholly inexorable  the children seem pleased but more inclined to think over these matters than to talk  l after giving them a little time mary i seldom ask you to read anything out of books of mine but there is a passage about the law of help which i want you to read to the children now because it is of no use merely to put it in other words for them you know the place i mean do not you  mary yes presently finding it where shall i begin  l here but the elder ones had better look afterwards at the piece which comes just before this  mary reads  a pure or holy state of anything is that in which all its parts are helpful or consistent the highest and first law of the universe and the other name of life is therefore help the other name of death is separation government and cooperation are in all things and eternally the laws of life anarchy and competition eternally and in all things the laws of death  perhaps the best though the most familiar example we could take of the nature and power of consistence will be that of the possible changes in the dust we tread on  exclusive of animal decay we can hardly arrive at a more absolute type of impurity than the mud or slime of a damp over trodden path in the outskirts of a manufacturing town i do not say mud of the road because that is mixed with animal refuse but take merely an ounce or two of the blackest slime of a beaten footpath on a rainy day near a manufacturing town that slime we shall find in most cases composed of clay or brickdust which is burnt clay mixed with soot a little sand and water all these elements are at helpless war with each other and destroy reciprocally each others nature and power competing and fighting for place at every tread of your foot sand squeezing out clay and clay squeezing out water and soot meddling everywhere and defiling the whole let us suppose that this ounce of mud is left in perfect rest and that its elements gather together like to like so that their atoms may get into the closest relations possible  let the clay begin ridding itself of all foreign substance it gradually becomes a white earth already very beautiful and fit with help of congealing fire to be made into finest porcelain and painted on and be kept in kings palaces but such artificial consistence is not its best leave it still quiet to follow its own instinct of unity and it becomes not only white but clear not only clear but hard nor only clear and hard but so set that it can deal with light in a wonderful way and gather out of it the loveliest blue rays only refusing the rest we call it then a sapphire  such being the consummation of the clay we give similar permission of quiet to the sand it also becomes first a white earth then proceeds to grow clear and hard and at last arranges itself in mysterious infinitely fine parallel lines which have the power of reflecting not merely the blue rays but the blue green purple and red rays in the greatest beauty in which they can be seen through any hard material whatsoever we call it then an opal  in next order the soot sets to work it cannot make itself white at first but instead of being discouraged tries harder and harder and comes out clear at last and the hardest thing in the world and for the blackness that it had obtains in exchange the power of reflecting all the rays of the sun at once in the vividest blaze that any solid thing can shoot we call it then a diamond  last of all the water purifies or unites itself contented enough if it only reach the form of a dewdrop but if we insist on its proceeding to a more perfect consistence it crystallizes into the shape of a star and for the ounce of slime which we had by political economy of competition we have by political economy of cooperation a sapphire an opal and a diamond set in the midst of a star of snow  l i have asked you to hear that children because from all that we have seen in the work and play of these past days i would have you gain at least one grave and enduring thought the seeming troublethe unquestionable degradationof the elements of the physical earth must passively wait the appointed time of their repose or their restoration it can only be brought about for them by the agency of external law but if indeed there be a nobler life in us than in these strangely moving atomsif indeed there is an eternal difference between the fire which inhabits them and that which animates usit must be shown by each of us in his appointed place not merely in the patience but in the activity of our hope not merely by our desire but our labor for the time when the dust of the generations of men shall be confirmed for foundations of the gates of the city of god the human clay now trampled and despised will not becannot be knit into strength and light by accident or ordinances of unassisted fate by human cruelty and iniquity it has been afflictedby human mercy and justice it must be raised and in all fear or questioning of what is or is not the real message of creation or of revelation you may assuredly find perfect peace if you are resolved to do that which your lord has plainly requiredand content that he should indeed require no more of youthan to do justice to love mercy and to walk humbly with him      notes      note i  page 26   that third pyramid of hers  throughout the dialogues it must be observed that sibyl is addressed when in play as having once been the cumaean sibyl and egypt as having been queen nitocristhe cinderella and the greatest heroine and beauty of egyptian story the egyptians called her neith the victorious nitocris and the greeks face of the rose rhodope chaucers beautiful conception of cleopatra in the legend of good women is much more founded on the traditions of her than on those of cleopatra and especially in its close modified by herodotuss terrible story of the death of nitocris which however is mythologically nothing more than a part of the deep monotonous ancient dirge for the fulfillment of the earthly destiny of beauty she cast herself into a chamber full of ashes  i believe this queen is now sufficiently ascertained to have either built or increased to double its former size the third pyramid of gizeh and the passage following in the text refers to an imaginary endeavor by the old lecturer and the children together to make out the description of that pyramid in the 167th page of the second volume of bunsens egypts place in universal historyideal endeavorwhich ideally terminates as the old lecturers real endeavors to the same end always have terminated there are however valuable notes respecting nitocris at page 210 of the same volume but the early egyptian history for the young by the author of sidney gray contains in a pleasant form as much information as young readers will usually need      note ii  page 27   pyramid of asychis  this pyramid in mythology divides with the tower of babel the shame or vain glory of being presumptuously and first among great edifices built with brick for stone this was the inscription on it according to herodotus  despise me not in comparing me with the pyramids of stone for i have the preeminence over them as far as jupiter has pre eminence over the gods for striking with staves into the pool men gathered the clay which fastened itself to the staff and kneaded bricks out of it and so made me  the word i have translated kneaded is literally drew in the sense of drawing for which the latins used duco and thus gave us our ductile in speaking of dead clay and duke doge or leader in speaking of living clay as the asserted preeminence of the edifice is made in this inscription to rest merely on the quantity of labor consumed in it this pyramid is considered in the text as the type at once of the base building and of the lost labor of future ages so far at least as the spirits of measured and mechanical effort deal with it but neith exercising her power upon it makes it a type of the work of wise and inspired builders      note iii  page 29   the greater pthah  it is impossible as yet to define with distinctness the personal agencies of the egyptian deities they are continually associated in function or hold derivative powers or are related to each other in mysterious triads uniting always symbolism of physical phenomena with real spiritual power i have endeavored partly to explain this in the text of the tenth lecture here it is only necessary for the reader to know that the greater pthah more or less represents the formative power of order and measurement he always stands on a foursquare pedestal the egyptian cubit metaphorically used as the hieroglyphic for truth his limbs are bound together to signify fixed stability as of a pillar he has a measuringrod in his hand and at philas is represented as holding an egg on a potters wheel but i do not know if this symbol occurs in older sculptures his usual title is the lord of truth others very beautiful king of the two worlds of gracious countenance superintendent of the great abode etc are given by mr birch in arundales gallery of antiquities which i suppose is the book of best authority easily accessible for the full titles and utterances of the gods rosellini is as yet the onlyand i believe still a very questionableauthority and arundales little book excellent in the text has this great defect that its drawings give the statues invariably a ludicrous or ignoble character readers who have not access to the originals must be warned against this frequent fault in modern illustration especially existing also in some of the painted casts of gothic and norman work at the crystal palace it is not owing to any willful want of veracity the plates in arundales book are laboriously faithful but the expressions of both face and body in a figure depend merely on emphasis of touch and in barbaric art most draughtsmen emphasize what they plainly seethe barbarism and miss conditions of nobleness which they must approach the monument in a different temper before they will discover and draw with great subtlety before they can express  the character of the lower pthah or perhaps i ought rather to say of pthah in his lower office is sufficiently explained in the text of the third lecture only the reader must be warned that the egyptian symbolism of him by the beetle was not a scornful one it expressed only the idea of his presence in the first elements of life but it may not unjustly be used in another sense by us who have seen his power in new development and even as it was i cannot conceive that the egyptians should have regarded their beetle headed image of him champollion pantheon p 12 without some occult scorn it is the most painful of all their types of any beneficent power and even among those of evil influences none can be compared with it except its opposite the tortoise headed demon of indolence  pasht p 27 line 9 is connected with the greek artemis especially in her offices of judgment and vengeance she is usually lioness headed sometimes cat headed her attributes seeming often trivial or ludicrous unless their full meaning is known but the inquiry is much too wide to be followed here the cat was sacred to her or rather to the sun and secondarily to her she is alluded to in the text because she is always the companion of pthah called the beloved of pthah it may be as judgment demanded and longed for by truth and it may be well for young readers to have this fixed in their minds even by chance association there are more statues of pasht in the british museum than of any other egyptian deity several of them fine in workmanship nearly all in dark stone which may be presumably to connect her as the moon with the night and in her office of avenger with grief  thoth p 31 line 12 is the recording angel of judgment and the greek hermesphre line 16 is the sun  neith is the egyptian spirit of divine wisdom and the athena of the greeks no sufficient statement of her many attributes still less of their meanings can be shortly given but this should be noted respecting the veiling of the egyptian image of her by vulture wingsthat as she is physically the goddess of the air this bird the most powerful creature of the air known to the egyptians naturally became her symbol it had other significations but certainly this when in connection with neith as representing her it was the most important sign next to the winged sphere in egyptian sculpture and just as in homer athena herself guides her heroes into battle this symbol of wisdom giving victory floats over the heads of the egyptian kings the greeks representing the goddess herself in human form yet would not lose the power of the egyptian symbol and changed it into an angel of victory first seen in loveliness on the early coins of syracuse and leontium it gradually became the received sign of all conquest and the so called victory of later times which little by little loses its truth and is accepted by the moderns only as a personification of victory itselfnot as an actual picture of the living angel who led to victory there is a wide difference between these two conceptionsall the difference between insincere poetry and sincere religion this i have also endeavored farther to illustrate in the tenth lecture there is however one part of athenas character which it would have been irrelevant to dwell upon there yet which i must not wholly leave unnoticed  as the goddess of the air she physically represents both its beneficent calm and necessary tempest other storm deities as chrysaor and aeolus being invested with a subordinate and more or less malignant function which is exclusively their own and is related to that of athena as the power of mars is related to hers in war so also virgil makes her able to wield the lightning herself while juno cannot but must pray for the intervention of aeolus she has precisely the correspondent moral authority over calmness of mind and just anger she soothes achilles as she incites tydides her physical power over the air being always hinted correlatively she grasps achilles by his hairas the wind would lift itsoftly      it fanned his cheek it raised his hair     like a meadow gale in spring  she does not merely turn the lance of mars from diomed but seizes it in both her hands and casts it aside with a sense of making it vain like chaff in the windto the shout of achilles she adds her own voice of storm in heavenbut in all cases the moral power is still the principal onemost beautifully in that seizing of achilles by the hair which was the talisman of his life because he had vowed it to the sperchius if he returned in safety and which in giving at patroclus tomb he knowingly yields up the hope of return to his country and signifies that he will die with his friend achilles and tydides are above all other heroes aided by her in war because their prevailing characters are the desire of justice united in both with deep affections and in achilles with a passionate tenderness which is the real root of his passionate anger ulysses is her favorite chiefly in her office as the goddess of conduct and design      note iv  page 81   geometrical limitations  it is difficult without a tedious accuracy or without full illustration to express the complete relations of crystalline structure which dispose minerals to take at different times fibrous massive or foliated forms and i am afraid this chapter will be generally skipped by the reader yet the arrangement itself will be found useful if kept broadly in mind and the transitions of state are of the highest interest if the subject is entered upon with any earnestness it would have been vain to add to the scheme of this little volume any account of the geometrical forms of crystals an available one though still far too difficult and too copious has been arranged by the rev mr mitchell for orrs circle of the sciences and i believe the nets of crystals which are therein given to be cut out with scissors and put prettily together will be found more conquerable by young ladies than by other students they should also when an opportunity occurs be shown at any public library the diagram of the crystallization of quartz referred to poles at p 8 of cloizauxs manuel de mineralogie that they may know what work is and what the subject is  with a view to more careful examination of the nascent states of silica i have made no allusion in this volume to the influence of mere segregation as connected with the crystalline power it has only been recently during the study of the breccias alluded to in page 186 that i have fully seen the extent to which this singular force often modifies rocks in which at first its influence might hardly have been suspected many apparent conglomerates being in reality formed chiefly by segregation combined with mysterious brokenlyzoned structures like those of some malachites i hope some day to know more of these and several other mineral phenomena especially of those connected with the relative sizes of crystals which otherwise i should have endeavored to describe in this volume      note v  page 168   st barbara  i would have given the legends of st barbara and st thomas if i had thought it always well for young readers to have everything at once told them which they may wish to know they will remember the stories better after taking some trouble to find them and the text is intelligible enough as it stands the idea of st barbara as there given is founded partly on her legend in peter de natahbus partly on the beautiful photograph of van eycks picture of her at antwerp which was some time since published at lille      note vi  page 227   king of the valley of diamonds  isabel interrupted the lecturer here and was briefly bid to hold her tongue which gave rise to some talk apart afterwards between l and sibyl of which a word or two may be perhaps advisably set down  sibyl we shall spoil isabel certainly if it dont mind i was glad you stopped her and yet sorry for she wanted so much to ask about the valley of diamonds again and she has worked so hard at it and made it nearly all out by herself she recollected elishas throwing in the meal which nobody else did  l but what did she want to ask  sibyl about the mulberry trees and the serpents we are all stopped by that wont you tell us what it means  l now sibyl i am sure you who never explained yourself should be the last to expect others to do so i hate explaining myself  sibyl and yet how often you complain of other people for not saying what they meant how i have heard you growl over the three stone steps to purgatory for instance  l yes because dantes meaning is worth getting at but mine matters nothing at least if ever i think it is of any consequence so i speak it as clearly as may be but you may make anything you like of the serpent forests i could have helped you to find out what they were by giving a little more detail but it would have been tiresome  sibyl it is much more tiresome not to find out tell us please as isabel says because we feel so stupid  l there is no stupidity you could not possibly do more than guess at anything so vague but i think you sibyl at least might have recollected what first dyed the mulberry  sibyl so i did but that helped little i thought of dantes forest of suicides too but you would not simply have borrowed that  l no if i had had strength to use it i should have stolen it to beat into another shape not borrowed it but that idea of souls in trees is as old as the world or at least as the world of man and i did mean that there were souls in those dark branchesthe souls of all those who had perished in misery through the pursuit of riches and that the river was of their blood gathering gradually and flowing out of the valley then i meant the serpents for the souls of those who had lived carelessly and wantonly in their riches and who have all their sins forgiven by the world because they are rich and therefore they have seven crimson crested heads for the seven mortal sins of which they are proud and these and the memory and report of them are the chief causes of temptation to others as showing the pleasantness and absolving power of riches so that thus they are singing serpents and the worms are the souls of the common money getters and traffickers who do nothing but eat and spin and who gain habitually by the distress or foolishness of others as you see the butchers have been gaining out of the panic at the cattle plague among the poorso they are made to eat the dark leaves and spin and perish  sibyl and the souls of the great cruel rich people who oppress the poor and lend money to government to make unjust war where are they  l they change into the ice i believe and are knit with the gold and make the grave dust of the valley i believe so at least for no one ever sees those souls anywhere  sibyl ceases questioning  isabel who has crept up to her side without any one seeing oh sibyl please ask him about the fireflies  l what you there mousie no i wont tell either sibyl or you about the fireflies nor a word more about anything else you ought to be little fireflies yourselves and find your way in twilight by your own wits  isabel but you said they burned you know  l yes and you may be fireflies that way too some of you before long though i did not mean that away with you children you have thought enough for today      note to second edition   sentence out of letter from may who is staying with isabel just now at cassel dated 15th june 1877  i am reading the ethics with a nice irish girl who is staying here and shes just as puzzled as ive always been about the fireflies and we both want to know so muchplease be a very nice old lecturer and tell us wont you  well may you never were a vain girl so could scarcely guess that i meant them for the light unpursued vanities which yet blind us confused among the stars one evening as i came late into siena the fireflies were flying high on a stormy sirocco windthe stars themselves no brighter and all their host seeming at moments to fade as the insects faded
