our passport and the basha    xx  down the tenriugawa     xxi  to the sea       noto an unexplored corner of japan    i  an unknown  the fancy took me to go to noto  it seemed a strange fancy to my friends  yet i make no apology for it for it was a case of love at first sight  scanning one evening in tokyo the map of japan in a vague itinerary way with the look one first gives to the crowd of faces in a ballroom my eye was caught by the pose of a province that stood out in graphic mystery from the western coast  it made a striking figure there with its deepbosomed bays and its bold headlands  its name it appeared was noto and the name too pleased me  i liked its vowel color i liked its consonant form the liquid n and the decisive t  whimsically if you please it suggested both womanliness and will  the more i looked the more i longed until the desire carried me not simply off my feet but on to them  nobody seemed to know much about my inamorata  indeed those i asked asked me in their own want of information why i went and what there was to see of which questions the second itself did for answer to the first  why not in fact have set my heart on going to noto just because it was not known  not that it is well to believe all the unseen to be much worth the seeing but that i had an itching sole to tread what others had not already effacingly betrodden  privately i was delighted with the general lack of knowledge on the subject  it served admirably to put me in conceit with my choice although i will own i was rather at a loss to account for it and i can only explain it now by the fact that the place was so out of the way and not very unlike others after all being thus candid i ought perhaps to go a step farther and renounce the name  but on the two great principles that the pursuit is itself the prize and that the means justifies the end i prefer to keep it  for there was much of interest to me by the way and i cling to the name out of a kind of loyalty to my own fancy  i like to think that xenophon felt as much in his anabasis though but one book out of seven deals with the going up the other six being occupied with the getting safely away again  it is not told that xenophon regretted his adventure  certainly i am not sorry i was wedded to my idea  to most of my acquaintance noto was scarcely so much as a name and its local habitation was purely cartographic  i found but one man who had been there and he had dropped down upon it by way of harbor from a boat  some sympathetic souls however went so far toward it as to ask where it was  to the westward of tokyo so far west that the setting sun no longer seems to lose itself among the mountains but plunges for good and all straight into the shining nirvana of the sea a strangely shaped promontory makes out from the land  it is the province of noto standing alone in peninsular isolation  it was partly in this position that the fascination lay  withdrawn from its fellows with its back to the land it faced the glory of the western sky as if in virginal vision gazing out upon the deep  doubly withdrawn is it for that the coast from which it stands apart is itself almost unvisited by europeansan outoftheworld state in marked contrast to the shore bordering the pacific which is now a curbstone on the great waterway round the earth and incidentally makes a happy parenthesis of promenade for the hasty globetrotter the form too of the peninsula came in for a share in its attraction its coast line was so coquettishly irregular  if it turned its back on the land it stretched its hands out to the sea only to withdraw them again the next momenta double invitation  indeed there is no happier linking of land to water  the navigator in such parts becomes himself a delightfully amphibious creature at home in both  elements  should he tire of the one he can always take to the other besides such features in a coast suggest a certain cleancut character of profilea promise in japan at least rarely unkept  to reach this topographically charming province the main island had to be crossed at its widest and owing to lofty mountain chains much tacking to be done to boot  atmospherically the distance is even greater than afoot  indeed the change in climate is like a change in zone for the trend of the main island at this point being nearly east and west gives to the one coast a southerly exposure and to the other a northerly one while the highest wall of peaks in japan the hidashinshiu range shuts off most meteorological communication  long after tokyo is basking in spring the west coast still lies buried in deep drifts of snow  it was my misfortune to go to this outoftheway spot alone  i was duly sensible of my commiserable state at times  indeed in those strange flashes of dual consciousness when a man sees his own condition as if it were anothers i pitied myself right heartily for i hold that travel is like life in this at least that a congenial companion divides the troubles and doubles the joys to please ones self is so much harder than to be pleased by another and when it comes to doubt and difficulty there are drawbacks to being ones own guide philosopher and friend  the treatment is too homoeopathic by half  an excuse for a companion existed in the person of my japanese boy or cook  he had been boy to me years before and on this return of his former master to the land of the enlightened he had come back to his allegiance promoting himself to the post of cook  during the journey he acted in both capacities indifferentlyin one sense not in the other in addition to being capable he was willing and of great endurance  besides he was passionately fond of travel  he knew no more about noto than i and at times on the road he could not make out what the country folk said for the difference in dialect which lack of special qualification much increased his charm as a fellowtraveler he neither spoke nor understood english of course and surprised me after surprising himself on the last day but one of our trip by coming out with the words all right his surname appropriately enough meant mountainricefield and his last name which we should call his first namewas yejiro or luckyyoungerson  besides cooking excellently well he made paper plum blossoms beautifully and once constructed a string telephone out of his own head  i mention these samples of accomplishment to show that he was no mere dabbler in pots and pans  in addition to his various culinary contrivances we took a large and motley stock of canned food some of his own homemade bread and a bottle of whiskey  we laid in but a small supply of beer not that i purposed to forego that agreeable beverage but because in this europeanized age it can be got in all the larger towns  indeed the beer brewed in yokohama today ranks with the best in the world  it is in great demand in tokyo while its imported or professedly imported rivals have freely percolated into the interior so popular with the upper and upper middle classes have malt liquors become nowadays when a japanese thinks to go in for capuan dissipation regardless of expense he treats himself to a bottle of beer  these larderlike details are not meant to imply that i made a god of my palate but that otherwise my digestion would have played the devil with me  in japan to attempt to live off the country in the country is a piece of amateur acting the average european bitterly regrets after the play if not during its performance  we are not inwardly contrived to thrive solely on rice and pickles  it is best too for a journey into the interior to take with you your own bedding sheets that is and blankets  the bed itself yejiro easily improvised out of innumerable futons as the quilts used at night by the japanese are called  a single one is enough for a native but yejiro with praiseworthy zeal made a practice of asking for halfadozen which he piled one upon the other in the middle of the room  each had a perceptible thickness and a rounded loglike edge and when the time came for turning in on top of the lot i was always reminded of the latter end of a grecian hero the structure looked so like a funeral pyre  when to the above indispensables were added clothes camera dry plates books and sundries it made a collection of household gods quite appalling to consider on the march i had no idea i owned half so much in the world from which it would pain me to be parted  as my property lay spread out for packing i stared at it aghast  to transport all these belongings native ingenuity suggested a thing called a yanagigori several of them in fact  now the construction of a kori is elementally ingenious it consists simply of two wicker baskets of the same shape but of slightly different size fitting into each other upside down  the two are then tied together with cord the beauty of the idea lies in its extension for in proportion as the two covers are pulled out or pushed home will the pair hold from a maximum capacity of both to a minimum capacity of one  it is possible even to start with more than a maximum if the contents be such as are not given to falling out by the way  the contrivance is simply invaluable when it comes to transporting food for then as you eat your way down the obliging covers shrink to meet the vacuum  if more than one kori be necessary an easy step in devices leads to a series of graded sizes  then all your baskets eventually collapse into one  the last but most important article of all was my passport which carefully described my proposed route and which yejiro at once took charge of and carried about with him for immediate service for a wise paternal government insisted upon knowing my intentions before permitting me to visit the object of my choice    ii    off and on  it was on the day but one before the festival of the fifth moon that we set out or in english the third of may and those emblems of good luck the festival fishes were already swimming in the air above the house eaves as we scurried through the streets in jinrikisha toward the uyeno railway station  we had been a little behindhand in starting but by extra exertions on the part of the runners we succeeded in reaching the station just in time to be shut out by the gatekeeper  time having been the one thing worthless in old japan it was truly sarcastic of fate that we should reach our first goal too late  as if to point chagrin the train still stood in waiting remonstrances with the wicket man about the imported fiveminute regulation or whatever it was proved of no avail not one jot or tittle of the rule would he yield which perhaps was natural inasmuch as however we might have managed alone our companions the baskets never could have boarded the train without offical help  the intrinsic merits of the baggage failed alas to affect its mobility  then the train slowly drew out  to be stopped on the road is the common lot of travelers but to be stopped before one has fairly started is nothing less than to be mocked at  it is best however to take such gibes in good part  viewing the situation in this light the ludicrousness of the disconnection struck me so forcibly as very nearly to console me for my loss which was not trifling since the next train did not leave for above three hours too late to push on beyond takasaki that night a thing i had most firmly purposed to do  here i was the miserable victim of a punctuality my own people had foisted on a land only too happy without it  there was poetic justice in the situation after all besides the course of ones true love should not run too smooth  judicious difficulty whets desire  there was nothing to turn to on the spot and i was ashamed to go home then i opportunely remembered something  i have always thought we limited our pharmacopoeia  we prescribe pills enough for the body while we leave the mind to look after itself why should not the spirit also have its draughts and mixtures properly labeled and dispensed  for example angling appears to be a strong mental opiate  i have seen otherwise normal people stupefied beyond expression when at the butt of a rod and line happening to recall this effect i instantly prescribed for my perturbed state of mind a good dose of fishing to be taken as suited the day  so i betook me down a bystreet where the aerial carp promised the thickest and selecting a house well placed for a view asked permission to mount upon the roof  it chanced to be a castoff clothing shop along whose front some fine if aged garments were hung to catch the public eye  the camera and i were inducted up the ascent by the owner while my boots of course waited doglike in the porch below  the city made a spectacle from above  on all sides superb paper carp floated to the breeze tugging at the strings that held them to the poles quite after the manner of the real fish  one felt as though by accident he had stepped into some mammoth globe of goldfish the whole sky was alive with them  eighty square miles of finny folk inside the city and an untold company without  the counterfeit presentments were from five to ten feet long and painted to mimic life  the breeze entered at the mouth and passed out somewhat less freely at the tail thus keeping them well bellied and constantly in motion  the way they rose and dove and turned and wriggled was worthy of free will  indeed they had every look of spontaneity and lacked only the thing itself to turn the sky into an ocean and tokyo into a sea bottom with a rockery of roof  each fish commemorates the birth of a boy during the year  it would thus be possible to take a census of the increase of the male population yearly at the trifling cost of scaling a housetopa set of statistics not without an eventual value  while we were strolling back yejiro and i we came in the way upon another species of fish  the bait which was well designed to captivate bade for the moment to exceed even the anglers anticipations  it was a sort of unchristmas tree with fishingpole branches from which dangled articulated figures bodied like men but with heads of foxes tortoises and other less likelybeasts bewitching objects in impossible evolution to a baldpated urchin who stood gazing at it with all his soul  the peddler sat with his eyes riveted on the boy visions of a possible catch chasing themselves through his brain  i watched him while the crowd behind stared at me  we made quite a tail of curiosity  the opiate was having its effect i began to feel soporifically calm  then i went up to the restaurant in the park and had lunch as quietly as possible in fear of friendly discovery  sufficiently punctual passengers being now permitted to board the next train i ensconced myself in a kind of parlor compartment which fortunately i continued to have all to myself and was soon being rolled westward across the great musashi plain ruminating  my chief quarrel with railway rules is i am inclined to think that they preach to the public what they fail to practice themselves  after having denied me a paltry five minutes grace at the station the officials proceeded to lose half an hour on the road in a most exasperating manner  of course the delay was quite exceptional  such a thing had never happened before and would not happen againtill the next time  but the phenomenal character of the occurrence failed to console me as it should no doubt have done my delay too was exceptionalon this line  nor was i properly  mollified by repeated offers of hardboiled eggs cakes and oranges which certain enterprising peddlers hawked up and down the platforms when we stopped to a rhythmic chant of their own invention  the only consolation lay in the memory of what travel over the musashi plain used to be before trains hurried one or otherwise into the heart of the land  in those days the journey was done in jinrikisha and a question of days not hours it was in the doing two days worth of baby carriage of which the tediousness lay neither in the vehicles nor in the way but in the amount of both or if one put comparative speed above comparative comfort he rose before the lark to be tortured through a summers day in a basha or horse vehicle suitable only for disembodied spirits  my joints ached again at the thought clearly to grumble now was to sin against proportion  besides the weather was perfect argosies of fleecy cloud sailing slowly across a deep blue sky a broad plain in all its spring freshness of color picked out here and there with fruit trees smothered in blossom and bearing on its bosom the passing shadows of the clouds above in the distance the gradually growing forms of the mountains each at first starting into life only as a faint wash of color barely to be parted from the sky itself pricking up from out the horizon of field  then slowly timed to our advance the tint gathered substance grew into contrasts that deepening minute by minute resolved into detail until at last the whole stood revealed in all its majesty foothill shoulder peak one grand chromatic rise from green to blue  one after the other the points came out thus along the southern sky first the summits behind ome then bukosan like some sentinel halfway up the plains long side and then range beyond range stretching toward the west  behind bukosan peeped clouds rest the very same outline in fainter tint so like the double reflection from a pane of glass that i had to shift to an open window to make sure it was no illusion  then the nikko group began to show on the right and the haruna mass took form in front and as they rose higher and the sunbeams slanted more gilding the motes in the heavy afternoon air they rimmed the plain in front into one great bowl  of fairy eau de vie de dantzic  slowly above them the sun dipped to his setting straight ahead burnishing our path as we pursued in  two long lines of flashing rail into the westnorthwest  lower he sank luring us on and lower yet and then suddenly disappeared  beyond the barrier of peaks  the train drew up panting  it was takasaki now steeped in saffron afterglow  the guards passed along calling out the name and  unfastening the doors  everybody got out and shuffled off on their clogs  the baskets yejiro and i followed after a little through  the gloaming  it was not far to the inn  it was just far enough at that hour to put us in heart for a housing  indeed twilight is the time of times to arrive anywhere  any spot be it ever so homely seems homelike then  the dusk has snatched from you the silent companionship of nature to leave you poignantly alone  it is the hour when a man draws closer to the one he loves and the hour when most he shrinks from himself though he want another near   it is then the rays of the house lights wander abroad and appear to beckon the houseless in and that must be in truth a sorry hostelry to seem such to him  even takasaki bore a look of welcome alike to the foreign and the native stranger which was certainly wonderful for takasaki  the place used not to fancy foreigners and its inns bandied the european traveler about like a bale of undesirable merchandise with the duties still due  but now what a change  the innkeeper not only received us but led the way at once to the best rooma room in the second story of the fireproof storehouse at the back which he hoped would be comfortable  comfortable  the room actually proffered us a table and chairs  no one who has not after a long days tramp sought in vain to rest his weary body propped up against a side beam in a japanese inn can enter into the feeling a chair inspires even long afterward by recollection   i cannot say i loved takasaki in former days  was it my reception or was it sentiment that made me see it all now through a mist of glamour unsuspected by us that atmosphere of time tints everything  few things but look lovelier seen down the vista of the years  indeed sentiment is a kind of religion or is it religion that is a kind of sentiment  both are so subtly busy canonizing the past and crowning with aureoles very everyday things as well as very ordinary people  not men alone take on a sanctity when they are no more     iii   the usui pass  the first object to catch my eye when the shoji were pushed apart the next morning was a string of the ubiquitous paper fish dangling limp in the motionless may air from a pole in a neighboring yard highly suggestive of having just been caught for breakfast  the sight would have been painfully prophetic but for the food we had brought with us for of all meals a japanese breakfast is the most cold the most watery and the most generally fishy in the world as it was breakfast consisted of pathetic copies of consecrated originals  it might have been excellent but for the canned milk   no doubt there are persons who are fond of canned milk but for my part i loathe it  the effect of the sweetish glue upon my inner man is singularly nauseating  i have even been driven to drink my matutinal coffee in all its afterdinner strength rather than adulterate it with the mixture  you have it is true the choice of using the stuff as a dubious paste or of mixing it with water into a noncommittal wash and whichever plan you adopt you wish you had adopted the other  why it need be so unpalatably cloying is not clear to my mind  they tell me the sugar is needed to preserve the milk  i never could make out that it preserved anything but the sugar simply to see the stuff ooze out of the hole in the can is deterrent  it is enough to make one think seriously at times of adding a good milch cow to his already ample trip encumberment at the certain cost of delaying the march and the not improbable chance of being taken for an escaped lunatic  indeed to the japanese mind to be seen solemnly preceding a caravan of cattle for purposes of diet would certainly suggest insanity  for cows in japan are never milked  dairy products consequently are not to be had on the road and the man who fancies milk butter or cheese must take them with him   it used to be the same in tokyo but in these latter days a dairy has been started at hakone which supplies fresh butter to such tokyoites as like it  one of my friends who had been many years from home was much taken with the new privilege and called my attention to it with some pride  the result was a colorless lardy substance that looked like poor oleomargarine not like good oleomargarine for that looks like butter but which was held in high esteem nevertheless my friend indeed seriously maintained to me once that such was the usual color of fresh butter and insisted that the yellow hue common elsewhere must be the result of dyes  he was so positive on the point that he almost persuaded me until i had left him and reason returned  it took me some time to recover from the pathos of the thing a man so long deprived of that simple luxury that he had quite forgotten how it looked and a set of cows utterly incapable from desuetude of producing it properly   after i had duly swallowed as much as i could of the doubtful dose supposed to be cafe au lait the cans were packed up again and we issued from the inn to walk a stones throw to the train  takasaki stands well toward the upper end of the plain just below where the main body of it thrusts its arms out into the hills up one of these we were soon wending  every minute the peaks came nearer frowning at us from their crumbling volcanic crags  at last they closed in completely standing round about in threatening pinnacles and barring the way in front  at this the train contrary to the usual practice of trains in such seemingly impassable places timidly drew up   in truth the railway comes to an end at the foot of the usui toge toge meaning pass after having wandered up with more zeal than discretion into a holeless pocket  such untimely end was far from the original intention for the line was meant for a through line along the nakasendo from tokyo to kioto and great things were expected of it  but the engineering difficulties at this point and still more at the wada toge a little farther on proving too great the project was abandoned and the through line built along the tokaido instead  the idea however had got too much headway to be stayed  so it simply jumped the usui toge rolled down the shinano valley climbed another divide and came out at last on the sea of japan   the hiatus caused by the usui pass is got over by a horse railroad somehow the mere idea seemed comic  a horse railroad in the heart of japan over a pass a mile high  to have suddenly come upon the entire comedie francaise giving performances in a teahouse at the top could hardly have been more surprising  the humor of the thing was not a whit lessened by its looks   to begin with the cars were fairly natural  this was a masterly stroke in caricature since it furnished the necessary foil to all that followed  they were not to my eye of any known species but with the exception of being evidently used to hard lines they looked enough like trams to pass as such  inside sat in all seriousness a wonderful cageful of japanese  to say that they were not to the   horsecar born conveys but a feeble notion of their unnaturalness  they were propped rather than seated bolt upright with a decorum which would have done more than credit to a funeral  they did not smile they did not even stir except to screw their heads round to stare at me  they were dummies pure and simple and may pass for the second item in the properties   the real personnel began with the horses these were very sorrylooking animals but tough enough admirably to pull through the performance  managing them with some difficulty stood the driver on the front platform arrayed in a bottlegreen livery with a stiff military cap which gave him the combined look of a german officer and of a musician from a street band  his energy was spent in making about three times as much work for himself as was needed  on the tail of the car rode the guard also notably appareled whose importance outdid even his uniform  he had the advantage of the driver in the matter of a secondclass fishhorn upon which he tooted vigorously whenever he thought of it and he was not a forgetful man   comedie francaise indeed  why here it all was in japanese farce from the passivity of the passengers to the pantomime of the driver and guard it could hardly have been done better and the actors all kept their countenances too in such a surprising manner a captious critic might have suggested that they looked a thought too much at the audience but on the whole i think that rather added to the effect  at all events they were excellently good especially the guard whose consequential airs could not have been happier if they had been studied for years   there was no end of red tape about the company  though the cars were some time in starting so that i got well ahead of them they could not admit me on the road when my baggage kuruma turned out to be too slow because i had not bought a ticket at the office  so i was obliged to continue to tramp afoot solacing myself with short cuts by which i gained on them to my satisfaction and by which i gained still more on my own baggage to my disgust in that i ceased to be near enough to hasten it   i had to wait for the latter at the parting of the ways for the tram had a brandnew serpentine track laid out for it while the old trail at this point struck up to the right coming out eventually at a shrine that crowned the summit of the pass  horserailroads not being as new to me as to the japanese i piously chose the narrow way leading to the temple to the lingering regret of the baggage trundlers who turned sorry eyes down upon the easier secular road at every bend in our own  a japanese pass has one feature which is invariable it is always longer than you think it is going to be  i can of my own experience recall but two exceptions to this distressing family likeness both of which were occasions of company which no doubt forbade proper appreciation of their length and vitiates them as scientific observations  when toiling up a toge i have been tempted to impute acute ascentomania to the japanese mind but sober second thought has attributed this inference to an overheated imagination  it seems necessary therefore to lay the blame on the land which like some people is deceptive from very excess of uprightness  there is so much more soil than can possibly be got in by simple directness of purpose or even by one more or less respectable slope   it was cold enough at the summit to cool anything imaginary or otherwise  even devotion shivered as in duty bound it admired the venerable temple and its yet more venerable tree  the roofs of the chalets stood weighted with rocks to keep them there and the tree raised aloft on its stonegirded parapet stretched bare branches imploringly toward the sky  so much for being a mile or so nearer heaven while still of the earth and earthy   halfway down the descent asamayama came out from behind the brow of a hill sending his whiffs of smoke dreamily into the air and a little lower still beyond a projecting spur on the opposite side the train appeared waiting in the plain with its engine puffing a sort of antiphonal response  the station stood at the foot of the tramway which tumbled to it after the manner of a cascade over what looked to be a much lower pass thus apparently supporting the theory of supererogatory climb the baggage passed on and yejiro and i followed leisurely admiring the view   either the old trail failed to connect with the railway terminus which i suspect or else we missed the path for we had to supply a link ourselves  this resulted in a woefully bad cut across a something between a moor and a bog supposed to be drained by ditches most of which lay at right angles to our course  we were not much helped halfway over by a kindly intentioned porter who dawned upon us suddenly in the distance rushing excitedly out from behind the platform gesticulating in a startling way and shouting that time was up  we made what sorry speed was possible under the circumstances getting very hot from exertion and hotter still from anxiety and then waited impatiently ten good minutes in our seats in the railway carriage for the train to start  i forget whether i tipped that wellmeaning but misguided man   the tram contingent had already arrivedhad in fact finished feeding at the many mushroom teahouses gathered about the station and were now busy finding themselves seats  their bustle was most pleasing to witness till suddenly i discovered that there were no firstclass carriages that it was my seat so to speak for which they were scrambling  the choice it appeared began with secondclass coaches doomed therefore to be doubly popular  secondclass accommodation by no means merely nominal was evidently the height of luxury to the patrons of the country half of this disjointed line which starts so seductively from tokyo  greater comfort is strictly confined to the more metropolitan portion   the secondclass coaches had of course the merit of being cheaper but this was more than offset by the fact that in place of panes of glass their windows had slats of wood with white cotton stretched over theman ingenious contrivance for shutting out the view and a good bit of the light both of which are pleasing and for letting in the cold which is not   if you go with the crowd you will be taken care of as a shrewd financier of my acquaintance used to say about stocks  this occurred to me by way of consolation as the guard locked us into the carriage in the approved paternal government style  fortunately the lockingin was more apparent than real for it consisted solely in the turning of a bar which it was quite possible to unturn as all travelers in railway coaches are aware by dropping the window into its oubliette and stretching the arm well down outsidea trick of which i did not scruple to avail myself  my fellowpassengers the japanese were far too decorous to attempt anything of the kind which compelled me to do so surreptitiously like one who committeth a crime   these fellowpassengers fully made up for the room they took by their value as scientific specimens  i would willingly have chloroformed them all and presented them on pins to some sartorial museum for each typified a stage in a certain unique process of evolution at present the japanese craze  they were just so many samples of unnatural development in dress from the native japanese to the imitated european  the costume usually began with a pothat and ended in extreme cases with congress boots  but each man exhibited a various phase of it according to his selfemancipation from former etiquette  sometimes a most disreputable derby painfully reminiscent of better bygone days found itself in company with a refined kimono and a spotless cloven sock  sometimes the metamorphosis embraced the body and even extended down the legs but had not yet attacked the feet in its creeping paralysis of imitation  in another corner a collarless cravatless semiflannel shirt had taken the place of the under tunic to the worse than loss of looks of its wearer  opposite this type sat the supreme variety which evidently prided itself upon its height of fashion  in him the change had gone so far as to recall the east end rough all over an illusion dispelled only by the innocence of his face  while still busy pigeonholing my specimens i chanced to look through the open window and suddenly saw pass by as in the shifting background of some scenic play the lichenveiled stone walls and lotusmantled moats of the old feudal castle of uyeda  poor neglected despised bit of days gone bydays that are but yesterdays aeons since as measured here  already it was disappearing down the long perspective of the past and yet only twenty years before it had stood in all the pride and glory of the middle ages  then it had been      a daimyos castle wont of old to wield     across the checkerboard of paddyfield     a rooklike power from its vantage square     on pawns of hamlets now a ruin there     its triple battlements gaze grimly down     upon a newbegotten bustling town     only to see selfmirrored in their moat     an ivied image where the lotus float  some subtle sense of fitness within me was touched as it might have been a nerve and instantly the motley crew inside the car became not merely comic but shocking  it seemed unseemly this shuffling off the stage of the tragic old by the farcelike new  however little one may mourn the dead something forbids a harlequinade over their graves  the very principle of cosmic continuity has a decency about it  nature holds with one hand to the past even as she grasps at the future with the other  some religions consecrate by the laying on of hands nature never withdraws her touch     iv   zenkoji  we were now come more than halfway from sea to sea and we were still in the thick of europeanization  so far we had traveled in the track of the comic  for if japan seems odd for what it is it seems odder for what it is no longer  one of the things which imitation of western ways is annihilating is distance  japan like the rest of the world is shrinking  this was strikingly brought home that afternoon a few short hours of shifting panorama a varying foreground of valley that narrowed or widened like the flow of the stream that had made it peaks that opened and shut on one another like the changing flies in some spectacular play and we had compassed two days worth of oldtime travel when a man made every foot of ground his own and were drawing near zenkoji  i was glad to be there hardly as glad to be there so soon there are lands made to be skimmed tame samenesses of plain or weary wastes of desert where even the iron horse gallops too slow  japan is not one of them  a land which nature herself has already crumpled into its smallest compass and then covered with vegetation rich as velvet is no land to hurry over  one may well linger where each mile builds the scenery afresh and in this world whose civilization grows at the expense of the picturesque it is something to see a culture that knows how least to mar   upon this mood of unsatisfied satisfaction my night fell and shortly after the train rolled into the zenkoji station amid a darkness deepened by falling rain  the passengers bundled out  the station looked cheerless enough  but from across the open space in front shone a galaxy of light  a crowd of teahouses posted on the farther side had garlanded themselves all over with lanterns each trying to outvie its neighbor in apparent hospitality  the display was perceptibly of pecuniary intent but still it was grateful  to be thought worth catching partakes after all of the nature of a compliment  what was not so gratifying was the embarrassment of choice that followed for each of these gayly beckoning caravansaries proved to be a catchpilgrim for its inn uptown  being on a hill zenkoji is not by way of easy approach by train and the pilgrims to it are legion  in order therefore to anticipate the patronage of unworthy rivals each inn has felt obliged to be personally represented on the spot   the one for which mine host of takasaki had with his blessing made me a note turned out so poorly prefaced that i hesitated the extreme zeal on the part of its proprietor to book me made me still more doubtful  so sending yejiro off to scout i walked to and fro waiting  i did not dare sit down on the sill of any of the booths for fear of committing myself   while he was still away searching vainly for the proper inn the lights were suddenly all put out  at the same fatal moment the jinrikisha of which a minute before there had seemed to be plenty all mysteriously vanished  by one fell stroke there was no longer either end in sight nor visible means of reaching it       in the street of by and by      stands the hostelry of never  as a rondel of henleys hath it but not every one has the chance to see the spanish proverb so literally fulfilled  there we werenowhere i think i never suffered a bitterer change of mood in my life   at last after some painful groping in the dark and repeated resolves to proceed on foot to the town and summon help i chanced to stumble upon a stray kuruma which had incautiously returned under cover of the darkness to the scene of its earlier exploits  i secured it on the spot and by it was trundled across a bit of the plain and up the long hill crowned by the town to the pleasing jingle of a chime of rings hung somewhere out of sight beneath the body of the vehicle  when the trundler asked where to drop me i gave at a venture the name that sounded the best only to be sure of having guessed awry when he drew up before the inn it designated  the existence of a better was legible on the face of it  we pushed on   happily the hostelries were mostly in one quarter the better to keep an eye on one another for in the course of the next ten minutes i suppose we visited nearly every inn in the place  the choice was not a whit furthered by the change from the outposts to the originals  at last however i got so far in decision as to pull off my boots an act elsewhere as well i believe considered an acquiescence in fateand suffered myself to be led through the house along the indoor piazza of polished board exceeding slippery up several breakneck ladderlike stairways even more polished and frictionless round some corners dark as a dim andon a feeble tallow candle blinded by a paper box placed so as not to light the turn could make them until finally we emerged on the third story a height that itself spoke for the superiority of the inn and i was ushered into what my bewildered fancy instantly pictured a mediaeval banqueting hall  it conjured up the idea on what i must own to have been insufficient grounds namely a plain deal table and a set of questionably made though rather gaudily upholstered chairs but chairs in a land whose people have from time immemorial found their own feet quite good enough to sit on were so unexpected a luxury even after our takasaki experience that they may be pardoned for suggesting any flight of fancy   the same might formerly have been said of the illumination next introduced  now however common kerosene lamps are no longer so much of a sight even in japan  indeed i had the assurance to ask for a shade to go with the one they set on the table in all the glaring nudity of a plain chimney  this there was some difficulty in finding the search resulting in a green paper visor much too small that sat on askew just far enough not to hide the light  the japanese called it a hat without the least intention of humor   by the light thus given the room stood revealed an eyrie encased on all sides except the one of approach by shoji only  into these had been let a belt of glass eighteen inches wide all the way round the room at the height at which a person sitting on the mats could see out  it is much the fashion now thus to graft a western window upon a fareastern wall  the idea is ingenious and economical and has but two drawbacksthat you feel excessively indoors if you stand up and strangely outofdoors if you sit down   i pushed the panels apart and stepped out upon the narrow balcony  below me lay the street the lanterns of the passersby flitting like fireflies through the dark and from it stole up to me the hum of pleasure life a perfume of sound strangely distinct in the still night air   accredited pilgrim though one be not to pass by so famous a shrine as zenkoji without the tribute of a thought were to be more or less than human even though one have paid his devoirs before  sought every year by thousands from all parts of japan it serves but to make the pilgrimage seem finer that the bourne itself should not be fine  large and curious architecturally for its roof the temple is otherwise a very ordinary structure more than ordinarily besoiled  there is nothing rich about it not much that is imposing  yet in spite of poverty and dirt it speaks with a certain grandeur to the heart  true shrine whose odor of sanctity is as widespread as the breeze that wanders through its open portals and which comes so near the wants of the world that the very pigeons flutter in to homes among its rafters  the airbeats of their wings heighten the hush they would seem to break and only enhance the sacred quiet of the navea stillness such that the coppers of the faithful fall with exaggerated ring through the lattice of the almsbox while the swiftly mumbled prayers of the givers rise in all simplicity straight to heaven   in and about the courtyard live the sacred doves and he who will may have their company for the spreading of a feast of crumbs  and the rush of their wings as they descend to him from the sky seems like drawing some strange benediction down     v   no  my quest still carrying me westward along the line of the new railway i took the train again and in the compartment of the carriage i found two other travelers  they were a typical japanese couple in middle life and in something above middle circumstances  he affected european clothes in part while she still clung to the costume of her ancestors  both were smokingshe her little pipe and he the fashionable cigarette  their mutual relations were those of substance to shadow  she followed him inevitably and he trod on her feelings regardless of them  she had been pretty when he took her to wife and though worn and withered she was happy still  as for him he was quite satisfied with her as he would have been quite satisfied without her    the roadbed soon left the shinano plain across which peered the opposite peaks still hooded with snow and wound up through a narrow valley to emerge at last upon a broad plateau  three mountains flanked the farther side in file the last and highest of the three myokosan an extinct volcano indeed hardly more than the ruins of one time has so changed its shape and the snow whitens its head so reverently it would be possible to pass it by without a suspicion of its wild youth  from the plateau it rose proudly in one long sweep from moor to shoulder from shoulder to crag from crag to snow up into the leaden sky high into its second mile of air  subtly the curve carried fancy with it and i found myself in mind slowly picking my way upward threading an arete here and scaling a slope there with all the feelings of a genuine climb  while i was still ascending in this insubstantial manner clouds fell upon the summit from the sky and from the summit tumbled down the ravines into the valley and met me at naoyetsu in a drizzling rain   naoyetsu is not an enlivening spot to be landed at in a stress of weather hardly satisfactory in fact for the length of time needed to hire jinrikisha  it consisted originally of a string of fishermens huts along the sea  to these the building of the railway has contributed a parallel row of reception booths a hundred yards inshore and to which of the two files to award the palm for cheerlessness it would be hard to know  the huts are good of a kind which is poor and the booths are poor of a kind which is good to decide between such rivals is a matter of mood  for my part i hasted to be gone in a jinrikisha itself not an overcheerful conveyance in a pour   the rain shut out the distance and the hood and oilpaper apron eclipsed the foreground  the loss was not great to judge by what specimens of the view i caught at intervals  the landscape was a geometric pattern in paddyfields  these as yet unplanted were swimming in water out of which stuck the stumps of last years crop  it was a tearful sight  fortunately the road soon rose superior to it passed through a cutting and came out unexpectedly above the seaa most homesick sea veiled in rainmist itself a disheartening drab  the cutting which ushered us somewhat proudly upon this inhospitable outlook proved to be the beginning of a pass sixty miles long between the hidashinshiu mountains and the sea of japan   i was now to be rewarded for my venture in an unlookedfor way for i found myself introduced here to a stretch of coast worth going many miles to see   the provinces of hida and etchiu are cut off from the rest of japan by sets of mountain ranges impassable throughout almost their whole length  so bent on barring the way are the chains that not content with doing so in midcourse they all but shut it at their ocean end for they fall in all their entirety plumb into the sea  following one another for a distance of sixty miles range after range takes thus its header into the deep  the only level spots are the deltas deposited by the streams between the parallels of peak  but these are far between  most of the way the road belts the cliffs now near their base now cut into the precipice hundreds of feet above the tide  the road is one continuous observation point  along it our jinrikisha bowled  in spite of the rain the view had a grandeur that compensated for much discomfort  it was moreover amply diversified  now we rushed out to the tip of some high cape now we swung round into the curve of the next bay now we wound slowly upward now we slipped merrily down  the headlands were endless and each gave us a seascape differing from the one we folded out of sight behind and a fringe of foam curving with the coast stretched like a ribbon before us to mark the way   we halted for the night at a fishing village called no two lines of houses hugging the mountain side and a single line of boats drawn up stern on upon the strand the day and night domiciles of the amphibious strip of humanity in domestic tiff turning their backs to one another a stones throw apart  as our kuruma men knew the place while we did not we let them choose the inn  they pulled up at what caused me a shudder  i thought if this was the best inn what must the worst be like  however i bowed my head to fate in the form of a rafter lintel and passed in  a dim light which came in part from a hole in the floor and in part from an ineffective lamp revealed a lofty grottolike interior  over the hole hung a sort of witches caldron swung by a set of iron bars from the shadowy form of a sootbegrimed rafter  around the kettle crouched a circle of gnomes   our entrance caused a stir out of which one of the gnomes came forward bowing to the ground  when he had lifted himself up enough to be seen he turned out quite human  he instantly bustled to fetch another light and started to lead the strangers across the usual slippery sill and up the nearly perpendicular stairs  why i was not perpetually falling down these same stairways or sliding gracefully or otherwise off the corridors in a heap will always be a mystery to me  yet with the unimportant exception of sitting down occasionally to put on my boots somewhat harder than i meant i remember few such mishaps  it was not the surface that was unwilling for the constant scuffle of stocking feet has given the passageways a polish mahogany might envy   the man proved anything but inhuman and very much mine host how courteous he was and in what a pleased mind with the world even its whims of weather his kind attentions put me  he really did so little too  beside numberless bows and profuse politeness he simply laid a small and very thin quilt upon the mats for me to sit on and put a feeble brazier by my side  so far as mere comfort went the first act savored largely of supererogation as the mats were already exquisitely clean and the second of insufficiency since the brazier served only to point the cold it was powerless to chase  but the manner of the doing so charmed the mind that it almost persuaded the grumbling body of content   as mine host bowed himself out a maid bowed herself in with a tray of tea and sugarplums and a grace that beggared appreciation   his augustness is well come she said as she sank on her knees and bowed her pretty head till it touched the mats and the voice was only too human for heaven  unconsciously it made the better part of a caress   would his augustness deign to take some tea  truly he must be very tired and pouring out a cup she placed it beside me as it might have been some beautiful rite and then withdrew leaving me beside the tea the perfume of a presence the sense that something exquisite had come and gone   i sat there thinking of her in the abstract and wondering how many maids outside japan were dowried with like grace and the like voice  with such a one for cupbearer i could have continued to sip tea i thought for the rest of my natural or alas unnatural existence   there i stayed squatting on my feet on the mats admiring the mimic volcano which in the orthodox artistic way the charcoal was arranged to represent and trying my best to warm myself over the idea but the idea proved almost as cold comfort as the brazier itself the higher aesthetic part of me was in paradise and the bodily half somewhere on the chill confines of outer space  the spot would no doubt have proved wholly heaven to that witty individual who was so anxious to exchange the necessities of life for a certainty of its luxuries  for here according to our scheme of things was everything one had no right to expect and nothing that one had  my european belongings looked very gross littering the mats and i seemed to myself a boor beside the unconscious breeding of those about me yet it was only a poor village inn and its people were but peasants after all   i pondered over this as i dined in solitary state and when i had mounted my funeral pyre for the night i remember romancing about it as i fell asleep   i was still a knighterrant and the princess was saying all manner of charming things to me in her still more charming manner when i became aware that it was the voice of the evening before wishing me goodmorning  i opened my eyes to see a golden gleam flooding the stillshut shoji and a diamond glitter stealing through the cracks that set the blood dancing in my veins  then with a startling clatter my princess rolled the panels aside   windows are but halfway shifts at best  the true goodmorning comes afield and next to that is the thrill that greets the throwing your whole room wide to it  to let it trickle in at a casement is to wash in a dish  the true way is to take the sunshine with the shock of a plunge into the sea and feel it glow and tingle all over you   the rain had taken itself off in the night and the air sparkled with freshness  the tiny garden court lay in cool rich shadow flecked here and there with spots of dazzle where a ray reflected found a pathway in while the roofs above glistened with countless starpoints   nor was mine host less smiling than the day though he had not overcharged me for my room  i was nothing to him yet he made me feel half sorry to go  a small pittance too the tea money seemed for all that had gone with it  we pay in this world with copper for things gold cannot buy  humanities are so cheapand so dear   the whole household gathered in force on its outer sill to wish us good luck as we took the street and threw sayonaras if it must be so after us as we rolled away   there is a touch of pathos in this parting acquiescence in fate if it must be so indeed  i wonder did mine host suspect that i did not all leavethat a part of me a sort of ghostly lodger remained with him who had asked me so little for my stay  probably in body i shall never stir him again from beside his fire nor follow as he leads the way through the labyrinth of his house but in spirit at times i still steal back and i always find the same kind welcome awaiting me in the guest room in the ell and the same bright smile of morning to gild the tiny garden court  the only things beyond the grasp of change are our own memories of what once was    vi  on a new cornice road  the sunshine quickened us all and our kuruma took the road like a flock of birds for jinrikisha men in company run as wild geese fly crisscross  it is an artistic habit inculcated to court ladies in books on etiquette  to make the men travel either abreast or in indian file is simply impossible  after a moments conformity they invariably relapse into their own orderly disorder   this morning they were in fine figure and bowled us along to some merry tune within while the babycarriages themselves jangled the bangles on their axles making a pleasing sort of cry  the village folk turned in their steps to stare and smile as we sped past   it was a strangeappearing street  on both sides of it in front of the houses ran an arcade continuous but irregular a contribution of building  each house gave its mite in the shape of a covered portico which fitted as well as could be expected to that of its next door neighbor  but as the houses were not of the same size and the ground sloped the roofs of the porticos varied in level  a similar terracing held good of the floors  the result was rather a federation than a strict union of interests  indeed the object in view was communal  for the arcades were snow galleries i was told to enable the inhabitants in winter to pass from one end of the village to the other no inconsiderable distance  they visored both sides of the way showing that then in these parts even a crossing of the street is a thing to be avoided  indeed by all report the drifts here in the depth of winter must be worth seeing  even at this moment may the 6th there was still neve on some of the lowest foothills and we passed more than one patch of dirtgrimed snow buttressing the highway bank  the bangles on the axles now began to have a meaning a thing they had hitherto seemed to lack  with the snow arcades by way of introduction they spoke for themselves  evidently they were first cousins of our sleighbells  here then as cordially as with us man abhors an acoustic vacuum and when nature has put her icy bellglass over the noises of the field he must needs invent some jingle to wile his ears withal   once past the houses we came upon a strip of paddyfields that bordered the mountain slope to the very verge of the tide  some of these stood in spots where the tilt of the land would have seemed to have precluded even the thought of such cultivation  for a paddyfield must be perfectly level that it may be kept under water at certain seasons of the year  on a slope therefore a thing a paddyfield never hesitates to scale they rise in terraces skyward  here the drop was so great that the terraces made bastions that towered proudly on the very knifeedge of decision between the seaweed and the cliffs  a runnel tamed to a bamboo duct did them ganymede service for a paddyfield is perpetually thirsty   it was the season of repairing of dykes and ditches in rice chronology a much more complicated annal than might be thought  this initial stage of it has a certain architectural interest  every year before planting begins the dykes have all to be remade strictly in place for they serve for both dams and bounds to the elaborately partitioned fields  adjacent mud is therefore carefully plastered over the remains of the old dyke which to the credit of the former builders is no small fraction of it and the work then finished off with a sculptors care  an easiergoing peasantry might often forego renewal  indeed i cannot but think the farmers take a natural delight in this exalted form of mud pies they work away on already passable specimens with such a will  but who does quite outgrow his childish delights  and to make of the play of childhood the work of middle life must be to foil the primal curse to the very letter  what more enchanting pastime than to wade all day in viscous mud hearing your feet plash when you put them in and suck as you draw them out while the higher part of you is busied building a parapet of gluey soil smoothing it down on the sides and top and crowning your masterpiece with a row of sprigs along the crest  and then in the gloaming to trudge homeward feeling that you have done a meritorious deed after all  when i come to my second childhood i mean to turn paddyfield farmer myself   though the fields took to the slopes so kindly they had a preference for plains  in the deltas formed by the bigger streams they expanded till they made chesswork of the whole  laborers knee deep in the various squares did very well for pawns  the fields being still in their prenatal stage were not exactly handsome  there was too much of one universal brown  this was relieved only by the nurseries of young plants small fields here and there just showing a delicate downy growth of green delightful to the eye  they were not long sown  for each still lay cradled under its scarecrow a pole planted in the centre of the rectangle with strings stretched to the four corners and a bit of rag fluttering from the peak  the scarecrows are no doubt useful since they are in general use but i counted seven sparrows feeding in reckless disregard of danger under the very wings of one of the contrivances   the customs of the country seemed doomed that day to misunderstanding whether by sparrows or by bigger birds of passage  those which should have startled failed of effect and those which should not have startled did  for on turning the face of the next bluff we came upon a hamlet apparently in the high tide of conflagration  from every roof volumes of smoke were rolling up into the sky while men rushed to and fro excitedly outside  i was stirred myself for there seemed scant hope of saving the place such headway had the fire as evidenced by the smoke already acquired  the houses were closed a wise move certainly on the score of draft but one that precluded a fighting of the fire  i was for jumping from the jinrikisha to see if not to do something myself when i was stopped by the jinrikisha men who coolly informed me that the houses were limekilns   it appeared that limemaking was a specialty of these parts being in fact the alternative industry to fishing with the littoral population the farming of its strip of ricefields hardly counting as a profession since such culture is second nature with the far oriental limemaking may labor under objections considered generically but this method of conducting the business is susceptible of advantageous imitation  it should commend itself at once to theatrical managers for a bit of stage effect  evidently it is harmless  no less evidently it is cheap and in some cases it might work a double benefit  impresarios might thus consume all the public statuary about the town to the artistic education of the community besides producing most realistic results in the theatre   through the courtesy of some of the laborers i was permitted to enter a small kiln in which they were then at work  i went in cautiously and came out with some haste for the fumes of the burning which quite filled the place made me feel my intrusion too poignantly i am willing to believe the work thoroughly enjoyable when once you become used to it  in the meantime i should choose its alternative the pleasures of a dirty fishing boat in a nasty seawayif i were unfortunate enough to make one of the population  i like to breathe without thinking of it   the charcoal used in the process came they told me from noto i felt a thrill of pride in hearing the land of my courting thus distinctively spoken of although the mention were not by way of any remarkable merit  at least the place was honorably known beyond its own borders had in fact a certain prestige  for they admitted there was charcoal in their own province but the best they all agreed came from their neighbor over the sea  they spoke to appreciative ears  i was only too ready to believe that the best of anything came from noto  did they lay my interest to the score of limemaking i wonder or were they in part undeceived when i asked if noto were visible from where we were  it was they said on very clear days did i know noto what shall a man say when questioned thus concerning that on which he has set his heart  he cannot say yes shall he say no and put himself without the pale of mere acquaintance  there is a sense of nearness not to be justified to another and the one to whom a man may feel most kin is not always she of whom he knows the most   i am by way of knowing it i said as my eyes followed my thoughts horizonward  was it all mirage they saw or thought to see that faint coastline washed a little deeper blue against the sky  i fear me so for the limeburners failed to make it out  the day was not clear enough they said   but the little heap of charcoal at least was real and it had once been a tree on that farther shore  charcoal to them it was no longer common charcoal to me for looking at it was i not face to face with something that had once formed part of noto the unknown    vii  oya shiradzu ko shiradzu   toward the middle of the afternoon we reached a part of the coast locally famous or infamous for the two were one a stretch of some miles where the mountains made no apology for falling abruptly into the sea  sheer for several hundred feet the shore is here unscalable nor did it use to be possible to go round by land for the cliffs are merely the ends of mountainchains themselves utterly wild and tractless  a narrow strip of sand was the sole link between etchiu on the one hand and echigo on the other  the natives call the place oya shiradzu ko shiradzu that is a spot where the father no longer knows the child nor the child the father so obliterating to sense of all beside is the personal danger  refuge there is none of any kind  to have been caught here in a storm on the making tide must indeed have been to look death in the face   between the devil of a precipice and the deep sea he who ventured on the passage must have hurried anxiously along the thread of sand hoping to reach the last bend in time  as he rounds the illomened corner he sees he is too late already the surf is breaking against the cliff  he turns back only to find retreat barred behind by rollers that have crept in since he passed  his very footprints have all been washed away  caged  like the walls of a deepdown dungeon the perpendicular cliff towers at his side and in the pit they rim he and the angry ocean are left alone together  then the sea begins to play with him creeping catlike up  her huge paws the breakers buffet his face  the water is already about his feet as he backs desperately up against the rock  and each wave comes crushing in with a cruel growl to strikeshort this time  but the next breaks closer and the next closer still  he climbs a boulder  the spray blinds him  he hears a deafening roar feels a shock that hurls him into space and he knows no more   now the place is fearful only to fancy  for a road has been built belting the cliffs hundreds of feet above the tide  it is a part of what is known as the new road a name it is likely long to keep its sides are in places so steep that it fails of its footing and is constantly slipping off into the sea  such sad missteps are the occasion for bands of convicts to appear on the scene under the marshaling of a police officer and be set to work to repair the slide by digging a little deeper into the mountainside  the convicts wear clothes of a light brickcolor which at a distance looks a little like couleur de rose while the police are dressed in sombre blue  it would seem somewhat of a satire on the facts  the new road is not without its sensation to such as dislike looking down  fortunately the jinrikisha men have not the instinct of packmules to be persistently trifling with its outer edge in addition to the void at the side another showed every now and then in front where a dip and a turn completely hid the road beyond the veritable end of the world seemed to be there just ahead close against the vacancy of space  a couple of rods more and we must step offindeed the end of the world for us if we had   when the road came to face the oya shiradzu ko shiradzu it attacked the rise by first running away from it up a stream into the mountains a bit of the wisdom of the serpent that enabled it to gain much height on the bend back  trees vaulted the way tapestrying it with their leaves between which one caught peeps at the sea a shimmer of blue through a shimmer of green  the path was strung with pedlars and pilgrims the latter of both sexes and all ages under mushroom hats with their skirts neatly tucked in at the waist showing their leggings the former doing fulcrum duty to a couple of baskets swung on a pole over their shoulders  the pilgrims were on their way back from zenkoji  some of them would have tramped over two hundred miles on foot before they reached home again  a rich harvest they brought back religion travel and exercise all in one enough to keep them happy long  i know of nothing which would more persuade me to be a buddhist than these same delightful pilgrimages  fresh air fresh scenes on the road and fresh faith at the end of it  no desert caravan of penance to these meccas but a summers stroll under a summers sky  an end that sanctifies the means and a means that no less justifies its end   while we were still in the way with these pious folk we touched our midday halt a wayside teahouse notched in a corner of the road commanding a panoramic view over the sea  the place was kept by a deaf old lady and her tailless cat  the old ladys peculiarity was personal the cats was not  no selfrespecting cat in this part of japan could possibly wear a tail  the northern branch of the family has long since discarded that really useless feline appendage  a dog in like circumstance would be sadly straitened in the expression of his emotions but a cat is every whit a cat without a continuation   with the deaf old lady we had for obvious reasons no sustained conversation  she busied herself for the most part in making dango a kind of dumpling but not one calculated to stir curiosity since it is made of rice all through  these our men ate with more relish than would seem possible  meanwhile i sat away from the road where i could look out upon the sea over the cliffs and the cat purred about in her offhand way and used me incidentally as a rubbing post  trees fringed the picture in front and the ribbon of road wound off through it into the distance beaded with folk and shot with sunshine and shadow   i was sorry when lunch was over and we took leave of our gentle hostesses tabbies both of them yet no unpleasing pair  a few more bends brought us to where the path culminated  the road had for some time lain bare to the sea and sky but at the supreme point some fine beeches made a natural screen masking the naked face of the precipice on the cutting above four huge chinese characters stood graved in the rock   ya no gotoku to no gotoshi  smooth as a whetstone straight as an arrow meaning the cliff  perhaps because of their pictorial descent the characters did not shock one  unlike the usual branding of nature they seemed not out of keeping with the spot  not far beyond the butts of the winters neve buried in dirt banked the path   for miles along the raod the view off was superb  nothing bordered one side of the way and the mountain bordered the other  far below lay the sea stretching away into blue infinity a vast semicircle of ultramarine domed by a hemisphere of azure and it was noticeable how much vaster the sea looked than the sky  we were so high above it that the heavings of its longer swells were leveled to imperceptibility while the waves only graved the motionless surface  here and there the rufflings of a breeze showed in darker markings like the changes on watered silk  the most ephemeral disturbance made the most show  dotted over the blue expanse were black spots fishing boats and a steamer with a long trail of smoke showed in the offing stationary to the eye yet shifting its place like the shadow of a style when you forgot to look  and in long perspective on either hand stretched the battlement of cliff  visual immensity lay there before us in each of its three manifestations of line of surface and of space   we stood still the better to try to take it inthis grandeur tempered by sunshine and warmth  do what he will man is very much the creature of his surroundings yet  in some instant sense the eyes fashion the feelings and we ourselves grow broader with our horizons breadth  the chaldean shepherds alone with the night had grander thoughts for the companionship and i venture to believe that the heart of the mountaineer owes quite as much to what he is forced to visage as to what he is compelled to do   we tucked ourselves into our jinrikisha and started down  by virtue of going the speed increased till the way we rolled round the curves was intoxicating  the panorama below swung to match and we leaned in or out mechanically to trim the balance  occasionally as it hit some stone the vehicle gave a lurch that startled us for a moment into sobriety from which we straightway relapsed into exhilaration  curious this how the body brings about its own forgetting  for i was conscious only of mind and yet mind was the one part of me not in motion  i suppose much oxygen made me tipsy  if so it is a recommendable tipple  spirits were not unhappily named after the natural article   it was late afternoon when we issued at last from our two days thermopylae upon the etchiu plain  as we drew out into its expanse the giant peaks of the tateyama range came into view from behind their foothills draped still in their winter ermine  it was last year yet in those upper regions of the world but all about us below throbbed with the heartbeats of the spring  at each mile amid the ever lengthening shadows nature seemed to grow more sentient  through the thick air the peaks stood out against the eastern sky in saffron that flushed to rose and then paled to gray  the ricefields already flooded for their first working mirrored the glow overhead so glassily that their dykes seemed to float in sunset illusion a mere bar tracery of earth between the sky above and a sky beneath  upon such lattice of a world we journeyed in midheaven  stealthily the shadows gathered and as the hour for confidences drew on nature took us into hers  the trees in the twilight just breaking into leaf stood in groups among the fields and whispered low to one another nodding their heads and then from out the shadow of the may evening came the croaking of the frogs  strangely the sound fitted the hour with its like touch of mysterious suggestion  as the twilight indefinite it pervaded everything yet was never anywhere  deafening at a distance it hushed at our approach only to begin again behind us  willothewisp of the ear infatuating because forever illusive  and the distance and the numbers blended what had perhaps been harsh into a mellow whole that filled the gloaming with a sort of voice  i began to understand why the japanese are so fond of it that they deem it not unworthy a place in natures vocal pantheon but little lower than the song of the nightingale and echo its sentiment in verse  and indeed it seems to me that his soul must be conventionally tuned in whom this evensong of the ricefields stirs no responsive chord     viii   across the etchiu delta   the twilight lingered and the road threaded its tortuous course for miles through the rice plain bordered on either hand by the dykes of the paddyfields  every few hundred feet we passed a farmhouse screened by clipped hedgerows and bosomed in trees and at longer intervals we rolled through some village the country pike becoming for the time the village street  the land was an archipelago of homestead in a sea of rice  but the trees about the dwellings so cut up the view that for the moments of passing the mind forgot it was all so flat and came back to its ocean in surprise when the next vista opened on the sides   things had already become silhouettes when we dashed into lanternlighted mikkaichi  we took the place in form and a fine sensation we made  what between the shouts of the runners and the clatter of the chaises men women and children made haste to clear a track snatching their little ones back and then staring at us as we swept past  indeed the teams put their best feet foremost for local effect and more than once came within an ace of running over some urchin who either would not or could not get out of the way  fortunately no casualties occurred  for it would have been ignominious to have been arrested by the police during our first ten minutes in the town not to speak of the sad dampening to our feelings an accident would have caused   in this mad manner we dashed up the long main street  we were forced to take the side for the village aqueduct or gutterit served both purposesmonopolized the middle  at short intervals it was spanned by causeways made of slabs of stone  over one of these we made a final swirl and drew up before the inn  then our shafts made their obeisance to the ground   a warm welcome greeted the appeal  a crowd of servants came rushing to the front of the house with an eye to business and a crowd of village folk with an eye to pleasure closed in behind  between the two fires we stepped out and entered the side court to the satisfaction of the one audience and the chagrin of the other but it is impossible to please everybody   fortunately it was not so hard to please us and certainly the inn people did their best for they led the way to what formerly were the state apartments that part of the house where the daimyo of kaga had been wont to lodge when he stopped here over night on his journey north  though it had fallen somewhat into disrepair it was still the place of honor in the inn and therefore politely put at the service of one from beyond sea  there i supped in solitary state and there i slept right royally amid the relics of former splendor doubting a little whether some unlaid ghost of bygone times might not come to claim his own and oust me at black midnight by the rats his retinue   but nothing short of the sun called me back to consciousness and bade me open to the tiny garden where a pair of ducks were preening their feathers after an early bath in their own little lake  on the veranda my lake already stood prepared a brass basin upon a wooden stand according to the custom of the country  so ducks and i dabbled and prinked in all innocence in the garden which might well have been the garden of eden for any hint it gave of a world beyond  it was my fate too to leave it after the same manner for breakfast over we were once more of the road   we had a long day of it before us for i purposed to cross the etchiu delta and sleep that night on the threshold of my hopes  the day like all days that look long on the map proved still longer on the march  its itinerary diversified discomfort  first seventeen miles in kuruma then a ferry then a tramp of twelve miles along the beach through a series of sand dunes then another ferry and finally a second walk of seven miles and a half over some foothills to top off with  the inexpensiveness of the transport was the sole relieving feature of the day  not i mean because the greater and worse half of the journey was done on our own feet but because of the cheap charges of the chaises and even of the porters  to run at a dogtrot trundling another in a baby carriage seventeen miles for twenty cents is not i hold an extortionate price  certain details of the tariff however are peculiar  for instance if two men share the work by running tandem the fare is more than doubled a ratio in the art of proportion surprising at first  each man would seem to charge for being helped  the fact is the greater speed expected of the pair more than offsets the decreased draft   otherwise as i say the day was depressing  it was not merely the tramp through the sand dunes that was regrettable though heaven knows i would not willingly take it again  the sand had far too hospitable a trick of holding on to you at every step to be to my liking  besides the sun which had come out with summer insistence chose that particular spot for its midday siesta and lay there at full length while the air was preternaturally still  it was a stupidly drowsy heat that gave no fillip to the feet   but such discomfort was merely by the way  the real trouble began at fushiki the town on the farther side of the second ferry  in the first place the spot had what is most uncommon in japan a very sorry look which was depressing in itself  secondly its inhabitants were much too busy or much too unemployed or both to be able to attend to strangers at that hour of the afternoon  consequently it was almost impossible to get any one to carry the baggage we dispatched emissaries however  by good luck we secured some beer and then argued ourselves dry again on the luggage question the emissaries were at work we were assured and at last some one who had been sent for was said to be coming  still time dragged on until finally the burden bearers turned up and turned out to bewomen   at this i rebelled  the situation was not new but it was none the less impossible  in outoftheway districts i had refused offers of the kind before  for japanese beasts of burden run in a decreasing scale as follows according to the poverty of the place jinrikisha horses bulls men women  i draw my line at the last  i am well aware how absurd the objects themselves regard such a protective policy but i cling to my prejudices  to the present proffer i was adamant  to step jauntily along in airy unencumberedness myself while a string of women trudged wearily after loaded with my heavy personal effects was more than an anglosaxon attitude towards the sex could stand  i would none of them to the surprise and dismay of the inn landlord and to the no slight wonder of the women the discarding was not an easy piece of work  the fair ones were present at it and i have no doubt misinterpreted the motive for women have a weakness for a touch of the slavemaster in a man  beside hell hath no fury like a woman scorned though it be only in the capacity of a porter  there was nothing for it however but to let it go at that  for to have explained with more insistence would infallibly have deepened their suspicions of wounded vanity  but it did seem hard to be obliged to feel a brute for refusing to be one   the landlord thanks to my importunities managed after some further delay to secure a couple of lusty lads relatives i suspect of the discarded fair ones and with them we eventually set out  we had not gone far when i came to consider unjustly no doubt that they journeyed too slow  i might have thought differently had i carried the chattels and they the purse  i shuddered to think what the situation would have been with women for then even the poor solace of remonstrance would have been denied  as it was i spent much breath in trying to hurry them and it is pleasanter now than it was then to reflect how futilely  for i rated them roundly while they accepted my verbal goadings with the trained stolidity of folk who were used to it   when at last we approached the village of our destination which bore the name of himi it was already dusk and this with the long may twilight meant a late hour before we should be comfortably housed  indeed i had been quartered in anticipation for the last few miles and was only awaiting arrival to enter into instant possession of my fancied estate  not content even with pure insubstantiality i had interviewed various people through yejiro on the subject  first the porters had been exhaustively catechized and then what wayfarers we chanced to meet had been buttonholed beside with the result of much contradictory information  there seemed to be an inn which was i will not say good but the best but no two informants could agree in calling it by name  one thought he remembered that the north inn was the place to go to another that he had heard the wistaria house specially commended   all doubts however were set at rest when we reached the town for without the slightest hesitation every one of the houses in question refused to take us in  the unanimity was wonderful considering the lack of collusion  yejiro and i made as many unsuccessful applications together as i could stand  then i went and sat down on the sill of the first teahouse for a base of operationsi cannot say for my headquarters because that is just what we could not getand gave myself up to melancholy  meanwhile yejiro ransacked the town from which excursions he returned every few minutes with a fresh refusal but the same excuse  it got so at last i could anticipate the excuse  the inn was full alreadyof assessors and their victims  the assessors had descended on the spot it seemed and the whole countryside had come to town to lie about the value of its land  i only wished the inhabitants might have chosen some other time for false swearing  for it was a sad tax on my credulity   we did indeed get one offer which i duly went to inspect but the outside of the house satisfied me  at last i adopted extreme measures  i sent yejiro off to the police station  this move produced its effect   even at home from having contrived to keep on the sunny side of the law and order my feelings toward the police are friendly enough for all practical purposes but in no land have i such an affectionate regard for the constabulary as in japan  members of the force there if the term be applicable to a set of students spectacled from overstudy whose strength is entirely moral never get you into trouble and usually get you out of it  one of their chief charms to the traveler lies in their opensesame effect upon obdurate landlords  in this trick they are wonderfully successful   having given ourselves up to the police therefore we were already by way of being lodged and that quickly  so indeed it proved in the time to go and come yejiro reappeared with an officer in civilians clothes who first made profuse apologies for presenting himself in undress but it seemed he was off duty at the momentand then led the way a stones throw round the corner and in five minutes i was sitting as snugly as you please in a capital room in an inns third story sipping tea and pecking at sugar plums a distinctly honored guest   here fate put in a touch of satire  for it now appeared that all our trouble was quite gratuitous  most surprisingly the innkeepers story on this occasion proved to be entirely true a possibility i had never entertained for a second and furthermore it appeared that our present inn was the one in which i had been offered rooms but had refused disliking its exterior   such is the reward for acting on general principles     ix  over the arayama pass  the morning that was to give me my selfpromised land crept on tiptoe into the room on the third story and touched me where i slept and on pushing the shoji apart and looking out i beheld as fair a day as heart could wish  a faint misty vapor like a bridal veil was just lifting from off the face of things and letting the sky show through in blueeyed depths  it was a morning of desire bashful for its youth as yet but graced with a depth of atmosphere sure to expand into a full warm perfect noon and i hastened to be out and become a part of it   three jinrikishas stood waiting our coming at the door and amidst a pelting of sayonara from the whole household we dashed off as proudly as possible down the main street of the town to the admiration of many lookerson the air laden with moisture left kisses on our cheeks as we hurried by while the sunshine fell in long scarfs of gauzy shimmer over the shoulders of the eastern hills  the men in the shafts felt the fillip of it all and encouraged one another with lusty cries a lightheartedness that lent them heels  even the peasants in the fields seemed to wish us well as they looked up from their work to grin goodhumoredly   we value most what we attain with difficulty  it was on this principle no doubt that the road considerately proceeded to give out  it degenerated indeed very rapidly after losing sight of the town and soon was no more than a collection of holes strung on ruts that made travel in perambulators tiring alike to body and soul  at last after five miles of floundering it gave up all pretence at a wheelway and deposited us at a wayside teahouse at the foot of a little valley the first step indeed up the arayama pass  low hills had closed in on the right shutting off the sea and the ridge dividing noto from etchiu rose in higher lines upon the left   here we hired porters securing them from the neighboring fields for they were primarily peasants and were porters only as we were tramps by virtue of the country  porterage being the sole means of transport they came to carry our things as they would have carried their own in skeleton hods strapped to their backs  in this they did not differ from the japanese custom generally but in one point they showed a strange advance over their fellows  they were wonderfully methodical folk  they paid no heed to our hurry and instead of shouldering the baggage they proceeded to weigh it each manload by itself on a steelyard of wood six feet long the results they then worked out conscientiously on an abacus  after which i paid accordingly  truly an equitable adjustment between man and man at which i lost only the time it took  then we started   from the teahouse the path rose steadily enough for so uneducated a way leaving the valley to contract into an open glen  the day in the mean time came out as it had promised full and warm fine basking weather as a certain snake in the path seemed to think  so i judge did the porters  if it be the pace that kills these simple folk must be a longlived race  they certainly were very careful not to hurry themselves  had they been hired for life so thrifty a husbanding of their strength would have been most gratifying to witness unluckily they were mine only for the job  they moved one foot after the other with a mechanical precision exhausting even to look at  to keep with them was practically impossible for an ordinary pedestrian  nothing short of a woman shopping could worthily have matched their pace  in sight their speed was snaillike out of it they would appear to have stopped so far did they fall behind once i thought they had turned back   the path we were following was the least traveled of the only two possible entrances into noto by land  it was a side or postern gate to the place over a gap on the northern end of a mountain wall the main approach lying along its other flank  for a high range of uninhabited hills nearly dams the peninsula across falling on the right side straight into the sea but leaving on the other a lowland ligature that binds noto to kaga  to get from kaga into etchiu the range has to be crossed lower down  our dip in the chain was called the arayama toge or rough mountain pass and was perhaps fifteen hundred feet high but pleasingly modeled in its lines after one ten times its height   halfway up the tug of the last furlong where the ascent became steep enough for zigzags i turned to look back  down away from me fell the valley slipping by reason of its own slope out into the great etchiu plain  here and there showed bits of the path in corkscrew from my personal standpoint all perfectly porterless  over the low hills to the left lay the sea the crescent of its great beach sweeping grandly round into the indistinguishable distance  back of it stretched the etchiu plain but beyond that nothing  the mountains that should have bounded it were lost to sight in the spring haze   mechanically my eyes followed up into the languid blue when suddenly they chanced upon a little cloud for cloud i took it to be yet something about it struck me as strange and scanning it more closely by this most natural kind of second sight i marked the unmistakable glisten of snow  it was a snow peak towering there in isolated majesty  as i gazed it grew on me with ineffable grandeur sparkling with a faint saffron glamour of its own  shifting my look a little i saw another and then another of the visions like puffs of steam rising above the plain  half apparitions below a certain line the snow line they vanished into air for between them and the solid earth there looked to be blue sky  the haze of distance on this soft may day hid their lower slopes and left the peaks to tower alone into the void  they were the giants of the tateyama range standing there over against me inaccessibly superb   a pair of teahouses rivals crowned the summit of the pass which like most japanese passes was a mere knifeedge of earth  with a quickened pulse if a slackened gait i topped the crest walked straight past the twin teahouses and their importunities to stop another halfdozen paces to the brink and in one sweep looked down over a thousand feet on the western side  noto eyelashed by the branches of a tree just breaking into leaf lay open to me below   after the first glow of attainment this initial view was i will confess disillusioning  instead of what unfettered fancy had led me to expect i saw only a lot of terraced ricefields backed by ranges of low hills for all the world a parquet in green and brown tiles  and yet as the wish to excuse prompted me to think was this not after all as it should be  for i was looking but at the entrance to the land its outer hallway as it were nanao its capital its inland sea all its beyond was still shut from me by the nearer hills  and feeling thus at liberty to be amused i forthwith saw it as a satire on panoramas generally   panoramic views are painfully plain  they must needs be mappy at best for your own elevation flattens all below it to one topographic level  field and woodland town or lake show by their colors only as if they stood in print and you might as well lay any good atlas on the floor and survey it from the lofty height of a footstool  such being the inevitable it was refreshing to see the thing in caricature  no pains evidently had been spared by the inhabitants to make their map realistic  there the geometric lines all stood in ludicrous insistence any child could have drawn the thing as mechanically   the two teahouses were well patronized by wayfarers of both sexes resting after their climb  some simply sipped tea chatting others made a regular meal of the opportunity  the greater number sat as we did on the sill for the trouble of taking off their straw sandals our landlady was the model of what a landlady should be for it was apparently a feminine establishment  if there was a man attached to it he kept himself discreetly in the background  she was a kind sympathetic soul with a word for every one and a deliberateness of action as effective as it was efficient  and in the midst of it all she kept up a refrain of welcomes and goodbys as newcomers appeared or old comers left  the unavoidable preliminary exercise and the crisp air whetted all our appetites  so i doubt not she drove a thriving trade although to western ideas of value her charges were infinitesimally small   midday halts for lunch are godsends to tramps who travel with porters they compel the porters to catch up and give the hirer opportunity to say things which at least relieve him if they do no good  i had begun to fear ours would deprive me of this pleasure and indeed had got so far on in my meal as to care little whether they did when automatically they appeared  fortunately they needed but a short rest and as the descent on the noto side was much steeper than on the other half an hours walk brought us to the level of kuruma once more   a bit of lane almost english in look bowered in trees and winding delightfully like some human stream led us to a teahouse  while we were ordering chaises a lot of children gathered to inspect us thus kindly giving us our first view of the natives  they looked more openeyed than japanese generally but such effect may have been due to wonder  at all events the stare if it was a stare seemed like a silent sort of welcome   leaving the children still gazing after us we bowled away toward nanao and in the course of time caught our first glimpse of it from the upper end of a sweep of meadows  it sat by the waters edge at the head of a landlocked bay the nearer arm of the inland sea and an apology for shipping rode in the offing  it seemed a very fairsized town and altogether a more lively place than i had thought to find  clearly its life was as engrossing to it as if no wall of hills notching the sky shut out the world beyond  having heard however that a wateringplace called wakura was the sight of the province and learning now that it was but six miles further we decided as it was yet early in the afternoon to push on and take the capital later  we did take it later very much later the next night than was pleasing   wakura indeed was the one thing in noto except the charcoal which had an ultranotorious reputation  rumors of it had reached us as far away as shinshiu and with every fresh inquiry we made as we advanced the rumors had gathered strength  our informants spoke of it with the vague respect accorded hearsay honor  clearly it was no place to pass by   the road to it from nanao was not noteworthy but for two things one officially commended to sightseers the other not  the first was a curious waterworn rock upon the edge of the bay some waif of a boulder doubtless since it stuck up quite alone out of the sand a shrine perched atop and a larger temple encircled it below to which its fantastic cuttings served as gateway and garden  the uncommended sight was a neighboring paddyfield in which a company of frogs caught trespassing stood impaled on sticks a foot high as awful warnings to their kind  beyond this the way passed through a string of clay cuttings following the coast and in good time rolled us into the midst of a collection of barnlike buildings which it seemed was wakura   the season for the baths had not yet begun so that the number of people at the hotels was still quite small  not so the catalogue of complaints for which they were visited  the list appalled me as i sat on the threshold of my prospective lodging listening to mine hosts encomiums on the virtues of the waters  he expatiated eloquently on both the quantity and quality of the cures quite unsuspicious that at each fresh recommendation he was in my eyes depreciating his own wares  did he hope that among such a handsome choice of diseases i might at least have one  i was very near to beating a hasty retreat on the spot  for the accommodation in japanese inns is of a distressingly communistic character at best and although at present there were few patients in the place the germs were presumably still there on the lookout for a victim   immediate comfort however getting the better of problematical risk i went in  the room allotted me lay on the ground floor just off the garden and i had not been there many minutes before i became aware as one does that i was being stared at  the culprit instantly pretended with a very sheepish air to be only taking a walk  he was the vanguard of an army of the curious  the people in the next room were much exercised over the new arrival and did all decency allowed to catch a glimpse of me for which in time they were rewarded  visitors lodged farther off took aimless strolls to the verandas and looked at me when they thought i was not looking at them  all envied the servants who outdid abra by coming when i called nobody and then lingering to talk  altogether i was more of a notoriety than i ever hope to be again especially as any european would have done them as well  my public would have been greater as i afterwards learned if yejiro had not been holding rival court in the kitchen   between us we were given a good deal of local information  one bit failed to cause me unmitigated delight  we were not it appeared the first foreigners to set foot in wakura  two europeans had in a quite uncalledfor way descended upon the place the summer before up to which time indeed the spot had been virgin to caucasians  lured by the fame of the springs these men had come from kanazawa in kaga where they were engaged in teaching chemistry to make a test of the waters  i believe they discovered nothing startling  i could have predicted as much had they consulted me beforehand  they neglected to do so and the result was they came saw and conquered what little novelty the place had  i was quite chagrined  it simply showed how betrodden in these latter days the world is  there is not so much as a remote corner of it but falls under one of two heads those places worth seeing which have already been seen and those that have not been seen but are not worth seeing  wakura onsen struck me as falling into the latter halves of both categories   while discussing my solitary dinner i was informed by yejiro that some one wished to speak with me and on admitting to be at home the local prefect was ushered in  he came ostensibly to vise my passport a duty usually quite satisfactorily performed by any policeman  the excuse was transparent  he really came that he might see for himself the foreigner whom rumor had reported to have arrived  as a passport on his part he presented me with some pride the bit of autobiography that he had himself once been in tokyo a fact which in his mind instantly made us a kind of brothers and raised us both into a common region of superiority to our surroundings  he asked affectionately after the place and i answered as if it had been the one thought in both our hearts it was a pleasing little comedy as each of us was conscious of its consciousness by the other  altogether we were very friendly   between two such tokyoites it was of course the merest formality to vise a passport but being one imposed by law he kindly ran his eye over mine  as it omitted to describe my personal appearance in the usual carefully minute manner as face oval nose ordinary complexion medium and so forth identification from mere looks was not striking  so he had to take me on trust for what i purported to be an assumption which did not disconcert him in the least  with writing materials which he drew from his sleeve he registered me then and there and the demands of the law thus complied with to the letter left me amid renewed civilities to sleep the sleep of the just    x  an inland sea  they had told us overnight that a small steamer plied every other day through notos unfamed inland sea leaving the capital early in the morning and touching shortly after at wakura  as good luck would have it the morrow happened not to be any other day so we embraced the opportunity to embark in her ourselves  on her it would be more accurate to say for she proved such a mite that her cabin was barely possible and anything but desirable  by squatting down and craning my neck i peered in at the entrance a feat which was difficult enough  she was in truth not much bigger than a ships gig but she had a soul out of all proportion to her size  the way it throbbed and strained and set her whole little frame quivering with excitement made me think every moment that she was about to explode  the fact that she was manned exclusively by japanese did not entirely reassure me   there was an apology for a deck forward to which when we were well under way i clambered over the other passengers  i was just sitting down there to enjoy a comfortable pipe when i was startlingly requested by a voice from a caboose behind to move off as i was obscuring the view of the man at the wheel  after that i perched on the gunwale   we steamed merrily out into the middle of the bay  the water was slumberously smooth and under the tawny haze of the morning it shone with the sheen of burnished brass  from the gentle plowing of our bow it rolled lazily to one side as if in truth it were molten metal land at varying picturesque distances lay on all sides of us in some directions the shore was not more than a mile and a half off in others the eye wandered down a vista of water framed by low headlands for ten miles or more  but the atmosphere gave the dominant thought a strange slumberlike seclusion  so rich and golden it shut this little corner of the world in a sort of happy valley of its own and the smoke from my pipe drifted dreamily astern a natural incense to the spirits of the spot   the passengers suggested anything from a public picnic to an early exploration party  there were men women and children of all ages and kinds some stowed away in the cabin behind some gathered in groups amidships and those in the cabin thought small fry of those on deck  the cabin was considered the place of honor because the company made one pay a higher price for the privilege of its discomfort  altogether it was a very pretty epitome of a voyage   just as the steamer people were preparing for their first landing there detached itself from the background of trees along the shore the most singular aquatic structure i think i have ever seen it looked like the skeleton of some antediluvian wigwam which a prehistoric roc had subsequently chosen for a nest  four poles planted in the water inclined to one another at such an angle that they crossed threequarters of the way up  the projecting quarters held in clutch a large wicker basket like the car of a balloon  peering above the car was a mans head  as the occupant below slowly turned the head to keep an eye on us it suggested amid its web of poles some mammoth spider lying in wait for its prey   it was a matter of some wonder at first how the man got there until the motion of the steamer turned the side and disclosed a set of cross poles lashed between two of the uprights forming a rude sort of ladder  curiosity satisfied on this primary point next asked why he got there  as this was a riddle to me i propounded it to yejiro who only shook his head and propounded it to somebody else a compliment to the inquiry certainly if not to my choice of informant this somebody else told him the man was fishing  except for the immobility of the figure i never saw a man look less like it in my life   such however was the fact  the wigwam was connected by strings to the entrance of a sort of weir and the man who crouched in the basket was on the lookout for large fish of a kind called bora  as soon as one of them strayed into the mouth of the net the man pulled the string which closed the opening  the height of his observatory above the level of the water enabled him to see through it to the necessary depth  i am a trifle hazy over the exact details of the apparatus as i never saw a fish inquisitive enough to go in but i submit the existence of the fishermen in proof that it works   having deposited such wights as wished to go ashorefor the place was of no pretensionour steam fish once more turned its tail and darted us through some narrows into another bay  it must have been a favorite one with bora as its shores were dotted with fishlookouts  the observatories stood a few stonethrows out in deepish water at presumably favorable points and never very near one another lest they should interfere with a possible catch  some were inhabited some not   this bay was further remarkable for a solar halo which i chanced to see on glancing up at the sun  i suppose it was the singular quality of the light that first caused me to look overhead  for a thin veil of cloud had drawn over the blue and tempered the sunshine peculiarly of course one is familiar with caricatures of the thing in meteorological books but the phenomenon itself is not so common and the effect was uncanny  at the first glance it seemed a bit of noto witchery that strangely luminous circle around the sun to admire the moon thus bonneted as the japanese say is common enough and befits the hour  but to have the halo of the night hung aloft in broad day is to crown sober noon with enchantment   the sheet of water was sparsely dotted with sail  one little craft in particular i remember whose course bore her straight down upon us she dilated slowly out of the distance and then passed so close i might have tossed a flower aboard of her  so steady her motion she seemed oblivious to our presence as she glided demurely by at relatively doubled speed   only after we had passed did she show signs of noticing us at all  for meeting our wake the coquette she suddenly began dropping us curtseys in goodby     xi   anamidzu   we seemed bound that day to meet freaks in fishingtackle  the next one to turn up was a kind of crinoline  this strange thing confronted us as we disembarked at anamidzu  anamidzu was the last port in the inland sea  after touching here the steamer passed out into the sea of japan and tied up for the night at a small port on the eastern side of the nose of the peninsula   as the town lay away from the shore up what looked like a canal we were transferred to a small boat to be rowed in  just as we reached the beginnings of the canal we saw squatting on the bank an old crone contemplating it seemed the forlorn remains of a hoopskirt which dangled from a pole before her half in and half out of water  the chief difference between this and the more common article of commerce was merely one of degree since here the ribs by quite meeting at the top entirely suppressed the waist  their lower extremities were hid in the water and were i was informed baited with hooks   the old ladys attitude was one of inimitable apathy nor did she so much as blink at us as we passed  a little farther up on the opposite bank sat a similar bit of still life  a third beyond completed the picture  these good dames bordered the brink like so many meditative frogs  though i saw them for the first time in the flesh i recognized them at once  here were the identical fisherfolk who have sat for centuries in the paintings of tsunenobu not a whit more immovable in kakemono than in real life  i almost looked to find the masters seal somewhere in the corner of the landscape   the worthy souls were i was told inkyos a social or rather unsocial state which in their case may be rendered unwidowed dowagers since in company with their husbands they had renounced all their social titles and estates  their daughtersinlaw now did the domestic drudgery while they devoted their days thus to sport   whether it were the dames or the canal or more likely still some touch of atmosphere but i was reminded of holland  indeed i know not what the special occasion was  it is a strange fabric we are so busy weaving out of sensations  let something accidentally pick up an old thread and behold without rhyme or reason we are treated to a whole piece of past experience  stranger yet when but the background is brought back  for we were unconscious of the warp while the details were weaving in  yet reproduce it and all the woof starts suddenly to sight  for atmosphere like a perfume does ghostly service to the past   there is something less mediate in my remembrance of anamidzu  the place has to me a memory of its own that hangs about the room they made mine for an hour  it was certainly a pretty room surprisingly so for such an outoftheway spot  i dare say it was only that to my fellowvoyager of the steamer hurrying homeward to wakamatsu i could hear him in the next apartment making merry over his midday meal  to him the place stood for the last stage on the journey home  but to me it meant more  it marked both the end of the beginning and the beginning of the end  for i had fixed upon this spot for my turning point   it was high noon in my day of travel like the high noon there outside the open shoji  the siesta of sensation had come  thus far the coming events had cast their shadows before and i had followed now they had touched their zenith here in midnoto  henceforth i should see them moving back again toward the east  the dazzling sunshine without pointed the shade within making even the room seem more shadowy than it was  i began to feel creeping over me that strange touch of sadness that attends the supreme moment of success though fulfillment be so trifling a thing as a journeys bourne  great or little real or fancied the feeling is the same in kind  the mind seems strangely like the eye  satisfy some emotion it has been dwelling on and the relaxed nerves at once make you conscious of the complementary tint   then other inns in japan came up regretfully across the blue distance of the intervening years midday halts where an hour of daydream lay sandwiched in between two half days of tramp  and i thought of the companions now so far away  having heard the tune in a minor key these came in as chords of some ampler variation making a kind of symphony of sentiment where i was brought back ever and anon to the simple motif  and the teahouse maidens entered and went out again like mutes in my minds scene   i doubt not the country beyond is all very commonplace but it might be an eldorado from the gilding fancy gave it then  i was told the hills were not high and that eighteen miles on foot would land the traveler at wakamatsu on the sea of japan fronting korea but seeing only the sea and i feel tolerably sure there is nothing there to repay the tramp  when a back has bewitched you in the street it is a fatal folly to try to see the face  you will only be disillusioned if you do     xii   at sea again   i was roused from my midnoto reverie by tidings that our boat was ready and waiting just below the bridge  this was not the steamer which had long since gone on its way but a small boat of the country we had succeeded in chartering for the return voyage  the good innfolk who had helped in the hiring hospitably came down to the landing to see us off   the boat like all japanese small boats was in build between a gondola and a dory and dated from a stage in the art of rowing prior to the discovery that to sit is better than to stand even at work  ours was a small specimen of its class that we might the quicker compass the voyage to nanao which the boatmen averred to be six ri fifteen miles  my estimate prompted perhaps by interest and certainly abetted by ignorance made it about half that distance my argument conclusive enough to myself proved singularly unshaking to the boatmen who would neither abate the price in consequence nor diminish their own allowance of the time to be taken   the boat had sweeps both fore and aft each let in by a hole in the handle to a pin on the gunwale  she was also provided with a sail hoisting on a spar that fitted in amidships  the sail was laced vertically a point by the way for telling a japanese junk from a chinese one at sea for cathay always laces horizontally   whatever our private beliefs on the probable length of the voyage both crew and passengers agreed charmingly in one hope namely that there might be as little rowing about it as possible  our reasons for this differed it is true but as neither side volunteered theirs the difference mattered not  so we slipped down the canal   the hoopskirt fisherdames were just where we had left them some hours before and were still too much absorbed in doing nothing to waste time looking at us  i would gladly have bothered them for a peep at their traps but that it seemed a pity to intrude upon so engrossing a pursuit  besides i feared their apathy might infect the crew  our mariners though hired only for the voyage did not seem averse to making a day of it as it was   one thing however i was bent on stopping to inspect cost what it might in delay or discipline and that was a fishlookout  to have seen the thing from a steamers deck merely whetted desire for nearer acquaintance  to gratify the wish was not difficult for the shore was dotted with them like blind lighthouses off the points  i was for making for the first visible but the boatmen with an eye to economy of labor pointed out that there was one directly in our path round the next headland  so i curbed my curiosity till on turning the corner it came into view  as good luck would have it it was inhabited   we pulled up alongside gave its occupants goodday and asked leave to mount  the fishermen hospitable souls offered no objection  this seemed to me the more courteous on their part after i had made the ascent for there were two of them in the basket and a visitor materially added to the already uneasy weight  but then they were used to it  the rungs of what did for ladder were so far apart as to necessitate making very long legs of it in places which must have been colossal strides for the owners  the higher i clambered the flimsier the structure got  however i arrived not without unnecessary trepidation wormed my way into the basket and crouched down in some uneasiness of mind  the way the thing swayed and wriggled gave me to believe that the next moment we should all be shot catapultwise into the sea  to call it topheavy will do for a word but nothing but experience will do for the sensation  this oscillation strangely enough was not apparent from the sea which reminds me to have noticed differences due the point of view before   i was greeted by an extensive outlook  the shore perhaps a hundred yards away ran shortly into a fisher hamlet and then into a long line of half submerged rocks like successive touches of a skipping stone  beyond the end of this indefinite point and a little to the right of it stood another lookout  this was our only near neighbor though others could be seen in miniature in the distance faint cobwebs against the coast  the bay stretched away on all sides landlocked at last except where to the east an opening gave into the sea of japan   to a dispassionate observer the basket may have been twenty feet above the water  to one in the basket it was considerably higher and its height was emphasized by its seeming insecurity the fishermen were very much at home in it but to me the sensation was such as to cause strained relations between my will to stay and my wish to be gone   but strong feelings are so easily changed into their opposites  i can imagine one of these eyries a delightful setting to certain moods a deserted one should be the place of places for reading a romance  the solitude the strangeness and the cradlelike swing would all compose to shutting out the world  to paddle there some may morning tie ones boat out of sight beneath and climb up into the nest to sit alone half poised in the sky in the midst of the sea should savor of a new sensation  after a little acclimatization it would probably become a passion  certainly with a pipe it should induce a most happy frame of mind for a french novel  the seeming risk of the one situation would serve to point those of the other   the fishermen received my thanks with amiability watched us with stolid curiosity as we pulled off and then relapsed into their former semicomatose condition  their eyrie slipped perspectively astern sank lower and lower and suddenly was lost against the background of the coast   the favoring breeze we were always hoping for never came  this was a bitter disappointment to the boatmen who thus found themselves prevented from more than occasional whiffs of smoking  once we had out the spar and actually hoisted the sail a godsend of an excuse to them for doing nothing for the next few minutes but it shortly had to come down again and on we rowed   our surroundings made a pretty sight  a foreground of water smooth as one could wish had he nowhere to go with illusive catspaws of wind playing coyly all around marking the great shield with dark scratches and never coming near enough to be caught except when the sail was down  fold upon fold of low hills in the distance with hamlets showing here and there at their bases by the sea  and then almost like a part of the picture so subtly did the sensations blend the slow cadenced creak of the sweeps on the gunwale a rhythmic undercurrent of sound   at intervals a wayfarer under sail bound the other way crept slowly by carrying as it seemed to our envious eyes his own capful of wind with him and once a boat bound our way and not under sail passed us not far off  our boatmen were beautifully blind to this defeat till their attention had been specifically called to it for an explanation  they then declared the victor to be lighter than we and this in face of our having chosen their craft for just that quality  what per cent of such statements i wonder do the makers expect to have credited  and if any appreciable amount which is the more sold the artless deceiver or his less simple victim  but we always headed in the direction of nanao and the shores floated by through the long spring afternoon  at last they began to contract upon us till by virtue of narrowing they shot us through the straits in water clear as crystal and then widening again dropped us adrift in wakura bay  though not so beloved of bora the bay was most popular with other fish  schools of porpoises turned cartwheels for our amusement and in spots the water was fairly alive with baby jellyfish  on the left lay monkey island so called from a certain old gentleman who had had a peculiar fondness for those animals  his family of poor relations had disappeared at his death and the island was now chiefly remarkable for a curious clay formation which time had chiseled into cliffs so mimicking a folding screen that they were known by the name  they were perfectly level on top and perpendicular on the sides and as doublefaced as the most matteroffact nicknamer could desire sunset came found us still in the bay and left us there  then the dusk crept up from the black water beneath like an exhalation  it grew chilly   just as we were turning the face of screen cliff a sound of singing reached us ricochetting over the water  it had a plaintive ring such as peasant songs are wont to have and came as we at length made out from a boat homeward bound from the island steering a course at right angles to our own  the voices were those of women and as our courses swept us nearer each other we saw that women alone composed the crew  they had been faggotcutting and the bunches lay piled amidships while fore and aft they plied their oars and sang  the gloaming hid all but sound and sex and threw its veil of romance over the trollers who sent their hearts out thus across the twilight sea  the song no doubt some common ditty gathered a pathos over the water through the night  it swept from one side of us to the other softened with distance lingered in detached strains and then was hushed leaving us once more alone with the night   still we paddled on  it was now become quite dark quite cold quite calm and we were still several good miles off from nanao  at length on turning a headland the lights of the town and its shipping came out one by one from behind a point the advance guards first then the main body and wheeling into line took up their post in a long parade ahead  we began to wonder which were the nearer  there is a touch of mystery in making a harbor at night  in the daytime you see it all wellordered by perspective  but as you creep slowly in through the dark the twinkles of the shipping only doubtfully point their whereabouts  the most brilliant may turn out the most remote and the faintest at first the nearest after all  your own motion alone can sift them into place  if we could voyage through the sea of space it would be thus we might come upon some starcluster and have the same delightful doubt which should become our sun the first   in half an hour they were all about us the nearer revealing by their light the dark bodies connected with them the farther still showing only themselves  the teahouses along the waterfront made a milkyway ahead  we threaded our course between the outlying lights while the milkyway resolved itself into starpointed silhouettes  then skirting along it we drew up at last at a darksome quay and landed yejiro to hunt up an inn  i looked at my watch it was ten oclock  we had not only passed my estimate of time somewhere in the middle of the bay we had exceeded even the boatmens excessive allowance  somehow we had put six hours to the voyage  i began to realize i had hired the wrong men  nor was the voyage yet over if remaining attached to the boat for fully an hour more be entitled to count  for yejiro did not return and the boatmen and i waited   i was glad enough to make pretence at arrival by getting out of the boat on to the quay  the quay was a dismal place  i walked out to the farther end where i found an individual haunting it with an idea to suicide apparently  his course struck me as so appropriate that i felt it would be hollow mockery to argue the point with him  he must have become alarmed at the possibility however for he made off  heaven knows he had small cause to fear i was certainly at that moment no unsympathetic soul   having only come to grief on the quay i next tried a landward stroll with much the same effect  the street or place that gave upon the wharf was as deserted as the wharf itself  half the houses about it were dark as tombs the other half showed only glimmering shoji taunting me by the sounds they suffered to escape or by a chance silhouette thrown for a moment upon the paper wall by some one within  and now and then as if still further to enhance the solitude a pair passed me by in low selfsuited talk   still no sign of the boy  every few minutes i would walk back to the boat and linger beside it till i could no longer stand the mute reproach of the baskets huddled in a little pile on the stones poor houseless immigrants that they were  and from time to time i made a touching spectacle of myself by pulling out my watch and peering by what feeble light i could find anxiously at its face to make out the hour   at last yejiro turned up in the company of a policeman  this official however proved to be accompanying him in a civil capacity and changing into a guide led the way through several dark alleywaysto an inn of forbidding face but better heart  there did we eventually dine or breakfast for by that time it was become the next day     xiii  on the noto highway  on the morrow morning we took the road in kuruma the road proper as yejiro called it for it was the main bond between noto and the rest of japan  this was the nearest approach it had to a proper name a circumstance which showed it not to be of the first importance  for in japan all the old arteries of travel had distinctive names the nakasendo or midmountain road the tokaido or eastern sea road and so forth  like certain other country relations their importance was due to their city connections not to their own local magnitude  for when well out of sight of the town they do not hesitate to shrink to anything but imposing proportions  in mid career you might often doubt yourself to be on so celebrated a thoroughfare  but they are always delightful to the eye as they wander through the country now bosomed in trees among the mountains now stalking between their own long files of pine or cryptomeria across the welltilled plains this one had but few sentinels to line it in the open but lost little in picturesqueness for its lack of pomp  it was pretty enough to be very good company itself   it was fairly patronized by wayfarers to delight the soul cheerful bodies who though journeying for business had plenty of time to be happy and radiated content  take it as you please the japanese people are among the very happiest on the face of the globe which makes them among the most charming to meet   nothing notable beyond such pleasing generalities of path and people lay in our way till we came to a place where a steep and perfectly smooth clay bank shot from a spur of the hills directly into the thoroughfare  three urchins were industriously putting this to its proper use coasting down it that is on the seats of what did them for breeches  an overgrownup regard for my own trousers alone deterred me from instantly following suit  no such scruples prevented my abetting them however to the extent of a trifling bribe for a repetition  for they had stopped abashed as soon as they found they had a public  regardless of maternal consequences i thus encouraged the sport  but after all was it so much a bribe as an entrance fee to the circus or better yet a sort of subsidy from an exmember of the fraternity  surely if adverse physical circumstances preclude profession in person the next best thing is to become a noble patron of art   from this accidental instance i judged that boys in noto had about as good a time of it as boys elsewhere the next sight we chanced upon made me think that possibly women did not  we had hardly parted from the coasters on dry ground when we met in the way with a lot of women harnessed to carts filled with various merchandise which they were toilsomely dragging along towards nanao  it was not so picturesque a sight as its sex might suggest  for though the women were naturally not aged and some had not yet lost all comeliness of feature this womanliness made the thing the more appealing  noto was evidently no eden since the local adam had thus contrived to shift upon the local eve so large a fraction of the primal curse it was as bad as the north of germany  the female porters we had been offered on the threshold of the province were merely symptomatic of the state of things within  i wonder what my young japanese friend the new light to whom i listened once on board ship while he launched into a diatribe upon the jinrikisha question the degrading practice as he termed it of using men for horsesi wonder i say what he would have said to this  he was a quixotic youth at the time returning from abroad where he had picked up many new ideas his proposed applications of them did him great credit more than they are likely to win among the class for whom they were designed a cent and two thirds a mile to be had for the running for it is as yet too glittering a prize to be easily foregone   of the travel in question we were treated to fortythree miles worth that day by relays of runners  the old men fell off gradually to be replaced by new ones giving our advance the character of a wave where the particles merely oscillated but the motion went steadily on  the oscillations however were not insignificant in amount  some of the men must have run their twentyfive miles or more broken only by short halts and this at a dogtrot changed of course to a slower pull on bad bits and when going up hill  a fine show of endurance with all allowances in this fashion we bowled along through a smiling agricultural landscape relieved by the hills upon the left and with the faintest suspicion not amounting to a scent of the sea out of sight on the right  the day grew more beautiful with every hour of its age the blue depths above tenanted by castles of cloud granted fancy eminent domain to wander where she would  even the road below gave free play to its caprice and meandered like any stream inquisitively through the valley visiting all the villages within reach after a whimsical fashion of its own  all about it meadows were tilling and the whole landscape breathed an air of wellestablished age amid the lustiness of youth  the very farmhouses looked to have grown where they stood as indeed the upper part of them had  for from the thatch of their roofs deep bedded in mud sprang all manner of plants that made of the eaves gardens in the air  the ridgepoles stood transformed into beds of flowers their long tufts of grass waved in the wind the blossoms nodding their heads amicably to the passersby  what a contented folk this should be whose very homes can so vegetate  surely a pretty conceit it is for a peasantry thus to sleep every night under the sod and yet awake each morning to life again  at the threshold of kaga we turned abruptly to the left and attacked the pass leading over into etchiu  as we wound our way up the narrow valley day left the hollows to stand on rosy tiptoe on the sides of the hills the better to take flight into the clouds  there it lingered a little folding the forests about with its roseate warmth  even the stern old pines flushed to the tips of their shaggy branches while here and there a bit of open turned a glowing cheek full to the goodnight kiss of the sun  and over beyond it all rose the twilight bow in purplish insubstantiality creeping steadily higher and higher above the pineclad heights   i reached the top before the jinrikisha and as a sort of reward of merit scrambled a little farther up the steep slope to the left  from here i commanded the pass especially that side of it i had not come up  the corkscrew of the road carried the eye most pleasingly down with it  i could see a teahouse a few hundred feet below and beyond it at a much lower level a bridge  beyond this came a comparatively flat stretch and then the road disappeared into a gorge  here and there it was pointed with people toiling slowly up  of the encircling hills the shoulders alone were visible  while i was still surveying the scene the jinrikisha men one after the other emerged from the gulf out of sight on the right and proceeded to descend into the one on the left  when the last had well passed and i had tickled myself with the sense of abandonment i scrambled back took a jump into the road and slipped down after them  the last had waited for me at the teahouse and stowing me in started to rattle down the descent  the road unlike us seemed afraid of its own speed and brought itself up every few hundred feet with a round turn  about each of these we swung only to dash down the next bend and begin the oscillation over again  the men were in fine excitement and kept up a shouting out of mere delight  in truth we all enjoyed the dissipated squandering in a few minutes of the energy of position we had so laboriously gained by toiling up the other side  over the bridge we rattled bowled along the level stretch and then into the gorge and once more down till in another ten minutes the last fall had shot us out into the plain with mental momentum enough to carry us hilariously into imaisurugi where we put up for the night   at breakfast the next morning the son of the house an engaging lad presented me with an unexpected dish three fossil starfish on a platter  they were found he said in numbers on the sides of the hill hard by a fact which would go to prove that this part of japan has been making in later geologic time  indeed i take it the better part of etchiu has thus been cast up by the sea and now lies between its semicircle of peaks and its crescent of beach like a young moon in the western sky a new bay of ricefield in the old bays arms we had come by way of its ocean terminator along its fringe of sand we were now to cross its face   as we pulled out from the town and entered the great plain of paddyfields it was like adventuring ourselves in some vast expanse of ocean cut up only by islets of trees  so level the plain and so still the air on this warm may morning the clumps shimmered in mirage in the distance like things at sea  farmhouses and peasants at work in the fields loomed up as ships past which we slowly tacked and then dropped them out of sight behind  and still no end of the same infinite level  new clumps rose doubtfully afar took on form and vanished in their turn  our men rolled along at a good sixknot gait and mile went to join mile with little perceptible effect on the surroundings  only the misty washes of the mountains glistening in spots with snow came out to the south and then swung slowly round like the sun himself  occasionally we rolled into a village of which i duly inquired the distance from the last known point  one of these takaoka was a very large place and stretched a mile or more along the road with ramifications to the side   at last we neared some foothills which we crossed by a baby pass and from the farther side looked off against the distant tateyama range  descending again another stretch of plain brought us to toyama the old feudal capital of the province  it is still a bustling town and does a brisk business i was told in patent medicine which is hawked over japan generally and cures everything  but the former splendor of the place has left it forever  the rooms in the inn where neighboring daimyos were wont to rest on their journeys through are still superb with carving lacquer and paintings but no daimyo will ever again hold his traveling court before their tokonoma the man perchance may again tarry there but the manner of it all has gone to join the past  now he who wills may ensconce himself in the daimyos corner and fancy himself a feudal lord nor will the breeding of those about him disillusion his midday dream   the castle they have turned into a public school and as i strolled into its close i met bands of boys in foreign lyceelike uniform trooping out chubbyfaced youngsters in stiff visored caps  girls there were too in knots of twos and threes pretty little things in semieuropean dress their hair done a la grecque stuck with a single flower who stopped in their chatter to stare at me  to think that the feudal times are to them as much a tale as the making of the plain itself where its ruins stand already mantled with green    xiv   the harinoki toge   there now befell us a sad piece of experience the result of misplaced confidence in the guidebook  ours was the faith a simple public pins upon print  le journal cest un jeune homme as balzac said and even the best of guidebooks as this one really was may turn outa cover to many shortcomings   its description of the crossing of the harinoki toge implied a generality of performances that carried conviction  if he who read might not run he had at least every assurance given him that he would be able to walk  that the writer might not only have been the first to cross but the last as well was not evident from the text  nor was it there apparent that the path which was spoken of as difficult and described as hanging to the precipitous side of the cliff might have become tired of hanging thus for the sake of travelers who never came and have given itself over at last to the abyss   in the book the dead past still lived an everyouthful present in truth however the path at the time of the account some twelve years before had just been made by the samurai of kaga to join them to the capital  since then the road by the sea had been built and the harinoki pass had ceased to be in practice what it purported to be in print  it had in a double sense reverted to type  there was small wonder at this for it was a very cerberus of a pass at best with three heads to it  the farthest from etchiu was the harinoki toge proper   the guidebook and a friend had gone over one season and the guidebook had induced another friend to accompany him again the year after  whether there were any unpersonally conducted ascents i am not sure  but at any rate all this happened in the early days for years the harinoki toge had had rest   we ought to have taken warning from the general skepticism we met with at toyama when we proposed the pass  but with the fatal faith of a man in his guidebook we ignored the native forebodings  besides there were just people enough who knew nothing about it and therefore thought it could be done to encourage us in our delusion  accordingly we left toyama after lunch in the best of spirits in jinrikisha for kamidaki or upper fall to which there professed to be a jinrikisha road  the distance was three ri seven miles and a half  before we had gone one of them the road gave out and left us to tack on foot in paths through the ricefields which in one long inclination kept mounting before us  just before reaching the village a huge tree in full faint purple bloom showed up a little to the left under a sudden attack of botanical zeal i struck across lots to investigate and after much tacking among the paddy dykes found to my surprise on reaching it that the flowers came from a huge wistaria that had coiled itself up the tree  the vine must have been at least six feet round at the base and had a body horribly like an enormous boa that swung from branches high in air  the animal look of the vegetable parasite was so lifelike that one both longed and loathed to touch it at the same time   at kamidaki after the usual delay we found porters who echoed the doubts of the people of toyama and went with us protesting  half an hour after this we came to the jindogawa a river of variable importance  it looked to have been once the bed of a mighty glacier that should have swept grandly round from unseen fastnesses among the hills  at the time of our visit it was for the most part a waste of stones through which two larger and several lesser streams were in much worry to find their way to the sea  the two larger were just big enough to be unfordable so a charon stationed at each ferried the country folk across  at the smaller after picking out the likeliest spots we took off our shoes and socks and waded and then upon the other side sat some time on stones illmodeled to that end to draw our things on again   our way now led up the left bankthe right bank according to aquatic convention which pleasingly supposes you to be descending the stream  it lay along a plateau which i doubt not to have been the rivers prehistoric bed so evidently had the present one been chiseled out of it to a further depth of over fifty feet  at first the path struck inland astutely making a chord to the rivers bow an unsuspected sign of intelligence in a path  it was adventurous too for soon after coming out above the brink it began upon acrobatic feats in which it showed itself nationally proficient a narrow aqueduct had been cut out of the side of the cliff and along its outer embankment which was two feet wide the path proceeded to balance  the aqueduct had given way in spots which caused the path to take to some rickety boards put there for its benefit  after this exhibition of daring it descended to the stream to rise again later meanwhile night came on and the river bottom began to fill with what looked to be mist but was in reality smoke  this gave a weird effect to the now mountainous settings  into the midst of it we descended to a suspension bridge of twisted strands of the wistaria vine ballasted at the ends with boulders piled from the rivers bed  the thing swayed cheerfully as we passed over   on the top of the opposite bank stood perched a group of houses not enough to make a village and far too humble to support an inn but in their midst rose a welltodo temple where according to the guidebook good lodging was to be had  it may indeed be so  for our part we were not so much as granted entry  an acolyte who parleyed with us through the darkness reported the priest away on business and refused to let us in on any terms  several bystanders gathered during the interview and had it not been for one of them we might have been there yet  from this man we elicited the information that another hamlet lay half a mile further up whose headman he thought might be willing to house us  we followed straight on until some buildings showed in still blacker silhouette against the black sky and there after some groping in the dark and a second uncanny conversation through a loopholefor the place was already boarded up for the nightwe were finally taken in   the house was a generous instance of a mountain farmhouse the floors were innocent of mats and the rooms otherwise pitiably barnlike  yet an air of largeness distinguished the whole  it was clearly the home of a man of standing in his community one who lived amply the only life he knew  you felt you already knew the man from his outer envelope  and this in some sort prepared me for a little scene i was shortly to witness  for while waiting for yejiro to get dinner ready i became aware that something was going on in what stood for hall and on pushing the shoji gently apart i beheld the whole household at evening prayers before an altar piece lighted by candles and glittering with gilded buddhas and bronze lotus flowers  the father intoned the service from a kind of breviary and the family joined from time to time in the responses  there was a sincerity and a sweet simplicity about the act that went to my heart and held me there  at the close of it the family remained bowed while the intoner reverently put out the lights and folded the doors upon the images within  locked in that little case lay all the luxury which the family could afford and to which the rest of the house was stranger  there is something touching in any heartfelt belief and something pathetic too   this peaceful parenthesis was hardly past before the trials of travel intruded themselves again  the porters proved refractory  they had agreed to come only as far as they could and now they refused to proceed further  here was a pretty pass  to turn back now was worse than not to have set out at all  besides we had not yet even come in sight of the enemy  yejiro reasoned with them for some hours in the kitchen occasionally pausing for lack of further argument to report his want of progress  it seemed the men valued their lives above a money consideration strangely enough  they made no bones about it the thing was too dangerous  the streams they declared impassable and the charcoal burners the only men who knew the path  yejiro at once had these witnesses subpoenaed and by good luck one of them came who on being questioned repeated all the porters had said  but yejiros blood was up and he boldly played his last trump  he threatened them with the arm of the law a much more effective weapon in japan than elsewhere  he proposed in fine to walk three ri down the valley to the nearest police station and fetch a policeman who should compel them to move on  it is perhaps open to doubt whether even a japanese policemans omnipotence would have extended so far  but the threat though not conclusive had some effect  this strategic stroke i only learnt of later and i laughed heartily when i did  that night however it was no laughing matter and i began to have doubts myself  but it was no time for misgivings so i went in to help  the circle round the kitchen fire was not a cheerful sight  to have the courage of ones convictions is rare enough in this weak world but to have the courage of ones doubts is something i uncover to  to furnish pluck for a whole company including ones self to hearten others without letting them see how sore in need of heartening is the heartener touches my utmost admiration  if only another would say to him that he might believe the very things he does not believe as he says them to that other they then might at least seem true  ignorance saved me  had i known what they did i should have agreed with them on the spot  as it was i did what i could and went back to my own room the prey of somewhat lonely thoughts     xv  toward the pass  i was waked by good news  the porters had to a certain extent come round  if we would halve their burdens by doubling their number they would make an attempt on the pass or rather they would go on as far as they could  this was a great advance  to be already moving implies a momentum of the mind which carries a man farther than he means  i acquiesced at once  the recruits consisted of the master of the househis father the officiator at family prayers had retired from the cares of this worldand a peasant of the neighborhood  the charcoal burners were too busy with their own affairs  from the sill as i put on my boots i watched with complacence the cording of the loads and then with quite a lightsome gait followed the lengthened file out into the street  one after the other we tramped forth past the few houses of the place whose people watched us go with the buoyant tread of those about to do great things and so out into the open   the path appeared very well  it trotted soberly along across a mountain moor until it came out above the river  it then wound up stream clinging to the slope several hundred feet above the valley bottom  it was precipitous in places but within reason and i was just coming to consider the accounts exaggerated when it descended to the river bed at a point where a butt of neve stuck a foot into the shingle  the stream which had looked a thread from above turned out a torrent when we stood upon its brink  the valley was nothing but river bed a mass of boulders of all sizes through the midst of which the stream plunged with deafening roar and so deep that fording was out of the question  a mans life would not have been worth a rush in it   we followed up the boulder bank in search of a more propitious spot  then we followed down again  each place promised at a distance and baulked hope at hand  at last in despair we came to a halt opposite the widest and shallowest part and after no end of urging one of the porters stripped and armed with his pole ventured in  the channel lay well over to the farther side thrice he got to its nearer edge and thrice he turned back as the rush of water became too great  his life was worth too much to him he said not unnaturally for him to throw it away  yet cross the stream we must or return ignominiously for the path we had so far followed had fallen over the cliff in front   we improved the moments of reflection to have lunch  while we were still discussing viae and viands and had nearly come to the end of both we suddenly spied a string of men defiling slowly down through the wide boulder desert on the other side  we all rose and hailed them  they were so far away that at first they failed to hear us and even when they heard they stared vacantly about them like men who hear they know not what  when at last they caught sight of us we beckoned excitedly  they consulted apparently and then one of them came down to the edge of the stream  the torrent made so much noise that our men could make themselves intelligible only in part and that by bawling at the top of their lungs  through the envoy they invited the band to string themselves across the stream and so pass our things over  the man shook his head  we rose to fabulous sums and still he repeated his pantomime  it then occurred to yejiro that a certain place lower down might possibly be bridged and beckoning to the man to follow he led the way to the spot in mind  a boulder twothirds way in stream seemed to offer a pier  he tried to shout his idea but the roar of the torrent narrow though it was drowned his voice so writing on a piece of paper what will you take to build us a bridge he wrapped the paper round a stone and flung it over  after reading this missive the spokesman held a consultation with his friends and a bargain was struck  for the huge sum of two yen a dollar and a half they agreed to build us a bridge and at once set off up the mountain side for a tree   the men it seemed were a band of woodcutters who had wintered as was their custom in a hut at kurobe which was this side of the harinoki toge and were just come out from their hibernation they were now on their way to ashikura where they belonged to report to their headman obtain supplies and start to return on the aftermorrow  it was a twodays journey either out or in   bridges therefore came of their trade  the distance across the boulder bed was considerable and as they toiled slowly up the face of the opposite mountain they looked like so many ants  picking out a trunk they began to drag it down  by degrees they got it to the river bed and thence eventually to the edge of the stream  to lay it was quite a feat of engineering  with some pieces of driftwood which they found lying about they threw a span to the big boulder and from the boulder managed to get the trunk across  then with rope which they carried at their girdles they lashed the whole together until they had patched up a very workmanlike affair we trod across in triumph  with praiseworthy care lest it should be swept away they then took the thing all down again   such valuable people were not idly to be parted with  here was a rare chance to get guides  when however we approached them on the point they all proved so conscientious about going home first that the attempt failed  but they gave us some important information on the state of the streams ahead and the means of crossing them and we separated with much mutual goodwill   for my part i felt as if we had already arrived somewhere  i little knew what lay beyond  while i was plodding along in this blissfully ignorant state of mind communing with a pipe the path which had frisked in and out for some time among the boulders suddenly took it into its head to scale a cliff on the left  it did this as it seemed to me without provocation after a certain reckless fashion of its own  the higher it climbed the more foolhardy it got till the downlook grew unpleasant  then it took to coquetting with the gulf on its right until as i knew would happen it lost its head completely and fell over the edge  the gap had been spanned by a few loose boards  over the makeshift we all one after the other gingerly crawled each waiting his turn with the abyss gaping on his side for the one in front to move on   we had not yet recovered from the shock when we came to another place not unlike the first  here again the path had given way and a couple of logs had been lashed across the inner elbow of the cliff  we crossed this by balancing ourselves for the first two steps by the stump of a bush that jutted out from a crevice in the rock for the next two we touched the cliff with the tips of our fingers for the last two we balanced ourselves alone   for the time being the gods of high places had tempted us enough for the path now descended again to the dry bed of the stream and there for a certain distance tripped along in all soberness giving me the chance to look about me  the precipitous sides of the mountains that shut in the narrow valley were heavily masked in forest and for some time past the ravines that scored their sides had been patched with snow  with each new mile of advance the patches grew larger and merged into one another stretching toward the stream  we now began to meet snow on the path  in the mean time from one cause and another insensibly i fell behind  the others passed on out of sight   the path having lulled me into a confiding unconcern started in seeming innocence of purpose to climb again  its ingenuousness but prefaced a malicious surprise  for of a sudden unmasking a corner it presented itself in profile ahead a narrow ledge notched in naked simplicity against the precipice  things look better slightly veiled besides it is more decent even in a path  in this case the shamelessness was earnest of the undoing  for on reaching the point in view and turning it i stood confronted by a sight sorry indeed  the path beyond had vanished  far below out of sight over the edge lay the torrent unscalable the cliff rose above and a line of fossil footprints leading across the face of the precipice in the debris alone marked where the path had been  spectres they seemed of their former selves  crusoe could not have been more horrified than was i   not to have come suggested itself as the proper solution unfortunately an impracticable one and being there to turn back was inadmissible  so i took myself in hand and started  for the first few steps i was far too much given up to considering possibilities  i thought how a single misstep would end  i could see my footing slip feel the consciousness that i was gone the dull thuds from point to point as what remained of me bounded beyond the visible edge down down      and after that what  how long before the porters missed me and came back in search  would there be any trace to tell what had befallen and then yejiro returning alone to tokyo to reportlost on the dragon peak  each time i almost felt my foot give way as i put it down right before left left before right   then i realized that this inopportune flirting with fate must stop that i must give over dallying with sensations or it would soon be all over with me  i was falling a prey to the native loreleifor all these spots in japan have their familiar devilssubjectively as befits a modern man  i numbed sensibility as best i could and cared only to make each step secure  between the nirvana within and the nirvana below it was a sorry hell   in midcareer the path made an attempt to recover but relapsed to further footprints in the sand  at last it descended to a brook i knelt to drink and on getting up again saw my pockethandkerchief whisking merrily away down stream  i gave chase but in vain for though it came to the surface once or twice to tantalize me it was gone before i could seize it  so i gave over the pursuit reflecting that after all it might have fared worse with me  if the lorelei had hoped to turn my head i was well quit of my handkerchief for her only trophy   shortly after this the main stream divided into two and the left branch which we followed led up to a gorgebeyond a doubt the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet  i do not remember a landscape more ghastly  not a tree not a blade of grass not even decent earth in the whole prospect  apparently the place had been flayed alive and sulphur had then been poured into the sore  thirty years before a cataclysm had occurred here  the side of one of the mountains had slid bodily into the valley  the debris by damming up the stream caused a freshet which swept everything before it and killed quantities of folk lower down the valley the place itself has never recovered to this day   although the stream here was a baby to the one below it was large enough to be impassable to the natural man  from our woodcutter friends however we had learned of the leavings of a bridge upon which in due time we came and putting the parts of it in place we passed successfully over   we now began to enter the snow in good earnest incipient glacier snow treacherously honeycombed  it made however more agreeable walking than the boulders  the path had again become precipitous and kept on mounting till of a sudden it landed us upon an amphitheatral arena dominated by high jagged peaks  one unbroken stretch of snow covered the plateau and at the centre of the wintry windingsheet a cluster of weatherbeaten huts appealed pitiably to the eye  they were the buildings of the riuzanjita hotsprings in summer a sort of secular monastery for pilgrims to the dragon peak  they were tenanted now we had been told by a couple of watchmen  we struck out with freer strides while the moon which had by this time risen high enough to overtop the wall of peaks watched us with an ashen face as in single file we moved across the waste of level white      xvi  riuzanjita  we made for the main hut a low mousecolored shanty fast asleep and deep drifted in snow  the advance porter summoned the place and the summons drew to what did for door a man as mouselike as his mansion  he had about him a subdued monkish demeanor that only partially hid an alertness withina secular monk befitting the spot  he showed himself a kindly body and after he had helped the porters off with their packs led the way into the room in which he and his mate hibernated  it was a room very much in the rough boards for walls for ceiling for floor its only furnishing a fire  it was the best of furnishing in our eyes and we hasted to squat round it in a circle in attitudes of extreme devotion for it was bitter cold  the monkish watchman threw a handful more twigs on the embers out of a cheerful hospitality to his guests   the fireplace was merely a hole in the floor according to japanese custom and the smoke found its way out as best it could  but there was very little of it usually indeed there is none for charcoal is the common combustible  a cauldron hung by iron bars jointed together from the gloom above  it was twilight in the room  already the day without was fading fast and even at high noon none too much of it could find a way into the building now half buried under the snow  a second watchman sat muffled in shadow on the farther side of the fire  he made his presence known from time to time by occasional sympathetic gutturals or by the sudden glow of a bit of charcoal which he took out of the embers with a pair of chopstick fireirons to relight his pipe  the talk naturally turned upon our expedition with yejiro for spokesman and from that easily slid into the allimportant question of guides  our inquiries on this head elicited nothing but doubt  we tried at first to get the watchmen to go  but this they positively refused to do  they could not leave their charge in the first place they said and for the second they did not know the path  we asked if there was no one who did  there was a hunter they said near by who was by way of knowing the road  a messenger was sent at once to fetch him   in the mean time if they showed themselves skeptical about our future they proved most sympathetic over our past  our description of the friday footprints especially brought out much fellowfeeling  they knew the spot well they said and it was very bad  in fact it was called the oni ga jo or place of many devils for its fearfulness it would be better they added after the mountain opening on the tenth of june   mountain opening said i to yejiro what is that  is it anything like the river opening for the japanese words seemed to imply not a physical but a formal unlocking of the hills like the annual religious rite upon the sumidagawa in tokyo  such it appeared it was  for the tenth of june he said was the date of the mountainclimbing festival  yearly on that day all the sacred peaks are thrown open to a pious public for ascent  a procession of pilgrims headed by a flautist and a bellman wend their way to the summit and there encamp  for three days the ceremony lasts after which the mountains are objects of pilgrimage till the twentyeighth day of august  for the rest of the year the summits are held to be shut the gods being then in conclave to disturb whom were the height of impiety  a pleasing coincidence of duty and pleasure that the scaling of the peaks should be enjoined to pilgrims at the times of easiest ascent  preparatory to the procession all the paths of approach are repaired  it was this repairing to which the watchmen referred and which concerned our secular selves   our difficulties began to be explained  we were very close to committing sacrilege  we had had it is true no designs on the peaks but were we wholly guiltless in attempting so much as the passes in this the close season  apparently not  at all events we were a month ahead of time in our visit which in itself was of questionable etiquette   at this point the messenger sent to find the hunter returned without his man  evidently the hunter was a person who meant to stand well with his gods or else he was himself a myth   distraught in mind and restless in body i got up and went out into the great snow waste  the sunset afterglow was just fading into the moonshine  the effect upon the pure white sheet before me was indescribably beautiful  the warm tint of the last of day as it waned dissolved imperceptibly into the cold lustre of the night as if some alchemist were subtly changing the substance while he kept the form  for a new spirit was slowly possessing itself of the very shapes that had held the old and the snow looked very silent very cold very ghostly glistening in its silver sheen   the sky was bitterly clear inhumanly cold  to call it frosty were to humanize it  its expanse stretched far more frozen than the frozen earth  indeed the night sky is always awful  for the most part we forget it for the kindlier prospect of the cradling trees and the whispers of the wind and the perfumes of the fields the sights and sounds that even in slumber stir with life and the nearer thrust away the real horror of the far  but the awe speaks with insistence when the foreground itself is dead   shivering i returned to the fire and human companionship the conversation again rolled upon precipices which it appeared were more numerous before than behind and casualties among the woodcutters not unknown in consequence  there was one place they said where if you slipped you went down a ri two miles and a half it was here a woodcutter had been lost three days before  the ri must have been a flight of fancy since it far exceeded the height of the pass above the sea  but a handsome discount from the statement left an unpleasant balance to contemplate   this death had frightened one of the watchmen badly as it may well have done  the facts were these  separated from the hot springs of riuzanjita by two passes lay a valley uninhabited except for two bands of woodcutters who had built themselves a couple of huts one on either side the stream in which they lived the year round it was these huts that went by the name of kurobe  during the winter they were entirely cut off from the outside world  as soon as practicable in the spring a part of each band was accustomed to come out over the passes descend to ashikura and return with provisions and money   now this year before the men in the valley had thought it time to attempt the passes a solitary woodcutter came up to the hot springs from below and in spite of warning from the watchmen started alone for kurobe  on the afternoon of the third day after his departure the regular band turned up at riuzanjita having left kurobe it seemed that morning  they passed the night at the hot springs hut and on being questioned by the watchmen about the man of three days before they said they had heard of no such person  it turned out to the horror of both parties that he had never reached kurobe  it was only the night before we arrived that the woodcutters had been there and the affair was still terribly fresh in the watchmans thoughts in fact it was the identical band that had built us our bridge  these men were thoroughly equipped for snowclimbing and had come over safely and yet as it was the head man of the other band at kurobe had been afraid to cross with them and had instead gone all the way round by the river and the sea a very long and rough journey  fatal accidents the watchmen said were of yearly occurrence on the passes   and all this was only the way to kurobe  beyond it lay the harinoki toge  that pass no one had yet crossed this year  and at intervals during the talk the watchman repeated excitedly as a sort of refrain it is impossible to go onit is impossible to go on  this talk a part of which i understood was not very heartening following as it did the personal experience of the oni ga jo the prospect began to look too uncertain in its conclusion and too certain in its premises to be inviting  if professionals properly accoutred found crossing so dangerous a matter the place was hardly one for unprovided amateurs  these mountaineers were not tied together but wore over their waraji or straw sandals a set of irons called kanakajiki  we were shown some of them which had been left by the woodcutters against their return  they were skeleton sandals iron bands shod with three spikes  they looked like instruments of torture from the middle ages and indeed were said to be indispensable against backsliding   on the other hand one blondin feat over the devil place was enough for me  to take it on the road rather than turn back was one thing to start to take it in cold blood another  i had had quite enough of balancing and doubt  so i asked if there was no other way out we might they said go to arimine   and how was the road  oh the road was good they answered cheerily   could we get a guide  apparently we could not for an awkward pause ensued until after some suspense the bigger of the two watchmen he that sat in the shadow of the corner volunteered to pilot us himself and he added we should not have to start betimes as the snow would not be fit to travel on till the sun had melted the crust   upon this doubly comforting conclusion i bade them goodnight and betook me to the celllike room allotted me to sleep     xvii   over the snow   when yejiro pushed the shoji and the amado night shutters apart in the morning he disclosed a bank of snow four feet deep not a snowfall over night but the relic of the winter  i found myself in a snow grotto beyond which nothing was visible  he then imparted to me the cheerful news that the watchman had changed his mind and now refused to set out with us  it was too late in the day to start the man said which in view of his having informed us only the night before that the snow would not be fit to travel on till this very hour was scarcely logical  the trouble lay not in the way but in the will  the man had repented him of his promise  things look differently as certainties in the morning from what they do as possibilities overnight  fortunately he proved amenable to importunity and finally consented to go  his fellow was much worried and followed him distressfully to the outer threshold whence in perturbation of spirit he watched us depart calling out pathetically to his mate to be very careful of himself  his almost motherly solicitude seemed to me more comical at the time than it came to seem later   the sky was without a fleck of cloud and as we struck out across the snow i feared at first for my eyes so great was the glare for i had neither goggles nor veil  in fact we were as unprepared a troop as ever started on such an expedition  we had not a pair of foot spikes nor a spiked pole to the lot of us   the jagged peaks of the valleys wall notched the sky in vivid relief their sharp teeth biting the blue  we below were blinking  luckily before very long we had crossed the level and were attacking the wall and once on it the glare lessened for we were facing the south and the slant of the slope took off from the directness of the suns rays  the higher we rose the greater the tilt became  the face of the slope was completely buried in snow except where the aretes stuck through for the face was well wrinkled  the angle soon grew unpleasant to visage and certainly looked to have exceeded the limit of stable equilibrium  in midascent as we were winding cautiously up a porter slipped  he stopped himself however and was helped on to his feet again by his fellow behind  the bad bit was preface to a worse effect round the corner for on turning the arete we came upon a snow slope like a gigantic houseroof  it was as steep as you please and disappeared a few hundred feet below over the edge into the abyss  across and up this the guide after looking about him struck out and i followed  the snow was in a plastic state and at each step i kicked my toes well in so wedging my footing  the view down was very unnerving  it soon grew so bad i fixed my thought solely on making each step secure and went slowly which was much against my inclination  in this manner we tacked gradually upward in zigzags some forty feet apart each of us improving the footprints of his predecessor   after a short eternity we came out at the top  i threw myself upon the snow and when i had sufficiently recovered my breath asked the guide with what i meant for sarcasm whether that was his idea of  a good road he owned that it was the worst bit on the way but he somewhat grudgingly conceded it a gake i sat corrected but in the interest of any future wanderer i submit the following definition of a gake which if not strictly accurate at least leans to the right side  if the cliff overhang it is a gake but if a plumb line from the top fall anywhere within the base it is no longer a gake but a good road  on the other side the slope was more hospitable  even trees wintered just below the crest their great gaunt trunks thrust deep into the snow  we glissaded down the first few hundred feet till we brought up standing at the head of an incipient gorge likewise smothered in snow  round the boles of the trees the snow had begun to thaw which gave me a chance to measure its depth by leaning over the rim of the cup and thrusting my pole down as far as i could reach  the point of it must have been over seven feet from the surface and it touched no bottom  my investigations took time enough to put a bend of the hollow between me and the others and when at last i looked up they were nowhere to be seen  as i trudged after them alone i felt like that coming historical character the last man on our then frozen earth   for some minutes past a strange faraway musical note like the murmur of running water had struck my ear and yet all about everything looked dead  of animate or even inanimate pulsation there was no sign  one unbroken sheet of snow stretched as far as i could see in which stood the great trees like mummies  still the sound continued seeming to come from under my feet  i stopped and kneeling down put my ear to the crust and there as distinct as possible i heard the wimpling of a baby brook crooning to itself under its thick white blanket  here then was the cradle of one of those streams that later would become such an ugly customer to meet  it was babily innocent now and the one living thing beside myself on this may day in the great snowsheeted solitude   perhaps it was the brook that had undermined the snow  at all events soon after i overtook the others the guide fearing to trust to it farther suddenly struck up again to the left  we all followed remonstrating  we had no sooner got up than we went down again the other side and this picketfence style of progress continued till we emerged upon the top of a certain spur which commanded a fine view of gorges  unfortunately we ourselves were on top of some of them  the guide reconnoitered both sides for a descent pushing his way through a thick growth of dwarf bamboo and brought up each time on the edge of an impassable fall to the stream below  at last he took to the arete  it was masked by trees for some distance and then came out as a bare knife edge of rock and earth  down it we scrambled till the slope to the side became passable  this was now much less steep although still steep enough for the guide to make me halt behind a tree for fear of the stones dislodged by those behind  these came down past us like cannonballs ricochetting by big bounds   at the bottom we reached the stream and beside it we halted for lunch  just below our resting place another stream joined our own both coming down forbiddinglooking valleys shut in by savage peaks  on the delta between the waters we made out a band of hunters three of them tarrying after an unsuccessful chase  this last was a general inference rather than an observed fact   the spot was ideal for picturesque purposesthe water clear as crystal and the sunshine sparkling  but otherwise matters went ill with us  our extempore guide had promised us over his own fire the evening before a single day of it to arimine  on the road his estimate of the time needed had increased alarmingly  from direct questioning it now appeared that he intended to camp out on the mountain opposite whose snowy slopes were painfully prophetic of what that night would be  besides this meant another day of it to arimine and even when we reached arimine we were nowhere and i was scant of time  we had already lost three days if we kept on i foresaw the loss of more  it was very disheartening to turn back but it had to be done   our object now was to strike the ashikura trail and follow it down  the guide however was not sure of the path so we hailed the hunters  one of them came across the delta to the edge of the stream within shouting distance and from him we obtained knowledge of the way   at first the path was unadventurous enough though distressingly rough  in truth it was no path at all it was an abstract direction  it led straight on regardless of footing and we followed now wading through swamps now stumbling over roots now ducking from whiplike twigs that cut us across the face until at last we emerged above the stream and upon a scene as grandly desolate as the most morbid misanthrope might wish  a mass of boulders of all sizes from a barn to a cobblestone completely filled a chasm at the base of a semicircular wall of castellated clay cliffs  into the pit we descended  the pinnacles above were impressively high and between them were couloirs of debris that looked to us to be as perpendicular as the cliffs  up one of these breakneck slides the guide pointed for our path  porters and all we demurred  path of course there was none there was not even an apology for a suspicion that any one had ever been up or down the place  we felt sure there must be some other way out  the more we searched however the less we found  the stream which was an impassable torrent barred exit below on our side by running straight into the wall of rock  the slide was an ugly climb to contemplate yet we looked at it some time before we accepted the inevitable   when in desperation we finally made up our minds we began picking our dubious way up among a mass of rocks that threatened to become a stone avalanche at any moment  none of us liked it but none of us knew how little the others liked it till that evening  in the expansion of success we admitted our past feelings  one poor porter said he thought his last hour had come and most of us believed a near future without us not improbable  it shows how danger unlocks the heart that just because halfway up i had relieved this man of his stick which from a help had become a hindrance he felt toward me an exaggerated gratitude  it was nothing for me to do for i was free while he had his load but had i really saved his life he could not have been more beholden  indeed it was a time to intensify emotion   as we scrambled upward on all fours the ascent from familiarity grew less formidable  at least the stones decreased in size although their tilt remained the same but the angle looked less steep from above than from below   at last one after the other we reached a place to the side of the neck of the couloir and scrambling round the coping of turf at the top emerged to our surprise upon a path or rather upon the ghost of one  for we found ourselves upon a narrow ridge of soil between two chasms ending in a pinnacle of clay and along this ribbon of land ran a path perfectly preserved for perhaps a score of paces out when it broke off bodily in midair  the untoward look of the way we had come stood explained  here clearly had been a cataclysm within itinerary times  some gigantic landslide must have sliced the mountain off into the gorge below and instead of a path we had been following its still unlaid phantom  the newborn character of the chasm explained its shocking nakedness  but it was an uncomfortable sight to see a path in all its entirety vanish suddenly into the void   the uncut end of the former trail led back to a little tableland supporting a patch of tilling and tenanted by an uninhabited hut  the willow moor they called it though it seemed hardly big enough to bear a name  on reconnoitring for the descent we found the farther side fallen away like the first so that the plateau was now cut off from all decent approach  one of us at last struck the butt end of a path but we had not gone far down it before it broke off and delivered us to the gullies  this side however was much better than the other and it took none of us very long to slip down the slope repair the bridge and join the ashikura trail   we were now once more on the path we had come up with the certainty of bad places instead of their uncertainty ahead of us a doubtful betterment  the oni ga jo lay in wait round the corner and the rest of the familiar devils would all appear in due course of time   tied over my boots were the straw sandals of the country  they were not made to be worn thus and showed great uneasiness in their new position do what we might with the thongs  everybody tried his hand at it first and last but the fidgety things always ended by coming off at the toe or the heel or sluing round to the side till they were worse than useless  they were supposed to prevent one from slipping which no doubt they would have done had they not begun by slipping off themselves  they wore themselves out by their nervousness and had to be renewed every little while from the stock the porters carried  in honor of the oni ga jo i had a fresh pair put on beside the brook sacred to the memory of my pockethandkerchief  we then rose to the devil place and threaded it in single file  whether it were the companionship or familiarity or simply that my right side instead of my left next the cliff gave greater seeming security i got over it a shade more comfortably this time though it was still far from my ideal of an afternoons walk  the road to the next world branched off too disturbingly to the left   at last the path descended to the river bottom for good  i sat down on a stone pulled out my tobacco pouch and lit a pipe  the porters passed on out of sight  then i trudged along myself  the tension of the last two days had suddenly ceased and in the expansion of spirit that ensued i was conscious of a void  i wanted some one with me then perhaps more than i ever craved companionship before  the great gorge about me lay filled to the brim with purple shadow  i drank in the cool shadescented air at every breath  the forestcovered mountain sides patched higher up with snow in the gullies shut out the world  only a gilded bit here and there on some lofty spur lingered to hint a sun beyond  the strip of pale blue sky far overhead bowed to meet the vista of the valley behind a vista of peaks more and more snowclad till the view was blocked at last by a white nunveiled summit flushed now in the late afternoon light to a tender rose  past strain had left the spirit as past fatigue leaves the body exquisitely conscious and my fancy came and walked with me there in that lonely valley as it gave itself silently into the arms of night   probably none i know will ever tread where i was treading then nor i ever be again in that strange wild cleft so far out of the world and yet if years hence i should chance to wander there alone once more i know the ghost of that romance will rise to meet me as i pass   i own i made no haste to overtake the caravan   darkness fell upon us while we were yet a long way from ashikura with an uncertain cliff path between us and it for the path like a true mountain trail had the passion for climbing developed into a mania and could never rest content with the rivers bed whenever it spied a chance to rise  it had just managed an ascent up a zigzag stairway of its own invention and had stepped out in the dark upon a patch of tall mountain grass as dry as straw when yejiro conceived the brilliant idea of torches  he had learned the trick in the hakone hills where it was the habit he told the guide when caught out at night and he proceeded to roll some of the grass into long wisps for the purpose  the torches were remarkably picturesque and did us service beside  their ruddy flare bowing to the breeze but only burning the more madly for its thwarting lighted the path like noonday through a circle of fifteen feet and dropped brands still flaring into the stubble which we felt it a case of conscience to stop and stamp out  the circle small as it was sufficed to disclose a yawning gulf on the side to which the path clung with the persistency of infatuation   the first thing to tell us of approach to human habitation was the croaking of the frogs  after the wildness of our day it sounded like some lullaby of mother earth speaking of hearth and home and we knew that we were come back to ricefields and man  it was another half hour however before our procession reached the outskirts of the village  here we threw aside our torches and in a weary drawnout file found our way one by one into the courtyard of the inn  it was not an inn the year round it became such only at certain seasons of which the present was not one  it had the habit of putting up pilgrims on their way to the dragon peak between the times of its pious offices it relapsed into a simple farmhouse but the owner received us none the less kindly for our inopportune appearance and hasted to bring the watertubs for our feet  never was i more willing to sit on the sill a moment and dabble my toes for i was footsore and weary and glad to be on mans level again i promise you we were all very human that evening and felt a deal aloud     xviii   a genial inkyo  the owner of the farmhouse had inherited it from his father  there was nothing very odd about this even to our otherworld notions of property except that the father was still living as hale and hearty as you please in a little den at the foot of the garden  he was in short what is known as an inkyo or one dwelling in retirementa singular state composed of equal parts of this world and the next like dying in theory and then undertaking to live on in practice  for an inkyo is a man who has formally handed in his resignation to the community and yet continues to exist most enjoyably in the midst of it  he has abdicated in favor of his eldest son and having put off all responsibilities is filially supported in a life of ease and pleasure   in spite of being no longer in society the father was greedily social as soon as he heard a foreigner had arrived he trotted over to call and nothing would do but i must visit his niche early in the morning before going away   after breakfast therefore the son duly came to fetch me and we started off through the garden  for his sires place of retirement lay away from the road toward the river that the dear old gentleman might command a view of the peaks opposite of one of which called the etchiu fuji from its conical form he was dotingly fond   it was an expedition getting there  this arose not from any special fault in the path which for the first half of the way consisted of a string of steppingstones neatly laid in the ground and for the latter fraction of no worse mud than could easily be met with elsewhere  the trouble came from a misunderstanding in footgear  it seemed too short a walk to put ones boots twice on and off for the doing of it  on the other hand to walk in stockingfeet was out of the question for the mud  so i attempted a compromise consisting of my socks and the native wooden clogs and tried to make the one take kindly to the other  but my mittenlike socks would have none of my thongs and failing of a grip for my toes compelled me to scuffle along in a very undignified way  then every few steps one or the other of the clogs saw fit to stay behind and i had to halt to recover the delinquent  i made a sorry spectacle as i screwed about on the remaining shoe groping after its fellow  once i was caught in the act by my cicerone who turned round inopportunely to see why i was not following and twice in attempting the feat i all but lost my balance into the mud   the worthy virtuoso as he was met us at the door and escorted us upstairs to see his treasures  the room was tapestried with all manner of works of art of which he was justly proud while the house itself stood copied from a chinese model for he was very classic  but i was pleased to find that above all his heart was given to the view  it was shared as i also discovered by the teaceremonies in which he was a proficient such a mixture is man  but i believe the view to have been the deeper affection  while i was admiring it he fetched from a cupboard a very suspiciouslooking bottle of what turned out to be honey and pressed a glass of it upon me  i duly sipped this not inappropriate liquor since cordials savor of asceticism and this one being of natural decoction peculiarly befitted a secular anchorite  then i took my leave of one who though no longer in the world was still so charmingly of it   the good soul chanced to be a widower but such bereavement is no necessary preliminary to becoming a dweller in retirement sometimes a man enters the inkyo state while he still has with him the helpmate of his youth and the two go together to this aftermath of life  surely a pretty return this of the honeymoon  darby and joan starting once more hand in hand alone in this indian summer of their love as they did years ago in its springtide before other generations of their own had pushed them on to less romantic parts darby come back from paternal cares to be once more the lover and joan from mother and grandam again become his girl   we parted from our watchmanguide and half our porters with much feeling as did they from us  as friendships go we had not known one another long but intimacy is not measured by time  circumstances had thrown us into one anothers arms and as we bade goodby first to one and then to another we seemed to be severing a tie that touched very near the heart   two of the porters came on with us as much for love as for money as far as kamiichi where we were to get kuruma  a long tramp we had of it across leagues of ricefields and for a part of the way beside a large deep canal finely bowered in trees and flowing with a swift dark current like some huge boa winding stealthily under the bamboo  it was the artery to i know not how many square miles of field we came in for a steady drizzle after this and it was long past noon before we touched our noontide halt and stalked at last into the inn   with great difficulty we secured three kurumathe place stood on the limits of such locomotionand a crowd so dense collected about them that it blocked the way out  everybody seemed smitten with a desire to see the strangers which gave the inn servants by virtue of their calling an enviable distinction to village eyes  but the porters stood highest in regard both because of their more intimate tie to us and because we here parted from them  it was severing the final link to the now happy past  we all felt it and told our rosary of memories in thought i doubt not each to himself as we went out into the world upon our different ways   eight miles in a rain brought us to the road by which we had entered etchiu some days before and that night we slept at mikkaichi once more  on the morrow morning the weather faired and toward midday we were again facing the fringe of breakers from the cliffs the mountain spurs looked the grimmer that we now knew them so well by repulse  the air was clearer than when we came and as we gazed out over the ocean we could see for the first half day the faint coast line of noto stretching toward us like an arm along the horizon we watched it at intervals as long as it was recognizable and when at last it vanished beyond even imaginations power to conjure up felt a strange pang of personal regret  the sea that snatches away so many lands at parting seems fitly inhuman to the deed   in the course of these two days two things happened which pointed curiously to the isolation of this part of japan  the first was the near meeting with another foreigner which would seem to imply precisely the contrary  but the unwonted excitement into which the event threw yejiro and me was proof enough of its strangeness it was while i was sipping tea waiting for a fresh relay of kuruma at namerigawa that yejiro rushed in to announce that another foreigner was resting at an inn a little further up town  he had arrived shortly before from the echigo side report said  the passing of royalty or even a circus would have been tame news in comparison of course i hastened into my boots and sallied forth  i did not call on him formally but i inspected the front of the inn in which he was said to be with peculiar expectation of spirit in spite of my affected unconcern  he was i believe a german but he never took shape   the second event occurred the next evening and was even more singular like the dodo it chronicled survival  it was manifested in the person of a policeman   some time after our arrival at the inn yejiro reported that the police officer wished to see me  the man had already seen the important part of me the passport and i was at a loss to imagine what more he could want  so yejiro was sent back to investigate he returned shortly with a sad case of concern for consideration and he hardly kept his face as he told it  the conscientious officer it seemed wished to sleep outside my room for my protection  from the passport he felt himself responsible for my safety and had concluded that the least he could do would be not to leave me for a moment  i assured him through yejiro that his offer was most thoughtful but unnecessary  but what an outoftheworld corner the thought implied and what a fine fossil the good soul must have been here was survival with an emphasis  the man had slept soundly through twenty years or more of change and was still in the preforeign days of the feudal ages   the prices of kuruma too were pleasingly behind the times  they were but twofifths of what we should have had to pay on the southern coast  as we advanced toward shinshiu however the prices advanced too  indeed the one advance accurately measured the other  we were getting back again into the world it was painfully evident  at last fares rose to six cents a ri  before they could mount higher we had taken refuge in the train and were hurrying toward zenkoji by steam   our objective point was now the descent of the tenriugawa rapids it was not the shortest way home but it was part of our projected itinerary and took us through a country typical of the heart of japan  it began with a fine succession of passes  these i had once taken on a journey years before with a friend and as we started now up the first one the saru ga bamba no toge i tried to make the new impression fit the old remembrance  but man had been at work upon the place without and imagination still more upon its picture within  it was another toge we climbed in the light of that latterday afternoon  with the companion the old had passed away   leaving the others to follow i started down the zigzags on the farther side  it was already dusk and the steepness of the road and the brisk night air sent me swinging down the turns with something of the anchorlike escapement of a watch  midway i passed a solitary pedestrian who was trolling to himself down the descent and when in turn he passed me as i was waiting under a tree for the others to catch up he eyed me suspiciously as one whose wanderings were questionable  they were certainly questionable to myself for by that time we were come to habitations and each fresh light i saw i took for the village where we were to stop for the night in spite of repeated disillusionings   overhead the larger stars came out and winked at me and then as the fields of space became more and more lighted with starpoints the hearthfires to other homes of worlds i thought how local after all is the great cone of shadow we men call night for it is only natures nightcap for the nodding earth as she turns her head away from the sun to lie pillowed in space   the next day was notable chiefly for the upanddown character of the country even for japan which was excelled only by the unhesitating acceptance of it on the part of the road and this in its turn only by the crowds that traveled it  it seemed that the desire to go increased inversely as the difficulty in going  the wayfarers were most sociable folk and for a people with whom personality is at a discount singularly given to personalities  not a man who had a decent chance but asked whither we were going and whence we had come  to the first half of the countryside we confided so much of our private history to the second we contented ourselves in saying with elaborate courtesy the same as six years ago an answer which sounded polite and rendered the surprised questioner speechless for the time we took to pass   especially the women added to the picturesqueness of the landscape  their heads done up in gaycolored kerchiefs framing their round and rosy faces their kit slung over their shoulders and their kimono tucked in at their waists they trudged along on useful pairs of ankles neatly cased in lavender gaiters  some followed dutifully behind their husbands others chatted along in company with their kindmembers these last of some pilgrim association   there were wayfarers too of less happy mind  for over the last pass the authorities were building a new road and long lines of pinkcoated convicts marched to and fro at work upon it under the surveillance of the darkblue police and the sight made me think how little the momentary living counts in the actual life  here we were two sets of men doing for the time an identical thing trudging along a mountain path in the fresh may air and yet to the one the day seemed all sunshine to the other nothing but cloud        xix   our passport and the basha   it was bound to come and we knew it it was only a question of time  but then we had braved the law so far so well we had almost come to believe that we should escape altogether  i mean the fatal detection by the police that we were violating my passport  that document had already outrun the statute of limitations and left me no better than an outlaw  for practical purposes my character was gone and being thus selfconvicted i might be arrested at any moment  in consequence of pending treaty negotiations the government had become particular about the privileges it granted  one of the first countermoves to foreign insistence on exterritoriality was the restricting of passports to a fortnights time  you might lay out any tour you chose and if granted by the government the provinces designated would all be duly inscribed in your passport but you had to compass them all in the fortnight or be punished  of course this could be evaded and a japanese friend in the foreign office had kindly promised to send me an extension on telegraph  but the dislike of being tied to times and places made me sinfully prefer the risk of being marched back to tokyo under the charge of a policeman a fate i had seen overtake one or two other malefactors caught at somewhat different crimes whom we had casually met on the road the harinoki toge was largely to blame for the delay it is true but then unluckily the harinoki toge could not be arrested and i could   the bespectacled authorities who examined my credentials every night had hitherto winked at my guilt so that the bolt fell upon us from a clear sky  it is almost questionable whether it had a right to fall at that moment at all  it was certainly a case of officious officialdom  for we had stopped simply to change kuruma and the unwritten rule of the road runs that so long as the traveler keeps moving he is safe  to catch him napping at night is the recognized custom   besides the police might have chosen even by day some other opportunity to light upon us than in the very thick of our wrestle with the extortionate prices of fresh kuruma  it was inconsiderate of them to say the least for the attack naturally threw us into a certain disrepute not calculated to cheapen fares  then too our obvious haste helped furnish circumstantial evidence of crime   nevertheless in the very midst of these difficult negotiations at matsumoto evil fate presented itself clothed as a policeman and demanded our papers  luckily they were not at the very bottom of the baggage but in yejiros bosom for otherwise our effects would have become a public show and collected an even greater crowd than actually gathered  the arm of the law took the passport fell at once on the indefensible date and pointed it out to us  there we were caught in the act  we sank several degrees instantly in everybodys estimation   how we escaped is a secret of the japanese force for escape we did  we admitted our misfortune to the policeman and expressed ourselves as even more desirous of getting back to tokyo than he could be to have us there  but we pointed out that now the tenriugawa was to all intents as short a way as any and furthermore that it was the one expressly nominated in the bond  the policeman stood perplexed out of doubt or courtesy or both he hesitated for some moments and then reluctantly handed the passport back  we stood acquitted  indeed we were not only suffered to proceed and that in our own way but he actually accelerated matters himself for he turned to against the kuruma to their instant discomfiture  indeed this was quite as it should be for he was as anxious to be rid of us as we were to be quit of him   on the road the kuruma proved unruly  the exposure we had sustained may have helped to this or the coercion of the policeman may have worked revolt  they jogged along more and more reluctantly till at last the worst of them refused to go on at all  after some quite useless altercation we made what shift we might with the remainder but had not got far when we heard the toot of a fishhorn behind and the sound gradually overhauled us  now a fishhorn on a country road in japan means a basha and a basha means the embodiment of the objectionable  it is a vehicle to be avoided both externally like a fireengine and internally like an ambulance or a hearse  indeed so far as its victim is concerned it usually ends by becoming a cross between the latter two  it is a machine absolutely devoid of recommendations  i speak from experience for in a moment of adventure i once took passage in one some years ago and i never mean to do so again  even the sound of its fishhorn now provokes me to evil thoughts  but we were in a bad way and to my wonder i found my sentiments perceptibly softening  before the thing caught up with us i had actually resolved to take it   we made signals of distress and rather contrary to my expectation the machine stopped  the driver pulled up and the guard a halfgrown boy who sat next him on the seat in front making melody on the horn jumped down a strange bundle of consequence and courtesy and helped us and our belongings in  he then swung himself into his seat as the basha set off again and fell to tooting vociferously  we had scarce got settled before the vehicle was dashing along at what seemed to our late perambulator experience a perfectly breakneck speed  the pace and the enthusiasm of the boy infected us  yejiro and i fell to congratulating each other with some fervor on our change of conveyance and each time we spoke the boy whisked round in his seat and cried out with a knowing wag of his head i tell you its fast a basha he and then as suddenly whisked back again and fell to tooting with renewed vigor like one who had been momentarily derelict in duty  the road was quite deserted so that so much noise would have seemed unnecessary  the boy thought otherwise  meanwhile we were being frightfully jolted and occasionally slung round corners in a way to make holding on a painful labor   i suppose the unwonted speed must have intoxicated us  there is nothing else that will account for our loss of head  for before we were well out of the machine we had begun negotiations for its exclusive possession on the morrow and by the time we were fairly installed in the inn at shiwojiri the bargain stood complete in consideration of no exorbitant sum the vehicle with all appertaining thereto was to be taken off its regular route and wander like any tramp at our sweet will in quite a contrary direction  the boy with the horn was expressly included in the lease  by this arrangement we hoped to compass two days journey in one and reach by the morrows night the point where boats are taken for the descent of the tenriugawa rapids  we knew the drive would be painful but we had every promise that it would be fast   the inn at shiwojiri possessed a foreign table and chairs a bit of furnishing from which the freshness of surprise never wore off  what was even less to be looked for the son of the house was proficient in english having studied with a missionary in tokyo  i had some talk with him later and lent him an english classic which he showed great desire to see   betimes the next morning the basha appeared both driver and guard got up in a fine darkgreen uniform a spruceness it much tickled our vanity to mark  with a feeling akin to princely pride we stepped in the driver cracked his whip and amid the bows of the inn household we went off up the street  barring the loss of an umbrella which had happened somewhere between the time we boarded the basha on the yestereen and the hour of departure that morning and an exhaustive but vain hunt for the same first in the vehicle and then at the stables nothing marred the serenity of our first half hour  the sky was dreamy a delicate blue seen through a golden gauze  i fancy it was such a sky with which danae fell in love  we rose slowly up the shiwojiri pass which a new road enabled even the basha to do quite comfortably and the southern peaks of the hidashinshiu range rose to correspond across the valley the snow line distinctly visible though the nearer ranges did their best to cut it off  norikura the saddle especially showed a fine bit of its ten thousand feet wrapped in the indistinctness of the spring haze  the heavy air gave a look of slumber to the peaks as if those summits waked before the rest of the world had already grown drowsy  we had not yet ceased gazing at them when a turn of the road shut them out  a rise of a few feet a dip a turn and the lake of suwa lay below us on the other side flanked by its own mountains through a gap in which showed the just perceptible cone of fuji   the shiwojiri toge is not a high pass and yet it does duty as part of a great divide  a drop of water falling on the shiwojiri side if it chance to meet with other drops before it be snatched up again into the sky wanders into the sea of japan while its fellow coming to earth not a yard away ends at last in the pacific ocean  our way now lay with the latter  for the tenriugawa or river of the heavenly dragon takes its rise in the lake of suwa a bowl of water a couple of miles or more across  it trickles out insignificantly enough at one end gathers strength for fifty miles of flow and then for another hundred cuts its way clean across a range of mountains  how it ever got through originally and why are interesting mysteries  its gorge is now from one to two thousand feet deep cleft not through a plateau but through the axis of a mountain chain  in most places there is not a yard to spare   we were still a doubtful day off from where it is customary to take a boat  we had started somewhat late stopped for the lack of umbrella and now were committed to a digression for letters i expected at shimonosuwa  i never order my letters to meet me on the line of march but i bitterly repent having chosen that special spot there is always some excellent reason why it turns out most inconvenient  but as yet i was hopeful for i thought i knew the speed of the basha and the day was still young   the day had grown older and i wiser by the time my letters were read with their strange perfume from outremer the horses harnessed afresh and we under way once more clattering down the main street of the village  it was not only in the village that we made a stir  a basha is equal to the occasion anywhere  the whole countryside stopped in its tracks to turn and stare as we passed and at one point we came in for a perfect ovation for our passage and the noonday recess of a school happening to coincide the children at that moment let loose instantly dashed after us pellmell in a mass shouting  one or two of them were so eager in the chase that they minded not where they went and tripping over stones or ruts fell headlong in the mud  the rest pursued us panting each according to his legs and gave over at last only for want of wind   the guard was supremely happy  what time the upper half of him was too tired to toot the lower half spent in hopping off his seat and on again upon imaginary duty  meanwhile in spite of enlivenments not included in the bill my old dislike was slowly but surely coming back  i began to be uneasy on the score of time  the speed was not what hope and the company had led me to expect  i went through some elaborate ruleofthree calculation between the distance the speed and the time and as far as i could make out it began to look questionable whether we should arrive that night at all  i had already played the part of goad out of precaution i now had to take to it in good earnestfutiley to boot  meanwhile my body was as uneasy as my mind  in the first place the seats faced sideways so that we progressed after the fashion of crabs  secondly the vehicle hardly made apologies for springs  we were rattled about like parched corn in a hopper   what a blessed trick of memory that of winnowing the joys of travel from its discomforts and letting the latter slip unconsciously away the dust and the heat and the thousand petty annoyances pass with the fact to be forgotten while the snowhooded mountains and the deep blue sky and the smiling fields stay with us a part of ourselves  that drive seems golden as i look back upon it yet how sadly discomforting it was at the time  toward afternoon a rumor became current that the road had been washed away ahead and that the basha would have to stop some miles short of where we had hoped to be that night  this was disheartening for with all its shortcomings the basha was undeniably faster than perambulators  the rumor gathered substance as we advanced until in consequence we ceased to advance at all  at a certain village called miyada the basha drew up and we were informed that it was impossible to proceed further   there was nothing for it but to hire kuruma  the men were a rascally lot and made gain of our necessity  but we were not as sorry to leave the basha as we might have been and the reports of impassability substantiated themselves before we had got a mile out  in further consolation the kuruma men turned out well on the road and bowled us along right merrily  the road ran along the skirts of the mountains on the right which fell in one long sweep to the river a breadth of plain unexpectedly gored by streams  the canons were startlingly abrupt and the darkness which now came on took nothing from the effect  a sudden zigzag down to a depth of a hundred feet a careful hitching over a decrepit bridge and a zigzag up the other side and we were off at a good trot again  this dispatch on the part of the men brought us in muchimproved spirits and in very good time into iijima our hopedfor goal     xx   down the tenriugawa   we had made arrangements overnight for a boat not without difficulty and in the morning we started in kuruma for the point of embarkation  we were eager to be off upon our voyage else we should have strolled afoot down the long meadow slope such invitation lay in it the dew sparkling on the grass blades the freshly tilled earth scenting the air and the larks rising like rockets up into the sky and bursting into song as they went  it seemed the essence of spring and we had a mile or more of it all before we reached the brink of the canon  for even here the river had begun a gorge for itself through the plain  we left our jinrikisha at the top and zigzagged on foot down the steep descent and straightway departed the upper life of fields and larks and sunshine for a new and semisubterranean one  it was not simply a change of scene it was a complete change of sphere  the world with its face open to the day in a twinkling had ceased to be and another world a world of dark water girt by shadowed walls of rock and trees had taken its place   amid farewell wavings from the jinrikisha men we pushed off into the stream  in spite of the rush of the water and the creaking of the oars a strange stillness had fallen on everything  the swirling inky flood swept us on past the hushed banks heights of motionless leaves nearly hiding the gray old rock  occasionally some puff of wind more adventurous than its fellows swooped down to make the leaves quiver a moment and then died away in awe while here and there a bird flew in and out among the branches with strangely subdued twitter   although this part of the river could show its gorge and its rapids it made only the preface to that chapter of its biography we had come to read  at tokimata some hours further down begins the voyage proper  but even the preface was imposing  the black water glided sinuous along its stealthy course every now and again interrupted by rapids where the sullen flood lashed itself to a passion of whitecaps with a kind of hissing roar  down these we shot the boat bowing first in acquiescence and then plunging as madly as the water itself  it was hard to believe that both boat and river were not sentient things   at intervals we met other boats toiling slowly up stream pulled laboriously by men who strained along the bank at the ends of hundreds of feet of towrope the ropes themselves invisible at first for distance so that we were aware only of men walking along the shore in attitudes of impossible equilibrium and of boats that followed them doglike from pure affection  it would seem weary work even for canalboating  it takes weeks to toil up what it once took only hours to float down  as we sped past the return convoys we seemed sad profligates thus wantonly to be squandering such dearlywon vantage of position  the stream which meant money to them was like money hard come and easy go   still the stream hurried us on  we hugged the cliffs now on one side now on the other only to have them slip by us the quicker  bend after bend opened spread out and closed  the scene changed every minute and yet was always the same  then at times we were vouchsafed openings in the surrounding hills narrow bits of foreground hints of a something that existed beyond   for three hours and more we kept on in our serpentine course for the river meandered as whimsically as if it still had a choice of its own in the matter  then gradually the land about began to make overtures toward sociability  the trees on the banks disappeared the banks themselves decreased in height then the river took to a more genial flow and presently we were ware of the whole countryside to the right coming down in one long sweep to the waters edge   the preface was over  the stream was to have a breathing spell of air and sunlight before its great plunge into sixty miles of twilight canon  with a quick turn of his rudder oar the boatman in the stern brought the flatbottomed craft round and in a jiffy she lay beached on the shingle at tokimata  it was now high noon   the greater part of the village kindly superintended the operation of disembarking and then the more active of its inhabitants trotted before as guides to the inn  for our boat would go no further and therefore all our belongings had to come out  it was only when we inquired for further conveyance that the crowd showed signs of satiety and edged off  to our importunities on this head the populace were statuesque or worse  a japanese assent is not always the most encouraging of replies and a japanese no touches in you a depth not unlike despair  they have a way of hinting the utter hopelessness of your wish past present and to come an eternity of impossibility to make you regret that you ever were born  after we had reached the inn and had stated our wants to a more informed audience we were told that the nautical part of the inhabitants were in the fields gathering mulberry leaves for the silkworms  from the bribe we offered to induce a change in pursuit we judged money to be no object to them  there remained nothing therefore but the police   it is good policy never to invoke the law except in the last extremity for you are pretty safe to have some flaw shown up in you before you are through with it  the law in this case was represented yejiro found by a person still yellow with the jaundice  he met the demand for boatmen with the counter demand for the passport and when this was produced his official eye at once detected its anachronism   this said he is not in order  i do not see how you can go on at all  to add artificial impossibility to natural was too much  yejiro answered that he had better come to the inn which he accordingly did  poor man  i pitied him  for in the first place he was still jaundiced and in the second although conscious of guilt as i was i was much the less disturbed of the two  i was getting used to being a selfsmuggler while he as the japanese say was taihen komarimasu exceedingly know not what to do a phrase which is a national complaint  in this instance he had cause  what to do with so hardened a sinner was a problem passing his powers  here was a lawbreaker who by rights should at once be bundled back to tokyo under police surveillance  but he could not go himself he had no one to send and furthermore the delinquent seemed only too willing to escort himself there free of government expense as speedily as possible  all i had to do was to whet his perception that the sooner boatmen were got the sooner i should be on the right side of the law again  after some conflict with himself he went in search of men   i was left to study the carppond with its gold and silver fish the pivot of attention of the pretty little garden court which stood handy to the kitchen  this juxtaposition was no accident for such ponds are landscape and larder in one  between meals the fish are scenery at the approach of the dinner hour they turn into game the inn guest having sufficiently enjoyed the gambols of future repasts picks out his dish to suit his taste or capacity and the fish is instantly netted and translated to the gridiron  the survivors none the wiser continue to steamboat about intent on their own dinners flashing their colors as they turn their armored sides in and out of the light  eccentric nature has fitted these prototypes of navigation with all the modern improvements  double and even triple sets of screws are common things in tails and sometimes the fins too are duplex  as for me i had neither the heart nor the stomach to help depopulate the pond  but i took much mechanical delight in their motions so i fed them instead of they me   i had my choice between doing this and watching the late boatmen at their dinner in the distance  no doubt moods have an aesthetic conscience of their ownthey demand appropriate setting for i was annoyed at the hilarity of these men over their midday meal  i bore them no malice but i own i should have preferred not to have seen them thus making free with time they had declared themselves unable to sell to me   thanks in part to my quality of outlaw and in part to four hours propitiation of the gods of delay the jaundiced policeman finally succeeded in beating up a crew  there were four conscripts in all kerchiefed not to say petticoated in the native nautical costume a costume not due to being freshwater sailors since their saltwater cousins are given to a like disguise of sex  these mariners made us wait while they finished their preparations  it meant a long voyage to thema facilis descensus averni sed revocare graduma very long pull  then the bow was poled off the current took us in its arms and swung us out into the stream and the crowd on the shingle dropped perspectively astern   while i was still standing gazing at lessening tokimata i heard a cry from behind me and turning ducked just in time to escape being unceremoniously somersaulted into the water by a hawser stretched from bank to bank at a level singularly suited to such a trick the rope was the stationary half of a ferry to which i had neglected to make timely obeisance  it marked indeed an incipient stage in the art of suspension bridges the ferryboat itself supporting a part of the weight while the ferryman pulled it and himself across we met several more in the course of the next few minutes before which we all bowed down into the bottom of the boat while the hawser scraped grumbling impotently overhead   our boat was of adaptive build  it was fortyfive feet long not quite four feet wide and somewhat over two feet deep  these proportions and the character of the wood made it exceeding lithe so that it bent like a willow before necessity  in the stern stood the head man wielding for rudder an oar half as long again as those the others used  there was very little rowing done nor was there need the current itself took us along at racing speed   shortly after ducking under the last ferry rope we reached the gateway to the canon  some rapids made an introduction rocks in places jutting out of the foam and while we were still curveting to the waves the hills suddenly closed in upon the stream in two beetling cliffs spanned surprisingly by a lofty cantalever bridge  an individual who chanced to cross at the moment stopped in mid path to watch us through  the stream swept us in and the countryside contracted to a vanishing vista behind  we were launched on our long canon voyage  the change was as sudden as a thunderstorm of a smiling summer afternoon  it was an eclipse of the earth by the earth itself  dark rocks picketed with trees rose in still darker shadow on either hand higher than one could see  the black river swirled beside us silent sullen swift  at the bottom of that gorge untrodden by man borne by the dark flood that untouched by sunlight coiled snakelike along we seemed adventured on some unforgotten styx   for some time we had voyaged thus with a feeling not unlike awe when all at once there was a bustle among the boatmen and one of them went forward and stood up in the bow  we swept round a corner and saw our first great rapids three hundred yards ahead  we could mark a dip in the stream and then a tumbled mass of white water while a roar as of rage came out of the body of it  as we swept down upon the spot the man in the bow began beating the gunwale with his oar in regularly repeated raps  the board gave out a hollow ring that strangely filled the river chasm a sound well calculated to terrify the evil spirits of the spot  for indeed it was an exorcism of homoeopathic design  his incantation finished he stood motionless  so did the rest of us waiting for the plunge  the boat dipped by the bow darted forward and in a trice we were in the midst of a deafening turmoil of boiling waters and crashing breakers  the breakers laid violent hands upon us grappling at the frail gunwale and coming in part aboard and then as we slipped from their grasp impotently flung their spray in our faces and with a growl dropped astern  the boat trembled like a leaf and was trembling yet when with nightmare speed the thing had slipped into the past and we were shot out into the midst of the seething flood below   not the least impressive part of the affair was the strange spiritrapping on the bow  the boatmen valiantly asserted that this was simply for signal to the man in the stern  undoubtedly now the action has largely cloaked itself in habit but that it once was superstitious is unquestionable  devils still constitute far too respected a portion of the community in peasant parts of japan   the steering the boatmen did was clever but the steering the stream managed of its own motion was more so  for between the rapids proper were swirls and whirlpools and races without end  the current took us in hand at the turns sweeping us down at speed straight for a rock on the opposite bank and then just as shipwreck seemed inevitable whisked us round upon the other tack  a thick cushion of water had fended the boat off so that to strike would have been as impossible as it looked certain  and then at intervals came the roar of another rapid like a stirring refrain with the boatman in the bow to beat the time   so we swept on now through inky swirls of tide now through snowcapped billows moods these of the passing stream while above the grand character of the gorge remained eternally the same     the trees far up sharpetched against the blue   let but the rivers strip of skylight through   to trees below that on each jutting ledge   scant foothold found to overlook the edge   as still as statues on their niches there   where no breeze stirred the evershadowed air   spellbound spectators crowded tier on tier   from where the lowest bending to be near   the shock of spray with leaves atremble stood   in shuddering gaze above the swirling flood    the whole deep chasm some vast natural nave   that to the thought a touch of grandeur gave   and touch of gracefor that wistaria clung   upon the trees its grapelike bunches hung   in stretch to catch their semblance in the stream   pale purple clusters meant to live in dream   placed high above mans predatory clutch   to sight alone vouchsafed from harming touch   wisely withheld as he is hurried past   and thus the more a memory to last   a violet vision there to stayfair fate   forever virginly inviolate   slowly the strip of sky overhead became steeped in color the half light at the bottom of the gorge deepened in tint and suddenly a turn brought us out at a blaze in the cliff where a handful of houses straggled up toward the outer world  we had reached mitsushima a shafting in the tunnel and our halting place for the night         xxi   to the sea   it was a ten minutes walk the next morning from the inn down to the boat an everwinding path along a succession of terraces studded with trees just breaking into leaf and dotted with cottages whose folk gave us goodday as we passed  the site of the village sloped to the south its cheek full turned to the sunshine that stole down and kissed it as it lay  on this lovely may morning amid the slumbering air it made as amorous a bit of springtide as the heart could wish  in front of us in vignette stretched the stream half a mile of it to where it turned the corner  each succeeding level of terrace reset the picture as if for trial of effect   the boat was waiting lightly grounded on a bit of shingle left by a turn of the current  several enthusiastic followers accompanied us out to it with respectful insistence   on reaching our craft we found to our surprise that it was full of bales of merchandise of large and plethoric habit  we asked in astonishment what all this cargo meant  the men answered sheepishly that it was to make the boat ride better  the boat had ridden well enough the day before and on general principles should it would seem ride all the better for being light  but indeed their guilt was plain  our rascally boatmen who had already charged a goodly sum for their craft had thought to serve two masters and after having leased the whole boat to me were intending now to turn a dishonest penny by shipping somebody elses goods into the bargain  in company with the rest of my kind i much dislike to be imposed upon so i told them they might instantly take the socalled ballast out again  when i had seen the process of disembarkation fairly begun i relented deciding so long as the bales were already aboard to take them on to the first stopping place and there put them ashore   the river its brief glimpse at civilization over relapsed again into utter savagery  rocks and trees as wild apparently as their first forerunners there walled us in on the sides and appeared to do so at the ends making exit seem an impossibility and entrance to have been a dream  the stream gave short reaches disclosing every few minutes as it took us round a fresh turn a new variation on the old theme  then as we glided straight our few hundred feet the wall behind us rose higher and higher stretching out at us as if to prevent our possible escape  we had thought it only a high cliff and behold it was the whole mountain side that had stood barrier there   i cannot point the wildness of it all better than did a certain sight we came upon suddenly round a corner  without the least warning a bend in the current introduced us to a fishingpole and a basket reposing together on the top of a rock  these two hints at humanity sat all by themselves keeping one another company no other sign of man was visible anywhere  the pair of waifs gave one an odd feeling as might the shadow of a person apart from the person himself there was something uncanny in their commonplaceness in so uncommon a place  while we were still wondering at the whereabouts of their owner another turn disclosed him by a sort of cove where his boat lay drawn up  indeed it was an ideal spot for an angler and a lucrative one as well for the river is naturally full of fish were i the angler i have seen others i would encamp here for the rest of my life and feed off such phosphoric diet as i might catch to the quickening of the brain and the composing of the body but fortunately man has more of the river than of the rock in his composition and whether he will or no is steadily being hurried past such nicks in life toward other adventures beyond   the rapids here were if anything finer than those above mitsushima  of them in all there are said to be more than thirty  some have nicknames as the turret the adze boiling rice and the mountain bath indeed probably all of them have distinctive appellations but one cannot ask the names of everybody in a procession  there were some bad enough to give one a sensation two of the worst rocks have been blown up but enough still remain to point a momentary moral or adorn an after tale  all were exhilarating through even the least bad i should have been more than sorry to have come alone  but confiding trust in the boatmen was not misplaced for if questionable in their morals they were above reproach in their watercraft   the rapids were incidents the gorge we had always with us superb cleft that it was hewn as by some giant axe notching the mountain chain imperiously for passage  hour followed hour with the same setting  how the river first took it into its head to come through so manifestly unsuitable a place is a secret for the geologist to tell  but i for one wish i had been by to see   from morning till noon we raced with the water at the bottom of the canon  each turn was like and yet unlike the one before so that i wonder that i have other than a blurred composite picture on my minds plate  yet certain bits have picked themselves out and ousted the rest and the river comes up to me in thought as vivid as in life   these repeated disclosures that disclosed nothing lulled us at last into a happy unconsciousness of end in this subterranean passage to a lower world  though we were cleaving the mountain chain in part against the grain indeed because we were it showed no sign of giving out until without premonition a curve shot us out at the foot of a village perched so perpendicularly on terraces that it almost overhung the stream  it was called nishinoto and consisted of a street that sidled up between the dwellings in a more than alpine way  up it we climbed aerially to a teahouse for lunch but not before i had directed the boatmen to discharge the smuggled goods   in another hour we were under way again less the uninvited bales which left sitting all alone on the sands mutely reproached us till they could be seen no more  at the first bend the gorge closed round about us as rugged as ever  the rapids were not so dangerous as those above but the stream was still fast if less furious  when we looked at the water we did not appear to be moving at all and when we looked up again at the bank we almost lost our balance for the sudden start   then gradually a change crept over the face of things  the stream grew a thought more steady the canon a shade less wild  we passed through some more rapidsour last the boatmen said  the river began to widen the mountains standing more respectfully apart they let us see nothing new but they showed us more of themselves and grand buttresses they made  then the reaches grew longer and other hills less high became visible ahead  by all signs we were come to the beginning of the end  another turn and we were confronted with a real viewa very hilly view to be sure but one that belonged to the world of man   it was like coming out of a tunnel into the light   the current hurried us on  at each bend the hills in front rose less wild than at the bend before  villages began to dot the shores and the river spread out and took its ease  another curve and we no longer saw hills and rocks ahead  a great plain stretched before us over which our eyes wandered at will  looking back we marked the mountains already closing up in line  i tried to place the rivers gap but the barrier had grown continuous to the eye  like adventurers in a fairy tale the opening through which we had come had closed unrecognizably behind us   in front all was plain everyday plain with people tilling it and hamlets and in the immediate foreground right athwart our course a ferryboat full of folk  as we bore down between it and the landing place two men gesticulated at us from the bank  we swerved in toward them  they shouted something to the boatmen and yejiro turned to me  the wayfarers asked if we would let them go with us to the sea  there was no regular conveyance and they much desired to reach the tokaido that night  what would i do  oh very well said i reluctantly take them on board  so it had come to this after our romantic solitary voyage  we were to end as a common carrier after all  one is born a demigod the french say to die a grocer   our passengers were honest and businesslike  soon after coming aboard they offered to pay for their passage an offer i politely declined  then they fell to chatting with yejiro and i doubt not in five minutes had possessed themselves of all our immediate history   meanwhile the river was lazily dropping us down to the sea  on the left at a respectful distance a long low rise like a bit of fortification ran down indefinitely in the same direction by way of encouraging the stream  pitiable supposition  was this meadowmeandering bit of water indeed our wild tenriugawa  it seemed impossible  once we had a bathetic bit of excitement over a near case of grounding where the water had spread itself out to ripple down to a lower level  this was all to recall the past  the stream had grown steady and profitable  more than once we passed craft jarringly mercantile and even some highly respectable automations waterwheel boats anchored in the current nose to tail in a long line apparently paddling up stream but never advancing an inch  and all these sights had a workaday machine look like middle age   the afternoon aged to match  the sun began to dip behind the distant hills and then toward the east in front of us came out the long outline of the tokaido bridge three quarters of a mile in length like a huge caterpillar crawling methodically across the riverbed  gradually we drew toward it till its myriad legs glinted in the sunset glow and then as we swept under it wheeled round to become instantly a gaunt stalking silhouette against the sky  from below by the rivers mouth the roar of the surf came forebodingly up out of the ashen east  but in the west was still a glory and as i turned to it i seemed to look down the long vista of the journey to western noto by the sea  i thought how i had pictured it to myself before starting and then how little the facts had fitted the fancy  it had lost and gained if no longer maiden it was mine and the glamour that fringes the future had but changed to the glamour that gilds the past  distance had brought it all back again  delays discomforts difficulties disappeared and its memory rose as lovely as the sky past which i looked  for the better part of place or person is the thought it leaves behind
