quebec    preface   my dear lads  in the present volume i have endeavoured to give the details of the principal events in a struggle whose importance can hardly be overrated at its commencement the english occupied a mere patch of land on the eastern seaboard of america hemmed in on all sides by the french who occupied not only canada in the north and louisiana in the south but possessed a chain of posts connecting them so cutting off the english from all access to the vast countries of the west  on the issues of that struggle depended not only the destiny of canada but of the whole of north america and to a large extent that of the two mother countries when the contest began the chances of france becoming the great colonizing empire of the world were as good as those of england not only did she hold far larger territories in america than did england but she had rich colonies in the west indies where the flag of england was at that time hardly represented and her prospects in india were better than our own at that time too she disputed with us on equal terms the empire of the sea  the loss of her north american provinces turned the scale with the monopoly of such a market the commerce of england increased enormously and with her commerce her wealth and power of extension while the power of france was proportionately crippled it is true that in time the north american colonies with the exception of canada broke away from their connection with the old country but they still remained english still continued to be the best market for our goods and manufactures  never was the shortsightedness of human beings shown more distinctly than when france wasted her strength and treasure in a sterile contest on the continent of europe and permitted with scarce an effort her north american colonies to be torn from her  all the historical details of the war have been drawn from the excellent work entitled montcalm and wolfe by mr francis parkman and from the detailed history of the louisbourg and quebec expeditions by major knox who served under generals amherst and wolfe  yours very sincerely  g a henty    chapter 1 a rescue   most of the towns standing on our seacoast have suffered a radical change in the course of the last century railways and the fashion of summer holiday making have transformed them altogether and great towns have sprung up where fishing villages once stood there are a few places however which seem to have been passed by by the crowd the number yearly becomes smaller as the iron roads throw out fresh branches with the advent of these comes the speculative builder rows of terraces and shops are run up promenades are made bathing machines and brass bands become familiar objects and in a few years the original character of the place altogether disappears  sidmouth for a long time was passed by by the world of holiday makers east and west of her great changes took place and many far smaller villages became fashionable seaside watering places the railway which passed by some twelve miles away carried its tens of thousands westward but left few of them for sidmouth and anyone who visited the pretty little place fifteen years back would have seen it almost as it stood when our story opens a century ago  there are few places in england with a fairer site it lies embosomed in the hills which rise sharply on either side of it while behind stretches a rich undulating country thickly dotted with orchards and snug homesteads with lanes bright with wildflowers and ferns with high hedges and trees meeting overhead the cold breezes which render so bare of interest the walks round the great majority of our seaside towns pass harmlessly over the valley of the sid where the vegetation is as bright and luxuriant as if the ocean lay leagues away instead of breaking on the shore within a few feet of the front line of houses  the cliffs which on either side rise from the waters edge are neither white like those to the east nor grey as are the rugged bulwarks to the west they are of a deep red warm and pleasant to the eye with clumps of green showing brightly up against them on every little ledge where vegetation can get a footing while the beach is neither pebble nor rock nor sand but a smooth level surface sloping evenly down hard and pleasant to walk on when the sea has gone down and the sun has dried and baked it for an hour or two but slippery and treacherous when freshly wetted for the red cliffs are of clay those who sail past in a boat would hardly believe that this is so for the sun has baked its face and the wind dried it till it is cracked and seamed and makes a brave imitation of red granite but the clammy ooze when the sea goes down tells its nature only too plainly and sidmouth will never be a popular watering place for children for there is no digging sand castles here and a fall will stain light dresses and pinafores a ruddy hue and the young labourers will look as if they had been at work in a brick field  but a century since the march of improvement had nowhere begun and there were few larger and no prettier seaside villages on the coast than sidmouth  it was an afternoon in august the sun was blazing down hotly scarce a breath of wind was stirring and the tiny waves broke along the shore with a low rustle like that of falling leaves some fishermen were at work recaulking a boat hauled up on the shore others were laying out some nets to dry in the sun some fisher boys were lying asleep like dogs basking in the heat and a knot of lads sitting under the shade of a boat were discussing with some warmth the question of smuggling  what do you say to it jim walsham one of the party said looking up at a boy some twelve years old who was leaning against a boat but who had hitherto taken no part in the discussion  there is no doubt that its wrong the boy said not wrong like stealing and lying and that sort of thing still its wrong because its against the law and the revenue men if they come upon a gang landing the tubs fight with them and if any are killed they are not blamed for it so there is no doubt about its being wrong then on the other hand no one thinks any the worse of the men that do it and there is scarce a one gentle or simple as wont buy some of the stuff if he gets a chance so it cant be so very wrong it must be great fun to be a smuggler to be always dodging the kings cutters and running cargoes under the nose of the officers ashore there is some excitement in a life like that  there is plenty of excitement in fishing one of the boys said sturdily if you had been out in that storm last march you would have had as much excitement as you liked for twelve hours we expected to go down every minute and we were half our time bailing for our lives  an approving murmur broke from the others who were all with the exception of the one addressed as jim walsham of the fisher class his clothing differed but little from that of the rest his dark blue pilot trousers were old and sea stained his hands and face were dyed brown with exposure to the sun and the salt water but there was something in his manner and tone of voice which showed that a distinction existed  james walsham was indeed the son of the late doctor of the village who had died two years previously dr walsham had been clever in his profession but circumstances were against him sidmouth and its neighbourhood were so healthy that his patients were few and far between and when he died of injuries received from being thrown over his horses head when the animal one night trod on a stone coming down the hill into sidmouth his widow and son were left almost penniless  mrs walsham was fortunately an energetic woman and a fortnight after her husbands death she went round among the tradesmen of the place and the farmers of the neighbourhood and announced her intention of opening a school for girls she had received a good education being the daughter of a clergyman and she soon obtained enough pupils to enable her to pay her way and to keep up the pretty home in which her husband lived in the outskirts of sidmouth  if she would have taken boarders she could have obtained far higher terms for good schools were scarce but this she would not do and her pupils all lived within distances where they could walk backwards and forwards to their homes her evenings she devoted to her son and though the education which she was enabled to give him would be considered meagre indeed in these days of universal cramming he learned as much as the average boy of the period  he would have learned more had he followed her desires and devoted the time when she was engaged in teaching to his books but this he did not do for a few hours in the day he would work vigorously at his lessons the rest of his time he spent either on the seashore or in the boats of the fishermen and he could swim row or handle a boat under sail in all weather as well or better than any lad in the village of his own age  his disposition was a happy one and he was a general favourite among the boatmen he had not as yet made up his mind as to his future his mother wanted him to follow his fathers profession he himself longed to go to sea but he had promised his mother that he would never do so without her consent and that consent he had no hope of obtaining  the betterclass people in the village shook their heads gravely over james walsham and prophesied no good things of him they considered that he demeaned himself greatly by association with the fisher boys and more than once he had fallen into disgrace with the more quiet minded of the inhabitants by mischievous pranks his reputation that way once established every bit of mischief in the place which could not be clearly traced to someone else was put down to him and as he was not one who would peach upon others to save himself he was seldom in a position to prove his innocence  the parson had once called upon mrs walsham and had talked to her gravely over her sons delinquencies but his success had not been equal to his anticipations mrs walsham had stood up warmly for her son  the boy may get into mischief sometimes mr allanby but it is the nature of boys to do so james is a good boy upright and honourable and would not tell a lie under any consideration what is he to do if i could afford to send him to a good school it would be a different thing but that you know i cannot do from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon my time is occupied by teaching and i cannot expect nor do i wish that he should sit moping indoors all day he had far better be out in the boats with the fishermen than be hanging about the place doing nothing if anything happened to me before he is started in life there would be nothing for him but to take to the sea i am laying by a little money every month and if i live for another year there will be enough to buy him a fishing boat and nets i trust that it may not come to that but i see nothing derogatory in his earning an honest living with his own hands he will always be something better than a common fisherman the education i have striven to give him and his knowledge that he was born a gentleman will nerve him to try and rise  as to what you say about mischief so far as i know all boys are mischievous i know that my own brothers were always getting into scrapes and i have no doubt mr allanby that when you look back upon your own boyhood you will see that you were not an exception to the general rule  mr allanby smiled he had come rather against his own inclinations but his wife had urged him to speak to mrs walsham her temper being ruffled by the disappearance of two favourite pigeons whose loss she without a shadow of evidence most unjustly put down to james walsham  the parson was by no means strict with his flock he was a tall man inclined to be portly a good shot and an ardent fisherman and although he did not hunt he was frequently seen on his brown cob at the meet whenever it took place within a reasonable distance of sidmouth and without exactly following the hounds his knowledge of the country often enabled him to see more of the hunt than those who did  as mrs walsham spoke the memory of his old school and college days came across him  that is the argumentum ad hominem mrs walsham and when a lady takes to that we can say no more you know i like your boy there is much that is good in him but it struck me that you were letting him run a little too wild however there is much in what you say and i dont believe that he is concerned in half the mischief that he gets credit for still you must remember that a little of the curb just a little is good for us all it spoils a horse to be always tugging at his mouth but he will go very badly if he does not feel that there is a hand on the reins  i have said the same thing to the squire he spoils that boy of his for whom between ourselves i have no great liking the old man will have trouble with him before he is done or i am greatly mistaken  nothing came of mr allanbys visit mrs walsham told james that he had been there to remonstrate with her  i do not want to stop you from going out sailing jim but i wish you would give up your mischievous pranks they only get you bad will and a bad name in the place many people here think that i am wrong in allowing you to associate so much with the fisher boys and when you get into scrapes it enables them to impress upon me how right they were in their forecasts i do not want my boy to be named in the same breath with those boys of robsons or young peterson or blame  but you know i have nothing to do with them mother james said indignantly they spend half their time about the public house and they do say that when peterson has been out with that lurcher of his he has been seen coming back with his coat bulged out and there is often a smell of hare round his fathers cottage at supper time you know i wouldnt have anything to do with them  no jim i am sure you would not but if people mix up your name with theirs it is almost as bad for you as if you had unfortunately people are too apt not to distinguish between tricks which are really only the outcome of high spirit and a lack of something better to do and real vice therefore jim i say keep yourself from mischief i know that though you are out of doors so many hours of the day you really do get through a good deal of work but other people do not give you credit for this remember how your father was respected here try to act always as you would have done had he been alive and you cannot go far wrong  james had done his best but he found it hard to get rid of his reputation for getting into mischief and more than once when falsely suspected he grumbled that he might just as well have the fun of the thing for he was sure to have the blame  as jim walsham and his companions were chatting in the shade of a boat their conversation was abruptly broken off by the sight of a figure coming along the road it was a tall figure with a stiff military bearing he was pushing before him a large box mounted on a framework supported by four wheels low down close to the ground swung a large flat basket in this on a shawl spread over a thick bed of hay sat a little girl some five years old  it is the sergeant one of the boys exclaimed i wonder whether he has got a fresh set of views the last were firstrate ones  the sergeant gave a friendly nod to the boys as he passed and then turning up the main street from the beach went along until he came to a shaded corner and there stopped the boys had all got up and followed him and now stood looking on with interest at his proceedings the little girl had climbed out of her basket as soon as he stopped and after asking leave trotted back along the street to the beach and was soon at play among the seaweed and stones  she was a singularly pretty child with dark blue eyes and brown hair with a touch of gold her print dress was spotlessly clean and neat a huge flapping sunbonnet shaded her face whose expression was bright and winning  well boys the sergeant said cheerfully how have you been getting on since i was here last nobody drowned i hope or come to any ill not that we must grumble whatever comes we have all got to do our duty whether it be to march up a hill with shot and shell screaming and whistling round as i have had to do or to be far out at sea with the wind blowing fit to take the hair off your head as comes to your lot sometimes or following the plough from years end to years end as happens to some we have got to make the best of it whatever it is  i have got a grand new set of pictures from exeter they came all the way down from london town for me by waggon london bridge and windsor castle with the flag flying over it telling that the kinggod bless his gracious majestyis at home  then i have got some pictures of foreign parts that will make you open your eyes theres niagara i dont know whether youve heard of it but its a place where a great river jumps down over a wall of rock as high as that steeple there with a roar like thunder that can be heard they say on a still night for twenty miles round  i have got some that will interest you more still because you are sailors or are going to be sailors i have got one of the killing of a whale he has just thrown a boat with five sailors into the air with a lash of his tail but its of no use for there are other boats round and the harpoons are striking deep in his flesh he is a big fish and a strong one but he will be beaten for he does not know how to use his strength thats the case with many men they throw away their life and their talents just because they dont know whats in them and what they might do if they tried  and i have got a picture of the fight with the spanish armada you have heard about that boys surely for it began out there over the water almost in sight of sidmouth and went on all the way up the channel our little ships hanging on to the great spaniards and giving them no rest but worrying them and battering them till they were glad to sail away to the dutch coast but they were not safe there for we sent fire ships at them and they had to cut and run and then a storm came on and sunk many and drove others ashore all around our coasts even round the north of scotland and ireland  you will see it all here boys and as you know the price is only one penny  by this time the sergeant had let down one side of the box and discovered four round holes and had arranged a low stool in front for any of those who were not tall enough to look through the glasses to stand upon a considerable number of girls and boys had now gathered round for sergeant wilks and his show were old established favourites at sidmouth and the news of his arrival had travelled quickly round the place  four years before he had appeared there for the first time and since then had come every few months he travelled round the southwestern counties dorset and wilts somerset devon and cornwall and his cheery good temper made him a general favourite wherever he went  he was somewhat of a martinet and would have no crowding and pushing and always made the boys stand aside till the girls had a good look but he never hurried them and allowed each an ample time to see the pictures which were of a better class than those in most travelling peep shows there was some murmuring at first because the show contained none of the popular murders and bloodcurdling scenes to which the people were accustomed  no the sergeant had said firmly when the omission was suggested to him the young ones see quite enough scenes of drunkenness and fighting when i was a child i remember seeing in a peep show the picture of a woman lying with her head nearly cut off and her husband with a bloody chopper standing beside her and it spoiled my sleep for weeks no none of that sort of thing for sergeant wilks he has fought for his country and has seen bloodshed enough in his time and the ground half covered with dead and dying men but that was dutythis is pleasure sergeant wilks will show the boys and girls who pay him their pennies views in all parts of the world such as would cost them thousands of pounds if they travelled to see them and all as natural as life he will show them great battles by land and sea where the soldiers and sailors shed their blood like water in the service of their country but cruel murders and notorious crimes he will not show them  it was not the boys and girls only who were the sergeants patrons picture books were scarce in those days and grownup girls and young men were not ashamed to pay their pennies to peep into the sergeants box  there was scarcely a farm house throughout his beat where he was not known and welcomed his care of the child who when he first came round was but a year old won the heart of the women and a bowl of bread and milk for the little one and a mug of beer and a hunch of bread and bacon for himself were always at his service before he opened his box and showed its wonders to the maids and children of the house  sidmouth was one of his regular halting places and indeed he visited it more often than any other town on his beat there was always a room ready for him there in the house of a fishermans widow when he arrived on the saturday and he generally stopped till the monday thus he had come to know the names of most of the boys of the place as well as of many of the elders for it was his custom of a saturday evening after the little one was in bed to go and smoke his pipe in the taproom of the anchor where he would sometimes relate tales of his adventures to the assembled fishermen but although chatty and cheery with his patrons sergeant wilks was a reticent rather than a talkative man at the anchor he was except when called upon for a story a listener rather than a talker  as to his history or the county to which he belonged he never alluded to it although communicative enough as to his military adventures and any questions which were asked him he quietly put on one side he had intimated indeed that the father and mother of his grandchild were both dead but it was not known whether she was the child of his son or daughter for under his cheerful talk there was something of military strictness and sternness and he was not a man of whom idle questions would be asked  now boys and girls he said step up the show is ready those who have got a penny cannot spend it better those who havent must try and get their father or mother to give them one and see the show later on girls first boys should always give way to their sisters the bravest men are always the most courteous and gentle with women  four girls of various ages paid their pennies and took their places at the glasses and the sergeant then began to describe the pictures his descriptions of the wonders within being so exciting that several boys and girls stole off from the little crowd and made their way to their homes to coax their parents out of the necessary coin  james walsham listened a while and then walked away to the sea for there would be several sets of girls before it came to the turn of the boys he strolled along and as he came within sight of the beach stopped for a moment suddenly and then with a shout ran forward at the top of his speed  the little girl after playing some time with the seaweed had climbed into a small boat which lay at the edge of the advancing tide and leaning over the stern watched the little waves as they ran up one after another a few minutes after she had got into it the rising tide floated the boat and it drifted out a few yards as far as its headrope allowed it ignorant of what had happened the child was kneeling up at the stern leaning over and dabbling her hands in the water  no one had noticed her the boys had all deserted the beach none of the fishermen were near the spot  just before james walsham came within sight of the sea the child had overbalanced itself his eye fell on the water just as two arms and a frightened little face appeared above it there was a little splash and a struggle and the sea was bare again  at the top of his speed james dashed across the road sprang down the beach and rushing a few yards into the water dived down he knew which way the tide was making and allowed for the set a few vigorous strokes and he reached something white on the surface it was the sunbonnet which had in the childs struggles become unfastened he dived at once and almost immediately saw a confused mass before him another stroke and he seized the childs clothes and grasping her firmly rose to the surface and swam towards shore  although the accident had not been perceived his shout and sudden rush into the water had called the attention of some of the men and two or three of them ran into the water waist deep to help him out with his little burden  well done master walsham the child would have been drowned if you had not seed it none of us noticed her fall over she was playing on the beach last time i seed her  is she dead james asked breathless from his exertions  not she the fisherman said she could not have been under water a minute take her into my cottage its one of the nighest my wife will put her between the blankets and will soon bring her round  the fishermans wife met them at the door and taking the child from the lad carried it in and soon had her wrapped up in blankets but before this was done she had opened her eyes for she had scarcely lost consciousness when james had seized her  the lad stood outside the door waiting for the news when the sergeant hurried up one of the fishermen having gone to tell him what had happened as soon as the child had been carried into the cottageassuring him as he did so that the little one would speedily come round  just as he came up the door of the cottage opened and one of the women who had run in to assist the fishermans wife put her head out  she has opened her eyes she said the little dear will soon be all right  thank god for his mercies the sergeant said taking off his hat what should i have done if i had lost her  and i have to thank you next to god he said seizing the boys hand may god bless you young gentleman and reward you for having saved my darling they tell me she must have been drowned but for you for no one knew she had fallen in had it not been for you i should come round to look for her and she would have been gonegone forever and the showman dashed the tears from his eyes with the back of his hand  i was only just in time the lad said i did not see her fall out of the boat she was only a few yards away from it when she came upjust as my eyes fell on the spot i am very glad to have saved her for you but of course it was nothing of a swim she could not have been many yards out of my depth now i will run home and change my things  james walsham was too much accustomed to be wet through to care anything about his dripping clothes but they served him as an excuse to get away for he felt awkward and embarrassed at the gratitude of the old soldier he pushed his way through the little crowd which had now gathered round and started at a run for the news had brought almost all those gathered round the peep show to the shore the excitement of somebody being drowned being superior even to that of the peep show to the great majority though a few who had no hope of obtaining the necessary pennies had lingered behind and seized the opportunity for a gratuitous look through the glasses  james ran upstairs and changed his clothes without seeing his mother and then taking down one of his lesson books set to work shrinking from the idea of going out again and being made a hero of  half an hour later there was a knock at the front door and a few minutes after his mother called him down he ran down to the parlour and there found the showman  oh i say the boy broke out dont say anything more about it i do hate being thanked and there was nothing in swimming ten yards in a calm sea please dont say anything more about it i would rather you hit me ever so much  the sergeant smiled gravely and mrs walsham exclaimed  why didnt you come in and tell me about it jim i could not make out at first what mrmr  sergeant wilks madam  what sergeant wilks meant when he said that he had called to tell me how grateful he felt to you for saving his little grandchilds life i am proud of you jim  oh mother dont the boy exclaimed it is horrid going on so if i had swum out with a rope through the surf there might be something in it but just to jump in at the edge of the water is not worth making a fuss about one way or the other  not to you perhaps young gentleman but it is to me the showman said the child is the light of my life the only thing i have to care for in the world and you have saved her if it had only been by stretching out your hand i should have been equally grateful however i will say no more about it but i shall not think the less  but dont you believe madam that there was no credit in it it was just the quickness and the promptness which saved her life had your son hesitated a moment it would have been too late for he would never have found her it is not likely that your son will ever have any occasion for help of mine but should there be an opportunity he may rely upon it that any service i can render him shall be his to the death and unlikely as it may seem it may yet turn out that this brave act of his in saving the life of the granddaughter of a travelling showman will not be without its reward  is she all right now james asked abruptly anxious to change the conversation  yes she soon came to herself and wanted to tell me all about it but i would not let her talk and in a few minutes she dropped off to sleep and there i left her the women tell me she will probably sleep till morning and will then be as well as ever and now i must go and look after my box or the boys will be pulling it to pieces  it was however untouched for in passing the sergeant had told the little crowd that if they left it alone he would on his return let all see without payment and during the rest of the afternoon he was fully occupied with successive audiences being obliged to make his lectures brief in order that all might have their turn  after the sergeant had left james took his hat and went for a long walk in the country in order to escape the congratulations of the other boys the next day little agnes was perfectly well and appeared with her grandfather in the seat far back in the church which he always occupied on the sundays he spent at sidmouth on these occasions she was always neatly and prettily dressed and indeed some of the good women of the place comparing the graceful little thing with their own children had not been backward in their criticisms on the folly of the old showman in dressing his child out in clothes fit for a lady    chapter 2 the showmans grandchild   three months later the showman again appeared at sidmouth but did not set up his box as usual leaving it at his lodging he went at once with his grandchild to mrs walshams  i have come madam he said after the first inquiries about the child had been answered on a particular business it will seem a strange thing to you for a man like me to ask but things are not quite as they seem though i cant explain it now but i am beating about the bush and not getting any nearer i have come to ask madam whether you would take charge of the child for two years of course i am ready to pay anything that you may think proper  but i dont take boarders mrs walsham said much surprised at the proposition i only take girls who come in the morning and go away in the afternoon besides they are all a good many years older than your grandchild none of the girls who come to me are under twelve  i know mam i know and i am sure you must think it a great liberty on my part to ask such a thing the sergeant said apologetically it is not the teaching i want but just a home for her  mrs walsham felt puzzled she did in her heart feel it to be a liberty surely this wandering showman would find no difficulty in getting his grandchild taken care of among people of his own rank in life it did seem most singular that he should seek to place the child with her mrs walsham was not given to thinking what her neighbours would say but she thought of the buzz of comment and astonishment which her taking the charge of this child would excite she had been particular in keeping her little school to some extent select and as it was now as large as she could manage unaided she was able to make it almost a favour to the farmers wives to take their girls  but to do mrs walsham justice this thought had less influence with her than that of the time and care which would be required by a child of that age in the house certainly she thought as she looked at her sitting with her eyes wide open and an expression of grave wonder in her face she is a little darling and as jim saved her life i have a special interest in her but this is out of the question  it was two or three minutes before she answered the showmans last words  no it cannot be done sergeant wilks no money that could be paid me would make up to me for the charge of a child of her age i am all day in school and what could a child especially one accustomed to be out all day do with herself the worry and anxiety would be immense were it not for my school it would be different altogether a child of that age especially such a sweet little thing as your granddaughter seems to be would be a pet and amusement but as it is i am sorry to say that it is out of the question but surely you will have no difficulty in finding plenty of good women who would be glad to take her and to whom having children of the same age she would be no trouble whatever  yes the sergeant said slowly i was afraid you would say that mam besides though you are good enough not to say it i know that there must be other objections i know you must be surprised at my wanting her to be with a lady like yourself so far as money goes i could afford to pay fifty pounds a year and perhaps you might get a girl who could look after aggie while you are busy  fifty pounds a year mrs walsham said greatly surprised that is a large sum a great deal too large a sum for you to pay for the care of such a little child for half that there are scores of farmers wives who would be happy to take her and where she would be far more happy and comfortable than she would be with me  i know i could get plenty to take her the soldier said but i have reasons very particular reasons why i wish to place her with a lady for two years i cannot explain those reasons to you but you may imagine they must be strong ones for me to be willing to pay fifty pounds a year for her that money has been laid by from the day she was born for that purpose i have other reasons of my own for wishing that she should be at sidmouth rather than at any other place and i have another reason and a slight smile stole across his face for preferring that she should be with you rather than anyone else all this must seem very strange to you madam but at the end of the two years when you know what my reasons were you will acknowledge that they were good ones  god knows he went on looking very grave what a wrench it will be for me to part with her how lonely i shall be as i tramp the country without her pretty prattle to listen to but i have got to do it sooner or later and these two years when i can see her sometimes will be a break and accustom me to do without her sweet face  please madam he urged do not give me a final answer today i shall not go till monday and will call again if you will let me that morning and believe me if i could tell you all i could give you reasons which would i think induce you to change your mind  so saying he made a military salute took the childs hand in his and was soon striding along towards the sea  mrs walsham was some time before she recovered from her surprise this was indeed a mysterious affair the earnestness with which the old soldier pleaded his cause had moved her strongly and had almost persuaded her to accept the proposal which had at first seemed preposterous fifty pounds a year too was certainly a handsome sum she could get a girl from the village for two or three shillings a week to look after the child and go out with her during school hours and a hundred pounds would be a very handsome addition to the sum which she had begun little by little to lay by for jims preparation for the medical profession  in the five years which would elapse before it would be time for him to enter upon his studies for it she could hardly hope to lay by more than that sum and this would at a stroke double it certainly it was a tempting offer she could not do justice to the child could not give her the care and attention which she ought to have and which she could have for such a sum elsewhere but the sergeant knew exactly how she was placed and if he was willing and anxious for her to assume the charge of the child why should she refuse this good offer  however her pupils were waiting for her in the next room and with an effort mrs walsham put the matter aside and went in to them  when james returned home to dinner his mother related to him the whole conversation james was more amused than puzzled  it seems a rum idea mother but i dont see why you shouldnt take her she is a sweet little thing and will be a great amusement fifty pounds a year seems a tremendous sum for a man like that to pay but i suppose he knows his own business and it will be a great pull for you you will be able to have all sorts of comforts i should like it very much i have often wished i had had a little sister and she can go out walks with me you know it would be like having a big dog with one only much jollier  yes his mother said smiling and i shouldnt be surprised if you wanted to throw sticks into the water for her to fetch them out and to be taking her out for a nights fishing and be constantly bringing her home splashed with that nasty red mud from head to foot you would be a nice playmate for a little girl jim perhaps it is that special advantage that the sergeant had in his minds eye when he was so anxious to put her with me  james laughed  i would see that she didnt come to any harm anyhow you know and after all i suppose it was my picking her out of the sea that had something to do with his first thinking of putting her with you  i suppose it had jim she said more seriously but what do you think my boy you know there are disadvantages in it there will be a good deal of talk about my taking this showmans grandchild and some of the farmers wives wont like it  then let them dislike it james said indignantly the child is as good as their daughters any day why i noticed her in church looking like a little lady there was not a child there to compare to her  yes i have noticed her myself mrs walsham said she is a singularly pretty and graceful child but it will certainly cause remark  well mother you can easily say what is really the fact that you naturally felt an interest in her because i picked her out of the water besides if people make remarks they will soon be tired of that and if not i can get into some scrape or other and give them something else to talk about  accordingly when sergeant wilks called on monday morning for his answer mrs walsham told him that she had decided to accept his offer  you are aware how i am placed she said and that i cannot give her the care and time which i could wish and which she ought to have for such a liberal payment as you propose but you know that beforehand and you see that for two years payments i could not sacrifice my school connection which i should have to do if i gave her the time i should wish  i understand madam he said and i am grateful to you for consenting to take her she is getting too old now to wander about with me and since the narrow escape she had last time i was here i have felt anxious whenever she was out of my sight it would not suit me to put her in a farm house i want her to learn to speak nicely and i have done my best to teach her but if she went to a farm house she would be picking up all sorts of country words and i want her to talk like a little lady  so that is settled mam i am going on to exeter from here and shall get her a stock of clothes there and will bring her back next saturday will it suit you to take her then  mrs walsham said that would suit very well and an hour later the sergeant set out from sidmouth with his box aggie trotting alongside talking continuously  but why am i to stop with that lady grampa and not to go about with you any more i shant like it i like going about though i get so tired sometimes when you are showing the pictures and i like being with you it isnt cause i have been naughty is it cause i fell out of the boat into the water i wont never get into a boat again and i didnt mean to fall out you know  no aggie its not that the sergeant said you are always a good girlat least not always because sometimes you get into passions you know still altogether you are a good little girl still you see you cant always be going about the country with me  but why not grampa  well my dear because great girls cant go about the country like men it wouldnt be right and proper they should  why shouldnt it be grampa the child persisted  well aggie i cant exactly explain to you why but so it is men and boys have to work they go about in ships or as soldiers to fight for their country just as i did girls and women have to stop at home and keep house and nurse babies and that sort of thing god made man to be hard and rough and to work and go about he made woman gentle and soft to stop at home and make things comfortable  aggie meditated for some distance in silence upon this view of the case  but i have seen women working in the fields grampa and some of them didnt seem very soft and gentle  no aggie things dont always go just as they ought to do and you see when people are poor and men cant earn enough wages then their wives and daughters have to help and then you see they get rough more like men because they are not doing their proper work but i want you to grow up soft and gentle and so for a time i want you to live with that lady with the nice boy who pulled you out of the water and they will make you very happy and i shall come and see you sometime  i like him the child said with a nod but i would rather be with you you know  and the lady will teach you to read aggie you have learned your letters you know  aggie shook her head to show that this part of the programme was not particularly to her liking  do you think the boy will play with me grampa  i daresay he will aggie when you are very good and you must never forget you know that he saved your life just think how unhappy i should be if he had not got you out of the water  the water was cold and nasty aggie said and it seemed so warm and nice to my hands aggie wont go near the water any more of course if the boy is with me i can go because he wont let me tumble in  shall i get into the basket now grampa i is tired  oh nonsense little woman you have not walked half a mile yet anyhow you must trot along until you get to the top of this hill then you shall have a lift for a bit  and so with the child sometimes walking and sometimes riding sometimes asleep in her basket and sometimes chatting merrily to her grandfather the pair made their way across the country towards exeter  there was no little talk in sidmouth when on the following sunday the showmans grandchild appeared in mrs walshams pew in church and it became known that she had become an inmate of her house it was generally considered that mrs walsham had let herself down greatly by taking the showmans grandchild and one or two of the mothers of her pupils talked about taking them away one or two indeed called upon her to remonstrate personally but they gained nothing by the step  i do not understand what you mean she said quietly by saying that the child is not fit to associate with my other pupils she is singularly gentle and taking in her manner she expresses herself better than any child of her own age in sidmouth so far as i know there are few so neatly and prettily dressed what is there to object to her grandfather has been a sergeant in the army he bears a good character and is liked wherever he goes i do not consider that james or myself are in any way demeaned by sitting down to meals with the child who indeed behaves as prettily and nicely as one could wish and i certainly do not see that any of my pupils can be injuriously affected by the fact that for an hour or two in the day she learns her lessons in the same room with them had i thought that they would be i should not have received her i shall of course be sorry if any of my pupils are taken away but as i have several girls only waiting for vacancies it would make no difference to me pecuniarily  and so it happened that mrs walsham lost none of her pupils and in a short time the wonder died out indeed the child herself was so pretty and taking in her ways that it was impossible to make any objection to her personally  mrs walsham had been struck by the self command which she showed at parting with her grandfather her eyes were full of tears her lip quivered and she could scarcely speak but there was no loud wailing no passionate outburst her grandfather had impressed upon her that the parting was for her own good and child though she was she felt how great a sacrifice he was making in parting with her and although she could not keep the tears from streaming down her cheeks or silence her sobs as she bade him goodbye she tried hard to suppress her grief  the pain of parting was indeed fully as great to sergeant wilks as to his granddaughter and it was with a very husky voice that he bade her goodbye and then putting her into mrs walshams arms walked hastily away  aggie was soon at home she and james very quickly became allies and the boy was ever ready to amuse her often giving up his own plans to take her for a walk to pick flowers in the hedgerow or to sail a tiny boat for her in the pools left as the sea retired mrs walsham found to her surprise that the child gave little trouble she was quiet and painstaking during the half hours in the morning and afternoon when she was in the school room while at mealtimes her prattle and talk amused both mother and son and altogether she made the house brighter and happier than it was before  in two months the sergeant came round again he did not bring his box with him having left it at his last halting place telling james who happened to meet him as he came into sidmouth that he did not mean to bring his show there again  it will be better for the child he explained she has done with the peep show now and i do not want her to be any longer associated with it  aggie was delighted to see him and sprang into his arms with a scream of joy as he entered after a few minutes talk mrs walsham suggested that she should put on her hat and go for a walk with him and in high contentment the child trotted off holding her grandfathers hand turning to the left the sergeant took the path up the hill and when he reached the top sat down on the short turf with aggie nestling up against him  so you are quite well and happy aggie he asked  quite well grampa and very happy but i do wish so much that you were here oh it would be so nice to have you to go out with every day  i am afraid that cannot be managed aggie i have been busy so long that i could not settle down quietly here besides i must live you know  but wouldnt people give you money for the show if you lived here grampa you always got money here the same as other places  yes my dear but i could not get fresh pictures every day and should soon tire them by showing the old house  but you are sorry sometimes grampa not to have me with you  yes aggie very sorry i miss you terribly sometimes and i am always thinking about you  then why dont you take me away again grampa  because as i told you aggie i want you to learn to read and to grow up quite a little lady  does reading make one a lady grampa  no aggie not by itself but with other things  and when i am quite grown up and big and know how to read nicely shall i be able to go with you again  we will see about that aggie when the time comes there is plenty of time yet to think about that  but i am getting on very fast grampa and the lady says i am a good girl so it wont be such a very long time before i can leave  it will be some time yet you have only got to read little words yet but there are lots of long words which you will come to presently but mrs walsham tells me that you are getting on nicely and that you are a very good girl which pleases me very much and when i am walking along with my box i shall like to be able to think of you as being quite comfortable and happy  and i go walks with jim grampa and jim has made me a boat and he says someday when it is very fine and quiet he will take me out in a big boat like that boat you know and he is going to ask you if he may for the lady said i must not go out with him till he has asked you and he said he wont let me tumble over and i am going to sit quite quite still  yes aggie i dont see any harm in your going out with him i am sure he will only take you when it is fine and he will look after you well you like him dont you  oh i do grampa and you know it was him who got me out of the water else i should never have come out and never have seen grampa again and he has made me a boat oh yes i do like him  thats right my dear always stick to those who are good to you  a few days after this as james was sailing the toy boat for aggies amusement in a pool a boy sauntered up he was somewhat taller than james walsham and at least two years older he was well dressed and james knew him as the nephew and heir of the squire  it was not often that richard horton came down into the village he was accustomed to be treated with a good deal of deference at the hall and to order servants and grooms about pretty much as he chose and the indifference with which the fisher boys regarded him offended him greatly he was a spoilt boy his uncle had a resident tutor for him but the selection had been a bad one the library was large and good the tutor fond of reading and he was content to let the boy learn as little as he chose providing that he did not trouble him as to any instruction beyond books he never thought of giving it  the squire never interfered he was a silent and disappointed man he attended to his duties as a magistrate and to the management of his estate but seldom went beyond the lodge gates he took his meals by himself and often did not see his nephew for a week together and had no idea but that he was pursuing his studies regularly with his tutor thus the character of richard horton formed itself unchecked at the best it was a bad one but under other circumstances it might have been improved  up to the age of ten he had lived in london with his father and mother the latter a sister of the squire who having married beneath her to the indignation of mr linthorne he had never seen her afterwards  four years before the story begins she had received a letter from him saying that as her eldest son was now his heir he wished him to come and live with him and be prepared to take his place the hortons who had a numerous family at once accepted the offer and richard hearing that he was going to a grand house and would no doubt have a pony and all sorts of nice things left his father and mother without a tear  he was essentially selfish he was vain of his good looks which were certainly striking and with his changed fortunes he became arrogant and as the squires servants said hateful and yet the change had brought him less pleasure than he expected it was true that he had the pony that he was not obliged to trouble himself with lessons that he was an important person at the hall but he had no playfellows no one to admire his grandeur and the days often passed heavily and there was a look of discontent and peevishness upon his handsome face  perhaps the reason why he so seldom came down into sidmouth was not only because the fisher boys were not sufficiently impressed with his importance but because they looked so much happier and more contented than he felt in spite of his numerous advantages on this day he was in a particularly bad temper he had lamed his pony the day before by riding it furiously over a bad road after it had cast a shoe the gardener had objected to his picking more than half a dozen peaches which had just come into perfection and had threatened to appeal to the squire  altogether he was out of sorts and had walked down to the sea with a vague hope that something might turn up to amuse him he stood for some little time watching james sail the boat and then strode down to the edge of the pool the boat was a model of a smack with brown sails james had taken a good deal of pains with it and it was an excellent model  presently in crossing she stuck in a shallow some twelve feet from the edge the intervening stretch of water was a foot deep  james picked up some small stones and threw them close to her that the tiny wave they made might float her off he tried several times without success  whats the use of such little stones as that richard said roughly you will never get her off like that and picking up one as large as his fist he threw it with some force  it struck the mast and broke it asunder and knocked the boat on to her side james walsham uttered an angry exclamation  you are a bad boy aggie said passionately you are a bad boy to break my boat and she burst into tears  i didnt mean to do it you little fool richard said angrily vexed more at his own clumsiness than at the damage it had caused what are you making such a beastly noise about and he gave her a push  it was not a hard one but the ground was slippery and the childs foot slipped and she fell at the edge of the pool her dress going partly into the water at the same instant richard reeled and almost fell beside her from a heavy blow between the eyes from jamess fist  you insolent blackguard he exclaimed furiously i will pay you for this and he rushed at james  the combat was not a long one hard work at rowing and sailing had strengthened jim walshams muscles and more than balanced the advantage in height and age of his adversary he had had too more than one fight in his time and after the first sudden burst of passion caused by the overthrow of aggie he fought coolly and steadily while richard rained his blows wildly without attempting to guard his face  the child on regaining her feet ran crying loudly towards the beach making for two fishermen who were engaged in mending a net some distance away but before she could reach them to beg for aid for her champion the fight was over terminating by a heavy righthanded hit from james which landed richard horton on his back in the pool  james stood quietly awaiting a renewal of the conflict when he arose but richard had had enough of it one of his eyes was already puffed and red his nose bleeding and his lip cut his clothes were soaked from head to foot and smeared with the red mud  i will pay you out for this you see if i dont richard gasped hoarsely  what have you had enough of it james said scornfully i thought you werent any good a fellow who would bully a little girl is sure to be a coward  richard moved as if he would renew the fight but he thought better of it and with a furious exclamation hurried away towards the hall  james without paying any further heed to him waded after the boat and having recovered it walked off towards the child who on seeing his opponent had moved off was running down to meet him  here is the boat aggie he said there is no great harm done only the mast and yard broken i can easily put you in fresh ones but the child paid no attention to the boat  he is a wicked bad boy jim and did he hurt you  oh no he didnt hurt me aggie at least nothing to speak of i hurt him a good deal more i paid him out well for breaking your boat and pushing you down the cowardly brute  only look jim she said holding out her frock what will she say  james laughed  mother wont say anything he said she is accustomed to my coming in all muddy  but she said keep your frock clean and its not clean aggie said in dismay  yes but that is not your fault little one i will make it all right with her dont you fret come on we had better go home and change it as soon as possible  they passed close by the two fishermen on their way  you gave it to the young squire finely master walsham one of them said and served him right too we chanced to be looking at the moment and saw it all he is a bad un he is by what they say up at the hall i heard one of the grooms talking last night down at the ship and a nice character he gave him this thrashing may do him some good and look you master walsham if he makes a complaint to the squire and its likely enough he will get up a fine story of how it came aboutthe groom said he could lie like king pharaohyou just send word to me and me and bill will go up to the squire and tell him the truth of the matter  mrs walsham felt somewhat alarmed when her son told her what had happened for the squire was a great man at sidmouth a magistrate and the owner of the greater part of the place as well as of the land around it and although mrs walsham did not hold the same exaggerated opinion of his powers as did the majority of his neighbours who would scarcely have dreamt of opposing it had the squire ordered anyone to be hung and quartered still she felt that it was a somewhat terrible thing that her son should have thrashed the nephew and heir of the great man  in the evening there was a knock at the door and the little maid came in with eyes wide open with alarm for she had heard of the afternoons battle to say that the constable wished to speak to mrs walsham  servant maam he said as he entered i am sorry to be here on an unpleasant business but i have got to say as the squire wishes to see master walsham in the justice room at ten oclock on a charge of salt and battery  dont you be afeard maam he went on confidentially i dont think as anything is going to be done to him i aint got no warrant and so i dont look upon it as regular business i expects it will be just a blowing up it will be just the squire and not the magistrate i takes it he told me to have him up there at ten but as he said nothing about custody i thought i would do it my own way and come to you quiet like so if you say as master walsham shall be up there at ten oclock ill just take your word for it and wont come to fetch him the doctor was allus very good to me and my missus and i shouldnt like to be walking through sidmouth with my hand on his sons collar  thank you hobson mrs walsham said quietly you can rely upon it my son shall be there punctually he has nothing to be afraid or ashamed of  full of rage as richard horton had been as he started for home he would never have brought the matter before the squire on his own account his case was too weak and he had been thrashed by a boy younger than himself thus he would have probably chosen some other way of taking his vengeance but it happened that just as he arrived home he met his tutor coming out the latter was astounded at richards appearance his eyes were already puffed so much that he could scarcely see out of them his lips were cut and swollen his shirt stained with blood his clothes drenched and plastered with red mud  why what on earth has happened richard  richard had already determined upon his version of the story  a brute of a boy knocked me down into the water he said and then knocked me about till he almost killed me  but what made him assault you in this outrageous manner his tutor asked surely all the boys about here must know you by sight and how one of them would dare to strike you i cannot conceive  i know the fellow richard said angrily he is the son of that doctor fellow who died two years ago  but what made him do it the tutor repeated  he was sailing his boat and it got stuck and he threw in some stones to get it off and i helped him and i happened to hit the mast of his beastly boat and then he flew at me like a tiger and thats all  well it seems to be a monstrous assault richard and you must speak to the squire about it  oh no i shant richard said hastily i dont want any row about it and i will pay him off some other way i could lick him easy enough if it had been a fair fight only he knocked me down before i was on my guard no i shant say anything about it  but richards tutor on thinking the matter over determined to speak to the squire only the evening before mr linthorne had surprised him by asking him several questions as to richards progress and conduct and had said something about examining him himself to see how he was getting on this had caused mr robertson no little alarm for he knew that even the most superficial questioning would betray the extent of richards ignorance and he had resolved that henceforth he would endeavour to assert his authority and to insist upon richards devoting a certain portion of each day regularly to study should the squire meet the boy anywhere about the house he must at once notice the condition of his face and even if he did not meet him he could not fail to notice it on sunday when he sat beside him in the pew it would be better therefore that he should at once report the matter to him  without saying a word to richard of his intentions he therefore went to the squires study and told him what had taken place as he had learned it from richard the squire listened silently  very well mr robertson you were quite right to tell me about it of course i cannot suffer my nephew to be treated in this manner at the same time i am sorry that it was walshams son i dont know anything about the boy and should not know him even by sight but i had an esteem for his father who was a hardworking man and i believe clever he used to attend here whenever any of the servants were ill and i had intended to do something for the boy i am sorry he has turned out so badly however i will have him up here and speak to him this sort of thing cannot be permitted  and accordingly orders were given to the constable when in the evening mr robertson informed richard what he had done the boy flew into a terrible passion and abused his tutor with a violence of language which shocked and astonished him and opened his eyes to his own culpability in allowing him to go on his way unchecked he in vain endeavoured to silence the furious lad he had been so long without exercising any authority that he had now no authority to exercise and after an angry scene richard flung himself out of the room and left his tutor in a state bordering on consternation    chapter 3 the justice room   richards feelings were not to be envied as he lay awake that night thinking over what had taken place in the morning it had never for a moment entered his mind that his tutor would repeat his statement to the squire and he would have given a good deal if he had not made it however there was nothing for him now but to stick to the story and he felt but little doubt of the result he had no idea that any but the actors in it had witnessed the scene by the pool and he felt confident that his uncle would as a matter of course take his word in preference to that of this boy who would naturally tell lies to screen himself of course the child was there but no one would mind what a baby like that said still it was a nuisance and he gnashed his teeth with rage at the interference of his tutor in the matter  i will get rid of him somehow before long he said i will pay him out for his meddling as sure as my names richard horton i will get him out of this before three months are gone  the next morning at breakfast richard received a message from the squire that he was to be present at ten oclock in the justice room and accordingly at that hour he presented himself there with a confident air but with an inward feeling of misgiving  the squire was sitting at his table with his clerk beside him mr robertson was in a chair a short distance off the constable was standing by the side of james walsham at the other end of the room mr linthorne nodded to his nephew  i wish you to repeat the story which you told mr robertson yesterday  richard had thought over whether it would be better to soften his story but as it had already been told to the squire he had concluded that there would be more danger in contradicting his first version than in sticking to it accordingly he repeated his story almost word for word as he had told it to mr robertson  what have you to say to this james walsham the squire asked this is a serious charge that you without any provocation assaulted and maltreated my nephew  i say it is all a lie sir james said fearlessly  the squire uttered a short exclamation of surprise and anger he had been at first favourably impressed with the appearance of the young prisoner though he had been surprised at seeing that he was younger than his nephew for he had expected to see a much older boy  that is not the way to speak sir he said sternly while the constable pressed a warning hand on jamess shoulder  well sir its not true then the boy said its all false from beginning to end except that i did strike him first but i struck him not because he had thrown a great stone and broken my boat but because he pushed a little girl who was with me down into the water  she slipped down i never pushed her richard broke in  hold your tongue sir the squire said sternly you have given your evidence i have now to hear what the accused has to say  now tell your story  james now gave his version of the affair  when he had ended mr linthorne said gravely have you any witnesses to call  yes sir there are two fishermen outside who saw it  bring them in the magistrate said to the constable  not a word was spoken in the justice room until the constable returned as james had told his story the magistrate had listened with disbelief it had not occurred to him that his nephew could have told a lie and he wondered at the calmness with which this boy told his story why were it true richard was a coward as well as a liar for with his superior age and height he should have been able to thrash this boy in a fair fight yet jamess face had not a mark while his nephews showed how severely he had been punished  but his eye fell upon richard when james said that he had witnesses he saw an unmistakable look of terror come over his face and the bitter conviction flashed across him that jamess story was the true one  there is no occasion to give him the book hobson he said as the constable was about to hand the testament to one of the fishermen this is a private investigation not a formal magisterial sitting and there is no occasion at this stage to take any evidence on oath  what is your name my man  john mullens your honour  well just tell me mullens what you know about this business  i was amending my nets yer honour along with simon harte and young master walsham was asailing his boat in a pool along with the little gal as lives at his mothers  how far were you from the spot where he was the squire asked  two hundred yards or so i should say the fisherman replied we was working behind a boat but we could see over it well enough presently we saw master horton come down and stand alongside the others  i said to simon he is a goodlooking young fellow is the squires nephew and the fishermans eye twinkled with a grim humour as he glanced at richards swollen face  the boat got stuck and master walsham threw something in close to it to get it off then i see master horton stoop and pick up a chunk of stone and chuck it hard and it hit the boat and knocked it over i see the little girl turn round and say something to master horton and then she put her apron up to her face and began to cry he gave her a sort of shove and she tumbled down into the edge of the pool  i says to simon what a shame but afore the words was out of my mouth master walsham he hits him and hits him hard too then there was a fight but master horton he hadnt a chance with james who gave him as sound a licking as ever you seed and ending with knocking him backwards into the pool then he gets up and shakes his fist at james and then goes off as hard as he could thats all i know about it  its a wicked lie richard burst out they have made it up between them there was nobody there  hold your tongue sir i tell you the squire said so sternly that richard who had risen from his seat shrank back again and remained silent while simon harte gave his evidence which was almost identical with that of the other fisherman  have you any other witnesses the magistrate asked james  only the little girl sir but i did not bring her up she is so little i thought it was better she should not come but i can send for her if you wish it  it is not necessary mr linthorne said i have heard quite sufficient the manner in which you and these fishermen have given your evidence convinces me that you are speaking the truth and i am sorry that you should have been placed in this position you will understand that this is not a formal court and therefore that there is no question of discharging you i can only say that having heard the story of what took place at this fight between you and my nephew i am convinced that you did what any other boy of spirit would have done under the same circumstances and that the punishment which you administered to him was thoroughly deserved  good morning  james walsham and his witnesses left the room mr linthorne rose and saying to his nephew follow me sir went to his study  without saying a word as to what had passed he took down some books from the shelves and proceeded to examine richard in them a few minutes sufficed to show that the boy was almost absolutely ignorant of latin while a few questions in geography and history showed that he was equally deficient in these also  that will do the squire said go up to your room and remain there until i send for you  an hour after this a dog cart came round to the door mr robertson took his place in it with his trunk and was driven away to exeter never to return  for two days richard remained a prisoner in his room his meals were brought up to him but the servant who came with them answered no questions telling him that the squires orders were that he was not to hold any conversation with him there was indeed a deep pleasure among the servants at the hall at the knowledge that richard horton was in disgrace the exact circumstances of the affair were unknown for the fishermen had not been present when richard had told his story and mrs walsham who was much shocked when james told her the circumstances had impressed upon him that it was better to say nothing more about it  you are clear in the matter jim and that is enough for you the squire will no doubt punish his nephew for the wicked lies he has told some day you know the boy will be master here dont let us set everyone against him by telling this disgraceful story  so beyond the fact that there had been a fight between james walsham and the squires nephew and that richard horton had been thrashed and that the squire himself had said that it served him right sidmouth knew nothing of what had taken place in the justice room  mr linthornes first impulse had been to send his nephew at once back to his parents with the message that he would have nothing more to do with him but though he had the reputation of being a stern man the squire was a very kindhearted one he was shocked to find that the boy was a liar and that to shield himself he had invented this falsehood against his opponent but upon reflection he acknowledged that he himself had been to blame in the matter he had taken the boy into his house had assigned to him the position of his heir and had paid no further attention to him  unfortunately the man he had selected as his tutor had proved false to the trust the boy had been permitted to run wild his head was turned with the change in his prospects his faults had grown unchecked it was to be said for him that he had not intended in the first place to bring his opponent into disgrace by making this false accusation against him for his tutor had acknowledged that he had said he did not intend to tell him or to take any step in the matter and his position of accuser had been to some extent forced upon him by the necessity of his confirming the tale which he had told to account for his being thrashed by a boy smaller than himself  yes it would be unfair upon the boy utterly to cast him off for this first offence he would give him one more trial  the result of the squires reflection was that on the third day of his imprisonment richard was sent for to the study the squire did not motion to him to sit down and he remained standing with as the squire said to himself a hangdog look upon his face  i have been thinking over this matter quietly richard for i did not wish to come to any hasty conclusion my first impulse was to pack you off home and have no more to do with you but i have thought better of it mean and despicable as your conduct has been i take some blame to myself for not having seen that your tutor did his duty by you therefore i have resolved to give you another chance but not here i could not bear to have a boy who has proved himself a despicable liar about me but i will try and think that this was a first offence and that the lesson which it has taught you may influence all your future life and that you may yet grow up an honourable man  but you will remember that henceforth you are on trial and that the position in which you will stand by my will will depend solely and entirely on your own conduct if you prove by that that this lesson has had its effect that you deeply repent of your conduct and are resolved to do your best to be henceforth straight honourable and true you will at my death occupy the position i have intended for you if not not one single penny of my money will you get i am going to put you in a school where you will be looked strictly after and where you will have every chance of retrieving yourself i have just written to a friend of mine a post captain in his majestys service asking him to receive you as a midshipman i have told him frankly that you have been somewhat over indulged and that the discipline of the sea life will be of great benefit to you and have requested him to keep a tight hand over you and let me know occasionally how you are going on i have told him that your position as my heir will to a very large extent depend upon his reports and have asked him in the name of our old friendship to be perfectly frank and open in them with me i have said he is my eldest nephew but i have others who will take his place if he is unworthy of the position and although i should be sorry if he should be found wanting i will commit the interests of all the tenants and people on my estate to no one who is not in every respect an honourable gentleman  that will do sir you need not remain longer in your room but you will not leave the grounds my friends ship is at portsmouth at present and doubtless i shall receive an answer in the course of a few days until then the less we see each other the more pleasant for us both  there were few more miserable boys in england than richard horton during the week which elapsed before the answer to the squires letter was received it cannot be said that in the true sense of the word he was sorry for his fault he was furious with himself not because he had lied but because of the consequences of the lie a thousand times he called himself a fool for having imperilled his position and risked being sent back again to the dingy house in london merely to excuse himself for being thrashed by a boy smaller than himself mad with his folly not in having invented the story but in having neglected to look round to assure himself that there were no witnesses who would contradict it he wandered disconsolate about the gardens and park cursing what he called his fortune  it was an additional sting to his humiliation that he knew every servant in and about the house rejoiced at his discomfiture and he imagined that there was a veiled smile of satisfaction at his bruised visage and his notorious disgrace with the squire on the face of every man he met outside and of every woman who passed him in the house  during the whole week he did not venture near the stables for there he knew that he had rendered himself specially obnoxious and there was nothing for him to do but to saunter listlessly about the garden until the day arrived that the letter came granting the squires request and begging that he might be sent off at once as the vessel would probably put to sea in a few days  now richard the squire said that evening to him in a kinder voice than he had used on the last occasion you understand exactly how we stand towards each other that being so i do not wish to maintain our present uncomfortable relations you have had your punishment and unless i hear to the contrary i shall assume that the punishment has had its effect when you return from sea after your first voyage you will come home here as if nothing had happened and this business need never be alluded to between us if you turn out as i have hitherto believed you to be i shall receive you as warmly as if my opinion of you had never been shaken  i have requested captain sinclair to let me know what is the average allowance that the midshipmen receive from their parents and shall see that you have as much as your messmates i have also asked him to kindly allow one of his officers to order you a proper outfit in all respects and to have the bill sent in to me so now my boy you will have a fresh and a fair start and i trust that you will turn out everything that i can wish  i will try sir i will indeed richard said earnestly and he spoke from his heart for the inheritance was very dear to him and it would be a terrible thing indeed to forfeit it  for two years after richard hortons departure things went on quietly at sidmouth james walsham continued to make a pet and a playmate of little aggie her outofdoor life had made her strong and sturdy and she was able to accompany him in all his rambles while when he was at work at home preparing fishing lines making boats or otherwise amusing himself she was content to sit hours quietly beside him chattering incessantly and quite content with an occasional brief answer to the questions when he was studying she too would work at her lessons and however much she might be puzzled over these she would never disturb him by asking him questions when so engaged  she was an intelligent child and the hours lesson morning and afternoon soon grew into two she was eager to learn and rapidly gained ground on mrs walshams older pupils during the two years that lady never had cause to regret that she had yielded to the sergeants entreaties aggie was no trouble in the house which she brightened with her childish laughter and merry talk and her companionship jamess mother could not but think did the boy much good it softened his manner and although he still often went out with the fishermen he was no longer thrown entirely for companionship upon the boys on the beach  the sergeant came and went seldom being more than two months without paying a visit to sidmouth the child was always delighted to see her grandfather and james took to him greatly and liked nothing better than to stroll up with him to a sheltered spot on the hillside where he would throw himself down on the grass while the sergeant smoked his pipe and told him stories of his travels and adventures and aggie ran about looking for wildflowers or occasionally sat down for a while to listen also  the squire lived his usual lonely life up at the hall the absence of his nephew whose ship had sailed for a foreign station was a relief rather than otherwise to him it had from the first been a painful effort to him to regard this boy as his heir and he had only done it when heartsick from a long and fruitless search for one who would have been nearer and dearer to him nor had he ever taken to the lad personally the squire felt that there was not the ring of true metal in him the careless way in which he spoke of his parents showed a want of heart and although his uncle was ignorant how much the boy made himself disliked in the household he was conscious himself of a certain antipathy for him which led him to see as little of him as possible  the two years for which the sergeant had placed his grandchild with mrs walsham came to an end that he did not intend to continue the arrangement she judged from something he said on the occasion of his last visit two months before the time was up but he gave no hint as to what he intended to do with her  in those weeks mrs walsham frequently thought the matter over that the sergeant had plans for the child she could hardly doubt the child herself had told her that she knew of no other relations than her grandfather and yet he could hardly intend to take her about with him after placing her for two years in a comfortable home she was but seven years old nowfar too young to go out into a place as servant girl in a farm house she doubted not that the sergeant had expended the whole of his savings and she thought him foolish in not having kept her with him for some little time longer or if he could not do that he might have placed her with some honest people who would have kept her for the sum he had paid until she was old enough to take a place as a nurse girl  and yet while she argued thus mrs walsham felt that the old showman had not acted without weighing the whole matter there must be something in it which she did not understand in fact he had said so when he placed the child with her  as the time approached she became more worried at the thought of aggie leaving her the little one had wound herself very closely round her heart the expense of keeping her was small indeed the cost of her food next to nothing while the extra girl whom mrs walsham had taken on when she first came had been retained but a very short time jamess constant companionship with her rendering the keeping of a nurse altogether unnecessary  at last she made up her mind that she would offer to keep her on without pay she and james would miss her companionship sorely and it could not be considered an extravagance since the money she had received for her would pay for the cost of her keep for years to come when mrs walshams mind was once made up her only fear was that these mysterious plans of the sergeant would not allow him to leave aggie with her  punctual to the day sergeant wilks arrived and after a little talk in the parlour as usual with james and aggie present he formally requested the favour of a conversation with mrs walsham alone  take aggie for a walk james do not stay out above three quarters of an hour as your tea will be ready for you then  you must have wondered maam a good deal the sergeant began when they were alone why i who get my living by travelling the country with a peep show wished to place my grandchild in a position above her and to have her taught to be a little lady it is time now that i should tell you aggie is my granddaughter but she is the granddaughter too of squire linthorne up at the hall  bless me mrs walsham ejaculated too astonished for any further expression of her feelings  yes maam she is the daughter of the squires son herbert who married my daughter cissie  dear me dear me mrs walsham said what an extraordinary thing of course i remember herbert linthorne a handsome pleasant young fellow he was on bad terms as everyone heard eight years ago with his father because he married somebody beneathi mean somebody of whom the squire did not approve a year afterwards we heard that he was dead and there was a report that his wife was dead too but that was only a rumour the squire went away just at the time and did not come back for months afterwards and after that he was altogether changed before he had been one of the most popular men in this part of the country but now he shut himself up gave up all his acquaintances and never went outside the park gates except to come down to church i remember it gave us quite a shock when we saw him for the first timehe seemed to have grown an old man all at once everyone said that the death of his son had broken his heart  and aggie is his granddaughter well well you have astonished me but why did you not tell me before  there were a good many reasons maam i thought in the first place you might refuse me if you knew for it might do you harm the squire is a vindictive man and he is landlord of your house and if he came to know that you had knowingly taken in his granddaughter there was no saying how he might have viewed it then if you had known it you might have thought you ought to keep her in and not let her run about the country with your son and altogether it would not have been so comfortable for you or her i chose to put her at sidmouth because i wanted to come here often to hear how the squire was going on for if he had been taken ill i should have told him sooner than i intended  but why did you not tell him before mrs walsham asked  just selfishness maam i could not bring myself to run the risk of having to give her up she was mine as much as his and was a hundred times more to me than she could be to him i took her a baby from her dead mothers arms i fed her and nursed her taught her her first words and her first prayer why should i offer to give her up to him who likely enough would not accept the offer when it was made to him but i always intended to make it some day it was my duty to give her the chance at least but i kept on putting off the day till that saturday when she was so nearly drowned then i saw my duty before me  i had from the first put aside a hundred pounds to give her more of an education than i could do but if it hadnt been for that fall into the sea it might have been years before i carried out my plan then i saw it could not go on any longer she was getting too old and too bold to sit quiet while i was showing my box she had had a narrow escape and who could say what might happen the next time she got into mischief then i bethought me that the squire was growing old and that it was better not to put it off too long so maam i came to you and made up my mind to put her with you  and you had your way mrs walsham said smiling though it was with some difficulty  i expected it would be difficult maam but i made up my mind to that and had you kept on refusing i should as a last chance have told you whose child she was  but why me mrs walsham asked why were you so particularly anxious that she should come to me of all people  the sergeant smiled  its difficult to tell you maam but i had a reason  but what was it mrs walsham persisted  the sergeant hesitated  you may think me an old fool maam but i will tell you what fancy came into my mind your son saved aggies life he was twelve years old she was five seven years difference  why what nonsense sergeant mrs walsham broke in with a laugh you dont mean to say that fancy entered your head  it did maam sergeant wilks said gravely i liked the look of the boy much he was brave and modest and a gentleman i spoke about him to the fishermen that night and everyone had a good word for him so i said to myself i cant reward him for what he has done directly but it may be that i can indirectly  aggie is only a child but she has a loving faithful little heart and i said to myself if i throw her with this boy who she knows has saved her life for two years she is sure to have a strong affection for him  many things may happen afterwards if the squire takes her they will be separated he may get to care for someone and so may she but its just giving him a chance  then too i thought a little about myself i liked to fancy that even though she would have to go from me to the squire my little plan may yet turn out and it would be i not he who had arranged for the future happiness of my little darling i shouldnt have told you all this maam but you would have it  i am glad you brought her to me sergeant wilks anyhow mrs walsham said for i love her dearly and she has been a great pleasure to me but what you are talking about is simply nonsense my son is a good boy and will i hope grow up an honourable gentleman like his father but he cannot look so high as the granddaughter of squire linthorne  more unequal marriages have been made than that maam the sergeant said sturdily but we wont say more about it i have thought it over and over many a hundred times as i wheeled my box across the hills and it dont seem to me impossible i will agree that the squire would never say yes but the squire may be in his grave years before aggie comes to think about marriage besides it is more than likely that he will have nothing to say to my pet if his pride made him cast his son off rather than acknowledge my daughter as his it will keep him from acknowledging her daughter as his grandchild i hope it will with all my heart i hope so  in that case sergeant wilks mrs walsham said let this be her home for the time before you told me your story i had made up my mind to ask you to let her remain with me you need feel under no obligation for the money you have paid me is amply sufficient to pay for the expenses of what she eats for years it will be a real pleasure for me to keep her for she has become a part of the house and we should miss her sorely indeed she is quick and intelligent and i will teach her all i know and can train her up to take a situation as a governess in a gentlemans family or perhaps and she laughed your little romance might come true some day and she can in that case stop in this home until james makes her another  you are very kind maam the sergeant said truly kind indeed and i humbly accept your offer except that so long as i live she shall be no expense to you i earn more than enough for my wants and can at any rate do something towards preventing her from being altogether a burden on your hands and now maam how would you recommend me to go to work with the vindictive old man up at the hall  i shouldnt have thought he was vindictive that is not at all the character he bears  no the sergeant said i hear him spoken well of but i have seen in other cases men who have had the name of being pleasant and generous were yet tyrants and brutes in their own family i judge him as i found hima hard hearted tyrannical vindictive father i think i had better not see him myself we have never met i have never set eyes on him save here in church but he regarded me as responsible for the folly of his son he wrote me a violent letter and said i had inveigled the lad into the marriage and although i might have told him it was false i did not answer his letter for the mischief was done then and i hoped he would cool down in time  however that is all past now but i dont wish to see him i was thinking of letting the child go to the hall by herself and drop in suddenly upon him she is very like her father and may possibly take his heart by storm  yes mrs walsham assented now i know who she is i can see the likeness strongly yes i should think that that would be the best way people often yield to a sudden impulse who will resist if approached formally or from a distance but have you any reason to suppose that he will not receive her did he refuse at first to undertake the charge of the child does he even know that she is alive it may be that all these years he has been anxious to have her with him and that you have been doing him injustice altogether  i never thought of it in that light the sergeant said after a pause he never came near his son when he lay dying never wrote a line in answer to his letters if a man could not forgive his son when he lay dying how could he care for a grandchild he had never seen  that may be so sergeant wilks but his sons death certainly broke him down terribly and it may be that he will gladly receive his granddaughter  but there are the young ones back again i will think over what you have been telling me and we can discuss it again tomorrow    chapter 4 the squires granddaughter   the following day another council was held and mrs walsham told the sergeant that on thinking it over she had concluded that the best way would be to take the old butler at the hall who had served the family for fortyfive years into their confidence and to ask him to arrange how best aggie might be introduced to the squire  i have been thinking over what you said maam and it may be that you are right and that i have partly misjudged the squire i hope so for aggies sake and yet i cannot help feeling sorry i have always felt almost sure he would have nothing to say to her and i have clung to the hope that i should not lose my little girl i know of course how much better it will be for her and have done all i could to make her so that she should be fit for it if he took her but it will be a wrench maam i cant help feeling it will be a wrench and the old soldiers voice quivered as he spoke  it cannot be otherwise sergeant mrs walsham said kindly you have been everything to each other and though for her good and happiness you are ready to give her up it is a heavy sacrifice for you to make  that afternoon the sergeant went for a long walk alone with aggie and when they returned mrs walsham saw by the flushed cheeks and the swollen eyes of the child that she had been crying james noticed it also and saw that she seemed depressed and quiet he supposed that her grandfather had been telling her that he was going to take her away for hitherto nothing had been said in her hearing as to the approaching termination of the stay with his mother  as they came out of church mrs walsham had waited for a moment at the door and had told the butler at the hall that she wished particularly to speak to him that afternoon if he could manage to come down they were not strangers for the doctor had attended johns wife in her last illness and he had sometimes called with messages from the hall when the doctor was wanted there  john petersham was astonished indeed when mrs walsham informed him that the little girl he had seen in her pew in church was his masters granddaughter  you dont say so maam you dont say as that pretty little thing is master herberts child but why didnt you say so afore why i have caught myself looking at her and wondering how it was that i seemed to know her face so well and now of course i sees it she is the picture of master herbert when he was little  i couldnt say so before john because i only knew it myself last night her grandfatherthat is her other grandfather you knowplaced her with me to educate and as he said to make a little lady of two years ago but it was only last night he told me  only to think of it the butler ejaculated what will the squire say  yes that is the point john what will the squire say her grandfather thinks he will have nothing to say to her  nothing to say to her maam why he will be off his head with joy didnt he search for her and advertise for her and do all he could to find her for months it wasnt till he tried for over a year that he gave it up and sent for richard horton to come to him  her grandfather can only judge by what he knows john he tells me that the son wrote to his father over and over again on his deathbed and that he never came near him or took any notice of the letters  thats true enough maam the butler said sadly and it is what has pretty nigh broken the squires heart he was obstinate like at first and he took me with him when he travelled about across the sea among the foreigners and when he was at a place they called athens he got a fever and he was down for weeks we came home by sea and the winds was foul and we made a long voyage of it and when we got home there was letters that had been lying months and months for us and among them was those letters of master herberts  the squire wasnt an hour in the house afore the carriage was round to the door and we posted as hard as horses could take us right across england to broadstairs never stopping a minute except to change horses and when we got there it was a month too late and there was nothing to do but to go to the churchyard and to see the stone under which master herbert and his young wife was laid  the house where they had died was shut up there had been a sale and the man who was the father of master herberts wife was gone and we learned there had been a baby born and that had gone too the squire was like a madman blaming himself for his sons death and araving to think what must master herbert have thought of him when he never answered his letters i had a terrible time with him and then he set to work to find the child but as i told you we never did find it or hear a word of it from that time to this and the squire has never held up his head he will be pretty well out of his mind with joy  i am very glad to hear what you say john mrs walsham said i could hardly fancy the squire who always has borne such a name for kindness being so hard that he would not listen to his dying sons entreaties  no maam the squire was hard for a bit master herberts marriage was a sad disappointment to him he had made up his mind he was going to do so well and to cut such a figure in the world but he would have come round lord bless you he only meant to hold out for a bit when he was ill at athens he was talking all the time about forgiving his son and i could see how hard it had been to him to keep separated from him on the voyage home he fidgeted ever so at the delay and i knew that the first thing he did when he got back would be to write to master herbert and tell him to bring his wife down to the hall theres not a hard corner in the squires heart  i thank the good god for the news you have told me maam its the best i ever heard in all my life  mrs walsham now told him how the child had been brought up and then the sergeant himself who was waiting in the next room was brought in and to him john petersham related the story of the squires illness the reason of the letters not reaching him for months after they had been written and his intense sorrow and self reproach at having arrived too late and told him of the efforts that had been made to find the child the sergeant listened in grave silence  i am glad it is so he said after a pause i have misjudged the squire and i am glad of it it will be a blow to me to lose the child i do not pretend that it wont but it is for her good and i must be content he can hardly object to my seeing her sometimes and if i know that she is well and happy that is all i care for and now the sooner its over the better can she come up this evening  surely she can john petersham said the squire dines at five if you will bring her up at six i will take her in to him  and so it was arranged and in his walk with aggie afterwards the sergeant told her the history of her parents and that squire linthorne was her other grandfather and that she was to go up and see him that evening  aggie had uttered her protest against fate she did not wish to leave her grampa who had been so good to her and mrs walsham and james the description of the big house and its grandeurs and the pleasures of a pony for herself offered no enticement to her and weeping she flung her arms round her grandfathers neck and implored him not to give her up  i must my dear it is my duty i wish to god that it were not you know how i love you aggie and how hard it is for me to part with you but it is for your good my darling you maynt see it now but when you get older you will know it it will not be so hard now on me dear nor on you as it would have been had i given you up two years ago but we have learned to do a little without each other  but you will come and see me just as you have here wont you aggie said still weeping  i hope so my dear you see the squire is your fathers father while i am only your mothers father and somehow the law makes him nearer to you than i am and he will have the right to say what you must do  i wont stay with him i wont aggie said passionately if he wont let you come  you must not say that dear the sergeant said we must all do our duty even when that duty is hard to do and your duty will be to obey the squires orders and to do as he tells you i have no doubt he will be very kind and that you will be very happy with him and i hope he will let you see me sometimes  it was a long time before the child was at all reconciled when her sobs began to cease her grandfather told her what she was to do when she saw the squire  you will remember my dear that i have been more fortunate than he has i have had you all these years and he has had no one to love or care for him you must remember that he was not to blame because he objected to his son marrying my daughter they were not in the same position of life and it was only natural that he should not like it at first and as i told you he was coming home to make them both happy when he found it was too late  you must think dear that while i have been happy all these years with you he has been sorrowing and grieving and you must try and love him and make up to him for what he has suffered i know you will not forget your old friends you will love me whether you see me often or not and mrs walsham who has been very kind to you and james you know who saved your life  i shall never forget anyone grampa i shall always love you better than anyone the child exclaimed throwing her arms round his neck with a fresh burst of tears  there there my pet the sergeant said soothingly you must not cry any more i want you to look your best this evening you know and to do credit to us all and now i think we have settled everything so we will be going back to tea  that evening the squire was sitting by himself in the great dining room occasionally sipping the glass of port which john petersham had poured out before he left the room the curtains were drawn and the candles lighted for it was late in september and the evenings were closing in fast and the squire was puzzling over john petershams behaviour at dinner  although the squire was not apt to observe closely what was passing around him he had been struck with the old butlers demeanour that something was wrong with him was clear usually he was the most quiet and methodical of servants but he had blundered several times in the service he had handed his master dishes when his plate was already supplied he had spilled the wine in pouring it out he had started nervously when spoken to mr linthorne even thought that he had seen tears in his eyes altogether he was strangely unlike himself  mr linthorne had asked him if anything was the matter but john had with almost unnecessary earnestness declared there was nothing altogether the squire was puzzled with any other servant he would have thought he had been drinking but such a supposition in johns case was altogether out of the question  he could have had no bad news so far as the squire knew for the only children he had had died young and he had no near relatives or connections it was ridiculous to suppose that john at his age had fallen in love altogether the squire failed to suggest to himself any explanation of his old butlers conduct and had just concluded philosophically by the reflection that he supposed he should know what it was sooner or later when the door of the room quietly opened  the squire did not look up it closed again as quietly and then he glanced towards it he could hardly believe his eyes a child was standing therea girl with soft smooth hair and large eyes and a sensitive mouth with an expression fearless but appealing her hands were clasped before her and she was standing in doubt whether to advance there was something so strange in this apparition in the lonely room that the squire did not speak for a moment it flashed across him vaguely that there was something familiar to him in the face and expression something which sent a thrill through him and at the same instant without knowing why he felt that there was a connection between the appearance of the child and the matter he had just been thinking ofjohn petershams strange conduct he was still looking at her when she advanced quietly towards him  grandpapa she said i am aggie linthorne  a low cry of astonishment broke from the squire he pushed his chair back  can it be true he muttered or am i dreaming  yes grandpapa the child said close beside him now i am aggie linthorne and i have come to see you if you dont think its me grampa said i was to give you this and then you would know and she held out a miniature on ivory of a boy some fourteen years old and a watch and chain  i do not need them the squire said in low tones i see it in your face you are herberts child whom i looked for so long  oh my child my child have you come at last and he drew her towards him and kissed her passionately while the tears streamed down his cheeks  i couldnt come before you know the child said because i didnt know about you and grampa thats my other grandpapa she nodded confidentially did not know you wanted me but now he knows he sent me to you he told me i was to come because you were lonely  but you cant be more lonely than he is she said with a quiver in her voice oh he will be lonely now  but where do you come from my dear and how did you get here and what have you been doing all these years  grampa brought me here the child said i call him grampa you know because i did when i was little and i have always kept to it but i know of course it ought to be grandpapa he brought me here and johnat least he called him johnbrought me in and i have been living for two years with mrs walsham down in the town and i used to see you in church but i did not know that you were my grandpapa  the squire who was holding her close to him while she spoke got up and rang the bell and john opened the door with a quickness that showed that he had been waiting close to it anxiously waiting a summons  john petersham the squire said give me your hand this is the happiest day of my life  the two men wrung each others hands they had been friends ever since john petersham who was twelve years the senior of the two first came to the house a young fellow of eighteen to assist his father who had held the same post before him  god be thanked squire he said huskily  god be thanked indeed john the squire rejoined reverently so this was the reason old friend why your hand shook as you poured out my wine how could you keep the secret from me  i did not know how to begin to tell you but i was pretty nigh letting it out and only the thought that it was better the little lady should tell you herself as we had agreed kept it in only to think squire after all these years but i never quite gave her up i always thought somehow as she would come just like this  did you john i gave up hope years ago how did it come about john  mrs walsham told me as i came out of church today as she wanted to speak to me so i went down and she told me all about it and then i saw him john hesitated at the name for he knew that perhaps the only man in the world against whom his master cherished a bitter resentment was the father of his sons wife it seems he never saw your advertisements never knew as you wanted to hear anything of the child so he took her away and kept her he has been here off and on all these years i heard tell of him often and often when i had been down into sidmouth but never dreamt as it was him he went about the country with a box on wheels with glassesa peep show as they calls it  the squire winced  he is well spoken of squire john said and i am bound to say as he doesnt seem the sort of man we took him for at all not by no means he did not know you wanted to have her but he thought it his duty to give her the chance and so he put her with mrs walsham and never told her till yesterday who she was mrs walsham was quite grieved at parting with her for she says she is wonderfully quick at her lessons and has been like a daughter with her for the last two years  the child had sat quietly down in a chair and was looking into the fire while the two men were speaking she had done what she was told to do and was waiting quietly for what was to come next her quick ear however caught in the tones of john petersham an apologetic tone when speaking of her grandfather and she was moved to instant anger  why do you speak like that of my grampa she said rising to her feet and standing indignantly before him he is the best man in the world and the kindest and the nicest and if you dont like him i can go away to him again i dont want to stay here not one minute  you may be my grandpapa she went on turning to the squire and you may be lonely but he is lonely too and you have got a great house and all sorts of nice things and you can do better without me than he can for he has got nothing to love but me poor grampa  and her eyes filled with sudden tears as she thought of him tramping on his lonely walks over the hills  we do not mean to speak unkindly of your grandfather my dear the squire said gently i have never seen him you know and john has never seen him but once i have thought all these years bitterly of him but perhaps i have been mistaken he has ever been kind and good to you and above all he has given you back to me and that will make me think differently of him in future we all make mistakes you know and i have made terrible mistakes and have been terribly punished for them i daresay i have made a mistake here but whether or no you shall never hear a word from me against the man who has been so kind to you  and you will let me see him sometimes grandpapa the child said taking his hand pleadingly he said if you said no i must do as you told me because somehow you are nearer to me than he is though i dont know how that can be but you wont say that will you for oh i know he is so lonely without me and i should never be happy thinking of him all alone not if you were to be ever so kind to me and to give me all sorts of grand things  no my dear i certainly shall not say so you shall see him as often as you like  oh thank you grandpapa she exclaimed joyfully and she held up her face to kiss him  the squire lifted her in his arms and held her closely to him  john he said you must tell mrs morcombe to get a room ready for my granddaughter at once and you had better bring the tea in here and then we will think of other things i feel quite bewildered at present  when john returned with the tea aggie was sitting on the squires knee she was perfectly at home now and had been chattering to him of her life with her grandfather and had just related the incident of her narrow escape from drowning  do you hear that john the squire said she was nearly drowned here within sight of our home and i might never have known anything about it it seems that lad of dr walshams saved her life he is a fine lad he was her champion you know in that affair with my nephew how strange that the two boys should have quarrelled over my granddaughter  yes squire and young walsham came well out of it john said heartily for to him only did the squire mention the circumstances of the case and he chuckled now to himself as he thought that richard horton had made an even greater mistake in that matter than he thought of for john detested the boy with all his heart and had only abstained from reporting his conduct to the squire from fear of giving his master pain  the squires brow clouded a little at the allusion  it will make a difference to him john he said for of course now my granddaughter will take his place  and a good thing too john said heartily i have never said a word before squire because as you had chosen him as your heir there was no use in setting you against him but a more hatefuller lad than richard horton i never comed across and so said everyone here you did not see much of him squire and natural thought well of him for he was a goodlooking boy and could speak fair enough when he liked i thought well of him myself when he first came but i larned better afterwards  there are many excuses to be made for him john the squire said and i have had good reports of him since of course i shall see that although he can no longer be regarded as my heir here he shall be well provided for but there will be plenty of time to think of this  mr wilks asked me to say sir the butler said as he prepared to leave them that he shall be staying in sidmouth tomorrow and that if you wish to see him he will come up here  certainly i wish to see him the squire replied i have many things to ask him let the boy go down the first thing in the morning orno if you dont mind john would you go down yourself tonight he will naturally be anxious to know how his grandchild is getting on tell him with what joy i have received her and take any message she may give you  is there anything you would like to say to your grandfather child  oh yes please tell him that i think i shall like it and that he is to come and see me when he likes and that of course he is to see me when he comes in the morning and then i can tell him all about it  and say i shall be glad to see him the first thing after breakfast the squire added  the housekeeper soon entered and aggie very sleepy after the excitements of the day was taken off to bed her sleepiness however disappeared in her wonder at the size of the house and at the vastness of her bedroom  why you have got a fire she exclaimed in astonishment i never saw a fire in a bedroom before  i didnt light it for the cold miss the housekeeper said but because it is a long time since the room was slept in before and because i thought it would be cheerful for you i shall sleep in the next room till things are settled so that if you want anything you will only have to run in  thank you aggie said gratefully it does all seem so big but i am sure not to want anything thank you  here is your box miss would you like me to help undress you  oh no aggie laughed why of course i can undress myself and she laughed at the idea of assistance being required in such a matter  then good night the housekeeper said i shall leave the door ajar between the two rooms when i come to bed  the next morning soon after breakfast sergeant wilks was ushered into the study where the squire was expecting him the two men had had hard thoughts of each other for many years the squire regarded the sergeant as a man who had inveigled his son into marrying his daughter while the sergeant regarded the squire as a heartless and unnatural father who had left his son to die alone among strangers the conversation with john petersham had taught the sergeant that he had wronged the squire by his estimate of him and that he was to be pitied rather than blamed in the matter the squire on his part was grateful to the sergeant for the care he had bestowed upon the child and for restoring her to him and was inclined indeed at the moment to a universal goodwill to all men  the sergeant was pale but self possessed and quiet while the squire moved by the events of the night before out of the silent reserve in which he had for years enveloped himself was agitated and nervous he was the first to speak  mr wilks he said i have to give you my heartfelt thanks for having restored my granddaughter to methe more so as i know from what she has said how great a sacrifice you must be making john has been telling me of his conversation with you and you have learned from him that i was not so wholly heartless and unnatural a father as you must have thought me deeply as i blame myself and shall always blame myself in the matter  yes the sergeant said i have learned that i have misread you had it not been so i should have brought the child to you long agoshould never have taken her away indeed perhaps we have both misjudged each other  i fear that we have the squire said remembering the letters he wrote to his son in his anger denouncing the sergeant in violent language  it does not matter now the sergeant went on quietly but as i do not wish aggie ever to come to think ill of me in the future it is better to set it right  when i left the army i had saved enough money to furnish a house and i took one at southampton and set up taking lodgers there i had my pension and lived well until my wife dieda year before your son came down from london with another gentleman and took my rooms my daughter was seventeen when her mother died and she took to managing the house i was careful of her and gave her orders that on no account was she ever to go into the lodgers rooms i waited on them myself  how your son first saw her and got to speak to her i dont know but i am not surprised that when he did he loved her for there was no prettier or sweeter girl in hampshire they took the rooms first only for a fortnight then the other gentleman went away and your son stayed on  one dayit came upon me like a thunderboltyour son told me he wanted to marry my agnes i was angry at first angry because it had been done behind my back and because i had been deceived i said as much but your son assured me that he had never spoken to her in the house but had met her when she went out for her walks still it was wrong and i told him so and i told her so though in my heart i did not altogether blame them for young people will be young people and as he had acted honourably in coming to me at once i let that pass  but squire though but a sergeant in his majestys service i had my pride as you had yours and i told him at once that i would not give my consent to my daughters marrying him until you had given yours and that he must leave the house at once and not see agnes again until he came with your written consent to show me  he went away at once after a time he began to write to me urging me to change my decision and from this although he never said so i was sure that you had refused to sanction his marriage however i stuck to what i had said though it was hard for me to do so with my child growing thin and pale before my eyes with all her bright happiness gone  so it went on for three months and then one morning she was gone and i found a letter on her table for me saying that she had been married to him a week before when she went out as i thought to spend the day with a friend she begged and prayed me to forgive her and said how miserable she had been and that she could not say no to her lovers pleadings  i wrote to the address she had given me saying that she had well nigh broken my heart she knew that i had only refused my consent because it would have seemed a dishonourable action to allow your son to marry her without your consent she knew how hard it had been for me to do my duty when i saw her pining before my eyes but i forgave her wholly and did not altogether blame her seeing that it was the way of nature that young women when they once took to loving should put their father altogether in the second place  it was hard to me to write that letter for i longed to see her bonny face again but i thought it was my duty i thought so then but i think now it was pride  from time to time she wrote to me i learned that you still refused to see your son and i gathered though she did not say much of this that things were going badly with them at last she wrote that her husband was illvery ill she feared he had in vain tried to get employment i dont think he was naturally strong and the anxiety had broken him down then i went up to london at once and found them in a little room without the necessaries of life i brought them down home and nursed him for three months till he died  a week later aggie was born ten days afterwards i laid her mother by the side of her father no answer had come to the letters he had written to you while he had been ill though in the later ones he had told you that he was dying so i looked upon the child as mine  things had gone badly with me i had been able to take no lodgers while they were with me i had got into debt and even could i have cleared myself i could not well have kept the house on without a woman to look after it i was restless too and longed to be moving about so i sold off the furniture paid my debts and laid by the money that remained for the childs use in the future  i had some time before met an old comrade travelling the country with a show i happened to meet him again just as i was leaving and he told me the name of a man in london who sold such things i left the child for a year with some people i knew a few miles out of southampton came up to london bought a show and started it was lonely work at first but after a year i fetched the child away and took her round the country with me and for four years had a happy time of it  i had chosen this part of the country and after a time i became uneasy in my mind as to whether i was doing right and whether for the childs sake i ought not to tell you that she was alive and offer to give her up if you were willing to take her i heard how your sons death had changed you and thought that maybe you would like to take his daughter but before bringing her to you i thought she should have a better education than i had time to give her and that she should be placed with a lady so that if you took her you need not be ashamed of her manners  i hoped you would not take her i wanted to keep her for myself but my duty to her was clear  and now squire you know all about it i have been wrong to keep her so long from you i grant but i can only say that i have done my duty as far as i could and that though i have made many mistakes my conscience is clear that i did the best as far as it seemed to me at the time    chapter 5 a quiet time   as the sergeant was telling the story the squire had sat with his face shaded by his hand but more than one tear had dropped heavily on the table  i wish i could say as much he said sadly when the other ended i wish that i could say that my conscience is clear mr wilks i have misjudged you cruelly and that without a tithe of the reason which you had for thinking me utterly heartless and cruel you will have heard that i never got those letters my son wrote me after he was ill and that when i returned home and received them i posted to southampton only to find that i was too late and that for a year i did all in my power to find the child still all this is no excuse i refused to forgive him returned his letters unanswered and left him as it seemed to his fate  it is no excuse to say that i had made up my mind to forgive him when he was as i thought sufficiently punished he did not know that as to the poverty in which you found him i can only plead that i did not dream that he would come to that he had i knew some money for i had just sent him his halfyears allowance before he wrote to me about this business then there was the furniture of his rooms in london his horses jewels and other matters i had thought he could go on very well for a year  of course i was mistaken herbert was always careless about money and no doubt he spent it freely after he was first married he would naturally wish to have everything pretty and nice for his young wife and no doubt he counted upon my forgiving him long before the money was spent  i am not excusing myself god knows how bitterly i have condemned myself all these years i only want to show you that i had no idea of condemning him to starvation he was my only son and i loved him i felt perhaps his rebellion all the more because he had never before given me a days trouble i was harsh obstinate and cruel  i have only the one old excuse i never thought it would turn out as it did what would i give if i could say as you can that you have a clear conscience and that you acted always as it seemed to be your duty  and now mr wilks now that i have heard your story i trust that you will forgive my past suspicions of you and let me say how much i honour and esteem you for your conduct no words can tell you how i thank you for your goodness and kindness to my little granddaughter our little granddaughter i should say you have the better right a thousandfold to her than i have and had i been in your place i could never have made such a sacrifice  we must be friends sir great friends our past has been saddened by the same blow all our hopes in the future are centred on the same object  the two men rose to their feet together and their hands met in a firm clasp and tears stood in both their eyes  then the squire put his hand on the others shoulder and said we will talk again presently let us go into the next room the little one is longing to see you and we must not keep her  for the next hour the two men devoted themselves to the child now that she had her old friend with her she felt no further misgivings and was able to enter into the full delight of her new home  the house and its wonders were explored and much as she was delighted with these the gardens and park were an even greater excitement and pleasure dancing chattering asking questions of one or the other she was half wild with pleasure and the squire was no less delighted a new light and joy had come into his life and with it the ten years which sorrow and regret had laid upon him had fallen off for although his habits of seclusion and quiet had caused him to be regarded as quite an old man by his neighbours he was still three years short of sixty while the sergeant was two years younger  it was a happy morning for them all three and when john petersham went in after lunch to the kitchen he assured his fellow servants that it was as much as he could do to keep from crying with joy at the sight of the squires happy face and to hear him laugh and joke as he had not done for eight years now  the sergeant had stopped to that meal for he saw by the manner in which the squire asked him that he should give pain if he refused and there was a simple dignity about the old soldier which would have prevented his appearing out of place at the table of the highest in the land  now pussy the squire said when they had finished you must amuse yourself for a bit you can go in the garden again or sit with mrs morcombe in her room she will look you out some picture books from the library i am afraid there is nothing very suited to your reading but we will soon put all that right your grandfather and i want to have another quiet chat together  now i want your advice he said when they were both comfortably seated in the study you see you have been thinking and planning about the child for years while it has all come new upon me so i must rely upon you entirely of course the child must have a governess that is the first thing not so much for the sake of teaching her though of course she must be taught but as a companion for her  yes the sergeant assented she must have a governess  it will be a troublesome matter to find one to suit the squire said thoughtfully i dont want a harsh sort of gorgon to repress her spirits and bother her life out with rules and regulations and i wont have a giddy young thing because i should like to have the child with me at breakfast and lunch and i dont want a flyaway young woman who will expect all sorts of attention now what is your idea i have no doubt you have pictured in your mind the exact sort of woman you would like to have over her  i have the sergeant answered quietly i dont know whether it would suit you squire or whether it could be managed but it does seem to me that you have got the very woman close at hand aggie has been for two years with mrs walsham who is a lady in every way she is very fond of the child and the child is very fond of her everyone says she is an excellent teacher she would be the very woman to take charge of her  the very thing the squire exclaimed with great satisfaction but she has a school he went on his face falling a little and there is a son  i have thought of that the sergeant said the school enables them to live but it cannot do much more so that i should think she would feel no reluctance at giving that up  money would be no object the squire said i am a wealthy man mr wilks and have been laying by the best part of my income for the last eight years i would pay any salary she chose for the comfort of such an arrangement would be immense to say nothing of the advantage and pleasure it would be to the child but how about the boy  we both owe a good deal to the boy squire the sergeant said gravely for if it had not been for him the child would have been lost to us  so she was telling me last night the squire said and he really saved her life  he did the sergeant replied but for his pluck and promptitude she must have been drowned a moments hesitation on his part and nothing could have saved her  i made up my mind last night the squire said to do something for him i have seen him before and was much struck with him  then in that case squire i think the thing could be managed if the lad were sent to a good school his mother might undertake the management of aggie she could either go home of an evening or sleep here and shut up her house as you might arrange with her living of course at home when the boy was home for his holidays and only coming up for a portion of the day  that would be a capital plan the squire agreed warmly the very thing i should get off all the bother with strange women and the child would have a lady she is already fond of and who i have no doubt is thoroughly qualified for the work nothing could be better i will walk down this afternoon and see her myself and i have no doubt i shall be able to arrange it  and now about yourselfwhat are your plans  i shall start tomorrow morning on my tramp as usual the sergeant answered quietly but i shall take care in future that i do not come with my box within thirty miles or so of sidmouth i do not want aggies future to be in any way associated with a showmans box i shall come here sometimes to see her as you have kindly said i may but i will not abuse the privilege by coming too often perhaps you wont think a day once every three months to be too much  i should think it altogether wrong and monstrous the squire exclaimed hotly you have been virtually the childs father for the last seven years you have cared for her and loved her and worked for her she is everything to you and i feel how vast are your claims to her compared to mine and now you talk about going away and coming to see her once every three months the idea is unnatural it is downright monstrous  no you and i understand each other at last would to heaven we had done so eight years back i feel how much more nobly you acted in that unhappy matter than i did and i esteem and honour you we are both getting on in life we have one common love and interest we stand in the same relation to the child and i say emphatically that you have a right and more than a right to a half share in her you must go away no more but remain here as my friend and as joint guardian of the child  i will have no refusal man he went on as the sergeant shook his head your presence here will be almost as great a comfort to me as to the child i am a lonely man for years i have cut myself loose from the world i have neither associates nor friends but now that this great load is off my mind my first want is a friend and who could be so great a friend who could enter into my plans and hopes for the future so well as yourself who would have an interest in them equal to my own  the sergeant was much moved by the squires earnestness he saw that the latter had really at heart the proposal he made  you are very good squire he said in a low voice but even if i could bring myself to eat another mans bread as long as i can work for my own it would not do i am neither by birth nor education fitted for such a position as that you offer to me  pooh nonsense the squire said hotly you have seen the world you have travelled and mixed with men you are fit to associate as an equal with anyone dont you deceive yourself you certainly do not deceive me  it is pride that stands in your way for that you are going to risk the happiness of your granddaughter to say nothing of mine for you dont suppose that either of us is going to feel comfortable and happy when the snow is whirling round and the wind sweeping the moors to think of you trudging along about the country while we are sitting snugly here by a warm fire  you are wanting to spoil everything now that it has all come right at last by just the same obstinate pride which wrecked the lives of our children i wont have it man i wont hear of it  come say no more i want a friend badly and i am sure we shall suit each other i want a companion why man if i were a rich old lady and you were a poor old lady and i asked you to come as my companion you would see nothing derogatory in the offer you shall come as my companion now or if you like as joint guardian to the child you shall have your own rooms in the house and when you feel inclined to be grumpy and dont care to take your meals with the child and me you can take them apart  at any rate try it for a month and if you are not comfortable then i will let you go though your rooms shall always be in readiness for you whenever you are disposed to come back  come give me your hand on the bargain  sergeant wilks could resist no longer the last two years work without the child had indeed been heavy and especially in winter when the wind blew strong across the uplands he began to feel that he was no longer as strong as he used to be the prospect of having aggie always near him was however a far greater temptation than that of ending his days in quiet and comfort  his hand and that of the squire met in a cordial grip and the matter was settled fortunately as the sergeant reflected he had still his pension of ten shillings a week which would suffice to supply clothes and other little necessaries which he might require and would thus save him from being altogether dependent on the squire  aggie was wild with delight when she was called in and informed of the arrangement the thought of her grandfather tramping the country alone had been the one drawback to the pleasure of her life at mrs walshams and many a time she had cried herself to sleep as she pictured to herself his loneliness that he was to be with her always was to give up his work to settle down in comfort was indeed a delight to her  greatly pleased was she also to hear that mrs walsham was to be asked to come up to be her governess  oh it will be nice she exclaimed clapping her hands just like the fairy stories you used to tell me grampa when everyone was made happy at the end by the good fairy grandpapa is the good fairy and you and i are the prince and princess and jamesand what is to be done with james is he to come up too  no my dear the squire said smiling james is to go to a good school but you will see him when he comes home for his holidays but that part of it is not arranged yet you know but if you will put on your hat you can walk down with us to the town and introduce me to mrs walsham  mrs walsham had just dismissed her pupils when the party arrived and was thinking how quiet and dull the house was without aggie when the door opened and the child rushed in and threw her arms round her neck  oh i have such good news to tell you grandpapa is so good and kind and grampa is going to live with us and you are to come up too and james is to go to school isnt it all splendid  what are you talking about aggie mrs walsham asked bewildered as the child poured out her news  aggie is too fast madam the squire said entering the room accompanied by the sergeant she is taking it all for granted while it has yet to be arranged i must apologize for coming in without knocking but the child opened the door and rushed in and the best thing to do was we thought to follow her  i have come in the first place to thank you for your great kindness to my little granddaughter and to tell your son how deeply i feel indebted to him for having saved her life two years ago  now aggie you run away and look for your friend while i talk matters over with mrs walsham  aggie scampered away to find james who was at work at his books and to tell him the news while the squire unfolded his plans to mrs walsham  his offers were so handsome that mrs walsham accepted them without an instants hesitation she was to have the entire charge of the child during the day with the option of either returning home in the evening when aggie went in to dessert after dinner or of living entirely at the hall the squire explained his intention of sending james to a good school at exeter as an instalment of the debt he owed him for saving the childs life and he pointed out that when he was at home for his holidays aggie could have her holidays too and mrs walsham need only come up to the hall when she felt inclined  mrs walsham was delighted with the offer even more for jamess sake than her own although the prospect for herself was most pleasant to have only aggie to teach and walk with would be delightful after the monotony of drilling successive batches of girls often inordinately tiresome and stupid she said at once that she should prefer returning home at nighta decision which pleased the squire for he had wondered what he should do with her in the evening  the arrangement was at once carried into effect the school was broken up and as the parents of the children were almost all tenants of the squire they offered no objection to the girls being suddenly left on their hands when they heard that their teacher was going to live as governess at the hall indeed the surprise of sidmouth and the neighbourhood at learning that the little girl at mrs walshams was the squires granddaughter and that the showman was therefore a connection of the squire and was going also to live at the hall was so great that there was no room for any other emotion save for wrecks or the arrival of shoals of fish off the coast or of troubles between the smugglers and the revenue officers sidmouth had few excitements and the present news afforded food for endless talk and conjecture  on comparing notes it appeared that there was not a woman in the place who had not been all along convinced that the little girl at mrs walshams was something more than she seemed to be and that the showman was a man quite out of the ordinary way and when on the following sunday the sergeant who had in the meantime been to exeter walked quietly into church with the squire all agreed that the welldressed militarylooking man was a gentleman and that he had only been masquerading under the name of sergeant wilks until somehow or other the quarrel between him and the squire was arranged and the little heiress restored to her position and sidmouth remained in that belief to the end  the sergeants military title was henceforth dropped mr linthorne introduced him to his acquaintanceswho soon began to flock in when it was known that the squires granddaughter had come home and that he was willing to see his friends and join in society againas my friend mr wilks the father of my poor boys wife  and the impression made was generally favourable  none had ever known the exact story of herberts marriage it was generally supposed that he had married beneath him but the opinion now was that this must have been a mistake for there was nothing in any way vulgar about the quiet militarylooking gentleman with whom the squire was evidently on terms of warm friendship  the only person somewhat dissatisfied with the arrangement was james walsham he loved his mother so much that he had never offered the slightest dissent to her plan that he should follow in his fathers footsteps she was so much set on the matter that he could never bring himself to utter a word in opposition at heart however he longed for a more stirring and more adventurous life such as that of a soldier or sailor and he had all along cherished a secret hope that something might occur to prevent his preparing for the medical profession and so enable him to carry out his secret wishes but the present arrangement seemed to put an end to all such hopes and although grateful to the squire for sending him to a good school he wished with all his heart that he had chosen some other way of manifesting his gratitude  four years passed quietly james walsham worked hard when at school and during his holidays spent his time for the most part on board the fishermens boats sometimes he went up to the hall generally at the invitation of mr wilks  why dont you come oftener jim the latter asked him one day aggie was saying only yesterday that you used to be such friends with her and now you hardly ever come near her the squire is as pleased as i am to see you  i dont know jim replied you see i am always comfortable with you i can chat with you and tell you about school and about fishing and so on the squire is very kind but i know it is only because of that picking aggie out of the water and i never seem to know what to talk about with him and then you see aggie is growing a young lady and cant go rambling about at my heels as she used to do when she was a little girl i like her you know mr wilks just as i used to do but i cant carry her on my shoulder now and make a playfellow of her  i suppose thats all natural enough jim aggies grandfather said but i do think it is a pity you dont come up more often you know we are all fond of you and it will give us a pleasure to have you here  jim was in fact getting to the awkward age with boys when younger they tyrannize over their little sisters when older they may again take pleasure in girls society but there is an age in every boys life when he is inclined to think girls a nuisance as creatures incapable of joining in games and as being apt to get in the way  still jim was very fond of his former playmate and had she been still living down in sidmouth with his mother they would have been as great friends as ever  at the end of the fourth year richard horton came back after an absence of five years he was now nearly twenty and had just passed as lieutenant he was bronzed with the eastern sun and had grown from a goodlooking boy into a handsome young man and was perfectly conscious of his good looks among his comrades he had gained the nickname of the dandya name which he accepted in good part although it had not been intended as complimentary for richard horton was by no means a popular member of his mess  boys are quick to detect each others failings and several sharp thrashings when he first joined had taught richard that it was very inexpedient to tell a lie on board a ship if there was any chance of its being detected as he had become one of the senior midshipmen his natural haughtiness made him disliked by the younger lads while among those of his own standing he had not one sincere friend for there was a general feeling among them that although richard horton was a pleasant companion and a very agreeable fellow when he liked he was not somehow straight not the sort of fellow to be depended upon in all emergencies  by the captain and lieutenants he was considered a smart young officer he was always careful to do his duty quiet and gentlemanly in manner and in point of appearance and dress a credit to the ship accordingly all the reports that his captain had sent home of him had been favourable  great as was the rage and disappointment which richard had felt when he received the letter from his uncle telling him of the discovery of his longlost granddaughter he had the tact to prevent any signs of his feelings being visible in the letter in which he replied the squire had told him that although the discovery would of course make a considerable difference in his prospects he should still if the reports of his conduct continued satisfactory feel it his duty to make a handsome provision for him  thanks to my quiet life during the last ten years the squire had written i have plenty for both of you the estate will of course go to her but always supposing that your conduct will be satisfactory i shall continue during my lifetime the allowance you at present receive and you will find yourself set down in my will for the sum of twenty thousand pounds  richard had replied in terms which delighted the squire  you see the boy has a good heart he said as he handed the letter to mr wilks no one could express himself better  his companion read the letter over in silence  charmingly expressed he said as he returned it almost too charmingly it seems to me  come come wilks you are prejudiced against the young fellow for that business with aggie and young walsham  i hope i am not prejudiced squire his friend replied but when i know that a lad is a liar and that he will bring false accusations to shield himself and when i know that he was detested by all who came in contact with himjohn petersham the gardener and the groomsi require a good deal more than a few satisfactory reports from his captain who can know very little of his private character and a softsoldering letter like that to reinstate him in my good opinion i will wager that if you and i had been standing behind him when he opened your letter you would have heard an expression of very different sentiments from those he writes you here  look at this i regret indeed my dear uncle that my new cousin must have such a bad opinion of me owing to my roughness in that unfortunate affair which i have never ceased to regret but i hope that when we meet i shall be able to overcome the dislike which she must feel for me  bah the old soldier said scornfully i would lay all my pension to a shilling that boy has already made up his mind that someday he will marry aggie and so contrive to get the estates after all  the squire burst into a goodhumoured laugh  its well i dont take up your wager such ideas as that might occur to you and me but hardly to a lad not yet seventeen  well we shall see the other said cooling down i hope i may be mistaken in him we shall see when he comes home  when he did come home the old soldier could find but little fault with the young man he had a frank and open manner such as is common to men of his profession he was full of life and anecdote his manner to the squire was admirable affectionate and quietly respectful without any air of endeavouring especially to ingratiate himself with him nor could the exsergeant find anything to complain of in the young mans manner towards himself he took the first opportunity when they were alone to say how glad he had been to hear that his grandfather had met with a friend and companion in his lonely life and to express a hope that the bad opinion which he had doubtless formed of him from his conduct when a boy would not be allowed to operate against him now  but though there was nothing he could find fault with the old soldiers prejudices were in no way shaken and indeed his antipathy was increased rather than diminished by the young officers conduct towards aggie it might be of course that he was only striving to overcome the prejudiced feeling against him but every time the old soldier saw him with his granddaughter he felt angry  in point of fact aggie was disposed to like richard even before his arrival six years had eradicated every tinge of animosity for that shove on the sand his letters had been long bright and amusing and with the mementos of travel which he picked up in the ports of india and china and from time to time sent home to his uncle there was always a little box with some pretty trinket for my cousin she found him now a delightful companion he treated her as if she had been seventeen instead of eleven was ready to ride or walk with her or to tell her stories of the countries he had seen as she might choose and to humour all her whims and fancies  confound him and his pleasant manners the exsergeant would mutter to himself as he watched them together and saw as he believed in the distance the overthrow of the scheme he had at heart he is turning the childs head and that foolish boy james is throwing away his chances  james indeed came home from school for the last time two or three weeks after richard hortons return he was now nearly eighteen and although a broad and powerful fellow was still a boy at heart he did not show to advantage by the side of richard horton the first time he went up to the hall after his return the latter had met him with outstretched hand  i am glad to meet you again he said i behaved like a blackguard last time we met and you gave me the thrashing which i deserved i hope we shall get on better in the future  aggie and her two grandfathers were present and james walsham certainly did not show to advantage by the side of the easy and selfpossessed young officer he muttered something about its being all right and then found nothing else to say being uncomfortable and ill at ease he made some excuse about being wanted at home and took his leave nor did he again go up to call several times the old soldier went down to sidmouth to see him and on one occasion remonstrated with him for not coming up to the hall  whats the use james said roughly i have got lots of reading to do for in two months you know i am to go up to london to walk the hospitals no one wants me up there aggie has got that cousin of hers to amuse her and i should feel only in the way if i went  mr wilks was fairly out of temper at the way things were going he was angry with james angry with the squire who evidently viewed with satisfaction the good understanding between his granddaughter and nephew angry for the first time in his life with aggie herself  you are growing a downright little flirt miss aggie he said one day when the girl came in from the garden where she had been laughing and chatting with her cousin  he had intended to speak playfully but there was an earnestness in his tone which the girl at once detected  are you really in earnest grampa she asked for she still retained the childish name for her grandfatherso distinguishing him from the squire whom she always called grandpapa  no i dont know that i am in earnest aggie he said trying to speak lightly and yet perhaps to some extent i am  i am sure you are the girl said oh grampa you are not really cross with me are you and the tears at once sprang into her eyes i have not been doing anything wrong have i  no my dear not in the least wrong her grandfather said hastily still you know i dont like seeing jim who has always been so good and kind to you quite neglected now this young fellow who is not fit to hold a candle to him has turned up  well i havent neglected him grampa he has neglected me he has never been near since that first day and you know i cant very well go round to sidmouth and say to him please come up to the hall  no my dear i know you cant and he is behaving like a young fool  why is he aggie asked surprised if he likes sailing about better than coming up here why shouldnt he  i dont think its for that he stays away aggie in fact you see jim has only just left school and he feels he cant laugh and talk and tell you stories about foreign countries as this young fellow can and having been so long accustomed to have you to himself he naturally would not like the playing second fiddle to richard horton  but he hasnt been here much the girl said ever since i came here he used to be so nice and so kind in the old days when i lived down there that i cant make out why he has changed so  my dear i dont think he has changed he has been only a boy and the fact is he is only a boy still he is fond of sailing and of the amusements boys take to and he doesnt feel at home and comfortable here as he did with you when you were a little girl at his mothers but mind aggie james is true as steel he is an honourable and upright young fellow he is worth fifty of this selfsatisfied pleasantspoken young sailor  i know james is good and kind grampa the girl said earnestly but you see he is not very amusing and richard is very nice  nice yes the old soldier said a fair weather sort of niceness aggie richard horton is the squires nephew and i dont wish to say anything against him but mark my words and remember them theres more goodness in jamess little finger than there is in his whole body but there i am a fool to be talking about it there is your cousin calling you in the garden go along with you  the girl went off slowly wondering at her grandfathers earnestness she knew she liked her old playmate far better than richard horton although the latters attentions pleased and flattered her the old soldier went straight off to the squires study  squire he said you remember that talk we had three years ago when your nephews answer came to your letter telling him that aggie was found i told you that i would wager he had made up his mind to marry her you laughed at me but i was right child though she still is he is already paving the way for the future  master richard certainly is carrying on a sort of flirtation with the little witch the squire said smiling but as she is such a mere child as you say what does it matter  i think it matters a great deal the old soldier said seriously i see squire the young fellow has quite regained your good opinion and unless i am mistaken you have already thought to yourself that it would not be a bad thing if they were to come together someday  i have thought it over and have made up my mind that in spite of your four years continued kindness to me and of the warm friendship between us i must go away for a time my box is still lying at exeter and i would rather tramp the country again and live on it and my pension than stay here and see my darling growing up a woman with that future before her i am sorry to say squire that what you call my prejudice is as strong as ever i doubt that young fellow as strongly as i did before he came home then i only had his past conduct and his letter to go by now i have the evidence of my own senses you may ask me what i have against him i tell younothing but i misdoubt him from my heart i feel that he is false that what he was when a boy he is now there is no true ring about him  the squire was silent for a minute or two he had a very sincere friendship and liking for his companion a thorough confidence in his judgment and principles he knew his selfsacrificing nature and that he was only speaking from his love for his grandchild  do not let us talk about it now old friend he said quietly you and i put before all other things aggies happiness disagreement between us there can be none on the subject give me tonight to think over what you have said and we will talk about it again tomorrow    chapter 6 a storm   after breakfast next morning the squire asked his friend to go with him into his study  i have been thinking this matter over he said very seriously and upon reflection i agree with you that it is undesirable that aggie should see much of richard until she is of an age to form a fair opinion for herself and to compare him with other young men i agree with you also that we have not yet sufficient proofs that he is completely changed i hope that he is you think he is not at any rate he must have a longer trial and until it is proved to your satisfaction as well as mine that he is in every way a desirable husband for aggie the less they see of each other the better i therefore propose to write at once to my friend admiral hewson to ask him to use his influence at the admiralty to get the young fellow appointed to a ship does that meet your approval my friend  quite so the other said cordially nothing could be better in the meantime as you say should richard turn out well and the young people take a liking for each other no match could be more satisfactory what i want is that she should take no girlish fancy for him at present  so be it then the squire said i think you know that we are a couple of old fools to be troubling ourselves about aggies future at present still in a matter which concerns us both so nearly we cannot be too careful if we had a woman with us we could safely leave the matter in her hands as it is we must blunder on as best we may  and so it was settled and a week later richard horton received an official letter from the admiralty ordering him to proceed at once to portsmouth to join the thetis to which he was appointed as fourth lieutenant the order gave richard extreme satisfaction he was beginning to find his life desperately dull and he was heartily sick of playing the attentive nephew he was well content with the progress he had made nothing had gone wrong since he returned his uncle had clearly taken him back into his favour and he had no doubt that aggie quite appreciated the pains he had bestowed to gain her liking  he detested the squires companion for he felt that the latter disliked and distrusted him and that his projects would meet with a warm opposition on his part still with the squire and aggie herself on his side he did not fear the result as to james walsham whom he had come home prepared to regard as a possible rival from his early intimacy with the child and the fact that his mother was her governess he now regarded him with contempt mingled with a revengeful determination to pay off the old score should a chance ever present itself  he therefore started next day in high spirits assuming however a great reluctance to tear himself away a few days later a letter came from him saying that he hoped that he should be able to come back sometimes for a day or two as the thetis was at present to be attached to the channel squadron and it was not expected that she would for some time proceed on foreign service  early in october james walsham was to go up to london to commence his medical course a week before he was to start mr wilks went down in the morning intending to insist on his returning with him to the hall as he went down towards sidmouth the old soldier noticed how strongly the wind was blowing the trees were swaying and thrashing in the wind the clouds were flying past overhead everything portended a severe gale  finding at mrs walshams that james was down on the beach he continued his course until he joined him there james was standing with a group of fishermen who were looking seaward now that he was exposed to the full force of the wind mr wilks felt that not only was it going to blow a gale but that it was blowing one already the heavy clouds on the horizon seemed to lie upon the water the waves were breaking with great force upon the beach and the fishermen had hauled their boats up across the road  its blowing hard jim he said laying his hand on the young fellows shoulder  it is blowing hard and it will blow a great deal harder before nightfall the fishermen all think it is going to be an exceptional gale it is blowing dead on shore it will be bad work for any ships that happen to be coming up channel today eight or ten of our boats are out we thought we had made out three of them just before you came but the cloud closed down on them the fishermen are just going to get lifelines ready i am afraid we are going to have a terrible night of it  i came down to ask you if you will come up to lunch jim but i suppose you will not be able to tear yourself away from here  i shouldnt like to leave now indeed there is no saying what may happen besides so many of the fishermen are away that i may be useful here if a vessel comes ashore and there may be half a dozen before the morning every hand will be wanted to give assistance  but you could not get a boat out through those breakers could you jim  yes jim replied we might get one of the big boats through it now but its going to be worse presently when i went out last year with a boat to the brig which was driven ashore it was worse than this  i shall be very glad to come up tomorrow if you will let me i hear that fellow horton went away last week  yes he went away jim but why his being there should have kept you from going up is beyond me  i dont like the fellow mr wilks he may mean very well but i dont like him i have been in one row about him with the squire and i dont want another but i am quite sure if i had gone up much while he was there it would have ended in my trying to punch his head again  in that case perhaps the old soldier said smiling you were wise to stay away jim i dont like the lad myself still punching his head would not have been a desirable thing  i am glad you dont like him james said warmly somehow i made up my mind that you were all sure to like him and i dont suppose the idea made me like him any the better he was just the freeandeasy sort of fellow to get along well and i was quite sure that aggie would not want me when she had him to go about with her i saw him drive through in the pony carriage with her two or three times and it was easy to see how thoroughly she was enjoying herself  well it was your own fault my boy if you choose to sulk down here and never to go up to the hall you cant blame aggie for letting herself be amused by someone else  oh i dont blame her james said hastily of course it is all right that she should enjoy herself with her cousin only somehow you know after being great friends with anyone one doesnt like to see someone else stepping into your place  but as i have told you over and over again during the last three years jim you have willfully stepped out of your place you know how often i have asked you to come up and how seldom you have come you have never shown aggie that you have any wish to continue on the footing of friendship on which you stood towards each other when she was at your mothers and as you have chosen to throw her over i dont see why she shouldnt take to anyone else who takes pains to make himself pleasant to her  oh i dont blame her a bit mr wilks how could you think such a thing i was very fond of little aggie when she was at my mothers but of course i was not ass enough to suppose that she was going trotting about the country with me when she once went up to the hall as the squires granddaughter of course the whole thing was changed  ah here comes the rain  as he spoke a sudden splash of rain struck them it might have been noticed coming across the water in a white line with it came a gust of wind to which that which had already been blowing was a trifle there was no more talking for nothing less than a shout could have been heard above the roaring of the wind it was scarcely possible to stand against the fury of the squall and they were driven across the road and took shelter at the corner of some houses where the fishermen had already retired  the squall lasted but a few minutes but was soon succeeded by another almost equally furious and this seemed to increase in strength until the wind was blowing a perfect hurricane but the fishermen now struggled across the road again for between the rain squalls a glimpse had been caught of two of the fishing boats and these were now approaching the shore a mere rag of sail was set on each and yet they tore over the waves at tremendous speed  one was some two hundred yards ahead of the other and by the course they were making they would come ashore nearly at the same spot the news that two boats were in sight spread rapidly and many of the fishermens wives with shawls over their heads ran down and stood peering out from behind shelter for it was wellnigh impossible to stand exposed to the fury of the gale  an old fisherman stood with a coil of rope in his hand close to the waters edge several of the others stood close to him and four of them had hold of the other end of the rope when the boat was within fifty yards of shore the sail was lowered but she still drove straight on before the wind with scarce an abatement in her speed a man stood in her bow also with a coil of rope in his hand and as he approached threw it far ahead the fisherman rushed waist deep into the water and caught the end of it which in a moment was knotted to the one in his hand  run along with her he shouted  for a moment the boat towered on the top of a wave which raced in towards the shore the next as it came took her stern and she was in the act of swinging round when the strain of the rope came upon her and brought her straight again higher and higher the wave rose and then crashed down and the boat shot forward like an arrow in the foam the fishermen rushed forward and caught it those on board leapt out waistdeep all were taken off their feet by the backward rush but they clung to the sides of the boat while the men at the head rope with their heels dug deeply into the sand withstood the strain and kept her from being swept out again  a few seconds and the boat was left dry and the next wave carried it high up on the beach amid a loud cheer from the fishermen and lookers on but there was no time to waste for the next boat was close at hand again the rope was thrown to the shore but this time the strain came a moment too late the following wave turned the boat round the next struck it broadside and rolled it over and over towards the shore the fishermen in an instant joined hands and rushing down into the water strove to grasp the men  several times those in front were knocked down and rolled up on the beach but three of the crew were brought in with them there was one still missing and there was a shout as he was seen clinging to an oar just outside the line of breakers james walsham had been working with the fishermen in saving those already brought to shore he now fastened the end of a line round his body  you can never get through those rollersthey will break you up like an eggshell the old fisherman shouted  i will dive through them jim shouted back give me plenty of slack and dont pull till you see i have got him  the lad waited for his opportunity and then rushing down after the sheet of white foam he stood waist deep as a great wave some twelve feet high towered up like a wall towards him it was just going to break when james plunged head foremost into it there was a crash which shook the earth a mass of wildly rushing foam and then some ten yards beyond the spot where the wave had broken jims head appeared above the surface it was but for a moment for he immediately dived again under the next wave and then came up within a few yards of the floating oar a stroke or two and he was alongside he seized the man and held up one arm as a signal in a moment the rope tightened and they moved towards shore when they were close to the edge of the breaking waves jim held up his hand and the strain stopped  now he said to the man the moment they begin to pull leave go of the oar and throw your arms round me  he waited until a wave bigger than ordinary approached and just as it began to pass under him gave the signal higher and higher they seemed to rise then they were dashed down with a tremendous shock there was a moments confusion as they were swept along in the white water jim felt a terrific strain and it seemed to him that the rope would cut him in sunder then he was seized by a dozen strong arms and carried high and dry before the next wave could reach him  for a minute or two he was scarce conscious the breath had been almost knocked out of his body with the break of the wave and the rushing water seemed still singing in his ears  are you hurt my boy are you hurt james were the first words he clearly heard  no i think i am all right he said trying to sit up is the other fellow all right  he has broke his arm one of the fishermen who had just helped the man to his feet replied he may be thankful its no worse  james was now helped to his feet  i am all right he repeated to mr wilks except that i feel as if i had a hot iron round my body that rope has taken the skin off all round me i fancy and doesnt it smart just with the salt water  oh james how could you do it a girls voice said suddenly  the fishermen drew aside and aggie linthorne pressed forward  the squire had gone into her schoolroom and had said  mrs walsham i think you had better give up your lessons for the morning and get home it is blowing a gale now and we shall probably have the rain down before long i will walk down with you the wind is dead on the shore and it will be a grand sight  aggie at once set her mind on going too but the squire refused until mrs walsham suggested that if it came on wet aggie could stop at her house until it cleared up or if necessary till morning whereupon the squire had given way and the three had started together for sidmouth leaving mrs walsham at her house as they passed the others had struggled down against the wind until they came within sight of the sea the first boat had just been run safely on shore when they arrived and aggie gave a cry and put her hands over her face as the second boat was seen to capsize  cling to me aggie the squire said see they are rushing in the water to save them they will have them yet  at the cheer which broke out from the spectators clustering thickly now as the first of the shipwrecked crew was brought to shore aggie looked out again it was a sight she never forgot with the great waves crashing down on the shore and the line of straggling figures waist deep in the white foam in which were scattered here and there portions of the boat oars sails and nets  well done well done the squire exclaimed they have dragged up three of them i dont know whether there are any more  yes yes look aggie cried there out in the wavesthere i can see a head thats just about where i was nearly drowned oh grandpapa take me away i cant look at it  theres someone going out to save him aggie listen to the cheer  aggie looked again  oh grandpapa stop him stop him she cried its james  but at the same moment the plunge was made and the figure lost to sight  aggie threw her arms round her grandfather and hid her face  i cant look i cant look she cried tell me about it  there he is up bravo the squire exclaimed almost as excited as she was he has dived again dearthen after a pausethere he is close to him he has got him aggie now he is waving his hand now they are tightening the rope now he is waving his hand again and they are waiting there  there was a pause which seemed to the girl to be endless then the squire cried  they have got them out both of them and a loud cheer broke from all standing round  come along grandpapa let us go down to them  stay a moment my dear they may be hurt its better you should not go  the girl stood with her hands clasped gazing at the fishermen grouped on the shore stooping over the prostrate figures then one of them stood up and waved his hand and the spectators knew that all was well then the girl ran down to join them  why aggie james exclaimed in astonishment as she pressed forward why my dear what brings you here in this storm whatever will the squire say  the squire has brought her down himself mr linthorne said following closely behind his granddaughter and he is glad he did james for she has seen a grand sight  you are a fine fellow and he wrung the lads hand  a grand fellow wilks isnt he  i always said so squire the old soldier said his face beaming with satisfaction but now let us get him home and aggie too the child will be blown away  but for a minute or two they could not carry james off so closely did the men and women press round him and shake him by the hand at last they got him away and escorted by a crowd of cheering boys led him back to his mothers  your son is a hero mrs walsham the squire exclaimed as they entered but dont talk to him now but mix him a glass of hot grog  wilks you get him between the blankets directly i will tell his mother all about it while she is mixing the grog  hallo aggie why bless the child shes fainted  the girl had borne up till they reached the house towards which the wind had blown her along as she clung to her grandfathers arm but the excitement had been too much for her and the instant they entered the room she had dropped into an armchair and at once lost consciousness  mrs walsham kept her presence of mind in spite of her bewilderment at these sudden occurrences she at once laid the girl on the sofa removed her dripping bonnet and cloak and poured a few drops of brandy between her lips while she set the squire to work to chafe her hands aggie soon opened her eyes and recovered her consciousness  dont try to get up aggie mrs walsham said you are faint and shaken with all this excitement your grandpapa and i were two very foolish people to let you come out  now mr wilks the best thing you can do is to find a boy outside and send him up to the hall with a message that the carriage is to come down directly  i think mr linthorne she had better get back home i should be glad enough as you know to keep her here for the night but this house is rocking with the wind now and she would not be likely to get any sleep here i will run up and see how james is and if he is all right i will come up with her and stop the night she is very much shaken and had better not be alone  mrs walsham soon came downstairs again and said that james said he never felt better in his life and that by all means she was to go up to the hall she then set about and prepared a cup of tea which greatly restored aggie and by the time the carriage arrived the girl was able to walk to the gate  mr wilks had offered to remain with james but the latter would not hear of it the lad was indeed well pleased to hear that they were all going up to the hall as thereby he escaped hearing any more of his own praises besides he was most anxious to get down to the beach again for no one could say what might take place there before morning  as soon therefore as he heard the door close he jumped out of bed and when peeping through the blinds he saw the carriage drive off with its four occupants he at once began to dress he felt bruised and sore from the blows he had received and a red wheal round his chest beneath the arms showed where the rope had almost cut into the flesh however he soon dressed himself and descended the stairs went into the kitchen and told the astonished girl that he was going out then having made a hasty meal of bread and cold meat he put on his oilskins again and started for the shore  he did not however wait long so heavy was the sea now that nothing whatever could be done should any vessel drive ashore and as for the fisher boats the sailors shook their heads as they spoke of them  they were farther away to the west so the chaps as got ashore tells us they may have got in somewhere before it got to the worst if not it must have gone hard with them  finding that there was nothing to be done and that he was much more stiff and bruised than he had believed jim made his way back again and turned into bed where he soon fell asleep and did not wake until the following morning  one of the grooms had come down from the hall at six oclock to inquire how he was and the message given by the girl that he had been out but that he had come back and was now sound asleep satisfied mrs walsham and enabled her to devote her undivided attention to her charge who needed her care more than her son before night indeed the squire had sent down to sidmouth for dr walshams successor who said that aggie was very feverish and must be kept perfectly quiet for some days he sent her up a soothing draught and mrs walsham sat up with her all night she slept but little and talked almost incessantly sometimes rambling a little  the first thing in the morning the doctor was again sent for and on his recommendation the squire at once sent off a man on horseback to exeter for the leading physician of that town when he arrived late in the afternoon aggie was somewhat quieter and his report was more cheering  her pulse is very high he said but mr langford tells me that it is not so rapid as it was in the morning and that he thinks the symptoms are abating undoubtedly it is a sharp feverish attack brought on by excitement and exposure a very little more and it would have been a case of brain fever but i trust now that it will soon pass off the sedatives that have been administered are taking effect and i trust she will soon fall asleep  as you requested i have made my arrangements for staying here tonight and i trust that by the morning we shall have her convalescent  mr wilks had gone down the first thing in the morning to see james and found him up and about as usual he was very greatly concerned at hearing that aggie had passed a bad night and came four times up to the hall during the day to inquire about her and on his last visit late in the evening he was told that she was sleeping quietly and that the doctor had every hope that she would wake in the morning free from fever this proved to be the case but she was ordered to keep her bed for a day or two  on the morning after the storm the wind had gone down much although a tremendous sea was still breaking on the shore messages arrived in the course of the day to say that all the missing boats with one exception had succeeded in gaining the shore before the storm was full on the missing boat was never heard of again  two days later james walsham had strolled up the hill to the east of the town and was lying with a book before him in a favourite nook of his looking over the sea it was one of the lovely days which sometimes come late in autumn as if the summer were determined to show itself at its best before leaving it could not be said that james was studying for he was watching the vessels passing far out at sea and inwardly moaning over the fact that he was destined for a profession for which he had no real liking instead of being free to choose one of travel and adventure  presently he heard voices behind him the position in which he was lying was a little distance down on the slopes on the seaward side of the path and as a screen of bushes grew behind it he could not be seen by anyone passing along  all the men with their pistols and cutlasses are to assemble here at ten oclock tonight johnson but do not give them orders till late and let them come up one by one so as not to attract attention lipscombes men are to assemble at the same hour and march to meet us this time i think there is no mistake the cargo is to be landed where i told you it will be high tide at twelve oclock and they are sure to choose that hour so that the cutter can run close in i have sent off a man on horseback to weymouth for the revenue cutter to come round if shes in time we shall catch that troublesome lugger as well as her cargo she has been a thorn in our side for the last year this time i do hope we shall have her  the speakers then moved on out of hearing but james walsham recognized the voice as that of the revenue officer commanding the force at sidmouth  smuggling was at that time carried on on a large scale along the coast and there were frequent collisions between those engaged in it and the revenue officers the sympathies of the population were wholly with the smugglers and the cheating of the revenue was not at all considered in the light of a crime  many of the fishermen from time to time took a hand in smuggling cruises and the country people were always ready to lend assistance in landing and carrying the cargoes  when out in their boats at night james had often heard the fishermen tell stories of their smuggling adventures and more than once he had been with them when they had boarded a lugger laden with contraband to warn them that the revenue cutter was on the cruising ground and it would not be safe to attempt to run cargo at present he now determined at once that he would warn the smugglers of their danger the question was where was the cargo to be run the officer had not mentioned the spot but as the force from the next station to the east was to cooperate it must be somewhere between the two  waiting till the speakers must have gone well along the cliff he rose to his feet and returned to sidmouth he thought at first of telling some of the fishermen what he had heard but as in the event of an affray it might come out how the smugglers had been warned of the intention of the revenue officers he thought there would be less risk in giving them warning himself he knew every path down the cliff for miles and trusted that he should be able to make his way down and give the boats notice of their danger before the revenue men reached the shore  at nine oclock he dressed himself in the rough sailors suit he wore when he went out with the fishermen and started along the cliff for some distance he kept well inland as the officer might have placed a man on the lookout to stop anyone going towards the scene of action the spot he thought the most likely was a mile and a half along the shore there was a good landing place and an easy path up the cliff and he knew that cargoes had been more than once run here accordingly when he reached this spot he sat down among some bushes on the edge of the cliff and waited for some sort of signal half an hour later he heard the tramp of a number of men passing along behind him  there go the revenue men he thought to himself i suppose they are going to meet those coming the other way  an hour passed without further sound and james began to get uneasy if this was the spot fixed for the landing some of the country people ought to be arriving by this time to help to carry off the cargo they might for aught he knew be already near waiting for the signal before they descended the path no doubt the revenue men would be lying in wait a short distance off and would allow the friends of the smugglers to go down to the water without letting them know of their presence  he kept his eyes fixed on the water to the east watching anxiously for the appearance of a light presently he started immediately in front of him about a mile at sea a bright light was shown in a second it disappeared three times it flashed out and then all was dark the night was a very dark one there was no moon and the stars were obscured and although he strained his eyes to the utmost he could not make out the vessel from which the light had been shown  how foolish to show such a bright light he said to himself it would have been almost sure to attract the attention of anyone on the watch  he made his way to the path and descended to the edge of the water and waited expecting momentarily to be joined by people from above but no one came he strained his ears listening for the fall of approaching oars but all was silent  half an hour passed and then it flashed across him that the signal must have been made to deceive the revenue men and to cause them to assemble at that spot and so leave the point really determined upon free for operations  with an exclamation of disgust at his own stupidity in having been deceived james ran up the path again at the top of his speed and then took the road along the cliff for two miles he ran without interruption and then saw a dark mass in front of him he turned off instantly to the left doubtless he had been heard approaching for two or three men detached themselves from the rest and started to cut him off james ran straight inland and in the darkness soon lost sight of his pursuers then he turned and made for the cliff again two or three hundred yards farther along there was another path to the shore and this he had no doubt now was the one the smugglers were about to use he struck the cliff within a few yards of the spot in an instant two men jumped up and seized him  who are you  for an instant james thought that his assailants were revenue men but even in the darkness he saw that they were countrymen  quick he said the revenue men are close at hand they are watching two or three hundred yards along listen here they come  a tramping of feet coming rapidly along the cliff was clearly heard and the men with an oath released their hold and ran off giving a loud whistle and made for their carts which were stationed a few hundred yards inland james dashed down the path shouting at the top of his voice he had not gone many yards before he met a number of men coming up with tubs of spirits on their shoulders  throw them down he cried and make along the shore the revenue men are close behind  his advice was taken at once the tubs were thrown down and went leaping and bounding down to the shore while the men followed james at full speed down the path  their pursuers were close behind there was no longer any use in concealment their officer shouted to them to press forward at full speed while from the beach below a hubbub of voices suddenly broke out and at the same moment a blue light was lit on the cliff above  beat them back my lads one of the smugglers was shouting as james ran down to the little crowd of men standing near two boats we are five to one against them come on  surrender in the kings name the revenue officer shouted as he rushed forward followed by his men  the answer was a pistol shot and in a moment a furious melee began the advantage in numbers was all on the side of the smugglers those who had landed with the kegs were all armed with pistol and cutlass and the countrymen had heavy sticks and bludgeons the ten revenue men would have been overpowered but suddenly a shout was heard and another party of sailors ran up along the shore and joined in the fray it was the detachment from the other station which had been waiting at some little distance along the shore for the signal from above  to the boats lads the leader of the smugglers shouted we are caught in a trap  the smugglers rushed to the boats and james who was standing by the waters edge leaped on board with them most of the country people fled at once along the shore pursued by some of the revenue men while the others made a rush for the boats these had been kept afloat a few yards from the shore grapnels had been dropped over their sterns and as the men in charge hauled out the moment the fight began they were in water shoulder deep when the smugglers scrambled on board  the revenue men dashed in after them and strove to hold the boats but they were beaten off with oars and cutlasses and the boats were soon hauled out into deep water the grapnels were lifted and the men many of whom were wounded more or less severely in the fray got out their oars and pulled to the lugger amid a dropping fire of pistol shots from shore    chapter 7 pressed   many and deep were the maledictions uttered as the smugglers climbed on board their vessel but their captain said cheerily  never mind lads it might have been worse it was only the first cargo of tubs and half of those werent ashore the lace and silk are all right so no great harm is done set to work and get up sail as soon as you can likely enough there is a cutter in the offing that blue light must have been a signal they seem to have got news of our landing somehow  the crew at once set to work to get up sail three or four of the countrymen who had like james got on board the boats stood in a group looking on confused and helpless but james lent his assistance until the sails were hoisted and the craft began to move through the water  now then the captain said let us go below and look at the wounds we darent show a light here on deck  the wounds were for the most part slashes and blows with cutlasses for in the darkness and confusion of the fight only two of the bullets had taken effect one of the smugglers had fallen shot through the head while one of those on board had his arm broken by a pistol ball  now for our passengers the captain said after the wounds had been bandaged  who are you and he lifted a lantern to jamess face  why it is young mr walsham he exclaimed in surprise  james knew the man now for the lugger had several times put in at sidmouth where coming in as a peaceable trader the revenue officers although well aware of the nature of her vocation were unable to touch her as vessels could only be seized when they had contraband on board  why what brings you into this affair young master  james related the conversation he had overheard and his determination to warn the smugglers of their danger  i should have managed it in plenty of time if i had known the exact spot on which you were going to land but i saw a signal light two miles down the coast and that kept me there for half an hour it struck me then it was a ruse to attract the officers from the real spot of landing but though i ran as hard as i could i was only just before them  thank you heartily the smuggler said i expect you saved us from a much worse mess than we got into i have no doubt they meant to capture the tubs as they were loaded without raising an alarm and the fellows on the shore would have come up quietly and taken us by surprise as we were landing the last boat loads thanks to you we have got well out of it and have only lost one of our hands and a score or so of tubs  you cant put me ashore i suppose james said  that i cant the smuggler replied i have no doubt that cutter from weymouth is somewhere outside us and we must get well off the coast before morning if we give her the slip i will send you off in a boat sometime tomorrow i must go ashore myself to make fresh arrangements for getting my cargo landed  james went on deck again the breeze was light and the lugger was slipping along quietly through the water he could faintly see the loom of the cliffs on his right and knew that the lugger was running west keeping as close inshore as she could to avoid the cutter watching for her outside he wondered what they would say at home when it was found that he was missing but consoled himself by thinking that his mother who was still up at the hall would no doubt suppose that he had gone out for a nights fishing as he had often done before and that as she was away he had forgotten to leave word with the servant  suddenly a blue light burned out on the top of the cliff an angry exclamation broke from the captain who was standing at the helm  confound it he exclaimed they have caught sight of us from the cliff and are signalling our whereabouts to the cutter  as he spoke he turned the vessels head seaward and for a quarter of an hour sailed straight out  now he said quietly i think we must be out of sight of those fellows on shore get her on the other tack lads but be as quiet as you can about it theres no saying how close the cutter may be to us  the great sails were lowered as the boats head paid off to the east the yards were shifted to the other sides of the masts and the sails hoisted again and the lugger began to retrace her way back along the coast  its just a chance now the captain said to james who was standing close by him whether the commander of the cutter guesses or not that we shall change our course he will know we are likely enough to do it  what should you do if you were in his place james said  i should run straight out to sea and lay to eight or ten miles off he would be able to make us out then at daylight whichever course we take whereas by trying to follow in the dark he would run the chance of missing us altogether i wish the wind would get up a bit we are not moving through the water more than three knots an hour and its dying away however i fancy it will blow up again in the morning  do you know whether she is faster than you are james asked  there is not much difference the captain replied if the wind is strong we have the legs of her but in a light breeze she is the fastest she has chased us half a dozen times already but we have always given her the slip  then even if she does run out to sea as you say james said we ought to be safe as we should be a dozen miles or so along the coast  yes but not that ahead of her the captain answered for she would be so much to the seaward still that would be far enough but she will begin to fire long before we are in range and will bring any other kings ship within hearing down on us however i daresay we shall give her the slip as we have done before  the hours passed slowly the wind continued to drop until the vessel scarcely moved through the water and after a while the sweeps were got out and were worked until the day broke all eyes were on the lookout for the cutter as the day dawn began to steal over the sky  there she is sure enough the captain exclaimed at length lying to on the watch some eight miles to the west she must have seen us for we are against the light sky but like ourselves she is becalmed  it was a quarter of an hour however before the position of the cutter was seen to change then her head was suddenly turned east  she has got the wind the captain said now we only want a good breeze and youll have a lively day of it lads  from the time when she had turned the lugger had made only about eight miles along the coast to the east and an equal distance seaward for the tide had set against her the morning was bright and clear the sea was perfectly smooth as yet the sails hung idly down but there were dark lines on the water that showed that a breeze was coming  we shall have plenty of wind presently the skipper said see how light the sky is to the south there will be white tops on the waves in an hour or two  here comes a flaw haul in your sheets lads now she begins to move  the puff did not last long dying away to nothing in a few minutes and then the lugger lay immovable again the men whistled stamped the deck impatiently and cast anxious glances back at the cutter  she is walking along fast the skipper said as he examined her through a glass she has got the wind steady and must be slipping along at six knots an hour this is hard luck on us if we dont get the breeze soon it will be a close thing of it  another quarter of an hour passed without a breath of wind ruffling the water the cutter was fully two miles nearer to them than when she had first been seen and was holding the wind steadily  here it comes lads the skipper said cheerfully another ten minutes and we shall have our share  the time seemed long indeed before the dark line on the water reached the lugger and there was something like a cheer from the crew as the craft heeled slightly over and then began to move through the water it was the true breeze this time and increased every moment in force till the lugger was lying well over with a white wave at her bow  but the cutter had first gained by the freshening breeze and james walsham looking back at her judged that there were not more than four miles of water between the boats the breeze was nearly due west and as the lugger was headed as close as she would lie to it the cutter had hauled in her sheets and lay up on the same course so that they were now sailing almost parallel to each other  if we could change places the skipper said we should be safe we can sail nearer the wind than she can but she can edge away now and has all the advantage of us  james had already perceived this and wondered that the lugger did not pay off before the wind so as to make a stern chase of it  i want to get a few miles farther out the skipper said likely enough there is another cutter somewhere inshore it is quite enough to have one of these fellows at ones heels  another half hour and the cutter edging in was little over three miles distant then the skipper gave the word the helm was put down the sheets slackened off and in a minute the lugger was running dead before the wind with her sails boomed out one on either side the cutter followed her example and hoisted a large square sail  the wind was blowing fresh now and the sea was getting up not a cloud was to be seen in the sky and the sun shone brightly on the white heads which were beginning to show on the water the lugger was tearing along occasionally throwing a cloud of spray over her bows and leaving a track of white water behind her  i think she still gains on us the captain said to the mate who had taken the helm  ay she is gaining the sailor agreed but the wind is freshening every minute she cant carry that topsail much longer its pressing her bows under now  she will go almost as fast without it the skipper said  the commander of the cutter seemed to be of the same opinion for just as he spoke the topsail was seen to flutter and then descended to the deck it was a quarter of an hour before the skipper spoke again  i think we just about hold our own he said i didnt think the polly could have held her running  she couldnt in a light wind the mate replied but with this wind it will want a fast boat to beat her  the hands were now set to work shifting the kegs further aft  thats better the skipper said presently i am sure we are gaining ground and our masts will stand it if the cutters will  with her stern low in the water the lugger was now tearing along at a tremendous pace stout as were her masts and strong the stays james walsham wondered at their standing the strain of the great brown sails as they seemed at times almost to lift her bodily out of the water buoyant as the craft was the waves broke over her bows and flooded her decks and sheets of spray flew over her  the cutter with her sharper bows and all her sail forward was feeling it still more severely and the spirits of all on board the lugger rose rapidly as it was evident that they were dropping their pursuers suddenly the gaff of the cutters mainsail was seen to droop and the boom was hauled on board  i thought it would be too much for them the skipper said exultantly they are going to reef  we had better reef down too i think the mate said she has had as much as she could bear for some time  ill hold on ten minutes longer the skipper said every half mile counts  but before that time was up the sails were one after another reefed for the wind continued to freshen the sky was still cloudless but there was a misty light in the air and a heavy sea was beginning to run  suddenly a gun flashed out from the cutter the skipper uttered an oath their pursuer was more than three miles astern and he knew that she could only be firing as a signal  there were several large ships in sight on their way up or down the channel to these little attention had been paid the skipper shaded his eyes with a hand and gazed earnestly at a large ship on the weather beam some four miles away  that is a frigate sure enough he exclaimed we are fairly caught between them  haul in the sheets lads we will have a try for it yet  the lugger was brought sharp up into the wind and was soon staggering along seaward with the lee bulwark almost under water the cutter instantly lowered her square sail and followed her example continuing to fire a gun every minute all eyes were turned towards the frigate which was now on the port beam  we shall cross two miles to windward of her the skipper said if she keeps on her course a quarter of an hour will do it but she is sure to notice the guns the wind will take them down to her  ah there she goes  as he spoke a puff of smoke darted out from the frigates bow her sails fluttered and her head bore round until she was on the same tack as the lugger  the latter was now about equidistant from her two pursuers the cutter and the lugger were nearly abreast but the former being to windward could edge down the frigate was three miles to leeward but she was fully a mile ahead  there is no way out of it the skipper said bitterly in a light wind we could run away from the frigate but with this breeze we have no chance with her look how she is piling on sail  the crew shared the captains opinion some shook their fists and cursed vainly at their pursuers some stood sullenly scowling while the french portion of the crew gave way to wild outbursts of rage rapidly the three vessels closed in towards each other for the cutter edged in so rapidly that the lugger was obliged to bear off towards the frigate again as a last hope the luggers course was changed and she again tried running but the superior weight and power of the frigate brought her rapidly down presently a heavy gun boomed out and a shot came dancing along the water a hundred yards away  lower the sails the skipper said it is no use going farther the inside of a prison is better than the bottom of the sea anyhow  down came the sails and the lugger lay rolling heavily in the waves as the frigate bore down upon her with a white roll of water on her stem  get ready lads the skipper said there is just one chance yet she will run by us the instant she is past up sail again we shall be a mile away before they can get her round into the wind again if she doesnt cripple us with her shot we may weather her yet we neednt mind the cutter  the frigate came foaming along the crew busy in taking sail off her the instant she had passed and was preparing to round to the sails of the lugger flew up like magic and she was soon tearing along almost in the eye of the wind as if to meet the cutter which was running down towards her  down below lads every man of you the captain shouted we shall have a broadside in a minute  in a moment the deck was clear of all save the skipper and his mate who stood at the tiller the frigate swept slowly round and then as her guns came to bear shot after shot was fired at the lugger already threequarters of a mile to the windward the shot hummed overhead one struck the water alongside a yard or two away but still she was untouched  some of her shots went as near the cutter as they did to us the skipper said she wont fire again  they were now fast approaching the cutter which when she was within a quarter of a mile changed her course and was brought up again into the wind firing the four guns she carried on her broadside as she came round the luggers head was paid off and this placed the cutter on her starboard quarter both going free the former was travelling the faster but a gun was fired from the cutters bow and the shot struck splinters from the luggers quarter the crew were on deck again now  train that gun over the stern the skipper said if we can knock her mast out of her we are saved if not they will have us yet  he had scarcely spoken when there was a crash a shot from the cutter had struck the mizzen mast a few feet above the deck and the mast and sail fell over to leeward there was a cry of rage and dismay  lucks against us the skipper said bitterly down with the sail lads this time it is all up with us  the sail was lowered and the lugger lay motionless in the water until the cutter came up and lay within fifty yards of her a boat was at once lowered and an officer was rowed to the lugger  so we have caught you my friends at last he said as he sprang on board  you wouldnt have done it if it had not been for the frigate the skipper said  no i will say your craft sails like a witch the officer replied i wish we could have done it without her it will make all the difference to us the frigate will get the lions share of the prize what is the value of your cargo  two hundred kegs of brandy the skipper replied and fifteen hundred pounds worth of lace and silks  a good prize the officer said not your own i hope for you have made a brave chase of it  no the skipper answered fortunately i only took a very small share this time its bad enough to lose my boat i own twothirds of her  i am sorry for you the officer said for he was in high spirits at the success of the chase and could afford to be pleasant here comes a boat from the frigate you played them a rare trick and might have got off if it hadnt been for that lucky shot of ours  i see you were just getting out a stern chaser and he pointed to the gun it is well for you that you didnt fire it as you cant be charged with armed resistance  i wish i had fired it for all that it might have been my luck to cripple you  it would have made no difference if you had the officer replied the frigate would have overhauled you with this wind she would sail five feet to your four  the boat from the frigate now came alongside  how are you cotterel the officer said as he stepped on board that was a lucky shot of yours but i think its lucky for the lugger that you hit her for the captain was so savage at that trick they played him that i believe he would have sunk her when he came up to her again i heard him say to the first lieutenant i wont give her a chance to play me such a trick again  what orders have you brought the other asked  we are outward bound so you are to put a crew on board and take her into port but as we are very short of hands we will relieve you of the prisoners  all on board the lugger were at once ordered into the frigates boat and were rowed off to the ship on gaining the deck they were drawn up in line and the captain and first lieutenant came up the good humour of the former had been restored by the capture of the lugger  hallo he said looking at the bandaged heads and arms of some of the men so you have been having a fight trying to run your cargo i suppose that will make it all the worse for you when you get on shore now i might press you all without giving you a choice but i dont want unwilling hands so i will leave it to you which is it to bean english prison for two or three years or a cruise on board the thetis  the greater part of the men at once stepped forward and announced their willingness to volunteer  who have we here the captain asked looking at the three countrymen  they are passengers sir the skipper of the lugger said with a half smile  a few questions brought to light the facts of the surprise while the cargo was being landed  well my lads the captain said you are in the same boat with the rest you were engaged in an unlawful enterprise and in resisting his majestys officers you will get some months in prison anyhow if you go back you had better stay on board and let me make men of you  the countrymen however preferred a prison to a man o war  james walsham had been turning over the matter in his mind he had certainly taken no part in the fray but that would be difficult to prove and he could not account for his presence except by acknowledging that he was there to warn them it would certainly be a case of imprisonment surely it would be better to volunteer than this he had been longing for the sea and here an opportunity opened for him for abandoning the career his mother intended for him without setting himself in opposition to her wishes surely she would prefer that he should be at sea for a year or two to his being disgraced by imprisonment he therefore now stepped forward  i do not belong to the luggers crew sir and had nothing to do with running their cargo though i own i was on the spot at the time i am not a sailor though i have spent a good deal of time on board fishing boats mr horton whom i see there knows me and will tell you that i am a son of a doctor in sidmouth but as i have got into a scrape i would rather serve than go back and stand a trial  very well my lad the captain said i like your spirit and will keep my eye on you  the three countrymen and four of the french sailors who declined to join the thetis were taken back to the cutter and the thetis at once proceeded on her way down channel james had given a hastily scribbled line on the back of an old letter which he happened to have in his pocket to the men who were to be taken ashore but he had very little hope that it would ever reach his mother nor indeed did it ever do so when the cutter reached weymouth with the lugger the men captured in her were at once sent to prison where they remained until they were tried at assizes three months afterwards and although all were acquitted of the charge of unlawful resistance to the kings officers as there was no proof against any of the six men individually they were sentenced to a years imprisonment for smuggling  whether jims hurriedly written letter was thrown overboard or whether it was carried in the pocket of the man to whom he gave it until worn into fragments james never knew but it never reached his mother  the news that james was missing was brought to her upon the day after the event by mr wilks he had as usual gone down after breakfast to report how aggie was getting on with a message from his mother that her charge was now so completely restored that it was unnecessary for her to stay longer at the hall and that she should come home that evening at her usual time hearing from the girl that james had not returned since he went out at nine oclock on the previous evening the old soldier sauntered down to the beach to inquire of the fishermen in whose boat james had gone out  to his surprise he found that none of the boats had put to sea the evening before the men seemed less chatty and communicative than usual most of them were preparing to go out with their boats and none seemed inclined to enter into a conversation rather wondering at their unusual reticence mr wilks strolled along to where the officer of the revenue men was standing with his boatswain watching the fishermen  a fine morning lieutenant  yes the latter assented there will be wind presently have you heard of the doings of last night  no mr wilks said in surprise i have heard nothing i was just speaking to the fishermen but they dont seem in as communicative a mood as usual this morning  the scamps know it is safest for them to keep their mouths shut just at present the officer said grimly i have no doubt a good many of them were concerned in that affair last night we had a fight with the smugglers two of my men were shot and one of theirs and there were a good many cutlass wounds on each side we have taken a score of prisoners but they are all country people who were assisting in the landing the smugglers themselves all got off we made a mess of the affair altogether thanks to some fellow who rushed down and gave the alarm and upset all the plans we had laid  it is too provoking i had got news of the exact spot and hour at which the landing was to take place i had my men all up on the cliff and as the fellows came up with kegs they were to have been allowed to get a hundred yards or so inland and would there have been seized and any shout they made would not have been heard below lieutenant fisher with his party from the next station was to be a little way along at the foot of the cliffs and when the boats came with the second batch he was to rush forward and capture them while we came down from above then we intended to row off and take the lugger there was not wind enough for her to get away  all was going well and the men were just coming up the cliff with the tubs when someone who had passed us on the cliff ran down shouting the alarm we rushed down at once but arrived too late they showed fight and kept us back till fishers party came up but by that time the boats were afloat and the smugglers managed to get in and carry them off in spite of us we caught as i tell you some of the countrymen and fisher has taken them off to weymouth but most of them got away there are several places where the cliff can be climbed by men who know it and i have no doubt half those fishermen you see there were engaged in the business  then the smuggler got away mr wilks asked  i dont know the lieutenant said shortly i had sent word to weymouth and i hope they will catch her in the offing the lugger came down this way first but we made her out and showed a blue light she must have turned and gone back again for this morning at daylight we made her out to the east the cutter was giving chase and at first ran down fast towards her then the smugglers got the wind and the last we saw of them they were running up the channel the cutter some three miles astern  i would give a couple of months pay to know who it was that gave the alarm i expect it was one of those fishermen as far as my men could make out in the darkness the fellow was dressed as a sailor but i must say good morning for i am just going to turn in  mr wilks had been on the point of mentioning that james was missing but a vague idea that he might in some way be mixed up with the events of the previous night checked the question on his lips and yet he thought as the officer walked away it was not probable had james been foolish enough to take part in such a business he would either have been taken prisoner or would after he escaped have returned home he had evidently not been taken prisoner or the officer would have been sure to mention it  much puzzled he walked slowly back to the fishermen some of the boats had already pushed off he went up to three of the men whose boat being higher up than the rest would not be afloat for another quarter of an hour  look here lads he said my young friend jim walsham is missing this morning and hasnt been at home all night as none of the fishing boats put out in the evening he cannot have gone to sea can any of you tell me anything about him  the men gave no answer  you need not be afraid of speaking to me you know he went on and its no business of mine whether any of the men on the shore were concerned in that affair the lieutenant has just been telling me of last night but hearing of that and finding jim is missing i cant help thinking there is some connection between the two things nothing you say to me will go further that i can promise you but the lads mother will be in a terrible way i cant make it out for i know that if he had anything to do with this smuggling business he would have told me again if he was there and got away he would naturally have come straight home for his absence would only throw suspicion upon him  well mr wilks the youngest of the sailors said i dont know nothing about it myself no one does so far as i know but i have heard say this morning as how he was there or thereabouts but dont you let out as i told you cause they would want to know who i heard it from  you can rely upon my silence my lad and heres half a guinea to drink my health between you but cant you tell me a little more  well sir they do say as how it war mr jim as came running down into the middle of them on the beach shouting the alarm with the revenue men close at his heels i dont say as it were helikely enough it werentbut thats the talk and thats all i have heared about the matter how he came for to know of it or how he got there no one knows for sartin he has had nought to do with any landings afore he was a lot among us but i know as he never was told about it for though everyone would have trusted jim still seeing how he was placed with his mother up at the hall and the squire a magistrate it was thought better as he shouldnt be let into it everyone on the shore here likes jim  but if he was there and he hasnt been taken prisonerand i am sure the lieutenant would have told me if he waswhy shouldnt he have got home  we didnt know as he hadnt got home did us bill the fisherman appealed to one of his comrades  no the other said we thought likely he had got safely away with the rest it war a dark night and i expect as everyone was too busy looking after himself to notice about others  he may have been wounded the old soldier said anxiously and may be in hiding in some house near the place  the fisherman was silent such a thing was of course possible  he might that one of the sailors said doubtfully and yet i dont think it the chase was a hot one and i dont think anyone wounded so bad as he couldnt make his way home would have got away i should say as it wur more likely as he got on board one of the boats it seems to me as though he might have come to warn usthat is to say to warn them i meanjust to do em a good turn as he was always ready to do if he had the chance but he wouldnt have had anything to do with the scrimmage and might have been standing quiet like near the boats when the other lot came along the shore and then seeing as the game was up he might likely enough have jumped on board and gone off to the lugger  that is possible mr wilks said anyhow i will go off at once and make inquiries at all the houses within a mile or so of the landing place    chapter 8 discharged   contrary to his usual habits of punctuality mr wilks did not return to luncheon at the hall and it was two hours later before he came in looking fagged and anxious he had been to all the farm houses within two miles of the scene of the fight and had ascertained for certain that jim was not lying wounded at any of them at first his inquiries had everywhere been coldly received there was scarce a farm house near the coast but the occupants had relations with the smugglers assisting with their carts and men at the landings or having hiding places where goods could be stowed away at first therefore all professed entire ignorance of the events of the previous night but when persuaded by the earnestness of the old soldiers manner that his mission was a friendly one they became more communicative and even owned that some of their men had been taken prisoners and marched to weymouth but none of them had heard of any wounded man being in hiding  convinced at last that james must have gone off to the lugger mr wilks returned to sidmouth a prey to great anxiety everything depended now on whether the lugger was captured if so james would have to stand his trial for being concerned in the fight on the beach and as two of the revenue men had been killed his sentence might be a heavy one  if she got away all would be well they would doubtless hear by letter from jim and it would be better that he should not return at present to sidmouth but should at once take up his residence in london and commence his studies there  he met the squire just as the latter was starting for sidmouth  well wilks we began to think that you were lost he said cheerfully aggie was downstairs to lunch and was mightily offended that you should not be there at her first appearance  but you look tired and fagged has anything gone wrong  things have gone very wrong squire  and he related to his friend all the news that he had gathered and his conviction that james walsham was on board the lugger  this is a pretty kettle of fish the squire said irritably what on earth did the boy mean by getting himself mixed up with such an affair as that  it is a foolish business squire the old soldier agreed but we cant expect wise heads on young shoulders i suppose he somehow or other learnt the surprise which the revenue men intended and as most of his friends the fishermen would probably be concerned in it he went to give them notice intending no doubt to go quietly back again before the revenue men arrived i dont know that hes altogether to be blamed in the matter most young fellows would do the same  well i suppose they would the squire agreed reluctantly but it is a most awkward business if the lad gets caught and gets two or three years imprisonment it will ruin his prospects in life his mother will be broken hearted over the business and i am sure aggie will take it terribly to heart they were great friends of old though she hasnt seen much of him for the last two or three years and of course that affair of the other day has made quite a hero of him  we must hope the lugger will get safely over to france his companion said then no great harm will have been done  we must hope so the squire assented moodily confound the young jackanapes turning everything upside down and upsetting us all with his madbrain freaks  mrs walsham was greatly distressed when the news was broken to her by mr wilks and aggie cried so that the squire at last said she must go straight up to bed unless she stopped for she would be making herself ill again when she was somewhat pacified the matter was discussed in every light but the only conclusion to be arrived at was that their sole hope rested in the hugger getting safely off  of course my dear madam the squire said if they are taken i will do my best to get a pardon for your son i am afraid he will have to stand his trial with the rest but i think that with the representations i will make as to his good character i may get a mitigation anyhow of a sentence if they find out that it was he who gave the alarm there will be no hope of a pardon but if that doesnt come out one would represent his being there as a mere boyish freak of adventure and in that case i might get him a free pardon you must not take the matter too seriously to heart it was a foolish business and that is the worst that can be said of it  i think it was a grand thing aggie said indignantly for him to risk being shot and imprisoned and all sorts of dreadful things just to save other people  and i think you are a goose aggie the squire said if everyone were to go and mix themselves up in other peoples business there would be no end of trouble i suppose next you will say that if you heard me arranging with the constable to make a capture of some burglars you would think it a grand thing to put on your hat to run off to warn them  oh grandpapa how can you say such a thing the girl said burglars and smugglers are quite different burglars are wicked men and thieves and robbers smugglers are not they are only trying to get goods in without paying duty  they try to rob the king my dear and in the eyes of the law are just as criminal as burglars both of them are leagued to break the law and both will resist and take life if they are interfered with i allow that in general estimation the smugglers are looked upon in a more favourable light and that a great many people who ought to know better are in league with them but that does not alter the facts of the case  the girl did not argue the question but the squire was perfectly aware that he had in no way convinced her and that her feeling that james walshams action was a highly meritorious one was in no way shaken it was agreed that nothing was to be said about jamess absence and after taking some refreshment mr wilks went down into sidmouth again to tell the girl at mrs walshams that she was not to gossip about james being away  three days later a letter was received by the squire from richard horton  i am taking the opportunity of writing a few lines to you my dear uncle as i have a chance of sending it ashore by the revenue cutter thistle which is lying alongside of us between us we have just captured a rascally smuggling lugger with a cargo of lace silk and spirits you will i am sure be surprised and grieved to hear that among the crew of the lugger was james walsham i could hardly believe my eyes when i saw him in such disreputable company it will be a sad blow for his poor mother as we were short of hands our captain offered the crew of the lugger the choice of shipping with us or being sent on shore for trial most of them chose the former alternative among them james walsham of which i was glad as his mother will be spared the disgrace of his being placed in the dock with his associates i need not say that if i could have obtained his release i should have done so knowing that you had a high opinion of him but it was of course out of my power to interfere  the squire was alone in his study when he received the letter for it was midday before the post arrived at sidmouth when a man from the hall went down each day with a bag to fetch the letters he rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell mr wilks he should be glad if he would step in to him when his friend came he handed him the letter without a word  that settles the matter he said as he threw the letter angrily down upon the table a malicious young viper i wish i had him here  it is not nicely worded the squire said gravely but it was an unpleasant story to have to tell  it was not an unpleasant story for him to tell the old soldier said hotly there is malice in every line of it he speaks of the men as jamess associates talks about the disgrace he would bring on his mother theres malice squire in every line of it  im afraid its a bad letter the squire assented gravely  its a natural letter mr wilks said savagely it is written in a hurry and hes had no time to pick and choose his words and round off his sentences as he generally does in his letters to you he was so full of malicious exultation that he did not think how much he was showing his feeling as he wrote  its a bad letter and a nasty letter the squire assented but let that pass now the first question ishow are we to tell jims mother do you think it will be a relief to her or otherwise  it will be a blow to know that the lugger has been captured mr wilks saida severe blow no doubt for her escape is what we have been building our hopes upon it will be a heavy blow too for her to know that james is a seaman before the mast that it will be years before she will see him again and that all her plans for his future are upset but i think this will be much better for her than if she knew he was a prisoner and would have to stand a trial  between ourselves squire as far as the lad himself is concerned i am not sure that he will be altogether sorry that events have turned out as they have in our talks together he has often confided to me that his own inclinations were altogether for a life of activity and adventure but that as his mothers heart was so set upon his following his fathers profession he had resolved upon never saying a word to her which would lead her to suppose that his own wishes lay in any other direction this business will give him the opportunity he has longed for to see the world without his appearing in any way to thwart his mothers plans  at any rate the squire said i am heartily glad he has got off being tried even if i had got a free pardon for him it would have been a serious slur upon him that he had been imprisoned and would have been awkward for us all in the future i think wilks i will leave it to you to break it to his mother  very well the other agreed it is an unpleasant business squire but perhaps i had better do it it may console her if i tell her that at heart he always wanted to go to sea and that accustomed as he is to knock about in the fishermens boats he will find it no hardship on board a man o war and will come back in the course of two or three years none the worse for his cruise she may think he will take up doctoring again after that though i have my doubts whether he will do that however there is no use in telling her so shall i show her that letter squire  no the squire replied of course you can tell her whats in it but i will keep the letter myself i would give a good deal if he had not written it it is certainly badly worded though why he should feel any malice towards the other is more than i can tell  his companion was about to speak but thought better of it and without another word went to break the news to mrs walsham  mrs walsham was terribly upset after suffering her to cry for some time in silence mr wilks said  my dear madam i know that this news must distress you terribly but it may be that in this as in all things a providence has overruled your plans for your son for his own good i will tell you now what you would never have known had this affair never occurred jim at heart hates his fathers profession he is a dutiful son and rather than give you pain he was prepared to sacrifice all his own feelings and wishes but the lad is full of life and energy the dull existence of a country surgeon in a little town like this is the last he would adopt as his own choice and i own that i am not surprised that a lad of spirit should long for a more adventurous life i should have told you this long ago and advised you that it would be well for you both to put it frankly to him that although you would naturally like to see him following his fathers profession still that you felt that he should choose for himself and that should he select any other mode of life you would not set your wishes against his but the lad would not hear of my doing so he said that rather than upset your cherished plans he would gladly consent to settle down in sidmouth for life i honoured him for his filial spirit but frankly i think he was wrong an eagle is not made to live in a hen coop nor a spirited lad to settle down in a humdrum village and i own that although i regret the manner of his going i cannot look upon it as an unmixed evil that the force of circumstances has taken him out of the course marked out for him and that he will have an opportunity of seeing life and adventure  mrs walsham had listened with a surprise too great to admit of her interrupting the old soldiers remarks  i never dreamed of this she said at last when he ceased i cannot remember now that i ever asked him but i took it for granted that he would like nothing better than to follow in his fathers steps had i known that he objected to it i would not for a moment have forced him against his inclinations of course it is natural that being alone in the world i should like to have him with me still but i would never have been so selfish as to have sacrificed his life to mine still though it would be hard to have parted from him in any way it is harder still to part like this if he was to go he need not have gone as a common sailor the squire who has done so much for him would no doubt instead of sending him to school have obtained a midshipmans berth for him or a commission in the army but it is dreadful to think of him as a common sailor liable to be flogged  well mrs walsham perhaps we may set the matter partly to rights i will speak to the squire and i am sure he will write to his friend at the admiralty and have an order sent out at once for jims discharge at the same time it would be better that he should not return here just at present his name may come out at the trial of the smugglers as being concerned in the affair and it would be better that he should stay away till that matter blows over at any rate if i were you i should write to him telling him that you know now that he has no taste for the medical profession and that should he see anything that he thinks will suit him in america you would not wish him to come home immediately if he has a fancy for staying out there but that if he chooses to return you are sure that the squire will exert himself to give him a start in any other profession he may choose  mrs walsham agreed to carry out the suggestion and that afternoon the squire sent off a letter to his friend at the admiralty and three letters were also posted to james himself  the voyage of the thetis was uneventful her destination was hampton at the opening of chesapeake bay where the troops on board would join the expedition under general braddock which was advancing up the potomac when she arrived there they found several ships of war under commodore keppel braddocks force had marched to wills creek where a military post named fort cumberland had been formed the soldiers on board were at once disembarked and marched up the banks of the potomac to join the force at fort cumberland the sailors were employed in taking stores up the river in boats  james walsham had done his best during the voyage to acquire a knowledge of his duties his experience in the fishing boats was useful to him now and he was soon able to do his work as an ablebodied seaman his good spirits and willingness rendered him a general favourite he was glad that he was not put in the same watch with richard horton as after their first meeting the young lieutenant showed no signs of recognition he was not james found popular among the men he was exacting and overbearing with them and some on board who had served with him on his previous voyage had many tales to his disadvantage  a fortnight after the arrival of the thetis at hampton orders were issued among the ships of war for thirty volunteers for braddocks expedition of which the thetis was to furnish ten so many sent in their names that the first lieutenant had difficulty in choosing ten who were looked upon with envy by the rest of the ships company for there seemed little chance at present of fighting at sea and the excitement of a march on shore with adventures of all sorts and encounters with the french and their indian allies seemed delightful to the tars  upon the following day a ship arrived from england and an hour afterwards an order was passed forward that the first lieutenant wanted james walsham upon the quarterdeck  walsham he said an order has just come from the admiralty for your discharge and you are to have a passage in the first ship returning if you choose to take it i am sorry you are leaving the ship for i have noticed that you show great willingness and activity and will make a firstrate sailor still i suppose your friends in england did not care about your remaining before the mast  james touched his hat and walked forward he was scarcely surprised for he had thought that his mother would probably ask the squire to use his influence to obtain his discharge he scarcely knew whether he was glad or sorry he was in a false position and could not hope for promotion except by some lucky chance such as was not likely to occur of distinguishing himself  at the same time he sighed as he thought that he must now return and take up the profession for which his mother had intended him a quarter of an hour later however the ships corporal came round and distributed the mails and james to his delight found there were three letters for him he tore open that from his mother it began by gently upbraiding him for getting himself mixed up in the fight between the smugglers and the revenue men  in the next place my dear boy she said i must scold you even more for not confiding in your mother as to your wishes about your future profession mr wilks has opened my eyes to the fact that while i have all along been taking it for granted that your wishes agreed with mine as to your profession you have really been sacrificing all your own inclinations in order to avoid giving me pain i am very thankful to him for having opened my eyes for i should have been grieved indeed had i found when too late that i had chained you down to a profession you dislike  of course i should have liked to have had you with me but in no case would have had you sacrifice yourself still less now when i have met with such kind friends and am happy and comfortable in my life therefore my boy let us set aside at once all idea of your becoming a doctor there is no occasion for you to choose immediately what you will do you are too old now to enter the royal navy and it is well that before you finally decide on a profession you have the opportunity of seeing something of the world  i inclose bank notes for a hundred pounds so that if you like you can stay for a few weeks or months in the colonies and then take your passage home from new york or boston by that time too all talk about this affair with the smugglers will have ceased but as your name is likely to come out at the trial of the men who were taken so the squire thinks it will be better for you to keep away for a time  the rest of the letter was filled up with an account of the excitement and alarm which had been felt when he was first missed  we were glad indeed she said when a letter was received from richard horton saying that you were on board the thetis mr wilks tells me it was an abominably spiteful letter and i am sure the squire thinks so too from the tone in which he spoke this afternoon about his nephew but i can quite forgive him for if it had not been for his letter we should not have known what had become of you and many months might have passed before we might have heard from you in america as it is only four or five days have been lost and the squire is writing tonight to obtain your discharge which he assures me there will be no difficulty whatever about  the squires was a very cordial letter and he too enclosed notes for a hundred pounds  mr wilks tells me he said that you do not like the thought of doctoring i am not surprised and i think that a young fellow of such spirit and courage as you have shown ought to be fitted for something better than administering pills and draughts to the old women of sidmouth tell me frankly when you write what you would like you are of course too old for the royal navy if you like to enter the merchant service i have no doubt i could arrange with some shipping firm in bristol and would take care that by the time you get to be captain you should also be part owner of the ship if on the other hand you would like to enter the armyand it seems to me that there are stirring times approachingi think that through one or other of my friends in london i could obtain a commission for you if there is anything else you would like better than this you may command my best services i never forget how much i am indebted to you for my present happiness and whatever i can do for you still shall feel myself deeply your debtor  the old soldier wrote a characteristic letter in the first place he told james that he regarded him as a fool for mixing up in an affair in which he had no concern whatever then he congratulated him on the fact that circumstances had broken the chain from which he would never otherwise have freed himself  you must not be angry with me he said for having betrayed your confidence and told the truth to your mother i did it in order to console her by showing her that things were after all for the best and i must say that madam took my news in the very best spirit and i am sure you will see this by her letter to you there is no one i honour and esteem more than i do her and i was sure all along that you were making a mistake in not telling her frankly what your wishes were now you have got a roving commission for a time and it will be your own fault if you dont make the best of it there is likely to be an exciting time in the colonies and you are not the lad i take you for if you dawdle away your time in the towns instead of seeing what is going on in the forest  these letters filled james with delight and without an hours delay he sat down to answer them in his letter to the squire he thanked him most warmly for his kindness and said that above all things he should like a commission in the army he wrote a very tender and affectionate letter to his mother telling her how much he felt her goodness in so promptly relinquishing her own plans and in allowing him to choose the life he liked  thank aggie he concluded for the message she sent by you give her my love and dont let her forget me  to the old soldier he wrote a gossipping account of his voyage  it was impossible he said for the news of my discharge to have come at a better moment thirty sailors from the fleet are going with general braddocks force and everyone else is envying their good lucki among them now i shall go up at once and join the virginian regiment which is accompanying them i shall join that instead of either of the line regiments as i can leave when i like besides if the squire is able to get me a commission it would have been pleasanter for me to have been fighting here as a volunteer than as a private in the line  by the way nobody thinks there will be much fighting so dont let my mother worry herself about me but at any rate a march through the great forests of this country with a chance of a brush with the redskins will be great fun perhaps by the time it is over i may get a letter from you saying that i have got my commission as i hear there is a chance of a regular war between the french and us out here the commission may be for a regiment on this side  after finishing his letters and giving them to the ships corporal to place in the next post bag james said goodbye to his messmates and prepared to go on shore the ten men chosen for the expedition were also on the point of starting richard horton was standing near in a state of great discontent that he had not been chosen to accompany them in their expedition james walsham stepped up to him and touched his hat respectfully  i wish to thank you lieutenant horton for your extremely kind letter telling my friends that i was on board this ship it has been the means of my obtaining my discharge at once instead of having to serve for many months before i could send the news home and obtain an answer in return  without another word he turned and walking to the gangway took his place in a boat about starting with some sailors for the shore leaving richard horton in a state of fury with himself for having been the means of obtaining jamess discharge he had already more than once felt uncomfortable as he thought of the wording of the letter and that this indulgence of his spite had had the effect of restoring jamess liberty rendered him wellnigh mad with rage  on landing james walsham at once disposed of his sailors clothes and purchased a suit similar to those worn by the colonists then he obtained a passage up the river to alexandria where the transports which had brought the troops were still lying here one of the companies of the virginia corps was stationed and james finding that they were expecting every day to be ordered up to wills creek determined to join them at once  the scene was a busy one stores were being landed from the transports teamsters were loading up their waggons officers were superintending the operations the men of the virginia corps who wore no uniform but were attired in the costume used by hunters and backwoodsmen namely a loose hunting shirt short trousers or breeches and gaiters were moving about unconcernedly while a few of them musket on shoulder were on guard over the piles of stores  presently a tall slightlybuilt young man with a pleasant but resolute face came riding along and checked his horse close to where james was standing james noticed that the men on sentry who had for the most part been sitting down on fallen logs of wood bales or anything else which came handy with their muskets across their knees or leaning beside them got up and began pacing to and fro with some semblance of military position  who is that young man he asked a teamster standing by  that is colonel washington the man replied one of the smartest of the colonial officers  why he only looks two or three and twenty james said in surprise  he is not more than that the man said but age dont go for much here and colonel washington is adjutant general of the virginian militia only a few months back he made a journey with despatches right through the forests to the french station at port de beuf and since then he has been in command of the party which went out to build a fort at the forks of the ohio and had some sharp fighting with the french a wonderful smart young officer they say he is just as cool when the bullets are flying as if sitting on horseback  james resolved at once that he would speak to colonel washington and ask him if he could join the virginian militia he accordingly went up to him and touched his hat  if you please sir i am anxious to join the virginian militia and as they tell me that you are adjutant general i have come to ask you if i can do so  i see no difficulty in it my lad the colonel said but if you have run away from home in search of adventure i should advise you to go back again for we are likely to have heavy work  i dont mind that sir and i have not run away i am english i was pressed on board a frigate and was brought over here but my friends in england procured my discharge which came for me here a fortnight after my arrival they are i believe about to obtain for me a commission in a kings regiment but as i was here i thought that i should like to see some service as it may be some months before i hear that i have got my commission i would rather if i could join as a volunteer as i do not want pay my friends having supplied me amply with money  you seem to be a lad of spirit colonel washington said and i will at once put you in the way of doing what you desire you shall join the virginian corps as a volunteer have you money enough to buy a horse  yes plenty jim said i have two hundred pounds  then you had better leave a hundred and fifty at least behind you the colonel said i will direct you to a trader here with whom you can bank it you can get an excellent horse for twenty pounds i asked you because if you like i can attach you to myself i often want a mounted messenger and of course as a volunteer you would mess with me  i should like it above all things james said thankfully  then we will at once go to the tent of the officer commanding this company washington said and enroll you as a volunteer  on reaching the tent washington dismounted and led the way in  captain hall he said this is a young english gentleman who will shortly have a commission in the kings army but in the meantime he wishes to see a little brisk fighting so he is to be enrolled as a volunteer in your company but he is going to obtain a horse and will act as a sort of aidedecamp to me  captain hall at once entered jamess name as a volunteer on the roll of his company  do you know of anyone who has a good horse for sale washington asked  yes the captain replied at least there was a farmer here half an hour ago with a goodlooking horse which he wants to sell i have no doubt he is in the camp still  captain hall went to the door of the tent and told two of the men there to find the farmer and tell him he had a purchaser for his horse  ten minutes later the farmer came up and james bought the horse captain hall doing the bargaining for him  now washington said we will go round to the storekeeper i spoke of and deposit the best part of your money with him i should only take a pound or two if i were you for you will find no means of spending money when you once set forward and should anything happen to you the indians would not appreciate the value of those english notes of yours you will want a brace of pistols and a sword a blanket and cooking potthat is about the extent of your camp equipment    chapter 9 the defeat of braddock   england and france were at this time at peace in europe although the troops of both nations were about to engage in conflict in the forests of america their position there was an anomalous one england owned the belt of colonies on the east coast france was mistress of canada in the north of louisiana in the south and moreover claimed the whole of the vast country lying behind the british colonies which were thus cooped up on the seaboard her hold however of this great territory was extremely slight she had strong posts along the chain of lakes from the saint lawrence to lake superior but between these and louisiana her supremacy was little more than nominal  the canadian population were frugal and hardy but they were deficient in enterprise and the priests who ruled them with a rod of iron for canada was intensely catholic discouraged any movements which would take their flocks from under their charge upon the other hand the colonists of new england pennsylvania and virginia were men of enterprise and energy and their traders pushing in large numbers across the alleghenies carried on an extensive trade with the indians in the valley of the ohio thereby greatly exciting the jealousy of the french who feared that the indians would ally themselves with the british colonists and that the connection between canada and louisiana would be thereby cut  the english colonists were greatly superior to the french in number but they laboured under the disadvantage that the colonies were wholly independent of each other with strong mutual jealousies which paralysed their action and prevented their embarking upon any concerted operations upon the other hand canada was governed by the french as a military colony the governor was practically absolute and every man capable of bearing arms could if necessary be called by him into the field he had at his disposal not only the wealth of the colony but large assistance from france and the french agents were therefore able to outbid the agents of the british colonies with the indians  for years there had been occasional troubles between the new england states and the french the latter employing the indians in harassing the border but until the middle of the eighteenth century there had been nothing like a general trouble in 1749 the marquis of galissoniere was governor general of canada the treaty of aix la chapelle had been signed but this had done nothing to settle the vexed question of the boundaries between the english and french colonies meanwhile the english traders from pennsylvania and virginia were poaching on the domain which france claimed as hers ruining the french fur trade and making friends with the indian allies of canada worse still farmers were pushing westward and settling in the valley of the ohio  in order to drive these back to impress the natives with the power of france and to bring them back to their allegiance the governor of canada in the summer of 1749 sent celoron de bienville he had with him fourteen officers twenty french soldiers a hundred and eighty canadians and a band of indians they embarked in twentythree birchbark canoes and pushing up the saint lawrence reached lake ontario stopping for a time at the french fort of frontenac and avoiding the rival english port of oswego on the southern shore where a trade in beaver skins disastrous to french interests was being carried on for the english traders sold their goods at vastly lower prices than those which the french had charged  on the 6th of july the party reached niagara where there was a small french fort and thence carrying their canoes round the cataract launched them upon lake erie landing again on the southern shore of the lake they carried their canoes nine miles through the forest to chautauqua lake and then dropped down the stream running out of it until they reached the ohio the fertile country here was inhabited by the delawares shawanoes wyandots and iroquois or indians of the five nations who had migrated thither from their original territories in the colony of new york further west on the banks of the miami the wabash and other streams was a confederacy of the miami and their kindred tribes still further west in the country of the illinois near the mississippi the french had a strong stone fort called fort chartres which formed one of the chief links of the chain of posts that connected quebec with new orleans  the french missionaries and the french political agents had for seventy years laboured hard to bring these indian tribes into close connection with france the missionaries had failed signally but the presents so lavishly bestowed had inclined the tribes to the side of their donors until the english traders with their cheap goods came pushing west over the alleghenies they carried their goods on the backs of horses and journeyed from village to village selling powder rum calicoes beads and trinkets no less than three hundred men were engaged in these enterprises and some of them pushed as far west as the mississippi  as the party of celoron proceeded they nailed plates of tin stamped with the arms of france to trees and buried plates of lead near them with inscriptions saying that they took possession of the land in the name of louis the fifteenth king of france  many of the villages were found to be deserted by the natives who fled at their approach at some however they found english traders who were warned at once to leave the country and by some of them letters were sent to the governor of pennsylvania in which celoron declared that he was greatly surprised to find englishmen trespassing in the domain of france and that his orders were precise to leave no foreign traders within the limits of the government of canada  at chiningue called logstown by the english a large number of natives were gathered most of the inhabitants of the deserted villages having sought refuge there the french were received with a volley of balls from the shore but they landed without replying to the fire and hostilities were avoided the french kept guard all night and in the morning celoron invited the chiefs to a council when he told them he had come by the order of the governor to open their eyes to the designs of the english against their lands and that they must be driven away at once the reply of the chiefs was humble but they begged that the english traders of whom there were at that moment ten in the town might stay a little longer since the goods they brought were necessary to them  after making presents to the chiefs the party proceeded on their way putting up the coats of arms and burying the lead inscriptions at scioto a large number of indians were assembled and the french were very apprehensive of an attack which would doubtless have been disastrous to them as the canadians of the party were altogether unused to war a council was held however at which celoron could obtain no satisfaction whatever for the interests of the indians were bound up with the english  there can be no doubt that had they been able to look into the future every indian on the continent would have joined the french in their effort to crush the english colonies had france remained master of america the indians might even now be roaming free and unmolested on the lands of their forefathers france is not a colonizing nation she would have traded with the indians would have endeavoured to christianize them and would have left them their land and freedom well satisfied with the fact that the flag of france should wave over so vast an extent of country but on england conquering the soil her armies of emigrants pressed west and the red man is fast becoming extinct on the continent of which he was once the lord  celorons expedition sailed down the ohio until it reached the mouth of the miami and toiled for thirteen days against its shallow current until they reached a village of the miami indians ruled over by a chief called by the french la demoiselle but whom the english whose fast friend he was called old britain he was the great chief of the miami confederation  the english traders there withdrew at the approach of the french the usual council was held and celoron urged the chief to remove from this location which he had but newly adopted and to take up his abode with his band near the french fort on the maumee the chief accepted the frenchmans gifts thanked him for his good advice and promised to follow it at a more convenient time but neither promises nor threats could induce him to stir at once  no sooner indeed had the french departed than the chief gathered the greater part of the members of the confederation on that spot until in less than two years after the visit of celoron its population had increased eightfold and it became one of the greatest indian towns of the west and the centre of english trade and influence  celoron reached miami and then returned northward to lake erie and thence back to montreal when he reported to the governor that english influence was supreme in the valley of the ohio  in the following year a company was formed in virginia for effecting a settlement in ohio and a party proceeded west to the village of the chief called old britain by whom they were received with great friendship and a treaty of peace was solemnly made between the english and the indians while the festivities consequent on the affair were going on four ottawa indians arrived from the french with the french flag and gifts but they were dismissed with an answer of defiance if at this time the colonists could have cemented their alliance with the indians with gifts similar to those with which the french endeavoured to purchase their friendship a permanent peace with the indians might have been established but the mutual jealousies of the colonies and the nature of the various colonial assemblies rendered any common action impossible pennsylvania was jealous of the westward advance of virginia and desired to thwart rather than to assist her  the governors of new york pennsylvania and virginia were fully conscious of the importance of the indian alliance but they could do nothing without their assemblies those of new york and pennsylvania were largely composed of tradesmen and farmers absorbed in local interests and animated but by two motives the cutting down of all expenditure and bitter and continuous opposition to the governor who represented the royal authority virginia and pennsylvania quarrelled about their respective rights over the valley of the ohio the assembly of new york refused to join in any common action saying we will take care of our indians and they may take care of theirs  the states further removed from the fear of any danger from the action of the indians and french were altogether lukewarm  thus neither in the valley of the ohio nor on the boundaries of the new england states did the indians receive their promised gifts and as the french agents were liberal both in presents and promises the indians became discontented with their new friends and again turned their eyes towards france old britain however remained firm in his alliance and the english traders by constant presents and by selling their goods at the lowest possible rates kept him and his warriors highly satisfied and contented  the french in vain tried to stir up the friendly tribes to attack oswego on lake ontario and the village of old britain which were the two centres to which the indians went to trade with the english but they were unsuccessful until in june 1752 charles langlade a young french trader married to a squaw at green bay and strong in influence with the tribes of that region came down the lakes with a fleet of canoes manned by two hundred and fifty ottawa and ojibwa warriors they stopped awhile at the fort at detroit then paddled up the maumee to the next fort and thence marched through the forests against the miamis  they approached old britains village in the morning most of the indians were away on their summer hunt and there were but eight english traders in the place three of these were caught outside the village the remaining five took refuge in the fortified warehouse they had built and there defended themselves  old britain and the little band with him fought bravely but against such overwhelming numbers could do nothing and fourteen of them including their chief were killed the five white men defended themselves till the afternoon when two of them managed to make their escape and the other three surrendered one of them was already wounded and was at once killed by the french indians seventy years of the teaching of the french missionaries had not weaned the latter from cannibalism and old britain was boiled and eaten  the marquis of duquesne who had succeeded galissoniere as governor highly praised langlade for the enterprise and recommended him to the minister at home for reward this bold enterprise further shook the alliance of the indians with the english for it seemed to them that the french were enterprising and energetic while the english were slothful and cowardly and neglected to keep their agreements the french continued to build forts and dinwiddie governor of virginia sent george washington to protest in his name against their building forts on land notoriously belonging to the english crown  washington performed the long and toilsome journey through the forests at no slight risks and delivered his message at the forts but nothing came of it the governor of virginia seeing the approaching danger made the greatest efforts to induce the other colonies to join in common action but north carolina alone answered the appeal and gave money enough to raise three or four hundred men two independent companies maintained by england in new york and one in south carolina received orders to march to virginia the governor had raised with great difficulty three hundred men they were called the virginia regiment an english gentleman named joshua fry was appointed the colonel and washington their major  fry was at alexandria on the potomac with half the regiment washington with the other half had pushed forward to the storehouse at wills creek which was to form the base of operations besides these captain trent with a band of backwoodsmen had crossed the mountain to build a fort at the forks of the ohio where pittsburgh now stands  trent had gone back to wills creek leaving ensign ward with forty men at work upon the fort when on the 17th of april a swarm of canoes came down the allegheny with over five hundred frenchmen who planted cannon against the unfinished stockade and summoned the ensign to surrender he had no recourse but to submit and was allowed to depart with his men across the mountains  the french at once set to to build a strong fort which they named fort duquesne while the governor of virginia had been toiling in vain to get the colonists to move the french had acted promptly and the erection of their new fort at once covered their line of communication to the west barred the advance of the english down the ohio valley and secured the allegiance of all the wavering indian tribes  although war had not yet been declared between england and france the colonists after this seizure by french soldiers of a fort over which the english flag was flying henceforth acted as if the two powers were at war washington moved forward from wills creek with his hundred and fifty men and surprised a french force which had gone out scouting several of the french were killed and the commander of fort duquesne sent despatches to france to say that he had sent this party out with a communication to washington and that they had been treacherously assassinated  this obscure skirmish was the commencement of a war which set two continents on fire colonel fry died a few days after this fight and washington succeeded to the command of the regiment and collected his three hundred men at green meadow where he was joined by a few indians and by a company from south carolina  the french at duquesne were quickly reinforced and the command was given to coulon de villiers the brother of an officer who had been killed in the skirmish with washington he at once advanced against the english who had fallen back to a rough breastwork which they called fort necessity washington having but four hundred men against five hundred french and as many indians  for nine hours the french kept up a hot fire on the intrenchment but without success and at nightfall villiers proposed a parley the french ammunition was running short the men were fatigued by their marches and drenched by the rain which had been falling the whole day the english were in a still worse plight their powder was nearly spent their guns were foul and among them they had but two cleaning rods  after a parley it was agreed that the english should march off with drums beating and the honours of war carrying with them all their property that the prisoners taken in the previous affair should be set free two officers remaining with the french as hostages until they were handed over  washington and his men arrived utterly worn out with fatigue and famine at wills creek this action left the french masters of the whole country beyond the alleghenies  the two mother nations were now preparing for war and in the middle of january 1755 major general braddock with the 44th and 48th regiments each five hundred strong sailed from cork for virginia while the french sent eighteen ships of war and six battalions to canada  admiral boscawen with eleven ships of the line and one frigate set out to intercept the french expedition the greater part of the fleet evaded him but he came up with three of the french men of war opened fire upon them and captured them up to this time a pretence of negotiations had been maintained between england and france but the capture of the french ships brought the negotiations to a sudden end and the war began  a worse selection than that of major general braddock could hardly have been made he was a brave officer and a good soldier but he was rough coarse and obstinate he utterly despised the colonial troops and regarded all methods of fighting save those pursued by regular armies in the field with absolute contempt to send such a man to command troops destined to fight in thick forests against an enemy skilled in warfare of that kind was to court defeat  as might be expected braddock was very soon on the worst possible terms with the whole of the colonial authorities and the delays caused by the indecision or obstinacy of the colonial assemblies chafed him to madness at last however his force was assembled at wills creek the two english regiments had been raised by enlistment in virginia to 700 men each there were nine virginian companies of fifty men and the thirty sailors lent by commodore keppel general braddock had three aidesdecampcaptain robert orme captain roger morris and colonel george washington  it was the 1st of june when james walsham rode with colonel washington into the camp and three days later the last companies of the virginian corps marched in during the next week some of the english officers attempted to drill the virginians in the manner of english troops  it is a waste of time colonel washington said to james one day when he was watching them and worse these men can fight their own way most of them are good shots and have a fair idea of forest fighting let them go their own way and they can be trusted to hold their own against at least an equal number of french and indians but they would be hopelessly at sea if they were called upon to fight like english regulars most likely the enemy will attack us in the forest and what good will forming in line or wheeling on a flank or any of the things which the general is trying to drum into their heads do to them if the french are foolish enough to wait at fort duquesne until we arrive i have no doubt we shall beat them but if they attack us in the woods it will go hard with us  during the ten days which elapsed between his arrival and the start james was kept hard at work being for the most part employed galloping up and down the road urging up the waggoners and bringing back reports as to their position and progress on the 10th of june the army started 300 axemen led the way cutting and clearing the road the long train of pack horses waggons and cannon followed the troops marched in the forest on either side while men were thrown out on the flanks and scouts ranged the woods to guard against surprise  the road was cut but twelve feet wide and the line of march often extended four miles thus day by day they toiled on crossing the allegheny mountains range after range now plunging down into a ravine now ascending a ridge but always in the deep shadow of the forest a few of the enemy hovered round them occasionally killing a straggler who fell behind  on the 18th of june the army reached a place called the little meadows so weak were the horses from want of forage that the last marches had been but three miles a day and upon washingtons advice braddock determined to leave the heavy baggage here with the sick men and a strong guard under colonel dunbar while he advanced with 1200 men besides officers and drivers  but the progress was still no more than three miles a day and it was not until the 7th of july that they arrived within eight miles of the french fort between them lay however an extremely difficult country with a narrow defile and braddock determined to ford the monongahela and then cross it again lower down  the garrison of fort duquesne consisted of a few companies of regular troops some hundreds of canadians and 800 indian warriors they were kept informed by the scouts of the progress of the english and when the latter approached the monongahela a party under captain beaujeu set out to meet them his force consisted of 637 indians 100 french officers and soldiers and 146 canadians in all about 900 men  at one oclock in the day braddock crossed the monongahela for the second time the troops had all the day been expecting the attack and had prepared for it at the second ford the army marched in martial order with music playing and flags flying once across the river they halted for a short time and then again continued their advance  braddock made every disposition for preventing a surprise several guides with six virginian light horsemen led the way then came the advanced column consisting of 300 soldiers under gage and a large body of axemen under sir john sinclair with two cannon the main body followed close behind the artillery and waggons moved along the road the troops marched through the woods on either hand numerous flanking parties were thrown out a hundred yards or more right and left and in the space between them and the line of troops the pack horses and cattle made their way as they best could among the trees  beaujeu had intended to place his men in ambuscade at the ford but owing to various delays caused by the indians he was still a mile away from the ford when the british crossed he was marching forward when he came suddenly upon the little party of guides and virginian light horsemen these at once fell back the indians raised their war whoop and spreading right and left among the trees opened a sharp fire upon the british  gages column wheeled deliberately into line and fired volley after volley with great steadiness at the invisible opponents the greater part of the canadians bolted at once but the indians kept up their fire from behind the shelter of the trees gage brought up his two cannon and opened fire and the indians who had a horror of artillery began also to fall back  the english advanced in regular lines cheering loudly beaujeu fell dead but captain dumas who succeeded him in command advanced at the head of his small party of french soldiers and opened a heavy fire  the indians encouraged by the example rallied and again came forward and while the french regulars and the few canadians who had not fled held the ground in front of the column the indians swarmed through the forests along both flanks of the english and from behind trees bushes and rocks opened a withering fire upon them the troops bewildered and amazed by the fire poured into them by an invisible foe and by the wild war whoops of the indians ceased to advance and standing close together poured fruitlessly volley after volley into the surrounding forest  on hearing the firing braddock leaving 400 men in the rear under sir peter halket to guard the baggage advanced with the main body to support gage but just as he came up the soldiers appalled by the fire which was mowing them down in scores abandoned their cannon and fell back in confusion this threw the advancing force into disorder and the two regiments became mixed together massed in several dense bodies within a small space of ground facing some one way and some another all alike exposed without shelter to the hail of bullets  men and officers were alike new to warfare like this they had been taught to fight in line against solid masses of the enemy and against an invisible foe like the present they were helpless the virginians alone were equal to the emergency they at once adopted their familiar forest tactics and taking their post behind trees began to fight the indians in their own way  had braddock been a man of judgment and temper the fortunes of the day might yet have been retrieved for the virginians could have checked the indians until the english troops were rallied and prepared to meet the difficulty but to braddock the idea of men fighting behind trees was at once cowardly and opposed to all military discipline and he dashed forward on his horse and with fierce oaths ordered the virginians to form line a body of them however under captain waggoner made a dash for a huge fallen tree far out towards the lurking places of the indians and crouching behind it opened fire upon them but the regulars seeing the smoke among the bushes took them for the enemy and firing killed many and forced the rest to return  a few of the soldiers tried to imitate the indians and fight behind the trees but braddock beat them back with the flat of his sword and forced them to stand with the others who were now huddled in a mass forming a target for the enemys bullets lieutenant colonel burton led 100 of them towards a knoll from which the puffs came thickest but he fell wounded and his men on whom the enemy instantly concentrated their fire fell back the soldiers powerless against the unseen foe for afterwards some of the officers and men who escaped declared that throughout the whole fight they had not seen a single indian discharged their guns aimlessly among the trees  they were half stupefied now with the terror and confusion of the scene the rain of bullets the wild yells which burst ceaselessly from their 600 savage foemen while the horses wild with terror and wounds added to the confusion by dashing madly hither and thither braddock behaved with furious intrepidity he dashed hither and thither shouting and storming at the men and striving to get them in order and to lead them to attack the enemy four horses were one after the other shot under him his officers behaved with equal courage and self devotion and in vain attempted to lead on the men sometimes advancing in parties towards the indians in hopes that the soldiers would follow them sir peter halket was killed horne and morris the two aidesdecamp sinclair the quartermaster general gates gage and gladwin were wounded of 86 officers 63 were killed or disabled while of noncommissioned officers and privates only 459 came off unharmed  james walsham had been riding by the side of washington when the fight began and followed him closely as he galloped among the troops trying to rally and lead them forward washingtons horse was pierced by a ball and staggering fell james leaped from his horse and gave it to the colonel and then seeing that there was nothing for him to do withdrew a short distance from the crowd of soldiers and crouched down between the trunks of two great trees growing close to each other one of which protected him for the most part from the fire of the indians and the other from the not less dangerous fire of the english presently seeing a soldier fall at a short distance from him he ran out and picked up his musket and cartridge box and began to fire at the bushes where the puffs of smoke showed that men were in hiding  after three hours passive endurance of this terrible fire braddock seeing that all was lost commanded a retreat and he and such officers as were left strove to draw off the soldiers in some semblance of order but at this moment a bullet struck him and passing through his arm penetrated his lungs and he fell from his horse he demanded to be left where he lay but captain stewart of the virginians and one of his men bore him between them to the rear  the soldiers had now spent all their ammunition and no longer kept in their places by their general broke away in a wild panic washingtons second horse had now been shot and as trying to check the men he passed the trees where james had taken up his position the latter joined him  in vain washington and his other officers tried to rally the men at the ford they dashed across it wild with fear leaving their wounded comrades cannon baggage and military chest a prey to the indians  fortunately only about fifty of the indians followed as far as the ford the rest being occupied in killing the wounded and scalping the dead dumas who had now but twenty frenchmen left fell back to the fort and the remnants of braddocks force continued the flight unmolested    chapter 10 the fight at lake george   fortunate was it for the remnant of braddocks force that the indians were too much occupied in gathering the abundant harvest of scalps too anxious to return to the fort to exhibit these trophies of their bravery to press on in pursuit for had they done so few indeed of the panicstricken fugitives would ever have lived to tell the tale all night these continued their flight expecting every moment to hear the dreaded war whoop burst out again in the woods round them  colonel washington had been ordered by the dying general to press on on horseback to the camp of dunbar and to tell him to forward waggons provisions and ammunition but the panic which had seized the main force had already been spread by flying teamsters to dunbars camp many soldiers and waggoners at once took flight and the panic was heightened when the remnants of braddocks force arrived there was no reason to suppose that they were pursued and even had they been so their force was ample to repel any attack that could be made upon it but probably their commander saw that in their present state of utter demoralization they could not be trusted to fight and that the first indian war whoop would start them again in flight still it was clear that a retreat would leave the whole border open to the ravages of the indians and colonel dunbar was greatly blamed for the course he took  a hundred waggons were burned the cannon and shells burst and the barrels of powder emptied into the stream the stores of provisions scattered through the woods and then the force began its retreat over the mountains to fort cumberland sixty miles away general braddock died the day that the retreat began his last words were  we shall know better how to deal with them next time  the news of the disaster came like a thunderbolt upon the colonists success had been regarded as certain and the news that some fourteen hundred english troops had been utterly routed by a body of french and indians of half their strength seemed almost incredible the only consolation was that the hundred and fifty virginians who had accompanied the regulars had all as was acknowledged by the english officers themselves fought with the greatest bravery and had kept their coolness and presence of mind till the last and that on them no shadow of the discredit of the affair rested indeed it was said that the greater part were killed not by the fire of the indians but by that of the troops who standing in masses fired in all directions regardless of what was in front of them  but colonel dunbar not satisfied with retreating to the safe shelter of fort cumberland to the amazement of the colonists insisted upon withdrawing with his own force to philadelphia leaving the whole of the frontier open to the assaults of the hostile indians after waiting a short time at philadelphia he marched slowly on to join a force operating against the french in the region of lake george more than two hundred miles to the north he took with him only the regulars the provincial regiments being under the control of the governors of their own states  washington therefore remained behind in virginia with the regiment of that colony the blanks made in braddocks fight were filled up and the force raised to a thousand strong with these he was to protect a frontier of three hundred and fifty miles long against an active and enterprising foe more numerous than himself and who acting on the other side of the mountain and in the shade of the deep forests could choose their own time of attack and launch themselves suddenly upon any village throughout the whole length of the frontier  nor were the troops at his disposal the material which a commander would wish to have in his hand individually they were brave but being recruited among the poor whites the most turbulent and troublesome part of the population they were wholly unamenable to discipline and washington had no means whatever for enforcing it he applied to the house of assembly to pass a law enabling him to punish disobedience but for months they hesitated to pass any such ordinance on the excuse that it would trench on the liberty of free white men  the service indeed was most unpopular and washington whose headquarters were at winchester could do nothing whatever to assist the settlements on the border his officers were as unruly as the men and he was further hampered by having to comply with the orders of governor dinwiddie at williamsburg two hundred miles away  what do you mean to do he had asked james walsham the day that the beaten army arrived at fort cumberland  i do not know james said i certainly will not continue with dunbar who seems to me to be acting like a coward nor do i wish to go into action with regulars again not at least until they have been taught that if they are to fight indians successfully in the forests they must abandon all their traditions of drill and must fight in indian fashion i should like to stay with you if you will allow me  i should be very glad to have you with me washington said but i do not think that you will see much action here it will be a war of forays the indians will pounce upon a village or solitary farm house murder and scalp the inhabitants burn the buildings to the ground and in an hour be far away beyond reach of pursuit all that i can do is to occupy the chief roads by which they can advance into the heart of the colony and the people of the settlements lying west of that must perforce abandon their homesteads and fly east until we are strong enough to again take up the offensive  were i in your place i would at once take horse and ride north you will then be in plenty of time if inclined to join in the expedition against the french on fort george or in that which is going to march on niagara i fancy the former will be ready first you will find things better managed there than here the colonists in that part have for many years been accustomed to indian fighting and they will not be hampered by having regular troops with them whose officers only idea of warfare is to keep their men standing in line as targets for the enemy  there are many bodies of experienced scouts to which you can attach yourself and you will see that white men can beat the indians at their own game  although sorry to leave the young virginian officer james walsham thought that he could not do better than follow his advice and accordingly the next day having procured another horse he set off to join the column destined to operate on the lakes  the prevision of washington was shortly realized and a cloud of red warriors descended on the border settlements carrying murder rapine and ruin before them scores of quiet settlements were destroyed hundreds of men women and children massacred and in a short time the whole of the outlying farms were deserted and crowds of weeping fugitives flocked eastward behind the line held by washingtons regiment  but bad as affairs were in virginia those in pennsylvania were infinitely worse they had for many years been on such friendly terms with the indians that many of the settlers had no arms nor had they the protection in the way of troops which the government of virginia put upon the frontier the government of the colony was at philadelphia far to the east and sheltered from danger and the quaker assembly there refused to vote money for a single soldier to protect the unhappy colonists on the frontier they held it a sin to fight and above all to fight with indians and as long as they themselves were free from the danger they turned a deaf ear to the tales of massacre and to the pitiful cries for aid which came from the frontier but even greater than their objection to war was their passion of resistance to the representative of royalty the governor  petition after petition came from the border for arms and ammunition and for a militia law to enable the people to organize and defend themselves but the quakers resisted declaring that braddocks defeat was a just judgment upon him and his soldiers for molesting the french in their settlement in ohio they passed indeed a bill for raising fifty thousand pounds for the kings use but affixed to it a condition to which they knew well the governor could not assent viz that the proprietary lands were to pay their share of the tax  to this condition the governor was unable to assent for according to the constitution of the colony to which he was bound the lands of william penn and his descendants were free of all taxation for weeks the deadlock continued every day brought news of massacres of tens fifties and even hundreds of persons but the assembly remained obstinate until the mayor aldermen and principal citizens clamoured against them and four thousand frontiersmen started on their march to philadelphia to compel them to take measures for defence  bodies of massacred men were brought from the frontier villages and paraded through the town and so threatening became the aspect of the population that the assembly of quakers were at last obliged to pass a militia law it was however an absolutely useless one it specially excepted the quakers from service and constrained nobody but declared it lawful for such as chose to form themselves into companies and to elect officers by ballot the company officers might if they saw fit elect also by ballot colonels lieutenant colonels and majors these last might then in conjunction with the governor frame articles of war to which however no officer or man was to be subjected unless after three days consideration he subscribed them in presence of a justice of the peace and declared his willingness to be bound by them  this mockery of a bill drawn by benjamin franklin while the savages were raging in the colony and the smoke of a hundred villages was ascending to the skies was received with indignation by the people and this rose to such a height that the assembly must have yielded unconditionally had not a circumstance occurred which gave them a decent pretext for retreat  the governor informed them that he had just received a letter from the proprietors as penns heirs were called giving to the province five thousand pounds to aid in its defence on condition that the money should be accepted as a free gift and not as their proportion of any tax that was or might be laid by the assembly  thereupon the assembly struck out the clause taxing the proprietory estates and the governor signed the bill a small force was then raised which enabled the indians to be to some extent kept in check but there was no safety for the unhappy settlers in the west of pennsylvania during the next three years while the french from montreal were hounding on their savage allies by gifts and rewards to deeds of massacre and bloodshed  the northern colonies had shown a better spirit massachusetts which had always been the foremost of the northern colonies in resisting french and indian aggression had at once taken the lead in preparation for war no less than 4500 men being one in eight of her adult males volunteered to fight the french and enlisted for the various expeditions some in the pay of the province some in that of the king shirley the governor of massachusetts himself a colonist was requested by his assembly to nominate the commander he did not choose an officer of that province as this would have excited the jealousy of the others but nominated william johnson of new yorka choice which not only pleased that important province but had great influence in securing the alliance of the indians of the five nations among whom johnson who had held the post of indian commissioner was extremely popular  connecticut voted 1200 men new hampshire 500 rhode island 400 and new york 800 all at their own charge johnson before assuming the command invited the warriors of the five nations to assemble in council eleven hundred indian warriors answered the invitation and after four days speech making agreed to join only 300 of them however took the field for so many of their friends and relatives were fighting for the french that the rest when they sobered down after the excitement of the council returned to their homes  the object of the expedition was the attack of crown pointan important military post on lake champlainand the colonists assembled near albany but there were great delays the five colonial assemblies controlled their own troops and supplies connecticut had refused to send her men until shirley promised that her commanding officer should rank next to johnson and the whole movement was for some time at a deadlock because the five governments could not agree about their contributions of artillery and stores  the troops were a roughlooking body only one of the corps had a blue uniform faced with red the rest wore their ordinary farm clothing all had brought their own guns of every description and fashion they had no bayonets but carried hatchets in their belts as a sort of substitute  in point of morals the army composed almost entirely of farmers and farmers sons was exemplary it is recorded that not a chicken was stolen in the camps of the puritan soldiers of new england sermons were preached twice a week and there were daily prayers and much singing of psalms but these good people were much shocked by the profane language of the troops from new york and rhode island and some prophesied that disaster would be sure to fall upon the army from this cause  months were consumed in various delays and on the 21st of august just as they were moving forward four mohawks whom johnson had sent into canada returned with the news that the french were making great preparations and that 8000 men were marching to defend crown point the papers of general braddock which fell with all the baggage of the army into the hands of the french had informed them of the object of the gathering at albany and now that they had no fear of any further attempt against their posts in ohio they were able to concentrate all their force for the defence of their posts on lake champlain  on the receipt of this alarming news a council of war was held at albany and messages were sent to the colonies asking for reinforcements in the meantime the army moved up the hudson to the spot called the great carrying place where colonel lyman who was second in command had gone forward and erected a fort which his men called after him but was afterwards named fort edward  james walsham joined the army a few days before it moved forward he was received with great heartiness by general johnson to whom he brought a letter of introduction from colonel washington and who at once offered him a position as one of his aidesdecamp this he found exceedingly pleasant for johnson was one of the most jovial and open hearted of commanders his hospitality was profuse and his private means being large he was able to keep a capital table which on the line of march all officers who happened to pass by were invited to share this was a contrast indeed to the discipline which had prevailed in braddocks columns and james felt as if he were starting upon a great picnic rather than upon an arduous march against a superior force  after some hesitation as to the course the army should take it was resolved to march for lake george gangs of axemen were sent to hew a way and on the 26th 2000 men marched for the lake while colonel blanchard of new hampshire remained with 500 to finish and defend fort lyman the march was made in a leisurely manner and the force took two days to traverse the fourteen miles between fort lyman and the lake they were now in a country hitherto untrodden by white men save by solitary hunters  they reached the southern end of the beautiful lake which hitherto had received no english name and was now first called lake george in honour of the king the men set to work and felled trees until they had cleared a sufficient extent of ground for their camp by the edge of the water and posted themselves with their back to the lake in their front was a forest of pitch pine on their right a marsh covered with thick brush wood on their left a low hill things went on in the same leisurely way which had marked the progress of the expedition  no attempt was made to clear away the forest in front although it would afford excellent cover for any enemy who might attack them nor were any efforts made to discover the whereabouts or intention of the enemy every day waggons came up with provisions and boats  on september 7th an indian scout arrived about sunset and reported that he had found the trail of a body of men moving from south bay the southern extremity of lake champlain towards fort lyman johnson called for a volunteer to carry a letter of warning to colonel blanchard a waggoner named adams offered to undertake the perilous service and rode off with the letter sentries were posted and the camp fell asleep  while johnson had been taking his leisure on lake george the commander of the french force a german baron named dieskau was preparing a surprise for him he had reached crown point at the head of 3573 menregulars canadians and indiansand he at once moved forward with the greater portion of his command on cariolon or as it was afterwards called ticonderoga a promontory at the junction of lake george with lake champlain where he would bar the advance of the english whichever road they might take  the indians with the french caused great trouble to their commander doing nothing but feast and sleep but on september 4th a party of them came in bringing a scalp and an english prisoner caught near fort lyman  he was questioned under the threat of being given over to the indians to torture if he did not tell the truth but the brave fellow thinking he should lead the enemy into a trap told them that the english army had fallen back to albany leaving 500 men at fort lyman which he represented as being entirely indefensible  dieskau at once determined to attack that place and with 216 regulars of the battalions of languedoc and la reine 684 canadians and about 600 indians started in canoes and advanced up lake champlain till they came to the end of south bay each officer and man carried provisions for eight days in his knapsack  two days march brought them to within three miles of fort lyman and they encamped close to the road which led to lake george just after they had encamped a man rode by on horseback it was adams johnsons messenger he was shot by the indians and the letter found upon him soon afterwards ten or twelve waggons appeared in charge of ammunition drivers who had left the english camp without orders  some of the drivers were shot two taken prisoners and the rest ran away the two prisoners declared that contrary to the assertion of the prisoner at ticonderoga a large force lay encamped by the lake the indians held a council and presently informed dieskau that they would not attack the fort which they believed to be provided with cannon but would join in an attempt on the camp by the lake dieskau judged from the report of the prisoners that the colonists considerably outnumbered him although in fact there was no great difference in numerical strength the french column numbering 1500 and the colonial force 2200 besides 300 mohawk indians but dieskau emulous of repeating the defeat of braddock and believing the assertions of the canadians that the colonial militia was contemptible determined to attack and early in the morning the column moved along the road towards the lake  when within four miles of johnsons camp they entered a rugged valley on their right was a gorge hidden in bushes beyond which rose the rocky height of french mountain on their left rose gradually the slopes of west mountain the ground was thickly covered with thicket and forest the regulars marched along the road the canadians and indians pushed their way through the woods as best they could when within three miles of the lake their scout brought in a prisoner who told them that an english column was approaching the regulars were halted on the road the canadians and indians moved on ahead and hid themselves in ambush among the trees and bushes on either side of the road  the waggoners who had escaped the evening before had reached johnsons camp about midnight and reported that there was a war party on the road near fort lyman a council of war was held and under an entire misconception of the force of the enemy and the belief that they would speedily fall back from fort lyman it was determined to send out two detachments each 500 strong one towards fort lyman the other to catch the enemy in their retreat hendrick the chief of the mohawks expressed his strong disapproval of this plan and accordingly it was resolved that the thousand men should go as one body hendrick still disapproved of the plan but nevertheless resolved to accompany the column and mounting on a gun carriage he harangued his warriors with passionate eloquence and they at once prepared to accompany them he was too old and fat to go on foot and the general lent him a horse which he mounted and took his place at the head of the column  colonel williams was in command with lieutenant colonel whiting as second they had no idea of meeting the enemy near the camp and moved forward so carelessly that not a single scout was thrown out in front or flank the sharp eye of the old indian chief was the first to detect a sign of the enemy and almost at the same moment a gun was fired from the bushes it is said that the iroquois seeing the mohawks who were an allied tribe in the van wished to warn them of danger the warning came too late to save the column from disaster but it saved it from destruction from the thicket on the left a deadly fire blazed out and the head of the column was almost swept away hendricks horse was shot and the chief killed with a bayonet as he tried to gain his feet  colonel williams seeing rising ground on his right made for it calling his men to follow but as he climbed the slope the enemys fire flashed out from behind every tree and he fell dead the men in the rear pressed forward to support their comrades when the enemy in the bushes on the right flank also opened fire  then a panic began some fled at once for the camp and the whole column recoiled in confusion as from all sides the enemy burst out shouting and yelling colonel whiting however bravely rallied a portion of williams regiment and aided by some of the mohawks and by a detachment which johnson sent out to his aid covered the retreat fighting behind the trees like the indians and falling back in good order with their faces to the enemy  so stern and obstinate was their resistance that the french halted threequarters of a mile from the camp they had inflicted a heavy blow but had altogether failed in obtaining the complete success they looked for the obstinate defence of whiting and his men had surprised and dispirited them and dieskau when he collected his men found the indians sullen and unmanageable and the canadians unwilling to advance further for they were greatly depressed by the loss of a veteran officer saint pierre who commanded them and who had been killed in the fight at length however he persuaded all to move forward the regulars leading the way  james walsham had not accompanied the column and was sitting at breakfast with general johnson on the stump of a tree in front of his tent when on the still air a rattling sound broke out  musketry was the general exclamation  an instantaneous change came over the camp the sound of laughing and talking was hushed and every man stopped at his work louder and louder swelled the distant sound until the shots could no longer be distinguished apart the rattle had become a steady roll  it is a regular engagement the general exclaimed the enemy must be in force and must have attacked williams column  general johnson ordered one of his orderlies to mount and ride out at full speed and see what was going on a quarter of an hour passed no one returned to his work the men stood in groups talking in low voices and listening to the distant roar  it is clearer than it was the general exclaimed  several of the officers standing round agreed that the sound was approaching  to work lads the general said there is no time to be lost let all the axemen fell trees and lay them end to end to make a breastwork the rest of you range the waggons in a line behind and lay the boats up in the intervals carry the line from the swamp on the right there to the slope of the hill  in an instant the camp was a scene of animation and the forest resounded with the strokes of the axe and the shouts of the men as they dragged the waggons to their position  i was a fool johnson exclaimed not to fortify the camp before but who could have supposed that the french would have come down from crown point to attack us here  in a few minutes terrorstricken men whites and indians arrived at a run through the forest and reported that they had been attacked and surprised by a great force in the forest that hendrick and colonel williams were killed and numbers of the men shot down they reported that all was lost but the heavy roll of fire in the distance contradicted their words and showed that a portion of the column at least was fighting sternly and steadily though the sound indicated that they were falling back  two hundred men had already been despatched to their assistance and the only effect of the news was to redouble the efforts of the rest soon parties arrived carrying wounded but it was not until an hour and a half after the engagement began that the main body of the column were seen marching in good order back through the forest  by this time the hasty defences were wellnigh completed and all the men were employed in cutting down the thick brushwood outside so as to clear the ground as far as possible and so prevent the enemy from stealing up under shelter to the felled trees  three cannon were planted to sweep the road that descended through the pines another was dragged up to the ridge of the hill two hundred and fifty men were now placed on each flank of the camp the main body stood behind the waggons or lay flat behind the logs and boats the massachusetts men on the right the connecticut men on the left  now my lads johnson shouted in his cheery voice you have got to fight remember if they get inside not one of you will ever go back to your families to tell the tale while if you fight bravely you will beat them back sure enough  in a few minutes ranks of whitecoated soldiers could be seen moving down the roads with their bayonets showing between the boughs at the same time indian war whoops rose loud in the forest and then dark forms could be seen bounding down the slope through the trees towards the camp in a throng  there was a movement of uneasiness among the young rustics few of whom ever heard a shot fired in anger before that morning but the officers standing pistol in hand threatened to shoot any man who moved from his position  could dieskau have launched his whole force at once upon the camp at that moment he would probably have carried it but this he was powerless to do his regular troops were well in hand but the mob of canadians and indians were scattered through the forest shouting yelling and firing from behind trees  he thought however that if he led the regulars to the attack the others would come forward and he therefore gave the word for the advance the french soldiers advanced steadily until the trees grew thinner they were deployed into line and opened fire in regular volleys scarcely had they done so however when captain eyre who commanded the artillery opened upon them with grape from his three guns while from waggon and boat and fallen log the musketry fire flashed out hot and bitter and reeling under the shower of iron and lead the french line broke up the soldiers took shelter behind trees and thence returned the fire of the defenders  johnson received a flesh wound in the thigh and retired to his tent where he spent the rest of the day lyman took the command and to him the credit of the victory is entirely due  for four hours the combat raged the young soldiers had soon got over their first uneasiness and fought as steadily and coolly as veterans the musketry fire was unbroken from every tree bush and rock the rifles flashed out and the leaden hail flew in a storm over the camp and cut the leaves in a shower from the forest through this lyman moved to and fro among the men directing encouraging cheering them on escaping as by a miracle the balls which whistled round him save the indians on the english side not a man but was engaged the waggoners taking their guns and joining in the fight  the mohawks however held aloof saying that they had come to see their english brothers fight but animated no doubt with the idea that if they abstained from taking part in the fray and the day went against the english their friends the iroquois would not harm them  the french indians worked round on to high ground beyond the swamp on the left and their fire thence took the defenders in the flank captain eyre speedily turned his guns in that direction and a few welldirected shells soon drove the indians from their vantage ground dieskau directed his first attack against the left and centre but the connecticut men fought so stoutly that he next tried to force the right where the massachusetts regiments of titcomb ruggles and williams held the line for an hour he strove hard to break his way through the intrenchments but the massachusetts men stood firm although titcomb was killed and their loss was heavy  at length dieskau exposing himself within short range of the english lines was hit in the leg while his adjutant montreuil was dressing the wound the general was again hit in the knee and thigh he had himself placed behind a tree and ordered montreuil to lead the regulars in a last effort against the camp  but it was too late the blood of the colonists was now up and singly or in small bodies they were crossing their lines of barricade and working up among the trees towards their assailants the movement became general and lyman seeing the spirit of his men gave the word and the whole of the troops with a shout leaped up and dashed through the wood against the enemy falling upon them with their hatchets and the butts of their guns  the french and their allies instantly fled as the colonists passed the spot where dieskau was sitting on the ground one of them singularly enough himself a frenchman who had ten years before left canada fired at him and shot him through both legs others came up and stripped him of his clothes but on learning who he was they carried him to johnson who received him with the greatest kindness and had every attention paid to him    chapter 11 scouting   it was near five oclock before the final rout of the french took place but before that time several hundreds of the canadians and indians had left the scene of action and had returned to the scene of the fight in the wood to plunder and scalp the dead they were resting after their bloody work by a pool in the forest when a scouting party from fort lyman under captains mginnis and folsom came upon them and opened fire  the canadians and indians outnumbering their assailants greatly fought for some time but were finally defeated and fled mginnis was mortally wounded but continued to give orders till the fight was over the bodies of the slain were thrown into the pool which to this day bears the name the bloody pool  the various bands of french fugitives reunited in the forest and made their way back to their canoes in south bay and reached ticonderoga utterly exhausted and famished for they had thrown away their knapsacks in their flight and had nothing to eat from the morning of the fight until they rejoined their comrades  johnson had the greatest difficulty in protecting the wounded french general from the mohawks who although they had done no fighting in defence of the camp wanted to torture and burn dieskau in revenge for the death of hendrick and their warriors who had fallen in the ambush he however succeeded in doing so and sent him in a litter under a strong escort to albany dieskau was afterwards taken to england and remained for some years at bath after which he returned to paris he never however recovered from his numerous wounds and died a few years later  he always spoke in the highest terms of the kindness he had received from the colonial officers of the provincial soldiers he said that in the morning they fought like boys about noon like men and in the afternoon like devils  the english loss in killed wounded and missing was two hundred and sixtytwo for the most part killed in the ambush in the morning the french according to their own account lost two hundred and twentyeight but it probably exceeded four hundred the principal portion of whom were regulars for the indians and canadians kept themselves so well under cover that they and the provincials behind their logs were able to inflict but little loss on each other  had johnson followed up his success he might have reached south bay before the french in which case the whole of dieskaus column must have fallen into his hands nor did he press forward against ticonderoga which he might easily have captured for ten days nothing was done except to fortify the camp and when at the end of that time he thought of advancing against ticonderoga the french had already fortified the place so strongly that they were able to defy attack the colonists sent him large reinforcements but the season was getting late and after keeping the army stationary until the end of november the troops having suffered terribly from the cold and exposure became almost mutinous and were finally marched back to albany a small detachment being left to hold the fort by the lake this was now christened fort william henry  the victory was due principally to the gallantry and coolness of lyman but johnson in his report of the battle made no mention of that officers name and took all the credit to himself he was rewarded by being made a baronet and by being voted a pension by parliament of five thousand a year  james walsham having no duties during the fight at the camp had taken a musket and lain down behind the logs with the soldiers and had all the afternoon kept up a fire at the trees and bushes behind which the enemy were hiding after the battle he had volunteered to assist the overworked surgeons whose labours lasted through the night when he found that no forward movement was likely to take place he determined to leave the camp he therefore asked captain rogers who was the leader of a band of scouts and a man of extraordinary energy and enterprise to allow him to accompany him on a scouting expedition towards ticonderoga  i shall be glad to have you with me rogers replied but you know it is a service of danger it is not like work with regular troops where all march fight stand or fall together here each man fights for himself mind there is not a man among my band who would not risk his life for the rest but scattered through the woods as each man is each must perforce rely principally on himself the woods near ticonderoga will be full of lurking redskins and a man may be brained and scalped without his fellow a few yards away hearing a sound i only say this that you may feel that you must take your chances the men under me are every one old hunters and indian fighters and are a match for the redskin in every move of forest war they are true grit to the backbone but they are rough outspoken men and on a service when a foot carelessly placed on a dried twig or a word spoken above a whisper may bring a crowd of yelping redskins upon us and cost every man his scalp they would speak sharply to the king himself if he were on the scout with them and you must not take offence at any rough word that may be said  james laughed and said that he should not care how much he was blown up and that he should thankfully receive any lessons from such masters of forest craft  very well captain rogers said in that case it is settled i will let you have a pair of moccasins you cannot go walking about in the woods in those boots you had better get a rifle your sword you had best leave behind it will be of no use to you and will only be in your way  james had no difficulty in providing himself with a gun for numbers of weapons picked up in the woods after the rout of the enemy were stored in camp the rifles had however been all taken by the troops who had exchanged their own firelocks for them captain rogers went with him among the men and selected a wellfinished rifle of which one of them had possessed himself its owner readily agreed to accept five pounds for it taking in its stead one of the guns in the store before choosing it captain rogers placed a bit of paper against a tree and fired several shots at various distances at it  it is a beautiful rifle he said its only fault is that it is rather heavy but it shoots all the better for it it is evidently a french gun i should say by a firstrate maker built probably for some french officer who knew what he was about it is a good workmanlike piece and when you learn to hold it straight you can trust it to shoot  that evening james having made all his preparations said goodbye to the general and to his other friends and joined the scouts who were gathering by the shore of the lake ten canoes each of which would carry three men were lying by the shore  nat you and jonathan will take this young fellow with you he is a lad and it is his first scout you will find him of the right sort he was with braddock and after that affair hurried up here to see fighting on the lakes he cant have two better nurses than you are he is going to be an officer in the kings army and wants to learn as much as he can so that if he ever gets with his men into such a mess as braddock tumbled into he will know what to do with them  all right captain we will do our best for him its risky sort of business ours for a greenhorn but if he is anyways teachable we will soon make a man of him  the speaker was a wiry active man of some forty years old with a weatherbeaten face and a keen gray eye jonathan his comrade was a head taller with broad shoulders powerful limbs and a quiet but goodtempered face  thats so isnt it jonathan nat asked  jonathan nodded he was not a man of many words  have you ever been in a canoe before nat inquired  never james said but i am accustomed to boats of all sorts and can handle an oar fairly  oars aint no good here the scout said you will have to learn to paddle but first of all you have got to learn to sit still these here canoes are awkward things for a beginner now you hand in your traps and i will stow them away then you take your place in the middle of the boat heres a paddle for you and when you begin to feel yourself comfortable you can start to try with it easy and gentle to begin with but you must lay it in when we get near where we may expect that redskins may be in the woods for the splash of a paddle might cost us all our scalps  james took his seat in the middle of the boat jonathan was behind him nat handled the paddle in the bow there was but a brief delay in starting and the ten boats darted noiselessly out on to the lake for a time james did not attempt to use his paddle the canoe was of birch bark so thin that it seemed to him that an incautious movement would instantly knock a hole through her  once under weigh she was steadier than he had expected and james could feel her bound forward with each stroke of the paddles when he became accustomed to the motion of the boat he raised himself from a sitting position in the bottom and kneeling as the others were doing he began to dip his paddle quietly in the water in time with their stroke his familiarity with rowing rendered it easy for him to keep time and swing and ere long he found himself putting a considerable amount of force into each stroke nat looked back over his shoulder  well done young un thats first rate for a beginner and it makes a deal of difference on our arms the others are all paddling three and though jonathan and i have beaten three before now when our scalps depended on our doing so it makes all the difference in the work whether you have a sitter to take along or an extra paddle going  it was falling dusk when the boat started and was by this time quite dark scarce a word was heard in the ten canoes as keeping near the righthand shore of the lake they glided rapidly along in a close body so noiselessly were the paddles dipped into the water that the drip from them as they were lifted was the only sound heard  four hours steady paddling took them to the narrows about fiveandtwenty miles from their starting point here on the whispered order of nat james laid in his paddle for careful as he was he occasionally made a slight splash as he put it in the water the canoes now kept in single file almost under the trees on the right bank for the lake was here scarce a mile across and watchful eyes might be on the lookout on the shore to the left another ten miles was passed and then the canoes were steered in to the shore  the guns blankets and bundles were lifted out the canoes raised on the shoulders of the men and carried a couple of hundred yards among the trees then with scarcely a word spoken each man rolled himself in his blanket and lay down to sleep four being sent out as scouts in various directions soon after daybreak all were on foot again although it had been arranged that no move should be made till night set in no fires were lighted for they had brought with them a supply of biscuit and dry deers flesh sufficient for a week  how did you get on yesterday captain rogers asked as he came up to the spot where james had just risen to his feet  first rate captain nat answered for him i hardly believed that a young fellow could have handled a paddle so well at the first attempt he rowed all the way except just the narrows and though i dont say as he was noiseless he did wonderfully well and we came along with the rest as easy as may be  i thought i heard a little splash now and then the captain said smiling but it was very slight and could do no harm where the lake is two or three miles wide as it is here but you will have to lay in your paddle when we get near the other end for the sides narrow in there and the redskins would hear a fish jump half a mile away  during the day the men passed their time in sleep in mending their clothes or in talking quietly together the use of tea had not yet become general in america and the meals were washed down with water drawn from the lake where an overhanging bush shaded the shore from the sight of anyone on the opposite bank mixed with rum from the gourds which all the scouts carried  nat spent some time in pointing out to james the signs by which the hunters found their way through the forest by the moss and lichens growing more thickly on the side of the trunks of the trees opposed to the course of the prevailing winds or by a slight inclination of the upper boughs of the trees in the same direction  an old woodsman can tell he said on the darkest night on running his hand round the trunk of a tree by the feel of the bark which is north and south but it would be long before you can get to such niceties as that but if you keep your eyes open as you go along and look at the signs on the trunks which are just as plain when you once know them as the marks on a mans face you will be able to make your way through the woods in the daytime of course when the sun is shining you get its help for although it is not often a gleam comes down through the leaves sometimes you come upon a little patch and you are sure now and then to strike on a gap where a tree has fallen and that gives you a line again a great help to a young beginner is the sun for a young hand in the woods gets confused and doubts the signs of the trees but in course when he comes on a patch of sunlight he cant make a mistake nohow as to the direction  james indulged in a silent hope that if he were ever lost in the woods the sun would be shining for look as earnestly as he would he could not perceive the signs which appeared so plain and distinct to the scout occasionally indeed he fancied that there was some slight difference between one side of the trunk and the other but he was by no means sure that even in these cases he should have noticed it unless it had been pointed out to him while in the greater part of the trees he could discern no difference whatever  its just habit my lad nat said encouragingly to him theres just as much difference between one side of the tree and the other as there is between two mens faces it comes of practice now just look at the roots of this tree dont you see on one side they run pretty nigh straight out from the trunk while from the other they go down deep into the ground that speaks for itself the tree has thrown out its roots to claw into the ground and get a hold on the side from which the wind comes while on the other side having no such occasion it has dipped its root down to look for moisture and food  yes i do see that james said that is easy enough to make out but the next tree and the next and as far as i see all the others dont seem to have any difference in their roots one side or the other  that is so the scout replied you see those are younger trees than this and it is like enough they did not grow under the same circumstances when a few trees fall or a small clearing is made by a gale the young trees that grow up are well sheltered from the wind by the forest and dont want to throw out roots to hold them up but when a great clearing has been made by a fire or other causes the trees as they grow up together have no shelter and must stretch out their roots to steady them  sometimes you will find all the trees for a long distance with their roots like this sometimes only one tree among a number perhaps when they started that tree had more room or a deeper soil and grew faster than the rest and got his head above them so he felt the wind more and had to throw out his roots to steady himself while the others all growing the same height did not need to do so  thank you james said i understand now and will bear it in mind it is very interesting and i should like above all things to be able to read the signs of the woods as you do  it will come lad its a sort of second nature these things are gifts the redskin thinks it just as wonderful that the white man should be able to take up a piece of paper covered with black marks and to read off sense out of them as you do that he should be able to read every mark and sign of the wood he can see as plain as if the man was still standing on it the mark of a footprint and can tell you if it was made by a warrior or a squaw and how long they have passed by and whether they were walking fast or slow while the ordinary white man might go down on his hands and knees and stare at the ground and wouldnt be able to see the slightest sign or mark for a white man my eyes are good but they are not a patch on a redskins i have lived among the woods since i was a boy but even now a redskin lad can pick up a trail and follow it when look as i will i cant see as a blade of grass has been bruised no these things is partly natur and partly practice practice will do a lot for a white man but it wont take him up to redskin natur  not until night had fallen did the party again launch their canoes on the lake then they paddled for several hours until as james imagined they had traversed a greater distance by some miles than that which they had made on the previous evening he knew from what he had learned during the day that they were to land some six miles below the point where lake george joins lake champlain and where on the opposite side on a promontory stretching into the lake the french were constructing their new fort  the canoes were to be carried some seven or eight miles through the wood across the neck of land between the two lakes and were then to be launched again on lake champlain so that by following the east shore of that lake they would pass ticonderoga at a safe distance the halt was made as noiselessly as before and having hauled up the canoes the men slept till daybreak and then lifting the light craft on their shoulders started for their journey through the woods it was toilsome work for the ground was rough and broken often thickly covered with underwood ridges had to be crossed and deep ravines passed and although the canoes were not heavy the greatest care had to be exercised for a graze against a projecting bough or the edge of a rock would suffice to tear a hole in the thin bark  it was not until late in the afternoon that they arrived on the shores of lake champlain a fire was lighted now the greatest care being taken to select perfectly dry sticks for the iroquois were likely to be scattered far and wide among the woods the risk however was far less than when in sight of the french side of lake george after darkness fell the canoes were again placed in the water and striking across the lake they followed the righthand shore after paddling for about an hour and a half the work suddenly ceased  the lake seemed to widen on their left for they had just passed the tongue of land between the two lakes and on the opposite shore a number of fires were seen burning brightly on the hillside it was ticonderoga they were now abreast of the advanced post of the french they lingered for some time before the paddles were again dipped in water counting the fires and making a careful note of the position they paddled on again until some twelve miles beyond the fort and then crossed the lake and landed on the french shore  but the canoes did not all approach the shore together as they had done on the previous nights they halted half a mile out and captain rogers went forward with his own and another canoe and landed and it was not for half an hour that the signal was given by an imitation of the croaking of a frog that a careful search had ascertained the forest to be untenanted and the landing safe  no sooner was the signal given than the canoes were set in motion and were soon safely hauled up on shore five men went out as usual as scouts and the rest fatigued by their paddle and the hard days work were soon asleep  in the morning they were about to start and rogers ordered the canoes to be hauled up and hidden among the bushes where having done their work they would for the present be abandoned to be recovered and made useful on some future occasion  the men charged with the work gave a sudden exclamation when they reached the canoes  what is that rogers said angrily do you want to bring all the redskins in the forest upon us  the canoes are all damaged one of the scouts said coming up to him  there was a general movement to the canoes which were lying on the bank a few yards distance from the waters edge every one of them had been rendered useless the thin birch bark had been gashed and slit pieces had been cut out and not one of them had escaped injury or was fit to take the water beyond a few low words and exclamations of dismay not a word was spoken as the band gathered round the canoes  who were on the watch on this side rogers asked  nat and jonathan took the first half of the night one of the scouts said williams and myself relieved them  as all four were men of the greatest skill and experience rogers felt sure that no neglect or carelessness on their part could have led to the disaster  did any of you see any passing boats or hear any sound on the lake  the four men who had been on guard replied in the negative  i will swear no one landed near the canoes nat said there was a glimmer on the water all night a canoe could not have possibly come near the bank anywheres here without our seeing it  then he must have come from the land side rogers said some skulking indian must have seen us out on the lake and have hidden up when we landed he may have been in a tree overhead all the time and directly the canoes were hauled up he may have damaged them and made off  there is no time to be lost lads it is five hours since we landed if he started at once the redskins may be all round us now it is no question now of our scouting round the french fort it is one of saving our scalps  how could it have been done james walsham asked nat in a low tone we were all sleeping within a few yards of the canoes and some of the men were close to them i should have thought we must have heard it  heard it the hunter said contemptuously why a redskin would make no more noise in cutting them holes and gashes than you would in cutting a hunk of deers flesh for your dinner he would lie on the ground and wriggle from one to another like an eel but i reckon he didnt begin till the camp was still the canoes wasnt hauled up till we had sarched the woods as we thought and then we was moving about close by them till we lay down  i was standing theer on the waters edge not six feet away from that canoe i never moved for two hours and quiet as a redskin may be he must have taken time to do that damage so as i never heard a sound as loud as the falling of a leaf no i reckon as he was at the very least two hours over that job he may have been gone four hours or a bit over but not more but that dont give us much of a start it would take him an hour and a half to get to the fort then he would have to report to the french chap in command and then there might be some talk before he set out with the redskins leaving the french to follow  its no use thinking of mending the canoes i suppose james asked  the hunter shook his head  it would take two or three hours to get fresh bark and mend those holes he said and we havent got as many minutes to spare there now we are off  while they had been speaking rogers had been holding a consultation with two or three of his most experienced followers and they had arrived at pretty nearly the same conclusion as that of rogers namely that the indian had probably taken two or three hours in damaging the canoes and getting fairly away into the forest but that even if he had done so the iroquois would be up in the course of half an hour  let each man pack his share of meat on his back rogers said dont leave a scrap behind quick lads theres not a minute to be lost its a case of legs now theres no hiding the trail of thirty men from redskin eyes  in a couple of minutes all were ready for the start and rogers at once led the way at a long slinging trot straight back from the lake first saying  pick your way lads and dont tread on a fallen stick there is just one chance of saving our scalps and only one and that depends upon silence  as james ran along at the heels of nat he was struck with the strangeness of the scene and the noiselessness with which the band of moccasinfooted men flitted among the trees not a word was spoken all had implicit confidence in their leader the most experienced bush fighter on the frontier and knew that if anyone could lead them safe from the perils that surrounded them it was rogers  james wondered what his plan could be it seemed certain to him that the indians must sooner or later overtake them they would be aware of the strength of the band and confiding in their superior numbers would be able to push forward in pursuit without pausing for many precautions once overtaken the band must stand at bay and even could they hold the indians in check the sound of the firing would soon bring the french soldiers to the spot  they had been gone some twenty minutes only when a distant war whoop rose in the forest behind them  they have come down on the camp nat said glancing round over his shoulder and find we have left it i expect they hung about a little before they ventured in knowing as we should be expecting them when we found the canoes was useless that war whoop tells em all as we have gone they will gather there and then be after us like a pack of hounds  ah that is what i thought the captain was up to  rogers had turned sharp to the left the direction in which ticonderoga stood he slacked down his speed somewhat for the perspiration was streaming down the faces even of his trained and hardy followers from time to time he looked round to see that all were keeping well together although in such an emergency as this none thought of questioning the judgment of their leader many of them were wondering at the unusual speed at which he was leading them along they had some two miles start of their pursuers and had evening been at hand they would have understood the importance of keeping ahead until darkness came on to cover their trail but with the whole day before them they felt that they must be overtaken sooner or later and they could not see the object of exhausting their strength before the struggle began  as they ran on at a somewhat slower pace now an idea as to their leaders intention dawned upon most of the scouts who saw by the direction they were taking that they would again strike the lake shore near the french fort nat who light and wiry was running easily while many of his comrades were panting with their exertions was now by the side of james walsham  give me your rifle lad for a bit you are new to this work and the weight of the gun takes it out of you we have got another nine or ten miles before us yet  i can hold on for a bit james replied i am getting my wind better now but why only ten miles we must be seventy away from the fort  we should never get there nat said a few of us might do it but the redskins would be on us in an hour or two i thought when we started as the captain would have told us to scatter so as to give each of us some chance of getting off but i see his plan now and its the only one as there is which gives us a real chance he is making straight for the french fort he reckons no doubt as the best part of the french troops will have marched out after the redskins  but there would surely be enough left james said to hold the fort against us and even if we could take it we could not hold it an hour when they all came up  he aint thinking of the fort boy hes thinking of the boats we know as they have lots of em there and if we can get there a few minutes before the redskins overtake us we may get off safe its a chance but i think its a good one  others had caught their leaders idea and repeated it to their comrades and the animating effect soon showed itself in the increased speed with which the party hurried through the forest before almost every man had thought their case hopeless had deemed that they had only to continue their flight until overtaken by the redskins and that they must sooner or later succumb to the rifles of the iroquois and their french allies but the prospect that after an hours run a means of escape might be found animated each man to renewed efforts  after running for some distance longer rogers suddenly halted and held up his hand and the band simultaneously came to a halt at first nothing could be heard save their own quick breathing then a confused noise was heard to their left front a deep trampling and the sound of voices and an occasional clash of arms  it is the french column coming out nat whispered as rogers swerving somewhat to the right and making a sign that all should run as silently as possible continued his course    chapter 12 a commission   presently the noise made by the column of french troops was heard abreast of the fugitives then it died away behind them and they again directed their course to the left ten minutes later they heard a loud succession of indian whoops and knew that the redskins pursuing them had also heard the french column on its march and would be warning them of the course which the band were taking the scouts were now but four miles from ticonderoga and each man knew that it was a mere question of speed  throw away your meat rogers ordered you will not want it now and every pound tells  the men had already got rid of their blankets and were now burdened only with their rifles and ammunition the ground was rough and broken for they were nearing the steep promontory on which the french fort had been erected they were still a mile ahead of their pursuers and although the latter had gained that distance upon them since the first start the scouts knew that now they were exerting themselves to the utmost the redskins could be gaining but little upon them for the trained white man is in point of speed and endurance fairly a match for the average indian  they had now descended to within a short distance of the edge of the lake in order to avoid the valleys and ravines running down from the hills the war whoops rose frequently in the forest behind them the indians yelling to give those at the fort notice that the chase was approaching  if there war any redskins left at the fort nat said to james they would guess what our game was but i expect every redskin started out on the hunt and the french soldiers when they hear the yelling wont know what to make of it and if they do anything they will shut themselves up in their fort  great as were the exertions which the scouts were making they could tell by the sound of the war whoops that some at least of the indians were gaining upon them accustomed as every man of the party was to the fatigues of the forest the strain was telling upon them all now for twelve miles they had run almost at the top of their speed and the short panting breath the set faces and the reeling steps showed that they were nearly at the end of their powers still they held on with scarcely any diminishing of speed each man knew that if he fell he must die for his comrades could do nothing for him and no pause was possible until the boats were gained  they were passing now under the french works for they could hear shouting on the high ground to the right and knew that the troops left in the fort had taken the alarm but they were still invisible for it was only at the point of the promontory that the clearing had been carried down to the waters edge a low cry of relief burst from the men as they saw the forest open before them and a minute later they were running along in the open near the shore of the lake at the extremity of the promontory where hauled up upon the shore lay a number of canoes and flatbottomed boats used for the conveyance of troops a number of boatmen were standing near evidently alarmed by the war cries in the woods when they saw the party approaching they at once made for the fort a quarter of a mile away on the high ground and almost at the same moment a dropping fire of musketry opened from the entrenchments  smash the canoes rogers said setting the example by administering a vigorous kick to one of them  the others followed his example and in a few seconds every one of the frail barks was stove in  two of the boats will hold us well rogers said quick into the water with them and out with the oars ten row in each boat let the other five handle their rifles and keep back the indians as they come up never mind the soldiers  for the whitecoated troops perceiving the scouts intention were now pouring out from the intrenchments  a couple of minutes sufficed for the men to launch the boats and take their seats and the oars dipped in the water just as three or four indians dashed out from the edge of the forest  we have won the race by three minutes rogers said exultantly stretch to your oars lads and get out of range as soon as you can  the indians began to fire as soon as they perceived the boats they were scarcely two hundred yards away but they like the white men were panting with fatigue and their bullets flew harmlessly by  dont answer yet rogers ordered as some of the scouts were preparing to fire wait till your hands get steady and then fire at the french there wont be many of the redskins up yet  the boats were not two hundred yards from shore when the french soldiers reached the edge of the water and opened fire but at this distance their weapons were of little avail and though the bullets splashed thickly around the boats no one was injured while several of the french were seen to drop from the fire of the scouts another hundred yards and the boats were beyond any danger save from a chance shot the indians still continued firing and several of their shots struck the boats one of the rowers being hit on the shoulder  lay in your rifles and man the other two oars in each boat rogers said the french are launching some of their bateaux but we have got a fair start and they wont overtake us before we reach the opposite point they are fresher than we are but soldiers are no good rowing besides they are sure to crowd the boats so that they wont have a chance  five or six boats each crowded with men started in pursuit but they were fully half a mile behind when the two english boats reached the shore  now it is our turn rogers said as the men leaping ashore took their places behind trees as soon as the french boats came within range a steady fire was opened upon them confusion was at once apparent among them oars were seen to drop and as the fire continued the rowing ceased another minute and the boats were turned and were soon rowing out again into the lake  theres the end of that rogers said and a close shave it has been  well youngster what do you think of your first scout in the woods  it has been sharper than i bargained for james said laughing and was pretty near being the last as well as the first if it hadnt been for your taking us to the boats i dont think many of us would have got back to fort henry to tell the tale  there is generally some way out of a mess rogers said if one does but think of it if i had not thought of the french boats we should have scattered and a few of us would have been overtaken no doubt but even an indian cannot follow a single trail as fast as a man can run and i reckon most of us would have carried our scalps back to camp still with the woods full of iroquois they must have had some of us and i hate losing a man if it can be helped we are well out of it  now lads we had better be tramping there are a lot more bateaux coming out and i expect by the rowing they are manned by indians the redskin is a firstrate hand with the paddle but is no good with an oar  the man who had been hit in the shoulder had already had his wound bandaged there was a minutes consultation as to whether they should continue their journey in the boats some of the men pointing out that they had proved themselves faster than their pursuers  that may be rogers says but the indians will land and follow along the shore and will soon get ahead of us for they can travel quicker than we can row and for aught we know there may be a whole fleet of canoes higher up lake george which would cut us off no lads the safest way is to keep on through the woods  the decision was received without question and the party at once started at a swinging trot which was kept up with occasional intervals of walking throughout the day at nightfall their course was changed and after journeying another two or three miles a halt was called for rogers was sure that the indians would abandon pursuit when night came on without their having overtaken the fugitives  before daybreak the march was continued and in the afternoon the party arrived at fort william henry  james now determined to leave the force and return at once to new york where his letters were to be addressed to him he took with him a letter from general johnson speaking in the warmest tones of his conduct  on arriving at new york he found at the post office there a great pile of letters awaiting him they had been written after the receipt of his letter at the end of july telling those at home of his share in braddocks disaster  i little thought my boy his mother wrote when we received your letter saying that you had got your discharge from the ship and were going with an expedition against the french that you were going to run into such terrible danger fortunately the same vessel which brought the news of general braddocks defeat also brought your letter and we learned the news only a few hours before your letter reached us it was as you may imagine a time of terrible anxiety to us and the squire and aggie were almost as anxious as i was mr wilks did his best to cheer us all but i could see that he too felt it very greatly however when your letter came we were all made happy again though of course we cannot be but anxious as you say you are just going to join another expedition still we must hope that that will do better as it wont be managed by regular soldiers mr wilks was quite angry at what you said about the folly of making men stand in a line to be shot at he thinks so much of drill and discipline the squire and he have been arguing quite fiercely about it but the squire gets the best of the argument for the dreadful way in which the soldiers were slaughtered shows that though that sort of fighting may be good in other places it is not suited for fighting these wicked indians in the woods  the squire has himself been up to london about your commission and has arranged it all he has as he will tell you in his letter got you a commission in the regiment commanded by colonel otway which is to go out next spring he was introduced to the commander in chief by his friend and told him that you had been acting as colonel washingtons aidedecamp with general braddock and that you have now gone to join general johnsons army so the duke said that though you would be gazetted at once and would belong to the regiment you might as well stay out there and see service until it arrived and that it would be a great advantage to the regiment to have an officer with experience in indian fighting with it i cried when he brought me back the news for i had hoped to have you back again with us for a bit before you went soldiering for good however the squire seems to think it is a capital thing for you mr wilks thinks so too so i suppose i must put up with it but aggie agrees with me and says it is too bad that she should never have seen you once from the time when she saw you in that storm  she is a dear little girl and is growing fast i think she must have grown quite an inch in the five months you have been away she sends her love to you and says you must take care of yourself for her sake  the squire in his letter repeated the news mrs walsham had given  you are now an ensign he said and if you go into any more fights before your regiment arrives you must mr wilks said get a proper uniform made for you and fight as a kings officer i send you a copy of the gazette where you will see your name  mr wilkss letter was a long one  i felt horribly guilty dear jim he said when the news came of braddocks dreadful defeat i could hardly look your dear mother in the face and though the kind lady would not i know say a word to hurt my feelings for the world yet i could see that she regarded me as a monster for it was on my advice that instead of coming home when you got your discharge you remained out there and took part in this unfortunate expedition i could see aggie felt the same and though i did my best to keep up their spirits i had a terrible time of it until your letter arrived saying you were safe if it had not come i do believe that i should have gone quietly off to exeter hunted up my box again and hired a boy to push it for me for i am not so strong as i was but i would rather have tramped about for the rest of my life than remain there under your mothers reproachful eye however thank god you came through it all right and after such a lesson i should hope that we shall never have repetition of such a disaster as that as an old soldier i cannot agree with what you say about the uselessness of drill even for fighting in a forest it must accustom men to listen to the voice of their officers and to obey orders promptly and quickly and i cannot but think that if the troops had gone forward at a brisk double they would have driven the indians before them as to the whooping and yells you talk so much about i should think nothing of them they are no more to be regarded than the shrieks of women or the braying of donkeys  james smiled as he read this and thought that if the old soldier had heard that chaos of bloodcurdling cries break out in the still depth of the forest he would not write of them with such equanimity  you will have heard from the squire that you are gazetted to otways regiment which with others is to cross the atlantic in a few weeks when it is generally supposed war will be formally declared your experience will be of great use to you and ought to get you a good staff appointment i expect that in the course of a year there will be fighting on a large scale on your side of the water and the english ought to get the best of it for france seems at present to be thinking a great deal more of her affairs in europe than of her colonies in america so much the better for if we can take canada we shall strike a heavy blow to her trade and some day north america is going to be an important place in the world  the letters had been lying there several weeks and james knew that otways regiment had with the others arrived a few days before and had already marched for albany thinking himself entitled to a little rest after his labours he remained for another week in new york while his uniform was being made and then took a passage in a trading boat up to albany  scarcely had he landed when a young officer in the same uniform met him he looked surprised hesitated and then stopped  i see you belong to our regiment he said have you just arrived from england what ship did you come in  i have been out here some time james replied my name is walsham i believe i was gazetted to your regiment some months ago but i only heard the news on my arrival at new york last week  oh you are walsham the young officer said my name is edwards i am glad to meet you we have been wondering when you would join us and envying your luck in seeing so much of the fighting out here our regiment is encamped about half a mile from here if you will let me i will go back with you and introduce you to our fellows  james thanked him and the two walked along talking together james learned that there were already five ensigns junior to himself his new acquaintance being one of them as the regiment had been somewhat short of officers and the vacancies had been filled up shortly before it sailed  of course we must call on the colonel first mr edwards said he is a capital fellow and very much liked in the regiment  colonel otway received james with great cordiality  we are very glad to get you with us mr walsham he said and we consider it a credit to the regiment to have a young officer who has been three times mentioned in despatches you will too be a great service to us and will be able to give us a good many hints as to this indian method of fighting which braddocks men found so terrible  it is not formidable sir when you are accustomed to it but unfortunately general braddock forced his men to fight in regular fashion that is to stand up and be shot at and that mode of fighting in the woods is fatal a hundred redskins would be more than a match in the forest for ten times their number of white troops who persisted in fighting in such a ridiculous way but fighting in their own way white men are a match for the redskins indeed the frontiersmen can thrash the indians even if they are two or three to one against them  you have been in this last affair on the lake have you not mr walsham i heard you were with johnson  yes sir i was and at the beginning it was very nearly a repetition of braddocks disaster but after being surprised and at first beaten the column that went out made such a stout fight of it that it gave us time to put the camp in a state of defence had the indians made a rush i think they would have carried it but as they contented themselves with keeping up a distant fire the provincials who were all young troops quite unaccustomed to fighting and wholly without drill or discipline gradually got steady and at length sallied out and beat them decisively  i will not detain you now the colonel said but i hope ere long you will give us a full and detailed account of the fighting you have been in with your idea of the best way of training regular troops for the sort of work we have before us mr edwards will take you over to the mess and introduce you to your brother officers  james was well received by the officers of his regiment and soon found himself perfectly at home with them he had to devote some hours every day to acquiring the mysteries of drill it was to him somewhat funny to see the pains expended in assuring that each movement should be performed with mechanical accuracy but he understood that although useless for such warfare as that which they had before them great accuracy in details was necessary for ensuring uniformity of movement among large masses of men in an open country  otherwise the time passed very pleasantly james soon became a favourite in the regiment and the young officers were never tired of questioning him concerning the redskins and their manner of fighting there were plenty of amusements the snow was deep on the ground now and the officers skated practised with snowshoes and drove in sleighs occasionally they got up a dance and the people of albany and the settlers round vied with each other in their hospitality to the officers  one day in february an orderly brought a message to james walsham that the colonel wished to speak to him  walsham he said i may tell you privately that the regiment is likely to form part of the expedition which is being fitted out in england against louisbourg in cape breton the key of canada a considerable number of the troops from the province will accompany it  but that will leave the frontier here altogether open to the enemy james said in surprise  that is my own opinion walsham louisbourg is altogether outside the range of the present struggle and it seems to me that the british force should be employed at striking at a vital point however that is not to the purpose it is the earl of loudons plan however it is manifest as you say that the frontier will be left terribly open and therefore two companies of each of the regiments going will be left naturally as you are the only officer in the regiment who has had any experience in this forest warfare you would be one of those left here but as an ensign you would not have much influence and i think that it would be at once more useful to the service and more pleasant for yourself if i can obtain for you something like a roving commission what do you think of that  i should greatly prefer that sir james said gratefully  the general is a little vexed i know the colonel went on at the numerous successes and daring feats gained by rogers and the other leaders of the companies of scouts while the regulars have not had an opportunity to fire a shot and i think that he would at once accept the proposal were i to make it to him that a company to be called the royal scouts should be formed of volunteers taken from the various regiments and that you should have the command  thank you sir james said and i should like it above all things but i fear that we should have no chance whatever of rivalling the work of rogers and the other partisan leaders these men are all trained to the work of the woods accustomed to fight indians equally at home in a canoe or in the forest i have had as you are good enough to say some experience in the work but i am a mere child by their side and were i to lead fifty english soldiers in the forest i fear that none of us would ever return  yes but i should not propose that you should engage in enterprises of that sort walsham my idea is that although you would have an independent command with very considerable freedom of action you would act in connection with the regular troops the scouts are often far away when wanted leaving the posts open to surprise they are so impatient of any discipline that they are adverse to going near the forts except to obtain fresh supplies you on the contrary would act as the eyes of any post which you might think threatened by the enemy at present for instance fort william henry is the most exposed to attack  you would take your command there and would report yourself to major eyre who is in command as for service there your letter of appointment would state that you are authorized to act independently but that while it would be your duty to obey the orders of the commanding officer you will be authorized to offer such suggestions to him as your experience in indian warfare would lead you to make you would train your men as scouts it would be their special duty to guard the fort against surprise and of course in case of attack to take part in its defence in the event of the provincial scouts making any concerted movement against a french post you would be authorized to join them you would then have the benefit of their skill and experience and in case of success the army would get a share of the credit what do you think of my plan  i should like it above all things james replied that would be precisely the duty which i should select had i the choice  i thought so the colonel said i have formed a very high opinion of your judgment and discretion from the talks which we have had together and i have spoken strongly in your favour to the general who had promised me that in the event of the army moving forward you should have an appointment on the quartermaster generals staff as an intelligence officer  since i heard that the main portion of the army is to sail to louisbourg i have been thinking this plan over and it certainly seems to me that a corps such as that that i have suggested would be of great service i should think that its strength should be fifty men you will of course have another officer with you is there anyone you would like to choose as i may as well take the whole scheme cut and dried to the general  i should like mr edwards sir he is junior to me in the regiment and is very active and zealous in the service and i should greatly like to be allowed to enlist temporarily two of the scouts i have served with in the force with power for them to take their discharge when they wished they would be of immense utility to me in instructing the men in their new duties and would add greatly to our efficiency  so be it the colonel said i will draw out the scheme on paper and lay it before the general today  in the afternoon james was again sent for  the earl has approved of my scheme you will have temporary rank as captain given you in order to place your corps on an equal footing with the provincial corps of scouts mr edwards will also have temporary rank as lieutenant the men of the six companies of the three regiments will be paraded tomorrow and asked for volunteers for the special service if there are more than fifty offer you can select your own men  accordingly the next morning the troops to be left behind were paraded and an order was read out saying that a corps of scouts for special service was to be raised and that volunteers were requested upwards of a hundred men stepped forward and being formed in line james selected from them fifty who appeared to him the most hardy active and intelligent looking he himself had that morning been put in orders as captain of the new corps and had assumed the insignia of his temporary rank the colonel had placed at his disposal two intelligent young noncommissioned officers  the next morning he marched with his command for fort william henry no sooner had he left the open country and entered the woods than he began to instruct the men in their new duties the whole of them were thrown out as skirmishers and taught to advance in indian fashion each man sheltering himself behind a tree scanning the woods carefully ahead and then fixing his eyes on another tree ahead to advance to it at a sharp run and shelter there  all this was new to the soldiers hitherto drilled only in solid formation or in skirmishing in the open and when at the end of ten miles skirmishing through the wood they were halted and ordered to bivouac for the night james felt that his men were beginning to have some idea of forest fighting the men themselves were greatly pleased with their days work it was a welcome change after the long monotony of life in a standing camp and the days work had given them a high opinion of the fitness of their young officer for command  but the work and instruction was not over for the day hitherto none of the men had had any experience in camping in the open james now showed them how to make comfortable shelters against the cold with two forked sticks and one laid across them and with a few boughs and a blanket laid over them with dead leaves heaped round the bottom and ends and how best to arrange their fires and cook their food  during the following days the same work was repeated and when after a weeks marching the force issued from the forest into the clearing around fort william henry james felt confident that his men would be able to hold their own in a brush with the indians major eyre to whom james reported himself and showed his appointment defining his authority and duties expressed much satisfaction at the arrival of the reinforcement  there are rumours brought here by the scouts he said that a strong force will ere long come down from crown point to ticonderoga and that we shall be attacked now that the lake is frozen regular troops could march without difficulty and my force here is very inadequate considering the strength with which the french will attack none of my officers or men have any experience of the indian methods of attack and your experience will be very valuable it is a pity that they do not give me one of these companies of scouts permanently sometimes one or other of them is here but often i am without any of the provincials and although i have every confidence in my officers and men one cannot but feel that it is a great disadvantage to be exposed to the attack of an enemy of whose tactics one is altogether ignorant  you will of course encamp your men inside the fort i see you have brought no baggage with you but i have some spare tents here which are at your service  thank you sir james replied i shall be glad to put the men under cover while they are here but i intend to practise them as much as possible in scouting and camping in the woods and although i shall always be in the neighbourhood of the fort i do not propose always to return here at night are any of captain rogerss corps at present at the fort  some of them came in last night major eyre replied  i have authority james said to enlist two of them in my corps  major eyre smiled  i do not think you will find any of them ready to submit to military discipline or to put on a red coat  they are all accustomed to obey orders promptly enough when at work james said though there is no attempt at discipline when off duty you see them at their worst here there is of course nothing like military order in the woods but obedience is just as prompt as among our troops as to the uniform i agree with you but on that head i should not be particular i can hardly fancy any of the scouts buttoned tightly up with stiff collars but as after all although they are to be enlisted they will be attached to the corps rather than be regular members of it i do not think i need insist upon the uniform  after leaving the major james saw to the pitching of the tents and the comforts of his men and when he had done so strolled off towards a group of scouts who were watching his proceedings and among whom he recognized the two men for whom he was looking  he received a cordial greeting from all who had taken part in his previous adventures with captain rogerss band  and so you are in command of this party nat said i asked one of the men just now and he said you were the captain you are young to be a captain but at any rate its a good thing to have a kings officer here who knows something about the woods the rest aint no more idea of them than nothing  i want to chat to you nat and also to jonathan if you will come across with me to my tent  im agreeable nat said and the two scouts walked across to the tent with james  lieutenant edwards who shared the tent with him was inside arranging a few things which major eyre had sent down for their use  edwards these are the two scouts nat and jonathan of whom you have often heard me speak now let us sit down and have a chat  there is some firstrate rum in that bottle nat there are two tin pannikins and there is water in that keg  now nat he went on when the party were seated on blankets laid on the ground this corps of mine has been raised specially to act as scouts round this or any other fort which may be threatened or to act as the advanced guard of a column of troops  but what do they know of scouting nat said contemptuously they dont know no more than children  they dont know much but they are active fellows and ready to learn i think you will find that already they have a pretty fair idea of fighting in indian fashion in the woods and as i have authority to draw extra supplies of ball cartridge i hope in a few weeks to make fair shots of them you have taught me something of forest ways and i shall teach them all i know but we want better teachers and i want to propose to you and jonathan to join the corps  what and put on a red coat and choke ourselves up with a stiff collar nat laughed nice figures we should look no no captain that would never do  no i dont propose that you should wear uniform nat i have got a special authority to enlist you and jonathan with the understanding that you can take your discharge whenever you like there will be no drilling in line or anything of that sort it will be just scouting work the same as with captain rogers except that we shall not make long expeditions as he does but keep in the neighbourhood of the fort i should want you to act both as scouts and instructors to teach the men as you have taught me something of woodcraft how to find their way in a forest and how to fight the indians in their own way and to be up to indian devices you will be guides on the line of march will warn me of danger and suggest the best plan of meeting it you will in fact be scouts attached to the corps only nominally you will be members of it i know your ways and should not exact any observance of discipline more than that which you have with rogers and should treat you in the light of noncommissioned officers  well and what do you say jonathan nat said turning to his tall companion you and i have both taken a fancy to the captain here and though he has picked up a lot for a young un and will in time make a firstrate hand in the woods i guess he wont make much hand of it yet if he hadnt got someone as knows the woods by his side we have had a spell of hard work of it with rogers lately and i dont mind if i have a change for a bit with the redcoats  i will go of course jonathan said briefly  very well then thats settled captain nat said rogers will be in tonight and i will tell him we are going to transfer ourselves over to you  he wont mind i hope james said  he wont mind nat replied we aint very particular about times of service in our corps we just comes and goes pretty well as the fancy takes us they would never get us to join if they wanted to get us to bind down hard and fast sometimes they start on an expedition fifty strong next time perhaps not more than thirty turns up  is there anything to do to join the corps  not much nat i give you each a shilling and attest you that is to say swear you in to serve the king and in your case give you a paper saying that you are authorized to take your discharge whensoever it pleases you  very well captain then on those terms we join always understood as we dont have to put on red coats  the two men were sworn in and then nat standing up said  and now captain discipline is discipline whats your orders  james went to the door of the tent and called the sergeant  sergeant these two men are enlisted as scouts in the corps they will draw rations and be a regular part of the company like the rest but they will not wear uniform acting only as scouts they will have the rank and position of corporals and will specially instruct the men in woodcraft and in the ways of the indians they will of course occupy the tent with the noncommissioned officers and will mess with them being engaged as scouts only they will in other respects be free from anything like strictness i trust that you will do what you can to make them comfortable  the sergeant saluted and led the two scouts over to the tent occupied by himself and the other noncommissioned officers and the roars of laughter that issued from it in the course of the evening at the anecdotes of the scouts showed that the newcomers were likely to be highly popular characters in their mess    chapter 13 an abortive attack   three weeks passed james kept his men steadily at work and even the scouts allowed that they made great progress sometimes they went out in two parties with an officer and a scout to each and their pouches filled with blank cartridge each would do its best to surprise the other and when they met a mimic fight would take place the men sheltering behind trees and firing only when they obtained a glimpse of an adversary  i did not think that these pipeclayed soldiers could have been so spry nat said to james they have picked up wonderfully and i wouldnt mind going into an indian fight with them they are improving with their muskets their shooting yesterday wasnt bad by no means in three months time they will be as good a lot to handle as any of the companies of scouts  besides the daily exercises the company did scouting work at night ten men being out by turns in the woods bordering the lake at one oclock in the morning on the 19th of march nat came into the officers tent  captain he said get up theres something afoot  what is it nat james asked as he threw off his rugs  its the french at least i dont see who else it can be it was my turn tonight to go round and look after our sentries when i came to jim bryan who was stationed just at the edge of the lake i said to him anything new jim and he says yes seems to me as i can hear a hammering in the woods i listens and sure enough axes were going it may be some three miles down the night is still and the ice brought the sound  thats one for you jim says i thems axes sure enough i stands and looks and then a long way down the lake on the left i sees a faint glare they had had the sense to light the fires where we couldnt see them but there were the lights sure enough its the french captain the redskins would never have made fires like that and if it had been a party of our scouts they would have come on here and not halted an hours tramp away  you had best get the troops under arms captain who would have thought they would have been such fools as to light their fires within sight of the fort  james at once went to major eyres quarters and aroused him and in a few minutes the garrison were all under arms their strength including james walshams corps and some scouts of the company of john stark numbered three hundred and fortysix men besides which there were a hundred and twentyeight invalids in hospital  two hours passed and then a confused sound as of a great body of men moving on the ice was heard the ice was bare of snow and nothing could be seen but the cannon on the side facing the lake at once opened fire with grape and round shot in the direction of the sound  after firing for a few minutes they were silent the sound on the ice could no longer be heard  they have taken to the woods nat who had taken up his station next to james walsham said it aint likely they would stop on the ice with the balls pounding it up  do you think they will attack before morning james asked  it aint likely nat replied they wont know the positions and such a dark night as this they wouldnt be able to make out anything about them if they could have come straight along the ice to the head of the lake here they would have made a dash no doubt but now they find we aint to be caught asleep i expect they will wait till morning  again the sound of axes was heard in the wood and the glare of light appeared above the trees  there must be a tidy lot of em nat said  do you think it will be any use to go out and try to surprise them  not a bit captain they are sure to have a lot of redskins with them and they will be lurking in the woods in hopes that we may try such a move no we have got a strong position here and can lick them three to one but in the woods except starks men and perhaps yours none of the others wouldnt be no good at all  mayor eyre shortly afterwards sent for james who gave him the opinion of the scout and the major then ordered the troops to get under shelter again leaving starks men to act as sentries for the night was bitterly cold  it was not until ten oclock next day that the french appeared and surrounding the fort on all sides except on that of the lake opened heavy musketry fire upon it they were a formidable body vaudreuil the governor of canada had spared no pains to make the blow a successful one the force had been assembled at crown point and numbered sixteen hundred regulars canadians and indians everything needful for their comfort had been providedovercoats blankets bear skins to sleep on and tarpaulins to cover them they had been provided with twelve days provisions which were placed on hand sledges and drawn by the troops  they marched over the ice of lake champlain down to ticonderoga where they rested a week and constructed three hundred scaling ladders three days further march up lake george brought them to the english fort  the weak point of the expedition was its leader for vaudreuil who was himself a canadian had the greatest jealousy of the french officers and had intrusted the command of the expedition to his brother rigaud  the fire did no damage as the garrison lay sheltered behind their entrenchments replying occasionally whenever the enemy mustered in force as if with an intention of attacking  i dont think they mean business this time captain nat said in a tone of disgust why there are enough of them to eat us if they could but make up their minds to come on they dont suppose they are going to take william henry by blazing a way at it half a mile off  perhaps they are going to make a night attack james said they will have learned all about the position of our works  maybe so nat replied but i dont think so when chaps dont attack at once when there are four or five to one i reckon that they aint likely to attack at all they meant to surprise us and they havent and it seems to me as it has taken all the heart out of them  as evening approached the fire ceased at nightfall strong guards were placed round the entrenchments and the troops retired to their quarters ready to turn out at a minutes notice  about midnight they were called out there was again a sound on the lake the cannon at once opened and as before all was silent again  look walsham look edwards exclaimed they have set fire to the sloops  as he spoke a tongue of flame started up from one of the two vessels lying in the ice close to the shore and almost simultaneously flames shot up from among the boats drawn up on the beach  thats redskin work nat exclaimed  come lads james cried leaping down from the low earthwork into the ditch let us save the boats if we can  the scouts followed him and ran down to the shore but the indians had done their work well the two sloops and many of the boats were well alight and it was evident at once that long before a hole could be broken through the ice and buckets brought down from the fort they would be beyond all hopes of saving them  the french too opened fire from the woods bordering the lake and as the light of the flames exposed his men to the enemys marksmen james at once called them back to the fort and the sloops and boats burned themselves out  at noon next day the french filed out from the woods on to the ice at a distance of over a mile  what now edwards exclaimed they surely dont mean to be fools enough to march across the ice to attack us in broad daylight  it looks to me james replied as if they wanted to make a full show of their force see there is a white flag and a party are coming forward  an officer and several men advanced towards the fort and major eyre sent out one of his officers with an equal number of men to meet them there was a short parley when the parties came together and then the french officer advanced towards the fort with the english his followers remaining on the ice  on nearing the fort the french officer le mercier chief of the canadian artillery was blindfolded and led to the room where major eyre with all the british officers was awaiting him the handkerchief was then removed from his eyes and he announced to the commandant that he was the bearer of a message from the officer commanding the french force who being desirous of avoiding an effusion of blood begged the english commander to abstain from resistance which against a force so superior to his own could but be useless he offered the most favourable terms if he would surrender the place peaceably but said that if he were driven to make an assault his indian allies would unquestionably massacre the whole garrison  major eyre quietly replied that he intended to defend himself to the utmost  the envoy was again blindfolded when he rejoined the french force the latter at once advanced as if to attack the place but soon halted and leaving the ice opened a fusillade from the border of the woods which they kept up for some hours the garrison contemptuously abstaining from any reply  at night the french were heard advancing again the sound coming from all sides the garrison stood to their arms believing that this time the real attack was about to be made  nearer and nearer came the sound and the garrison who could see nothing in the pitchy darkness fired wherever they could hear a sound presently a bright light burst up the redskins provided with faggots of resinous sticks had crept up towards some buildings consisting of several store houses a hospital and saw mill and the huts and tents of the rangers and having placed their torches against them set them on fire and instantly retreated the garrison could do nothing to save the buildings as their efforts in the absence of water must be unavailing and they would have been shot down by the foe lying beyond the circle of light they therefore remained lying behind the entrenchment firing wherever they heard the slightest sound and momentarily expecting an attack but morning came without the french advancing and the garrison were then able to give their whole attention to saving the buildings in the fort  some great wood stacks had now ignited and the burning embers fell thickly on the huts and for some hours it was only by the greatest exertions that the troops were able to save the buildings from destruction every moment they expected to be attacked for had the french advanced the huts must have been left to themselves in which case the garrison would have found themselves shelterless and all their provisions and stores would have been consumed but before noon the danger was over for not only had the fires begun to burn low but a heavy snow storm set in all day it continued  now would be the time for them to attack james walsham said to his lieutenant we can scarce see twenty yards away  now is their chance edwards agreed but i dont believe in their attacking i cant think who they have got in command he ought to be shot a man with such a force as he has hanging about here for four days when he could have carried the place with a rush any moment  no i dont think they will attack james replied men who will stop to light a fire to warm themselves within sight of an enemys fort they want to surprise are not likely to venture out of shelter of their blankets in such a snow as this  all day and all night the snow came down till the ground was covered to a depth of over three feet early on tuesday morning twenty volunteers of the french regulars made a bold attempt to burn a sloop building on the stocks with several storehouses and other structures near the water and some hundreds of boats and canoes which were ranged near them they succeeded in firing the sloop and some buildings but james with his scouts sallied out and forced them to retreat with the loss of five of their number and by pulling down some of the huts prevented the fire spreading  next morning the sun rose brightly and the white sheet of the lake was dotted with the french in full retreat for canada their total loss had been eleven killed and wounded while on the english side seven men had been wounded all slightly never was a worse conducted or more futile expedition  after this affair the time passed slowly at fort william henry until the sun gained strength enough to melt the thick white covering of the earth james practised his men in the use of snowshoes and as soon as spring had fairly commenced resumed the work of scouting this was done only as an exercise for there was no fear that after such a humiliating failure the french would for some time to come attempt another expedition against the fort  in the autumn of 1756 general montcalm had come out from france to take the command of the french troops few of the superior officers of the french army cared to take the command in a country where the work was hard and rough and little glory was to be obtained therefore the minister of war was able for once to choose an officer fitted for the post instead of being obliged as usual to fill up the appointment by a court favourite  the marquis of montcalm was born at the chateau of candiac near nimes on the 29th of february 1712 at the age of fifteen up to which time he had studied hard he entered the army two years later he became a captain and was first under fire at the siege of philipsbourg in 1736 he married mademoiselle du boulay who brought him influential connections and some property in 1741 montcalm took part in the campaign in bohemia two years later he was made colonel and passed unharmed through the severe campaign of 1744  in the following year he fought in the campaign in italy and in 1746 was wounded at the disastrous action at piacenza where he twice rallied his regiment received five sabre cuts and was made prisoner he was soon liberated on parole and was promoted in the following year to the rank of brigadier general and being exchanged for an officer of similar rank rejoined the army and was again wounded by a musket shot shortly afterwards the peace of aix la chapelle was signed and montcalm remained living quietly with his family to whom he was tenderly attached until informed by the minister of war that he had selected him to command the troops in north america with the rank of major general the chevalier de levis was appointed second in command  no sooner did montcalm arrive in america than difficulties arose between him and the marquis de vaudreuil the governor who had hoped to have himself received the appointment of commander of the french forces and who in virtue of his office commanded the canadian militia  from first to last this man opposed and thwarted montcalm doing all in his power to injure him by reports to france in his disfavour the misfortunes which befell france during the war were in no slight degree due to this divided authority and to the obstacles thrown in the way of montcalm by the governor  montcalms first blow against the english was struck in august 1756 six months before the attack on fort william henry which had been arranged by vaudreuil three battalions of regular troops with 700 canadians and 250 indians with a strong force of artillery were quietly concentrated at fort frontenac and were intended for an attack upon the important english post of oswego fighting had been going on in this neighbourhood for some time and it was from oswego that shirley had intended to act against niagara and frontenac that enterprise had fallen through owing to shirley having been deprived of the command but a sharp fight had taken place between colonel bradstreet and his armed boatmen and 1100 french who were beaten off  oswego was a place of extreme importance it was the only english post on ontario situated as it was towards the southwest corner of the lake so long as it remained in their possession it was a standing menace against the whole line of communications of the french with the south owing to gross neglect the fort had never been placed in a really defensive condition the garrison was small and crippled with the fever which had carried off great numbers of them the remainder were ill fed and discontented  on the 12th of august the earl of london sent colonel webb with the 44th regiment and some of bradstreets boatmen to reinforce oswego they should have started a month before and had they done so would have been in time but confusion and misunderstanding had arisen from a change in command webb had scarcely made half his march when tidings of the disaster met him and he at once fell back with the greatest precipitation  at midnight on the 10th montcalm had landed his force within half a league of the first english fort four cannon were at once landed and a battery thrown up and so careless of danger were the garrison that it was not till the morning that the invaders were discovered two armed vessels at once sailed down to cannonade them but their light guns were no match for the heavy artillery of the french and they were forced to retire  the attack was commenced without delay the indians and canadians swarming in the forest round the fort kept up a hot fire upon it by nightfall the first parallel was marked out at 180 yards from the rampart  fort ontario considered the strongest of the three forts at oswego stood on a high plateau on the right side of the river where it entered the lake it was in the shape of a star and formed of a palisade of trunks of trees set upright in the ground hewn flat on both sides and closely fitted togetheran excellent defence against musketry but worthless against artillery the garrison of the fort 370 in number had eight small cannon and a mortar with which all next day they kept up a brisk fire against the battery which the french were throwing up and arming with twentysix pieces of heavy artillery  colonel mercer the commandant of oswego saw at once that the french artillery would as soon as they opened fire blow the stockade into pieces and thinking it better to lose the fort alone than the fort and its garrison he sent boats across the river after nightfall and the garrison having spiked their guns and thrown their ammunition into the well crossed the river unperceived by the french  but oswego was in no position for defence fort pepperell stood on the mouth of the river facing fort ontario towards the west and south the place was protected by an outer line of earthworks mounted with cannon but the side facing the river was wholly exposed in the belief that fort ontario would prevent any attack in this direction  montcalm lost no time the next evening his whole force set to work throwing up a battery at the edge of the rising ground on which fort ontario stood and by daybreak twenty heavy guns were in position and at once opened fire the grape and round shot swept the english position smashing down the mudbuilt walls crashing through the stockades and carrying destruction among the troops the latter made a shelter of pork barrels three high and three deep and planted cannon behind them and returned the enemys fire but the canadians and indians had crossed the river by a ford two miles up and soon opened fire from all sides  colonel mercer who had bravely led his men and inspired them by his example was cut in two by a cannon shot and the garrison were seized with despair a council of officers was held and the garrison surrendered as prisoners of war to the number of sixteen hundred which included sick the sailors belonging to the shipping labourers and upwards of a hundred women  montcalm had the greatest difficulty in preventing the indians by means of threats promises and presents from massacring the prisoners oswego was burned to the ground the forts and vessels on the stocks destroyed and the place having been made a desert the army returned with their prisoners and spoil to montreal  the loss of oswego had inflicted a very severe blow to the influence and prestige of england among the indians of the lake districts but this was partly restored by the failure of the french expedition against william henry early in the following spring  the expedition against louisbourg to strengthen which the western frontier had been denuded of troops proved a failure a great delay had taken place at home in consequence of ministerial changes and it was not until the 5th of may that fifteen ships of the line and three frigates under admiral holbourne with 5000 troops on board sailed from england for halifax where loudon was to meet him with the forces from the colony but while the english fleet had been delaying the french government had obtained information of its destination and had sent three french squadrons across the atlantic to louisbourg  it was the 10th of july before the united english force assembled at halifax and there fresh delays arose the troops nearly twelve thousand in number were landed and weeks were spent in idle drill  at the beginning of august the forces were again embarked when a sloop came in from newfoundland bringing letters which had been captured on board a french ship from these it appeared that there were twentytwo ships of the line besides several frigates in the harbour of louisbourg and that 7000 troops were in garrison in what was by far the strongest fortress on the continent  success was now impossible and the enterprise was abandoned loudon with his troops sailed back to new york and admiral holbourne who had been joined by four additional ships sailed for louisbourg in hopes that the french fleet would come out and fight him he cruised for some time off the port but lamotte the french admiral would not come out  in september a tremendous gale burst upon the british fleet one ship was dashed on the rocks a short distance from louisbourg and only a sudden shift of the wind saved the rest from a total destruction nine were dismasted and others threw their cannon into the sea had lamotte sailed out on the following day the english fleet was at his mercy fortunately he did not do so and holbourne returned to england  the french in canada were aware that loudon had gathered all his troops at new york and was preparing for an expedition which was to be aided by a fleet from england but thinking it probable that it was directed against quebec the most vital point in canada since its occupation by the english would entirely cut the colony off from france montcalm was obliged to keep his forces in hand near that town and was unable to take advantage of the unprotected state in which loudon had left the frontier of the colonies  as soon however as by despatch received from france and by the statements of prisoners captured by the indians on the frontier montcalm learned that the expedition which had just left new york was destined for louisbourg he was at liberty to utilize his army for the invasion of the defenceless colonies and he determined to commence the campaign by the capture of fort william henry  james walsham with his company of royal scouts had spent the spring at fort william henry loudon had at first sent an order for the corps to be broken up and the men to rejoin their respective regiments and to accompany them on the expedition but the earnest representations of colonel monro of the 35th regiment who was now in command of the total inadequacy of the garrison to defend itself should a serious attack be made from ticonderoga and of the great value to him of the corps under captain walsham which was now thoroughly trained in forest fighting induced him to countermand the order  james was glad that he was not obliged to rejoin his regiment the independent command was a pleasant one and although life at fort william henry had since the french repulse been an uneventful one there was plenty of fishing in the lake and shooting in the woods to vary the monotony of drill  he and edwards were now both expert canoemen and often ventured far down the lake taking with them one or other of the scouts and keeping a sharp lookout among the woods on either side for signs of the enemy once or twice they were chased by indian canoes but always succeeded in distancing them  the news has just come in that the expedition has sailed james said as he one day towards the end of july entered the hut which he now occupied with edwards for the corps had long since been put under huts these being better suited for the hot season than tents  it is rather a nuisance edwards grumbled being kept here instead of going and taking share in a big siege  dont be impatient edwards james replied if i am not greatly mistaken you will have quite as much fighting as you want here before long montcalms sudden attack on oswego last autumn showed that he is an enterprising general and i have no doubt that as soon as he learns that loudons expedition is not intended for quebec he will be beating us up on the frontier with a vengeance  montcalm indeed had already prepared to strike a blow a thousand indians lured by the prospect of gifts scalps and plunder had come in from the west and north and were encamped near montreal and besides these there were the mission indians and those of the five nations who adhered to france  early in july the movement began day after day fleets of boats and canoes rowed up lake champlain and towards the end of the month the whole force was gathered at ticonderoga here were now collected eight thousand men of whom two thousand were indians representing fortyone tribes and subtribes among them were iroquois hurons nipissings abenakis algonkins micmacs and malecites these were all nominal christians and counted eight hundred warriors with them were the western indians ojibwas mississagas pottawattamies menomonies sacs foxes winnebagoes miamis and iowas these were still unconverted  the french held these savage allies in abhorrence their drunkenness their turbulence their contempt of all orders their cruelty to their captives and their cannibalism disgusted and shocked montcalm and his officers but they were powerless to restrain them for without them as scouts guides and eyes in the forests the french could have done nothing and at the slightest remonstrance the indians were ready to take offence and to march away to their distant homes  the letters of montcalm and his officers to their friends were full of disgust at the doings of their savage allies and of regret that they could not dispense with their services or restrain their ferocity vaudreuil and the canadians on the other hand accustomed to the traditions of savage warfare made no attempt whatever to check the ferocity of the indians and were indeed the instigators of the raids which the savages made upon the unprotected villages and settlements on the frontier offered rewards for scalps and wrote and talked gleefully of the horrible atrocities committed upon the colonists    chapter 14 scouting on lake champlain   one morning colonel monro sent for james  captain walsham he said there are rumours that the french are gathering at crown point in considerable force captain rogers is still disabled by his wound and his band have suffered so heavily in their last affair with the enemy that for the time they are out of action it is important that i should learn the truth of these rumours for if they be true i must communicate at once to the general in order that he may get together a sufficient force to relieve us if montcalm comes down and lays siege to the fort will you undertake the business  i will do my best sir james replied do you propose that i should take all my company or only a picked party  that i will leave to you captain walsham i want trustworthy news and how you obtain it for me matters little  then i will take only a small party james said fifty men would be useless for purposes of fighting if the enemy are numerous while with such a number it would be hopeless to attempt to escape detection by the indians the fewer the better for such an enterprise  on leaving the commandant james at once summoned the two hunters to his hut and told them the mission he had received  i am ready captain that is if you and i and jonathan makes up the party as to going trapezing about round crown point with fifty soldiers the thing aint to be thought of we should be there no more than half an hour before the indians would know of it and we should have no show either for fighting or running away no captain the lads are good enough for scouting about round camp here but as for an expedition of that sort we might as well start with a drove of swine  that is just what i thought nat one canoe may escape even the eyes of the indians but a dozen would have no chance of doing so  we might get up the lakes the scout said but the mischief would be in the woods no it never would do captain if we goes it must be the three of us and no more when do you think of starting  the sooner the better nat  very well captain i will go and get some grub ready and as soon as it gets dusk we will get the canoe into the water  i suppose you cant take me with you lieutenant edwards said when james told him of the duty he had been requested to perform it is dismal here  not exactly james laughed what would become of the company if it were to lose its two officers and its two scouts at a blow no edwards you will command during my absence and i think you will soon have more lively times here for if it be true that montcalm will himself command the troops coming against us it will be a different business altogether from the last and now leave me alone for an hour i have some letters to write before i start they will be for you to send off in case we dont come back again  dont look serious i have no intention of falling into the hands of montcalms savages still there is no doubt the expedition is a risky one and it is just as well to be prepared  just as the sun was setting nat came into the officers hut  everything is ready captain he said i hope you have made a good dinner for its the last hot meal you will eat till you get back i have cooked enough meat for the next four days and thats about as long as it will keep good after that dried deers flesh will have to do for us  i expect i tell you we shall have to be pretty spry this time if they are coming down in force they are sure to send a lot of their indians through the woods on each side of the lake and the water will be swarming with their canoes jonathan and i have been talking it over and trying to settle which would be the safest to foot it all the way or to go by water we concluded as there aint much difference and the canoe will be the quickest and easiest so we had best keep to that plan  i would certainly rather go that way nat if you think that the danger is no greater  no i dont think theres much difference captain at any rate we may as well go that way like enough we shall have to tramp back by the woods  half an hour later the canoe put out although they had little fear that any of the indian canoes would be so far up lake george there was scarce a word spoken in the boat for some hours after starting jonathan was always silent and nat although talkative enough when in camp was a man of few words when once embarked upon a serious expedition as for james he had little inclination for conversation  the enterprise was he knew one of extreme danger had it been only a french force he was about to reconnoitre or even one composed of french and canadians together he would have thought little of it but he knew that the redskins would be roaming thickly in the forest ahead of the army and much as he relied upon the skill and experience of the two scouts he knew it would be difficult indeed to elude their watchful eyes he thought of the letters he had been writing and wondered whether he should return to tear them up or whether they would be read at home  all the time he was thinking he worked his paddle vigorously and at a high rate of speed the light canoe bounded noiselessly over the water impelled by three vigorous pairs of arms  when they approached the narrows connecting lake george with lake champlain the boats head was directed towards the shore for they could not get past ticonderoga before daylight broke and it was likely that a good watch would be kept in the narrows by the enemy and it would be dangerous to try to effect a landing there the canoe was carried ashore and hidden in some bushes and all lay down to sleep  when day broke nat rose and went down to the water to see that in landing they had left no mark upon the shore which might betray them to the eye of a passing redskin going down on his hands and knees he obliterated every sign of their footprints raised the herbage upon which they had trodden cut short to the ground such stalks as they had bruised or broken in their passage and then when confident that all was safe he returned to his camp when it again became dark the canoe was carried down and replaced in the water and they continued their passage james had at nats request laid by his paddle  you paddle wonderfully well captain i dont say you dont but for a delicate piece of work like this one cant be too careful it aint often i can hear your paddle dip in the water not once in a hundred times but then you see that once might cost us our scalps we have got to go along as silent as a duck swimming speed aint no object for we shall be miles down lake champlain before daylight but if the french know their business they will have half a dozen canoes in these narrows to prevent us scouting on lake champlain and you see they have got all the advantage of us cause theyve got just to lie quiet and listen and we have got to row on as far as seeing goes i can make them out as soon as they can make us out but they can hear us while they wont give our ears a chance  i tell you captain i dont expect to get through this narrows without a chase for it if it come to running of course you will take your paddle again and we three can show our heels to any canoe on the lakes perviding of course as its only a starn chase if there are three or four of them then i dont say as it wont be a close thing  james accordingly lay quietly back in the boat while his companions took the paddles it was not necessary for him either to look out or to listen for he knew that his companions eyes and ears were quicker than his own it had been agreed before starting that they should go along close to the trees on the lefthand side of the passage because the keenest lookout would be kept on the righthand side as that would naturally be chosen by any boat going up as being farthest from the french fort  there is no fear whatever of our being seen from the land nat had said the redskins would know that so well that they wouldnt trouble to look out its only canoes we have got to be afraid of and as to them its just a chance they might see us out in the light waters in the middle but under the trees they cant make us out thirty yards off they will be lying there quiet if they are there at all and we shall either get past them safe or we shall pretty nigh run into them its just chance and theres nothing to do for it but to paddle as noiselessly as fish and trust to our luck  having crossed the lake to the left shore they entered the narrows the paddles were dipped so quietly into the water that even james could scarcely hear their sound every few strokes the scouts stopped paddling altogether and sat listening intently they were keeping close to the trees so close that at times it seemed to james that by stretching out his hands he could touch the bushes  after an hours paddling they stopped longer than usual  what is it james whispered in jonathans ear for nat had taken the bow paddle  there are men ahead the scout whispered back we heard them speak just now  presently the boat began to move again but so quietly that it was only by looking at the dark masses of the boughs that stretched out overhead that james knew the boat was in motion jonathan now crouched in the bottom of the boat and placed his hand on nats shoulder as a sign for him to do the same the time seemed endless to james as he lay there it was too dark under the trees for him even to see the outline of nats figure the boat was he was sure moving for occasionally as he lay on his back it grew lighter overhead as they passed under openings in the trees  suddenly his heart gave a bound and he nearly started for a guttural voice spoke seemingly within a few feet of the canoe he placed his hand on his rifle in readiness to sit up and fire but all was still again it was a passing remark made by one redskin to another in a canoe for the sound was to his right another long period passed and then jonathan sat up and took to his paddle again and james judged that the danger was over  raising his head he could see nothing except the vague light of the sheet of water on his right the boat was still keeping close under the trees on the left shore of the lake and he lay back again and dozed off to sleep he was awoke by jonathan touching his foot  you can take your paddle now captain  he sat up at once and looked round they were far out now on a broad sheet of water there were some faint lights as of fires burning low high up to the left behind them and he knew that they had already passed ticonderoga and were making their way along lake champlain they paddled for some hours and then landed on the righthand side of the lake  we are not likely to be disturbed here nat said as they lifted the canoe from the water the indians coming down from crown point would keep on the other side of the lake they will all make for ticonderoga and will not think of keeping a lookout for anyone as far down the lakes as this  that was a close shave with that canoe nat it startled me when i heard the voice close to us they must have been within ten yards of us  about that nat said it was lucky they spoke when we were coming along i expect they had been watching for some nights and hadnt much idea anyone would come or else they wouldnt have spoken as it was it was easy enough to pass them on such a dark night of course they were looking outside and i just kept along as close as i could to the bushes only just giving a light stroke now and then to take her along being inside them i got a sight of em some distance away but i knew they couldnt see us sharp as their eyes are the only chance was their hearing and as there was no noise for them to hear i felt safe enough after i had once caught sight of em and saw they were lying out at the edge of the shadow  if they had been close under the bushes as they ought to have been we should have been in for a fight for we mightnt have seen each other till the boats touched let that be a lesson to you captain when you are on the lookout for a canoe at night lie in among the bushes it must pass between you and the light then and as they cant see you you can either grapple or shoot just as you like  if they had a seen us we should have had a hot time for i could hear by their calls right along the other side that they were looking out for us in earnest and if a rifle had been fired we should have had half a dozen canoes down upon us in no time and like enough should have had to leave the boat and take to the woods  how far is crown point away  not more than ten miles nat said it is thirty miles from ticonderoga it lies out on a point just where champlain widens out i reckon our safest way tonight will be to scout along this side till we are well past the point then to paddle out well across the lake and come up again and land to the left of crown point we shall then be in the track of boats coming up from the lower end of the lake and can paddle boldly on no one would be keeping any lookout that way our danger wont begin until we get ashore in course then we must act according to sarcumstances  this manoeuvre was carried out they started as soon as it became dark and after paddling along the eastern shore for nearly three hours struck out into the wide lake till they approached the opposite shore and then heading south again paddled boldly down towards the spot where at the end of a sweep of land which seemed to close in the lake stood the french fort of crown point  before starting the two scouts had stripped to the waist had laid aside their caps and fastening a strip of leather round their heads had stuck some feathers into it they then painted their faces and bodies  you neednt be particular about the flourishes jonathan its only the redskin outline as one wants to get if we run against any other canoes coming up the lake or they get sight of us as we near the shore so as we look something like redskins thats near enough of course we can both speak mohawk well enough to pass muster and the captain will lay himself down in the bottom  captain you will do well enough for a canadian when we have once landed there aint much difference between a hunter one side of the frontier and the other but its as well that you shouldnt be seen till we land the less questions asked the better our mohawks good enough with any of the other tribes but it wouldnt pass with a mohawk if we got into a long talk with him  fortunately however these precautions proved unnecessary no other canoes were seen on the lake and they landed unnoticed at a spot a mile and a half to the west of crown point before starting from fort william henry james had laid aside his uniform and had dressed himself in hunting shirt and leggings similar to those worn by the scouts he had adopted various little details in which the canadian hunters differed from those on the english side of the frontier the latter wore their hunting shirts loose in indian fashion while the canadians generally wore a leathern belt outside theirs at the waist  his cap was made of squirrels skins which would pass equally well on both sides of the frontier the fire bag in which tobacco tinder and other small matters were carried was of indian workmanship as was the cord of his powder horn and bullet pouch altogether his getup was somewhat brighter and more picturesque than that of english scouts who as a rule despised anything approaching to ornament  he knew that by disguising himself he would be liable if captured to be shot at once as a spy but this could not be considered under the circumstances to add to the risk he ran for in any case he was certain to be killed if detected and it would have been out of the question to attempt to approach the french camp in the uniform of a british officer could he have spoken canadian french the mission would have been comparatively easy but he knew only a few words of the language and would be detected the instant he opened his lips  the canoe was hauled up and carefully concealed on land and then they lay down until daylight for no information as to the strength of the enemy could be gained in the dark in the morning the two scouts very carefully made their toilet they had brought all necessaries with them and soon in their indian hunting shirts and fringed leggings and with carefullypainted faces they were in a position to defy the keenest scrutiny  when after a careful survey of each other they felt that their disguise was complete they moved boldly forward accompanied by james after half an hours walking they emerged from the forest and the strong fort of crown point lay before them  it was constructed of stone and was capable of withstanding a long siege by any force which could be brought against it round it was the camp of the french troops and james judged from the number of tents that there must be some 1500 french soldiers there a short distance away were a large number of roughlyconstructed huts roofed with boughs of trees  thems the canadians jonathan said the redskins never build shelters while on the war path there are a heap of redskins about  these indeed even at the distance of several hundred yards could be easily distinguished from their white allies by their plumed headdresses and by the blankets or long robes of skins which hung from their shoulders  i should put them down at three thousand  it is a big army nat said i should think there must be quite as many canadians as french how many redskins there are there aint no knowing but we may be sure that they will have got together as many as they could put em down at 4000 and that makes 7000 altogether enough to eat up fort william henry and to march to albanyor to new york if they are well led and take fancy to itthat is if the colonists dont bestir themselves smartly  well so far you have found out what you came to seek captain whats the next thing  we must discover if we can whether they mean to go up the lakes in boats or to march through the woods james replied they will have a tremendous job getting any guns through the woods but if they are going by water of course they can bring them  very well nat replied in that case captain my advice is you stop in the woods and jonathan and i will go down past the fort to the shore and see what provision they are making in that way you see the place swarms with canadians and you would be sure to be spoken to redskins dont talk much to each other unless there is some need for words and we can go right through the french camp without fear the only danger is of some loping mohawk coming up to us and i dont reckon there are many of em in the camp perhaps nary a one  although james did not like his followers to go into danger without his sharing it he saw that his presence would enormously add to their risks and therefore agreed to their plan withdrawing some distance into the wood and choosing a thick growth of underwood he entered and lay down in the bushes while the two scouts walked quietly away towards the camp  two hours passed several times he heard footsteps in the wood near him and peering through the leaves caught sight of parties of indians going towards the camp either late arrivals from montreal or bands that had been out scouting or hunting at the end of the two hours to his great relief he saw two figures coming from the other way through the woods and at once recognized the scouts he crawled out and joined them as they came up  thank god you are back again i have been in a fever all the time you have been away  i wish i had known the precise place where you were hiding i should have made a sign to you to keep quiet but it aint of no use now  whats the matter then nat  i aint quite sure as anything is the matter the scout replied but i am feared of it as bad luck would have it just as we were coming back through the camp we came upon a mohawk chief he looked hard at us and then came up and said  the owl thought that he knew all his brothers but here are two whose faces are strange to him  of course i told him that we had been living and hunting for years in the english colony but that hearing that the mohawks had joined the french we had come to fight beside our brothers he asked a few questions and then passed on but i could see the varmin was not satisfied though in course he pretended to be glad to welcome us back to the tribe so we hung about the camp for another half hour and then made a sweep before we came out here i didnt look round but jonathan stooped as if the lace of his moccasin had come undone and managed to look back but in course he didnt see anything  then you have no reason to believe you are followed nat  dont i tell you i have every reason nat said if that redskin the owl has got any suspicionand suspicion you may be sure hes gothe wont rest till hes cleared the matter up he is after us sure enough  then had we not better make for the canoe at full speed  no nat said if they are behind us they will be watching our trail and if they see we change our pace they will be after us like a pack of wolves while as long as we walk slowly and carelessly they will let us go if it were dark we might make a run for it but there aint no chance at present if we took to the lake we should have a hundred canoes after us while the woods are full of indians and a whoop of the owl would bring a hundred of them down onto our track  why shouldnt the owl have denounced you at once if he suspected you james asked  because it aint redskin nature to do anything till you are sure the scout replied there is nothing a redskin hates so much as to be wrong and he would rather wait for weeks to make sure of a thing than run the risk of making a mistake i dont suppose he takes us for whites he expects we belong to some other tribe come in as spies  then what are you thinking of doing james asked  we will go on a bit further nat said in hopes of coming across some stream where we may hide our trail if we cant find that we will sit down before long and eat as if we was careless and in no hurry  for a time they walked on in silence  do you think they are close to us james asked presently  not far away the scout said carelessly so long as they see we aint hurrying they will go easy they will know by this time that we have a white man with us and like enough the owl will have sent back for one or two more of his warriors likely enough he only took one with him at first seeing we were but two and that he reckoned on taking us by surprise but when he saw you joined us he would send back for perhaps a couple more  then what i would suggest james said is that we should at once stroll down to our canoe put it in the water and paddle out a few hundred yards and there let down the lines we have got on board and begin to fish as long as we are quiet there the redskins may not interfere with us and when it gets dark we can make off at the worst we have a chance for it and it seems to me anything would be better than this sort of wandering about when we know that at any time we may have them down upon us  perhaps that is the best plan nat said what do you think jonathan  jonathan gave an assenting grunt and they turned their faces towards the lake still walking at the same leisurely pace not once did any of the three look back as they neared the water james found the temptation very strong to do so but he restrained it and sauntered along as carelessly as ever  the canoe was lifted from its hiding place and put in the water as they were about to step in the bushes parted and the owl stood beside them  where are my brothers going he asked quietly  we are going fishing nat answered the noise in the woods will have frightened game away  there is food in the camp the owl said the french give food to their brothers the redskins  my white brother wants fish nat said quietly and we have told him we will catch him some will the owl go with us  the indian shook his head and in a moment the canoe put off from the shore the indian standing watching them at the edge of the water  thats a badly puzzled redskin nat said with a low laugh his braves have not come up yet or he would not have let us start  there that is far enough we are out of the range of indian guns now lay in your paddles and begin to fish there are several canoes fishing further out and the redskin will feel safe he can cut us off providing we dont go beyond them  the indian was as nat had said puzzled that something was wrong he was sure but as he was alone he was unable to oppose their departure he watched them closely as they paddled out in readiness to give a war whoop which would have brought down the fishing canoes outside and given warning to every indian within sound of his voice but when he saw them stop and begin to fish he hesitated if he gave the alarm he might prove to be mistaken and he shrank from facing the ridicule which a false alarm would bring upon him should they really prove as he believed to be spies he would if he gave the alarm lose the honour and glory of their capture and their scalps would fall to other handsa risk not to be thought of  he therefore waited until six of his braves came up he had already retired among the trees before he joined them but the canoe was still visible through the branches  the men we tracked have taken to the water they are fishing the owl is sure that they are not of our tribe but he must wait till he sees what they will do let three of my brothers go and get a canoe and paddle out beyond them and there fish i will remain with the others here if they come back again we will seize them if they go out further my brothers will call to the redskins in the other canoes and will cut them off the owl and his friends will soon be with them  there is another canoe coming out nat james said hadnt we better make a run for it at once  not a bit of it captain dear me how difficult it is to teach men to have patience i have looked upon you as a promising pupil but there you are just as hasty and impatient as if you had never spent a day in the woods where should we run to we must go up the lake for we could not pass the point for fifty canoes would be put out before we got there we couldnt land this side because the woods are full of redskins and if we led them for ten miles down the lake and landed tother side scores of them would land between here and there and would cut us off  no lad we have got to wait here till its getting late i dont say till its dark but till within an hour or so of nightfall as long as we show no signs of going the chances is as they wont interfere with us its a part of redskin natur to be patient and as long as they see as we dont try to make off they will leave us alone thats how i reads it  you agrees with me jonathan  in course you do he went on as his companion grunted an assent i dont say as they maynt ask a question or so but i dont believe as they will interfere with us  there is a fish on your line captain you dont seem to me to be attending to your business  james indeed found it difficult to fix his attention on his line when he knew that they were watched by hostile eyes and that at any moment a conflict might begin the canoe that had come out last had shaped its course so as to pass close to those fishing outside them and a few words had been exchanged with the occupants of eacha warning no doubt as to the suspicious character of the fishing party near them beyond this nothing had happened the indians in the canoe had let down their lines and seemed as intent as the others upon their fishing  the hours passed slowly under other circumstances james would have enjoyed the sport for the fish bit freely and a considerable number were soon lying in the canoe nat and jonathan appeared as interested in their work as if no other boat but their own were afloat on the lake never once did james see them glance towards the canoes they did not talk much but when they spoke it was always in the indian tongue  the time seemed endless before the sun began to sink beyond the low hills on their left it was an intense relief to james when nat said at last  the time is just at hand now cap the redskins are tired of waiting at least they think that they had better not put it off any longer they know as well as we do that it wont do to wait till it gets dark  do you see that canoe that came out last is paddling down towards us it looks as if it were drifting but i have seen them dip a paddle in several times the others are pulling up their lines so as to be in readiness to join in get your piece ready to pick up and aim the moment i give the word they think they are going to surprise us but we must be first with them go on with your fishing and just drop your line overboard when you pick up your gun  the canoe approached slowly until it was within thirty yards james and his companions went on with their fishing as if they did not notice the approach of the other canoe until one of the indians spoke  have my indian brothers caught many fish  a goodish few nat replied one or two of them are large ones  see here and he stooped as if to select a large fish  now he said suddenly  in an instant the three rifles were levelled to the shoulder and pointed at the indians the latter taken completely by surprise and finding themselves with three barrels levelled at them as by one accord dived overboard  now your paddles nat exclaimed  three strokes sent the canoe dancing up to that which the indians had just left it struck it on the broadside and rolled it instantly over  those redskin guns are out of the way anyhow nat said now we have got to row for it  he gave a sharp turn to the canoe as he spoke and it bounded away towards the right thereby throwing those outside it on their quarter simultaneously with the upset of the canoe half a dozen rifles rang out from the shore an indian war whoop rose at the edge of the woods and a minute later half a dozen canoes shot out from shore    chapter 15 through many perils   the course nat was taking was not parallel to that of the boats outside him he was sheering gradually out into the lake and although the boat was travelling somewhat faster than its pursuers james saw that its course would carry it across their bows at a dangerously close distance the indians were not long in seeing that the canoe was outstripping them and in each of the boats one of the redskins laid aside his paddle and began to fire the balls struck the water near the canoe but no one was hit  let them fire jonathan said it aint every man as can shoot straight from a canoe going at racing pace the more they fires the better they will only fall further behind  after firing two or three shots each the indians appeared to be of the same opinion and resumed their paddles but they had lost so much ground that the canoe they were in chase of shot out into the lake fifty yards ahead of the nearest some more shots were fired and then the indians began hastily to throw the fish with which their canoes were laden into the water after paddling two or three hundred yards farther nat laid in his paddle  out with them fish he said you can leave one or two for supper but the rest must go overboard be quick about it for those canoes from the shore are coming up fast  the work was concluded just as the canoes with the owl and his warriors came up with the others which having now got rid of their fish again set out and in a close body the ten canoes started in pursuit  paddle steady nat said and whatever you do be keerful of your blades if one was to break now it would mean the loss of our scalps dont gain on em as long as the redskins on shore think as their friends are going to catch us they wont care to put out and join in the chase but if they thought we was getting away they might launch canoes ahead of us and cut us off the nearer we are to them the better as long as we are keeping ahead  for an hour the chase continued the indians although straining every nerve did not gain a foot upon the fugitives who although paddling hard had still some reserve of strength the sun by this time was touching the tops of the hills  now cap nat said its time to teach em as we can bite a bit they wont be quite so hot over it if we give them a lesson now do you turn round and pepper them a bit  now old hoss you and i must row all we know for a bit  turning himself in the canoe resting his elbow on his knee to steady his rifle james took as careful an aim as the dancing motion of the boat permitted and fired a dull sound came back like an echo to the crack of the piece and a paddle in the leading boat fell into the water a yell arose from the indians but no answering shout came back  the indians were now paddling even harder than before in hope of overtaking the canoe now that it was impelled by but two rowers but the scouts were rowing their hardest and proved the justice of their fame as the best paddlers on the lakes by maintaining their distance from their pursuers  again and again james fired several of his bullets taking effect it was now rapidly becoming dusk  that will do captain we had best be showing them our heels now and get as far ahead as we can by the time it is quite dark  james laid by his rifle and again took his paddle and as all were rowing at the top of their speed they gradually increased the distance between themselves and their pursuers rapidly the gap of water widened and when darkness fell on the lake the fugitives were more than half a mile ahead of their pursuers the night was dark and a light mist rising from the water further aided them when night had set in the pursuing canoes could no longer be seen  for another half hour they paddled on without intermitting their efforts then to jamess surprise nat turned the head of the canoe to the western shore he asked no question however having perfect faith in nats sagacity they were nearly in the middle of the lake when they altered their course and it took them half an hours hard paddling before the dark mass of trees loomed up in the darkness ahead of him ten minutes before nat had passed the word that they should paddle quietly and noiselessly it was certain that the chase would be eagerly watched from the shore and that any indians there might be in the wood would be closely watching near the waters edge  accordingly as noiselessly as possible they approached the shore and gliding in between the overhanging trees laid the canoe alongside a clump of bushes then without a word being spoken they laid in their paddles and stretched themselves full length in the canoe  james was glad of the rest for trained and hard as were his muscles he was exhausted by the long strain of the row for life he guessed that nat would calculate that the indian canoes would scatter when they lost sight of them and that they would seek for them more closely on the eastern shore at the same time he was surprised that after once getting out of sight of their pursuers nat had not immediately landed on the opposite shore and started on foot through the woods  after recovering his breath james sat up and listened attentively once or twice he thought he heard the sound of a dip of a paddle out on the lake but he could not be sure of it while from time to time he heard the croak of a frog sometimes near sometimes at a distance along the shore he would have thought little of this had not a slight pressure of jonathans hand against his foot told him that these were indian signals  some hours passed before nat made a move then he touched jonathan and sat up in the canoe the signal was passed on to james the paddles were noiselessly taken up and without a sound that could be detected by the most closelylistening ear the canoe stole out again on to the lake until some distance from shore they paddled very quietly then gradually the strokes grew more vigorous until the canoe was flying along at full speed up the lake her course being laid so as to cross very gradually towards the eastern side  it was not until as james judged they must have been several miles from the point at which they had started that they approached the eastern shore they did so with the same precautions which had been adopted on the other side and sat listening intently before they gave the last few strokes which took them to the shore quietly they stepped out and the two scouts lifting the canoe on their shoulders carried it some fifty yards into the forest and laid it down among some bushes then they proceeded on their way nat walking first james following him so close that he was able to touch him for in the thick darkness under the trees he could not perceive even the outlines of his figure jonathan followed close behind their progress was slow for even the trained woodsmen could with difficulty make their way through the trees and nats only index as to the direction to be taken lay in the feel of the bark of the trunks  after an hours progress he whispered  we will stop here till daylight we cant do any good at the work we havent made half a mile since we started  it was a positive relief to james to hear the scouts voice for not a single word had been spoken since they lost sight of their pursuers in the darkness the fact that he had ventured now to speak showed that he believed that they were comparatively safe  may i speak nat he asked after they had seated themselves on the ground  ay you may speak captain but dont you raise your voice above a whisper there is no saying what redskin ears may be near us i guess these forests are pretty well alive with them you may bet there isnt a redskin or one of the irregular canadian bands but is out arter us tonight the war whoop and the rifles will have put them all on the lookout  they will have seen that we were pretty well holding our own and will guess that when night came on we should give the canoes the slip i guess they will have placed a lot of canoes and flatboats across the lake opposite crown point for they will know that we should either head back or take to the woods i guess most of the redskins near crown point will have crossed over at this point as in course we were more likely to land on this side i had a mighty good mind to land whar we was over there but there are sure to be such a heap of indians making their way up that side from montreal that i judge this will be the best but we shall have all we can do to get free of them  why didnt you land at once nat after we lost sight of them instead of crossing over  because thats where they will reckon we shall land captain thats where they will look for our tracks the first thing in the morning and they will know that we cant travel far such a dark night as this and they will search every inch of the shore for three or four miles below where they lost sight of us to find where we landed they would know well enough we couldnt get ashore without leaving tracks as they would make out and they would reckon to pick up our trail fast enough in the wood and to overtake us before we had gone many miles  now you see we have doubled on them the varmint in the woods will search the edge of the lake in the morning but its a good long stretch to go over and if we have luck they maynt strike on our landing place for some hours after daylight in course they may hit on it earlier still it gives us a chance anyhow another thing is we have twenty miles less to travel through the woods than if we had to start up there and that makes all the difference when youve got redskins at your heels if we dont have the bad luck to come across some of the varmint in the woods i expect we shall carry our scalps back to fort william henry  now you had best sleep till daybreak we shant get another chance till we get into the fort again  with the first dawn of morning they were on their way striking straight back into the woods they walked fast but with the greatest care and caution occasionally making bends and detours to prevent the redskins following their traces at a run which they would have been able to do had they walked in a straight line whenever the ground was soft they walked without trying to conceal their tracks for nat knew that however carefully they progressed the indians would be able to make out their trail here when however they came to rocky and broken ground they walked with the greatest caution avoiding bruising any of the plants growing between the rocks after walking ten miles in this direction they turned to the south  we ought to be pretty safe now nat said they may be three or four hours before they hit on our landing place and find the canoe i dont say as they wont be able to follow our trailthere aint no saying what redskin eyes can dobut it ull take them a long time anyway there aint much risk of running against any of them in the forest now i guess that most of them followed the canoe down the lake last night  anyway we are well out from lake champlain now when we have gone another fifteen mile we shant be far from the upper arm theres a canoe been lying hidden there for the last two years unless some tramping redskin has found it which aint likely  twenty miles further walking brought them to the shore of the lake following this for another hour they came upon the spot where a little stream ran into the lake  here we are nat said fifty yards up here we shall find the canoe  they followed the stream up for a little distance and then nat leaving its edge made for a clump of bushes a few yards away pushing the thick foliage aside he made his way into the centre of the clump  here it is he said just as i left it  the canoe was lifted out and carried down to the lake and taking their seats they paddled up lake champlain keeping close under the shore  we have had good luck captain nat said i hardly thought we should har got out without a scrimmage i expect as the best part of the redskins didnt trouble themselves very much about it they expect to get such a lot of scalps and plunder when they take the fort that the chance of three extra wasnt enough inducement for em to take much trouble over it the redskins in the canoes who chased us would be hot enough over it for you picked out two if not more of them but those who started from the fort wouldnt have any particular reason to trouble much especially as they think it likely that those who were chasing us would get the scalps when a redskins bloods up there aint no trouble too great for him and he will follow for weeks to get his revenge but take em all in all they are lazy varmint and as long as there is plenty of deers meat on hand they will eat and sleep away their time for weeks  by night they reached the upper end of lake champlain the canoe was carefully hidden away again and they struck through the woods in the direction of fort william henry they were now safe from pursuit and after walking two or three miles halted for the night made a fire and cooked some of the dried meat when they had finished their meal nat said  now we will move away a bit and then stretch ourselves out  why shouldnt we lie down here nat  because it would be a foolish thing to do captain there aint no saying what redskins may be wandering in the woods in time of war a thousand nights might pass without one of em happening to come upon that fire but if they did and we were lying beside it all the trouble we have taken to slip through their hands would be chucked clean away no you cannot be too careful in the woods  they started early the next morning and before noon arrived at fort william henry where james at once reported to colonel monro what he had learned of the strength of the french force gathering at crown point  thank you captain walsham the commandant said i am greatly indebted to you for having brought us certain news of what is coming i will write off at once and ask for reinforcements this is a serious expedition and the colonies will have to make a great effort and a speedy one if they are going to save the fort for from what we hear of montcalm he is not likely to let the grass grow under his feet i shall report the services you have rendered  as soon as colonel monro received the report james had brought him he sent to general webb who with two thousand six hundred men chiefly provincials was at fort edward fourteen miles away on the 25th of july that general visited fort william henry and after remaining there four days returned to fort edward whence he wrote to the governor of new york telling him the french were coming and urging him to send forward the militia at once saying that he was determined to march himself with all his troops to the fort instead of doing so three days later he sent up a detachment of two hundred regulars under lieutenant colonel young and eight hundred massachusetts men under colonel frye this raised the force at fort william henry to two thousand two hundred men and reduced that of webb to sixteen hundred  had webb been a brave and determined man he would have left a few hundred men only to hold fort edward and marched with the rest to assist monro when on the morning of the 3d of august he received a letter from him saying that the french were in sight on the lake but as he was neither brave nor determined he remained at fort edward sending off message after message to new york for help which could not possibly arrive in time  already the garrison of fort william henry had suffered one reverse three hundred provincials chiefly new jersey men under colonel parker had been sent out to reconnoitre the french outposts the scouts under james walsham were of the party they were to proceed in boats down the lake  i dont like this business no way captain nat said as the company took their place in the boats this aint neither one thing or the other if monro wants to find out about the enemy jonathan and i kin do it if he wants to fight the enemy this lot aint enough besides these new jersey men know no more about the forest than so many children you mark my words this is going to be a bad business why they can see all these boats halfway down the lake and with all these redskins about they will ambush us as soon as we try to land  look here captain you know that i aint no coward i dont think no one can say that of me i am ready to fight when there is a chance of fighting but i dont see no good in getting myself killed off when there aint no good in it so what i says is this dont you be in a hurry captain with these boats of ours  but i must obey orders nat james said smiling  yes you must obey orders captain no doubt but theres two ways of obeying orders the one is to rush in front and to do a little more than you are told the other is to take things quiet and just do what you are told and no more now my advice is on this here expedition you go on the last plan if you are ordered to land first why land first it must be if you dont get orders to land first just let them as is in a hurry land afore you i aint been teaching all these lads to know something about the woods for the last six months jest to see them killed off like flies because a blundering wrongheaded colonel sends them out with two hundred and fifty ploughmen for the redskins to see and attack jest when they fancies  very well nat i will take your advice and for once we wont put ourselves in the front unless we are ordered  satisfied with this nat passed quietly round among the men as they were taking their places in the boats and told them that there was no occasion for them to row as if they were racing  i shall be in the captains boat he said you keep close to us and dont you try to push on ahead when we are once fairly in the woods then we will do the scouting for the rest but there aint no hurry for us to begin that till we are on shore  look at us nat grumbled in jamess ear as the boats started down the lake there we are rowing along the middle instead of sneaking along close to the shore does parker think that the redskins are as blind as he is and that cause its night a lot of big boats like these cant be seen out in the middle of the lake i tell you captain if we aint ambushed as soon as we land i will grant i know nothing of redskin ways  james had in fact before starting suggested to colonel parker that it would be well to keep under the shelter of the bushes but the officer had replied stiffly  when i want your advice captain walsham i will ask for it  after which rebuff james was more willing than he had hitherto been to act in accordance with the advice of the scout accordingly as they rowed down the lake the boats with the royal scouts although keeping up with the others maintained their position in the rear of the column  towards daybreak the boats heads were turned to shore and when they neared it colonel parker gave the order for the men to lay in their oars while the three boats which happened to be in advance were told to advance at once and land the boats passed through the thick curtain of trees which hung down over the waters edge a minute passed and then three others were ordered to follow them  did you hear nothing nat whispered to james  no i didnt hear anything nat did you  well i think i did hear something captain it seems to me as i heard a sort of scuffle  but they never could surprise some thirty or forty men without the alarm being given  it depended what sort of men they were nat said scornfully they wouldnt surprise men that knew their business but those chaps would just jump out of their boats as if they was landed on a quay at new york and would scatter about among the bushes why lord bless you the indians might ambush and tomahawk the lot before they had time to think of opening their lips to give a shout  the second three boats had now disappeared among the trees and colonel parker gave the word for the rest to advance in a body  look to your firelocks lads james said whatever happens keep perfectly cool you at the oars especially sit still and be ready to obey orders  the boats were within fifty yards of the trees when from beneath the drooping boughs a volley of musketry was poured out and a moment later a swarm of canoes darted out from beneath the branches and the terrible indian war whoop rang in the air  appalled by the suddenness of the attack by the deadly fire and the terrible yells the greater portion of the men in the boats were seized with the wildest panic many of them jumped into the water others threw themselves down in the bottom of the boats some tried to row but were impeded by their comrades  steady men steady james shouted at the top of his voice get the boats heads round and keep together we can beat off these canoes easy enough if you do but keep your heads  his orders were obeyed promptly and coolly by the men of his company the boats were turned with their heads to the lake as the canoes came dashing up and the men who were not employed in rowing fired so steadily and truly that the redskins in several of the leading canoes fell upsetting their boats  dont hurry james shouted there is no occasion for haste they can go faster than we can all we have got to do is to beat them off lay in all the oars except the two bow oars in each boat all the rest of the men stand to their arms and let the boats follow each other in file the bow of one close to the stern of that ahead  the check which the volley had given to the canoes gave time to the men in several of the boats close to those of the scouts to turn they were rowing past jamess slowlymoving boats when he shouted to them  steady men your only chance of escape is to show a front to them as we are doing they can overtake you easily and will row you down one after the other fall in ahead of our line and do as we are doing you need not be afraid we could beat them off if they were ten times as many  reassured by the calmness with which james issued his orders the boats took up the positions assigned to them james who was in the last boat in the line shuddered at the din going on behind him the yells of the indians the screams and cries of the provincials mingled with the sharp crack of rifles or the duller sound of the musket the work of destruction was soon over save his own company and some fifty of the provincials in the boats ahead the whole of colonel parkers force had been killed or were prisoners in the hands of the indians who having finished their work set off in pursuit of the boats which had escaped them  james at once changed the order the front boat was halted and the others formed in a line beside it presenting the broad side to the approaching fleet of canoes when the latter came within a hundred yards a stream of fire opened from the boats the men aiming with the greatest coolness  the canoes were checked at once a score of the paddlers had sunk killed or wounded into the bottom and several of the frail barks were upset as fast as the men could load they continued their fire and in two minutes from the first shot the canoes were turned and paddled at full speed towards the shore pursued by a hearty cheer from the english the oars were then manned again and the remains of parkers flotilla rowed up the lake to fort william henry  several of the prisoners taken by the indians were cooked and eaten by them a few days afterwards a party of indians following the route from the head of lake champlain made a sudden attack on the houses round fort edward and killed thirtytwo men  it was an imposing spectacle as the french expedition made its way down lake george general levis had marched by the side of the lake with twentyfive hundred men canadians regulars and redskins while the main body proceeded the troops in two hundred and fifty large boats the redskins in many hundreds of their canoes  the boats moved in military order there were six regiments of french line la reine and languedoc la sarre and guienne bearn and roussillon the cannons were carried on platforms formed across two boats slowly and regularly the procession of boats made its way down the lake till they saw the signal fires of levis who with his command was encamped near the water at a distance of two miles from the fort even then the english were not aware that near eight thousand enemies were gathered close to them monro was a brave soldier but wholly unfitted for the position he held knowing nothing of irregular warfare and despising all but trained soldiers  at daybreak all was bustle at fort henry parties of men went out to drive in the cattle others to destroy buildings which would interfere with the fire from the fort the english position was now more defensible than it had been when it was attacked in the spring the forest had been cleared for a considerable distance round and the buildings which had served as a screen to the enemy had for the most part been removed the fort itself lay close down by the edge of the water one side and the rear were protected by the marsh so that it could only be attacked from one side beyond the marsh lay the rough ground where johnson had encamped two years before while on a flat hill behind this was an entrenched camp beyond which again was another marsh  as soon as the sun rose the column of levis moved through the forest towards the fort followed by montcalm with the main body while the artillery boats put out from behind the point which had hid them from the sight of the english and surrounded by hundreds of indian canoes moved slowly forward opening fire as they went soon the sound of firing broke out near the edge of the forest all round the fort as the indians with levis opened fire upon the soldiers who were endeavouring to drive in the cattle  hitherto james walsham with edwards and his two scouts was standing quietly watching the approaching fleet of boats and canoes nat expressing in no measured terms his utter disgust at the confusion which reigned in and around the fort  it looks more like a frontier settlement suddenly surprised he said than a place filled with soldiers who have been for weeks expecting an attack nothing done nothing ready the cattle all over the place the tents on that open ground there still standing stores all about in the open of all the pigheaded obstinate ignorant old gentlemen i ever see the colonel beats them all one might as well have an old woman in command indeed i know scores of old women on the frontier who would have been a deal better here than him  but if monro was obstinate and prejudiced he was brave cool and determined and now that the danger had come he felt secure of his ground and took the proper measures for defence moving calmly about and abating the disposition to panic by the calm manner in which he gave his orders nat had scarcely finished his grumbling when the colonel approached  captain walsham he said you will take your company at once and cover the parties driving in the cattle you will fall back with them and when you see all in safety retire into the intrenched camp  the company were already under arms waiting for orders and at the double james led them up the sloping ground towards the forest whence the war whoops of the indians and the sharp cracks of the rifles were now ringing out on all sides james made for the spot where a score of soldiers were driving a number of cattle before them some hurrying the beasts on across the rough ground others firing at the indians who as their numbers increased were boldly showing themselves behind the trees and advancing in pursuit  as soon as they neared the spot james scattered his men in skirmishing order each placed himself behind one of the blackened stumps of the roughlycleared forest and opened fire upon the indians several of these fell and the rest bounded back to the forest whence they opened a heavy fire  now the company showed the advantage of the training they had gone through fighting with the greatest steadiness and coolness and keeping well in shelter until when the soldiers and cattle had got well on their way towards the fort james gave the order to fall back and the band crawling among the stumps and pausing to fire at every opportunity made their way back without having lost a man although several had received slight wounds    chapter 16 the massacre at fort william henry   when the skirmishing round fort henry was over la corne with a body of indians occupied the road that led to fort edward and levis encamped close by to support him and check any sortie the english might make from their intrenched camp montcalm reconnoitred the position he had at first intended to attack and carry the intrenched camp but he found that it was too strong to be taken by a rush he therefore determined to attack the fort itself by regular approaches from the western side while the force of levis would intercept any succour which might come from fort edward and cut off the retreat of the garrison in that direction he gave orders that the cannon were to be disembarked at a small cove about half a mile from the fort and near this he placed his main camp he now sent one of his aidesdecamp with a letter to monro  i owe it to humanity he said to summon you to surrender at present i can restrain the savages and make them observe the terms of a capitulation but i might not have the power to do so under other circumstances and an obstinate defence on your part could only retard the capture of the place a few days and endanger the unfortunate garrison which cannot be relieved in consequence of the dispositions i have made i demand a decisive answer within an hour  monro replied simply that he and his soldiers would defend themselves till the last  the trenches were opened on the night of the 4th the work was extremely difficult the ground being covered with hard stumps of trees and fallen trunks all night long 800 men toiled at the work while the guns of the fort kept up a constant fire of round shot and grape but by daybreak the first parallel was made the battery on the left was nearly finished and one on the right begun the men were now working under shelter and the guns of the fort could do them little harm  while the french soldiers worked the indians crept up through the fallen trees close to the fort and fired at any of the garrison who might for a moment expose themselves sharpshooters in the fort replied to their fire and all day the fort was fringed with light puffs of smoke whilst the cannon thundered unceasingly the next morning the french battery on the left opened with eight heavy cannon and a mortar and on the following morning the battery on the right joined in with eleven other pieces  the fort only mounted in all seventeen cannon for the most part small and as some of them were upon the other faces the english fire although kept up with spirit could reply but weakly to that of the french the fort was composed of embankments of gravel surmounted by a rampart of heavy logs laid in tiers crossing each other the interstices filled with earth and this could ill support the heavy cannonade to which it was exposed the roar of the distant artillery continuing day after day was plainly audible at fort edward but although monro had at the commencement of the attack sent off several messengers asking for reinforcements webb did not move  on the third day of the siege he had received 2000 men from new york and by stripping all the forts below he could have advanced with 4500 men but some deserters from the french told him that montcalm had 12000 men and webb considered the task of advancing through the intervening forests and defiles between him and fort henry far too dangerous an operation to be attempted undoubtedly it would have been a dangerous one for the indians pervaded the woods as far as fort edward no messenger could have got through to inform monro of his coming and montcalm could therefore have attacked him on the march with the greater part of his force still a brave and determined general would have made the attempt webb did not do so but left monro to his fate  he even added to its certainty by sending off a letter to him telling him that he could do nothing to assist him and advising him to surrender at once the messenger was killed by the indians in the forest and the note taken to montcalm who learning that webb did not intend to advance was able to devote his whole attention to the fort montcalm kept the letter for several days till the english rampart was half battered down and then sent it in by an officer to monro hoping that it would induce the latter to surrender the old soldier however remained firm in his determination to hold out even though his position was now absolutely hopeless the trenches had been pushed forward until within 250 yards of the fort and the indians crept up almost to the wall on this side  two sorties were madeone from the fort the other from the intrenched camp but both were repulsed with loss more than 300 of the defenders had been killed and wounded smallpox was raging and the casemates were crowded with sick all their large cannon had been burst or disabled and only seven small pieces were fit for service the french battery in the foremost trench was almost completed and when this was done the whole of montcalms thirtyone cannon and fifteen mortars would open fire and as a breach had already been effected in the wall further resistance would have been madness  on the night of the 8th it was known in the fort that a council of war would be held in the morning and that undoubtedly the fort would surrender  james with his company had after escorting the cattle to the fort crossed the marsh to the intrenched camp as the fort was already crowded with troops the company therefore avoided the horrors of the siege when the report circulated that a surrender would probably be made the next morning nat went to james  what are you going to do captain  do nat why i have nothing to do if monro and his council decide to surrender there is an end of it you dont propose that our company is to fight montcalms army alone do you  no i dont nat said testily there has been a deal too much fighting already i understand holding out till the last when theres a hope of somebody coming to relieve you but whats the use of fighting and getting a lot of your men killed and raising the blood of those redskin devils to boiling point if the colonel had given up the place at once we should have saved a loss of 300 men and montcalm would have been glad enough to let us march off to fort edward  but probably he will agree to let us do that now james said  he may agree nat said contemptuously but how about the redskins do you think that after losing a lot of their braves they are going to see us march quietly away and go home without a scalp i tell you captain i know redskin nature and as sure as the sun rises tomorrow there will be a massacre and i for one aint going to lay down my rifle and let the first redskin as takes a fancy to my scalp tomahawk me  well but what do you propose nat  well captain i have heard you say yours is an independent command and that you can act with the company wherever you like while you are here i know you are under the orders of the colonel but if you had chosen to march away on any expedition of your own you could have done it  that is so nat but now the siege is once begun i dont know that i should be justified in marching away even if i could  but they are going to surrender i tell you nat insisted i dont see as how it can be your duty to hand over your company to the french if you can get them clear away so as to fight for the king again  what do you say edwards james asked his lieutenant  i dont see why we shouldnt march away if we could edwards said now that the game is quite lost here i dont think anyone could blame you for saving the company if possible and i agree with nat that montcalm will find it difficult if not impossible to keep his indians in hand the french have never troubled much on that score  well nat what is your plan james asked after a pause  the plan is simple enough nat said there aint no plan at all all we have got to do is to march quietly down to the lake to take some of the canoes that are hauled up at the mouth of the swamp and to paddle quietly off keeping under the trees on the righthand side there aint many redskins in the woods that way and the night is as dark as pitch we can land eight or ten miles down the lake and then march away to the right so as to get clean round the redskins altogether  very well nat i will do it james said its a chance but i think its a better chance than staying here and if i should get into a row about it i cant help it i am doing it for the best  the corps were quietly mustered and marched out through the gate of the intrenchments on the side of the lake no questions were asked for the corps had several times gone out on its own account and driven back the indians and french pickets the men had from their first arrival at the fort laid aside their heavy boots and taken to moccasins as being better fitted for silent movement in the forest therefore not a sound was heard as under nats guidance they made their way down the slope into the swamp  here they were halted for the moment and told to move with the greatest care and silence and to avoid snapping a bough or twig this however was the less important as the cannon on both sides were still firing and a constant rattle of musketry was going on round the fort  presently they reached the point where the canoes were hauled up and were told off three to a canoe  follow my canoe in single file james said not a word is to be spoken and remember that a single splash of a paddle will bring the redskins down upon us likely enough there may be canoes out upon the lakethere are sure to be indians in the wood  i dont think theres much fear captain nat whispered theres no tiring a redskin when hes out on the scout on his own account but when hes acting with the whites hes just as lazy as a hog and as they must be sure the fort cant hold out many hours longer they will be too busy feasting and counting the scalps they mean to take to think much about scouting tonight  we shall go very slowly let every man stop paddling the instant the canoe ahead of him stops were jamess last instructions as he stepped into the stern of a canoe while nat and jonathan took the paddles edwards was to take his place in the last canoe in the line  without the slightest sound the canoes paddled out into the lake and then made for the east shore they were soon close to the trees and slowly and noiselessly they kept their way just outside the screen afforded by the boughs drooping down almost into the water only now and then the slightest splash was to be heard along the line and this might well have been taken for the spring of a tiny fish feeding  several times when he thought he heard a slight sound in the forest on his right nat ceased paddling and lay for some minutes motionless the canoes behind doing the same so dark was it that they could scarce see the trees close beside them while the bright flashes from the guns from fort and batteries only seemed to make the darkness more intense it was upwards of an hour before james felt from the greater speed with which the canoe was travelling that nat believed that he had got beyond the spot where any indians were likely to be watching in the forest  faster and faster the boat glided along but the scouts were still far from rowing their hardest for although the whole of the men were accustomed to the use of the paddle the other boats would be unable to keep up with that driven by the practised arms of the leaders of the file after paddling for another hour and a half the scout stopped  we are far enough away now nat said there aint no chance in the world of any redskins being in the woods so far out as this the hope of scalps will have taken them all down close to the fort we can land safely now  the word was passed down the line of canoes the boats glided through the screen of foliage and the men landed  better pull the canoes ashore captain if we left them in the water one might break adrift and float out beyond the trees some redskin or other would make it out and we should have a troop of them on our trail before an hour had passed  theres no marching through the forest now nat james said i cant see my own hand close to my face  thats so captain and wed best halt till daylight i could make my way along easy enough but some of these fellows would be pitching over stumps or catching their feet in a creeper and like enough letting off their pieces as they went down we may just as well stay where we are they aint likely to miss us even in the camp and sartin the redskins cant have known we have gone so theres no chance whatever of pursuit and there aint nothing to be gained by making haste  james gave the order the men felt about till each found a space of ground sufficiently large to lie down upon and soon all were asleep except the two scouts who said at once that they would watch by turns till daylight  as soon as it was sufficiently light to see in the forest the band were again in motion they made due east until they crossed the trail leading from the head of lake champlain to fort edward kept on for another hour and then turning to the south made in the direction of albany for it would have been dangerous to approach fort edward round which the indians were sure to be scattered thickly  for the first two hours after starting the distant roar of the guns had gone on unceasingly then it suddenly stopped  they have hoisted the white flag edwards said it is all over thank god we are well out of it i dont mind fighting walsham but to be massacred by those indians is a hideous idea  i am glad we are out of it too james agreed but i cannot think that montcalm with so large a force of french regulars at his command will allow those fiendish indians to massacre the prisoners  i hope not edwards said it will be a disgrace indeed to him and his officers if he does but you know what the indians are better than i do and you have heard nats opinion you see if montcalm were to use force against the indians the whole of them would go off and then there would be an end to any hope of the french beating the colonists in the long run montcalm darent break with them its a horrible position for an officer and a gentleman to be placed in montcalm did manage to prevent the redskins from massacring the garrison of oswego but it was as much as he could do and it will be ten times as difficult now that their blood is up with this week of hard fighting and the loss of many of their warriors anyhow i am glad i am out of it even if the bigwigs consider we had no right to leave the fort and break us for it i would rather lose my commission than run the risk of being massacred in cold blood  james agreed with him  for two days they continued their march through the forest using every precaution against surprise they saw however nothing of the enemy and emerged from the forest on the evening of the second days march at a distance of a few miles from albany  they had not reached that town many hours when they learned that nats sombre predictions had been fulfilled the council of war in the fort agreed that further resistance was impossible and lieutenant colonel young went out with a white flag to arrange the terms of surrender with montcalm it was agreed that the english troops should march out with the honours of war and be escorted to fort edward by a detachment of french troops that they should not serve for eighteen months and that all french prisoners captured in america since the war began should be given up within three months the stores ammunition and artillery were to be handed over to the french except one field piece which the garrison were to be allowed to retain in recognition of their brave defence  before signing the capitulation montcalm summoned the indian chiefs before him and asked them to consent to the conditions and to restrain their young braves from any disorder they gave their approval and promised to maintain order  the garrison then evacuated the fort and marched to join their comrades in the intrenched camp no sooner had they moved out than a crowd of indians rushed into the fort through the breach and embrasures and butchered all the wounded who had been left behind to be cared for by the french having committed this atrocity the indians and many of the canadians rushed up to the intrenched camp where the english were now collected the french guards who had been stationed there did nothing to keep them out and they wandered about threatening and insulting the terrified women telling the men that everyone should be massacred and plundering the baggage  montcalm did his best by entreaty to restrain the indians but he took no steps whatever to give effectual protection to the prisoners and that he did not do so will remain an ineffaceable blot upon his fame seeing the disposition of the redskins he should have ordered up all the regular french troops and marched the english garrison under their protection to fort edward in accordance with the terms of surrender and he should have allowed the english troops to again fill their pouches with cartridge by which means they would have been able to fight in their own defence  the next morning the english marched at daybreak seventeen wounded men were left behind in the huts having been in accordance with the agreement handed over to the charge of a french surgeon but as he was not there in the morning the regimental surgeon miles whitworth remained with them attending to their wants the french surgeon had caused special sentinels to be placed for their protection but these were now removed when they were needed most  at five in the morning the indians entered the huts dragged out the inmates tomahawked and scalped them before the eyes of whitworth and in the presence of la corne and other canadian officers as well as of a french guard stationed within forty feet of the spotnone of whom as whitworth declared on oath did anything to protect the wounded men  the indians in the meantime had begun to plunder the baggage of the column monro complained to the officers of the french escort that the terms of the capitulation were broken but the only answer was that he had better give up all the baggage to the indians to appease them but it had no effect in restraining the passion of the indians they rushed upon the column snatching caps coats and weapons from men and officers tomahawking all who resisted and seizing upon shrieking women and children carried them away or murdered them on the spot a rush was made upon the new hampshire men at the rear of the column and eighty of them were killed or carried away  the canadian officers did nothing at all to try to assuage the fury of the indians and the officers of the canadian detachment which formed the advance guard of the french escort refused any protection to the men telling them they had better take to the woods and shift for themselves montcalm and the principal french officers did everything short of the only effectual step namely the ordering up of the french regular troops to save the english they ran about among the yelling indians imploring them to desist but in vain  some seven or eight hundred of the english were seized and carried off by the savages while some seventy or eighty were massacred on the spot the column attempted no resistance none had ammunition and of the colonial troops very few were armed with bayonets had any resistance been offered there can be no doubt all would have been massacred by the indians  many of the fugitives ran back to the fort and took refuge there and montcalm recovered from the indians more than four hundred of those they had carried off these were all sent under a strong guard to fort edward the greater part of the survivors of the column dispersed into the woods and made their way in scattered parties to fort edward here cannon had been fired at intervals to serve as a guide to the fugitives but many no doubt perished in the woods on the morning after the massacre the indians left in a body for montreal taking with them two hundred prisoners to be tortured and murdered on their return to their villages  few events cast a deeper disgrace on the arms of france than this massacre committed in defiance of their pledged honour for the safety of their prisoners and in sight of four thousand french troops not a man of whom was set in motion to prevent it these facts are not taken only from english sources but from the letters of french officers and from the journal of the jesuit roubaud who was in charge of the christianized indians who according to his own account were no less ferocious and cruel than the unconverted tribes the number of those who perished in the massacre is uncertain captain jonathan carver a colonial officer puts the killed and captured at 1500 a french writer whose work was published at montreal says that they were all killed except seven hundred who were captured but this is of course a gross exaggeration general levis and roubaud who were certain to have made the best of the matter acknowledged that they saw some fifty corpses scattered on the ground but this does not include those murdered in the fort and camp  probably the total number killed was about two hundred and besides these must be counted the two hundred prisoners carried off to be tortured by the indians the greater portion of these were purchased from the indians in exchange for rum by vaudreuil the governor at montreal but to the eternal disgrace of this man he suffered many of them to be carried off and did not even interfere when publicly in the sight of the whole town the indians murdered some of the prisoners and not content with eating them themselves forced their comrades to partake of the flesh bougainville one of the aidesdecamp of montcalm was present and testified to the fact and the story is confirmed by the intendant bigot a friend of the governor  the ferocity of the indians cost them dear they had dug up and scalped the corpses in the graveyard of fort william henry many of these had died of smallpox and the savages took the infection home to their villages where great numbers perished of the disease  as soon as their indian allies had left the french soldiers were set to work demolishing the english fort and the operation was completed by the destruction by fire of the remains the army then returned to crown point  in view of the gross breach of the articles of capitulation by the french the english government refused also to be bound by it and the french prisoners in their hands were accordingly retained  colonel monro himself was one of those who survived he had made his way through the savages back to the fort to demand that the protection of the french troops should be given to the soldiers and so escaped the massacre  upon his arrival at albany james reported to the officer in command there the reason which had induced him to quit the fort with his company these reasons were approved of but the officer advised james to send in a written report to general webb and to march at once to fort edward and place himself under that officers directions  when he reached the fort the fugitives were coming in from the woods james at once reported himself to the general and handed in his written statement at the same time he gave his reasons in a few words for the course he had taken webb was far too much excited by the news of the terrible events which had taken place and for which as he could not but be aware he would be to some extent held responsible by public opinion for having refused to move to monros assistance to pay much attention to the young officers statement  you were quite right sir quite right to carry off your command he said hastily thank god there are so many the fewer of his majestys troops sacrificed you will please take your company out at once into the woods they are accustomed to the work which is more than any of my troops here are divide them into four parties and let them scour the forest and bring in such of the fugitives as they can find let them take as much provisions and rum as they can carry for many of the fugitives will be starving  james executed his orders and during the next five days sent in a considerable number of exhausted men who hopelessly lost in the woods must have perished unless they had been discovered by his party  had montcalm marched direct upon fort edward he could doubtless have captured it for the fall of fort william henry had so scared webb that he would probably have retreated the moment he heard the news of montcalms advance although within a day or two of the fall of the fort many thousands of colonial militia had arrived as soon however as it was known that montcalm had retired the militia who were altogether unsupplied with the means of keeping the field returned to their homes  loudon on his way back from the unsuccessful expedition against louisbourg received the news of the calamity at fort william henry he returned too late to do anything to retrieve that disaster and determined in the spring to take the offensive by attacking ticonderoga this had been left on the retirement of montcalm with a small garrison commanded by captain hepecourt who during the winter was continually harassed by the corps of captain rogers and james walshams scouts  toward the spring receiving reinforcements hepecourt caught rogers and a hundred and eighty men in an ambush and killed almost all of them rogers himself and some twenty or thirty men alone escaping  in the spring there was a fresh change of plans the expedition against ticonderoga was given up as another attempt at louisbourg was about to be made the english government were determined that the disastrous delays which had caused the failure of the last expedition should not be repeated loudon was recalled and to general abercromby the second in command was intrusted the charge of the forces in the colonies colonel amherst was raised to the rank of major general and appointed to command the expedition from england against louisbourg having under him brigadier generals whitmore lawrence and wolfe before the winter was ended two fleets put to sea the one under admiral boscawen was destined for louisbourg while the other under admiral osborne sailed for the straits of gibraltar to intercept the french fleet of admiral la clue which was about to sail from toulon for america  at the same time sir edward hawke with seven ships of the line and three frigates sailed for rochefort where a french squadron with a fleet of transports with troops for america were lying  the two latter expeditions were perfectly successful osborne prevented la clue from leaving the mediterranean hawke drove the enemys vessels ashore at rochefort and completely broke up the expedition thus canada at the critical period when the english were preparing to strike a great blow at her was cut off from all assistance from the mother country and left to her own resources  as before halifax was the spot where the troops from the colonies were to meet the fleet from england and the troops who came out under their convoy and here on the 28th of may the whole expedition was collected the colonies had again been partially stripped of their defenders and five hundred provincial rangers accompanied the regulars james walshams corps was left for service on the frontier while the regiments to which they belonged sailed with the force destined for the siege of louisbourg  this fortress stood at the mouth of a landlocked bay on the stormy coast of cape breton since the peace of aix la chapelle vast sums had been spent in repairing and strengthening it and it was by far the strongest fortress in english or french america the circuit of its fortifications was more than a mile and a half and the town contained about four thousand inhabitants the garrison consisted of the battalions of artois bourgogne cambis and volontaires etrangers with two companies of artillery and twentyfour of colonial troops in all three thousand and eighty men besides officers in the harbour lay five ships of the line and seven frigates carrying five hundred and fortyfour guns and about three thousand men and there were two hundred and nineteen cannons and seventeen mortars mounted on the ramparts and outworks and fortyfour in reserve  of the outworks the strongest were the grand battery at lighthouse point at the mouth of the harbour and that on goat island a rocky islet at its entrance the strongest front of the works was on the land side across the base of the triangular peninsula on which the town stood this front twelve hundred yards in extent reached from the sea on the left to the harbour on the right and consisted of four strong bastions with connecting works  the best defence of louisbourg however was the craggy shore which for leagues on either side was accessible only at a few points and even there a landing could only be effected with the greatest difficulty all these points were watched for an english squadron of nine ships of war had been cruising off the place endeavouring to prevent supplies from arriving but they had been so often blown off by gales that the french ships had been able to enter and on the 2nd of june when the english expedition came in sight more than a years supply of provisions was stored up in the town    chapter 17 louisbourg and ticonderoga   all eyes in the fleet were directed towards the rocky shore of gabarus bay a flat indentation some three miles across its eastern extremity white point being a mile to the west of louisbourg the sea was rough and the white masses of surf were thrown high up upon the face of the rock along the coast as far as the eye could reach  a more difficult coast on which to effect a landing could not have been selected there were but three points where boats could even in fine weather get to shorenamely white point flat point and fresh water cove to cover these the french had erected several batteries and as soon as the english fleet was in sight they made vigorous preparations to repel a landing  boats were at once lowered in order to make a reconnaissance of the shore generals amherst lawrence and wolfe all took part in it and a number of naval officers in their boats daringly approached the shore to almost within musket shot when they returned in the afternoon they made their reports to the admiral and these reports all agreed with his own opinionnamely that there was but little chance of success one naval captain alone an old officer named fergusson advised the admiral to hold no council of war but to take the responsibility on himself and to make the attempt at all risks  why admiral he said the very children at home would laugh at us if for a second time we sailed here with an army and then sailed away again without landing a man  so they would fergusson so they would the admiral said if i have to stop here till winter i wont go till i have carried out my orders and put the troops ashore  in addition to the three possible landing places already named was one to the east of the town named lorambec and it was determined to send a regiment to threaten a landing at this place while the army formed into three divisions were to threaten the other points and effect a landing at one or all of them if it should be found possible  on the next day however the 3rd of june the surf was so high that nothing could be attempted on the 4th there was a thick fog and a gale and the frigate trent struck on a rock and some of the transports were nearly blown on shore the sea was very heavy and the vessels rolled tremendously at their anchors most of the troops suffered terribly from seasickness  the next day the weather continued thick and stormy on the 6th there was fog but towards noon the wind went down whereupon the signal was made the boats were lowered and the troops took their places in them scarcely had they done so when the wind rose again and the sea got up so rapidly that the landing was postponed  the next day the fog and heavy surf continued but in the evening the sea grew calmer and orders were issued for the troops to take to the boats at two oclock next morning this was done and the frigates got under sail and steered for the four points at which the real or pretended attacks were to be made and anchoring within easy range opened fire soon after daylight while the boats in three divisions rowed towards the shore  the division under wolfe consisted of twelve companies of grenadiers with the light infantry frasers highlanders and the new england rangers fresh water cove was a crescentshaped beach a quarter of a mile long with rocks at each end on the shore above lay 1000 frenchmen under lieutenant colonel de saint julien with eight cannons on swivels planted to sweep every part of the beach the intrenchments behind which the troops were lying were covered in front by spruce and fir trees felled and laid on the ground with the tops outward  not a shot was fired until the english boats approached the beach then from behind the leafy screen a deadly storm of grape and musketry was poured upon them it was clear at once that to advance would be destruction and wolfe waved his hand as a signal to the boats to sheer off  on the right of the line and but little exposed to the fire were three boats of the light infantry under lieutenants hopkins and brown and ensign grant who mistaking the signal or wilfully misinterpreting it dashed for the shore directly before them it was a hundred yards or so east of the beacha craggy coast lashed by the breakers but sheltered from the cannon by a small projecting point  the three young officers leapt ashore followed by their men major scott who commanded the light infantry and rangers was in the next boat and at once followed the others putting his boats head straight to the shore the boat was crushed to pieces against the rocks some of the men were drowned but the rest scrambled up the rocks and joined those who had first landed they were instantly attacked by the french and half of the little party were killed or wounded before the rest of the division could come to their assistance  some of the boats were upset and others stove in but most of the men scrambled ashore and as soon as he landed wolfe led them up the rocks where they formed in compact order and carried with the bayonet the nearest french battery  the other divisions seeing that wolfe had effected a landing came rapidly up and as the french attention was now distracted by wolfes attack on the left amherst and lawrence were able to land at the other end of the beach and with their divisions attacked the french on the right  these assaulted on both sides and fearing to be cut off from the town abandoned their cannon and fled into the woods some seventy of them were taken prisoners and fifty killed the rest made their way through the woods and marshes to louisbourg and the french in the other batteries commanding the landing places seeing that the english were now firmly established on the shore also abandoned the positions and retreated to the town  general amherst established the english camp just beyond the range of the cannon on the ramparts and the fleet set to work to land guns and stores at flat point cove for some days this work went on but so violent was the surf that more than a hundred boats were stove in in accomplishing it and none of the siege guns could be landed till the 18th while the sailors were so engaged the troops were busy making roads and throwing up redoubts to protect their position  wolfe with 1200 men made his way right round the harbour and took possession of the battery at lighthouse point which the french had abandoned planted guns and mortars there and opened fire on the battery on the islet which guarded the entrance to the harbour while other batteries were raised at different points along the shore and opened fire upon the french ships these replied and the artillery duel went on night and day until on the 25th the battery on the islet was silenced leaving a portion of his force in the batteries he had erected wolfe returned to the main army in front of the town  in the meantime amherst had not been idle day and night a thousand men had been employed making a covered road across a swamp to a hillock less than half a mile from the ramparts the labour was immense and the troops worked knee deep in mud and water  when wolfe had silenced the battery on the islet the way was open for the english fleet to enter and engage the ships and town from the harbour but the french took advantage of a dark and foggy night and sank six ships across the entrance  on the 25th the troops had made the road to the hillock and began to fortify themselves there under a heavy fire from the french while on the left towards the sea about a third of a mile from the princesss bastion wolfe with a strong detachment began to throw up a redoubt  on the night of the 9th of july 600 french troops sallied out and attacked this work the english though fighting desperately were for a time driven back but being reinforced they drove the french back into the town  each day the english lines drew closer to the town the french frigate echo under cover of a fog had been sent to quebec for aid but she was chased and captured the frigate arethuse on the night of the 14th of july was towed through the obstructions at the mouth of the harbour and passing through the english ships in a fog succeeded in getting away only five vessels of the french fleet now remained in the harbour and these were but feebly manned as 2000 of the officers and seamen had landed and were encamped in the town  on the afternoon of the 16th a party of english led by wolfe suddenly dashed forward and driving back a company of french seized some rising ground within three hundred yards of the ramparts and began to intrench themselves there all night the french kept up a furious fire at the spot but by morning the english had completed their intrenchment and from this point pushed on until they had reached the foot of the glacis  on the 21st the french man of war celebre was set on fire by the explosion of a shell the wind blew the flames into the rigging of two of her consorts and these also caught fire and the three ships burned to the waters edge several fires were occasioned in the town and the english guns of which a great number were now in position kept up a storm of fire night and day  on the night of the 23rd six hundred english sailors silently rowed into the harbour cut the cables of the two remaining french men of war and tried to tow them out one however was aground for the tide was low the sailors therefore set her on fire and then towed her consort out of the harbour amidst a storm of shot and shell from the french batteries  the french position was now desperate only four cannon on the side facing the english batteries were fit for service the masonry of the ramparts was shaken and the breaches were almost complete a fourth of the garrison were in hospital and the rest were worn out by toil every house in the place was shattered by the english artillery and there was no shelter either for the troops or the inhabitants  on the 26th the last french cannon was silenced and a breach effected in the wall and the french unable longer to resist hung out the white flag they attempted to obtain favourable conditions but boscawen and amherst insisted upon absolute surrender and the french wholly unable to resist further accepted the terms  thus fell the great french stronghold on cape breton the defence had been a most gallant one and drucour the governor although he could not save the fortress had yet delayed the english so long before the walls that it was too late in the season now to attempt an attack on canada itself  wolfe indeed urged that an expedition should at once be sent against quebec but boscawen was opposed to this owing to the lateness of the season and amherst was too slow and deliberate by nature to determine suddenly on the enterprise he however sailed with six regiments for boston to reinforce abercromby at lake george  wolfe carried out the orders of the general to destroy the french settlements on the gulf of saint lawrencea task most repugnant to his humane nature after this had been accomplished he sailed for england  when amherst had sailed with his expedition to the attack of louisbourg he had not left the colonists in so unprotected a state as they had been in the preceding year they on their part responded nobly to the call from england that a large force should be put in the field the home government had promised to supply arms ammunition tents and provisions and to make a grant towards the pay and clothing of the soldiers  massachusetts as usual responded most freely and loyally to the demand she had already incurred a very heavy debt by her efforts in the war and had supplied 2500 mena portion of whom had gone with amherstbut she now raised 7000 more whom she paid maintained and clothed out of her own resources thus placing in the field onefourth of her ablebodied men connecticut made equal sacrifices although less exposed to danger of invasion while new hampshire sent out onethird of her ablebodied men  in june the combined british and provincial force under abercromby gathered on the site of fort william henry the force consisted of 6367 officers and soldiers of the regular army and 9054 colonial troops  abercromby himself was an infirm and incapable man who owed his position to political influence the real command was in the hands of brigadier general lord howea most energetic and able officer who had during the past year thoroughly studied forest warfare and had made several expeditions with the scouting parties of rogers and other frontier leaders he was a strict disciplinarian but threw aside all the trammels of the traditions of the service he made both officers and men dress in accordance with the work they had before them all had to cut their hair close to wear leggings to protect them from the briars and to carry in their knapsacks thirty pounds of meal which each man had to cook for himself the coats of both the regulars and provincials were cut short at the waist and no officer or private was allowed to carry more than one blanket and a bear skin  howe himself lived as simply and roughly as his men the soldiers were devoted to their young commander and were ready to follow him to the death  thats something like a man for a general nat said enthusiastically as he marched with the royal scouts past the spot where lord howe was sitting on the ground eating his dinner with a pocket knife  i have never had much hope of doing anything before with the regulars in the forest but i do think this time we have got a chance of licking the french what do you say captain  it looks more hopeful nat certainly under loudon and webb things did not look very bright but this is a different sort of general altogether  on the evening of the 4th of july baggage stores and ammunition were all on board the boats and the whole army embarked at daybreak on the 5th it was indeed a magnificent sight as the flotilla started it consisted of 900 troop boats 135 whale boats and a large number of heavy flatboats carrying the artillery they were in three divisions the regulars in the centre the provincial troops on either flank  each corps had its flags and its music the day was fair and bright and as the flotilla swept on past the verdureclad hills with the sun shining brilliantly down on the bright uniforms and gay flags on the flash of oars and the glitter of weapons a fairer sight was seldom witnessed  at five in the afternoon they reached sabbath day point twentyfive miles down the lake where they halted some time for the baggage and artillery at eleven oclock they started again and by daybreak were nearing the outlet of the lake  an advanced party of the french were watching their movements and a detachment was seen near the shore at the spot where the french had embarked on the previous year the companies of rogers and james walsham landed and drove them off and by noon the whole army was on shore  the troops started in four columns but so dense was the forest so obstructed with undergrowth that they could scarcely make their way and after a time even the guides became confused in the labyrinth of trunks and boughs and the four columns insensibly drew near to each other  curiously the french advanced party 350 strong who had tried to retreat also became lost in the wood and not knowing where the english were in their wanderings again approached them as they did so lord howe who with major putnam and 200 rangers and scouts was at the head of the principal column suddenly came upon them a skirmish followed scarcely had it begun when lord howe dropped dead shot through the breast for a moment something like a panic seized the army who believed that they had fallen into an ambush and that montcalms whole force was upon them the rangers however fought steadily until rogers rangers and the royal scouts who were out in front came back and took the french in the rear only about 50 of these escaped 148 were captured and the rest killed or drowned in endeavouring to cross the rapids  the loss of the english was small in numbers but the death of howe inflicted an irreparable blow upon the army as major mante who was present wrote  in lord howe the soul of general abercrombys army seemed to expire from the unhappy moment that the general was deprived of his advice neither order nor discipline was observed and a strange kind of infatuation usurped the place of resolution  the loss of its gallant young general was indeed the destruction of an army of 15000 men abercromby seemed paralysed by the stroke and could do nothing and the soldiers were needlessly kept under arms all night in the forest and in the morning were ordered back to the landing place  at noon however bradstreet was sent out to take possession of the sawmill at the falls which montcalm had abandoned the evening before bradstreet rebuilt the two bridges which had been destroyed by the enemy and the army then advanced and in the evening occupied the deserted encampment of the french  montcalm had for some days been indecisive as to his course his force was little more than a fourth of that of the advancing foe he had for some time been aware of the storm which was preparing against him vaudreuil the governor had at first intended to send a body of canadians and indians under general levis down the valley of the mohawk to create a diversion but this scheme had been abandoned and instead of sending levis with his command to the assistance of montcalm he had kept them doing nothing at montreal  just about the hour lord howe was killed montcalm fell back with his force from his position by the falls and resolved to make a stand at the base of the peninsula on which ticonderoga stands the outline of the works had already been traced and the soldiers of the battalion of berry had made some progress in constructing them at daybreak just as abercromby was drawing his troops back to the landing place montcalms whole army set to work thousands of trees were hewn down and the trunks piled one upon another so as to form a massive breastwork the line followed the top of the ridge with many zigzags so that the whole front could be swept by a fire of musketry and grape the log wall was eight or nine feet high and the upper tier was formed of single logs in which notches were cut to serve as loopholes the whole space in front was cleared of trees for the distance of a musket shot the trees being felled so that their tops turned outwards forming an almost impenetrable obstacle while immediately in front of the log wall the ground was covered with heavy boughs overlapping and interlaced their points being sharpened this position was in fact absolutely impregnable against an attack in front by infantry  it was true that abercromby might have brought up his artillery and battered down the breastwork or he might have planted a battery on the heights which commanded the position or he might have marched a portion of his army through the woods and placed them on the road between ticonderoga and crown point and so have cut off the whole french army and forced them to surrender for they had but eight days provisions but howe was dead there was no longer leading or generalship and abercromby leaving his cannon behind him marched his army to make a direct attack on the french intrenchment  in the course of the night levis with 400 of his men arrived and the french were in readiness for the attack the battalions of la sarre and languedoc were posted on the left under bourlamaque berry and royal roussillon in the centre under montcalm la reine beam and guienne on the right under levis a detachment of volunteers occupied the low ground between the breastwork and the outlet of lake george while 450 canadian troops held an abattis on the side towards lake champlain where they were covered by the guns of the fort  until noon the french worked unceasingly to strengthen their position then a heavy fire broke out in front as the rangers and light infantry drove in their pickets as soon as the english issued from the wood they opened fire and then the regulars formed in columns of attack pushed forward across the rough ground with its maze of fallen trees they could see the top of the breastwork but not the men behind it and as soon as they were fairly entangled in the trees a terrific fire opened upon them the english pushed up close to the breastwork but they could not pass the bristling mass of sharpened branches which were swept by a terrific crossfire from the intrenchment after striving for an hour they fell back abercromby who had remained at the mill a mile and a half in the rear sent orders for them to attack again  never did the english fight with greater bravery six times did they advance to the attack but the task set them was impossible at five in the afternoon two english columns made an assault on the extreme right of the french and although montcalm hastened to the spot with his reserves they nearly succeeded in breaking through hewing their way right to the very foot of the breastwork and renewing the attack over and over again the highland regiment which led the column fighting with desperate valour and not retiring until its major and twentyfive of the officers were killed or wounded and half the men had fallen under the deadly fire  at six oclock another desperate attempt was made but in vain then the regulars fell back in disorder but for an hour and a half the provincials and rangers kept up a fire while their comrades removed the wounded abercromby had lost in killed wounded and missing 1944 officers and men while the loss of the french was 377  even now abercromby might have retrieved his repulse for with 13000 men still remaining against 3300 unwounded frenchmen he could still have easily forced them to surrender by planting cannons on the heights or by cutting off their communication and food  he did neither but at daybreak reembarked his army and retired with all speed down the lake montcalm soon received large reinforcements and sent out scouting parties one of these caught a party commanded by captain rogers in an ambush but were finally driven back with such heavy loss that from that time few scouting parties were sent out from ticonderoga  in october montcalm with the main portion of his army retired for the winter to montreal while the english fell back to albany  while abercromby was lying inactive at the head of lake george brigadier general forbes had advanced from virginia against fort duquesne and after immense labour and hardships succeeded in arriving at the fort which the french evacuated at his approach having burnt the barracks and storehouses and blown up the fortifications a stockade was formed and a fort afterwards built there this was called fort pitt and the place itself pittsburg a small garrison was left there and the army after having collected and buried the bones of braddocks men retired to virginia the general who though suffering terribly from disease had steadfastly carried out the enterprise in the face of enormous difficulties died shortly after the force returned to the settlements  another successful enterprise during the autumn had been the capture of fort frontenac and the gaining of a foothold by the english on lake ontario  thus the campaign of 1758 was on the whole disastrous to the french they had held their own triumphantly at ticonderoga but they had lost their great fortress of louisbourg their right had been forced back by the capture of fort duquesne and their line of communication cut by the destruction of fort frontenac    chapter 18 quebec   in the following spring the french prepared to resist the serious attack which they expected would be made by way of lake champlain and ontario but a greater danger was threatening them for in the midst of their preparations the news arrived from france that a great fleet was on its way from england to attack quebec the town was filled with consternation and surprise for the canadians had believed that the navigation of the saint lawrence was too difficult and dangerous for any hostile fleet to attempt their spirits rose however when a few days later a fleet of twentythree ships ladened with supplies from france sailed up the river  a day or two later the british fleet was at the mouth of the saint lawrence and the whole forces of the colony except three battalions posted at ticonderoga and a strong detachment placed so as to resist any hostile movement from lake ontario were mustered at quebec here were gathered five french battalions the whole of the canadian troops and militia and upwards of a thousand indians in all amounting to more than sixteen thousand  the position was an extremely strong one the main force was encamped on the high ground below quebec with their right resting on the saint charles river and the left on the montmorenci a distance of between seven and eight miles the front was covered by steep ground which rose nearly from the edge of the saint lawrence and the right was covered by the guns of the citadel of quebec a boom of logs chained together was laid across the mouth of the saint charles which was further guarded by two hulks mounted with cannon a bridge of boats crossing the river a mile higher up connected the city with the camp  all the gates of quebec except that of saint charles which faced the bridge were closed and barricaded a hundred and six cannon were mounted on the walls while a floating battery of twelve heavy pieces a number of gunboats and eight fire ships formed the river defences  the frigates which had convoyed the merchant fleet were taken higher up the river and a thousand of their seamen came down from quebec to man the batteries and gunboats  against this force of sixteen thousand men posted behind defensive works on a position almost impregnable by nature general wolfe was bringing less than nine thousand troops the steep and lofty heights that lined the river rendered the cannon of the ships useless to him and the exigencies of the fleet in such narrow and difficult navigation prevented the sailors being landed to assist the troops  a large portion of montcalms army indeed consisted of canadians who were of little use in the open field but could be trusted to fight well behind intrenchments  wolfe was unfortunately in extremely bad health when he was selected by pitt to command the expedition against quebec but under him were brigadier generals monckton townshend and murray all good officers  the fleet consisted of twentytwo ships of war with frigates and sloops and a great number of transports it was at first divided into three squadrons that under admiral durell sailed direct for the saint lawrence to intercept the ships from france but arrived at its destination a few days too late that of admiral holmes sailed for new york to take on board a portion of the army of amherst and abercromby that of admiral saunders sailed to louisbourg but finding the entrance blocked with ice went on to halifax where it was joined by the squadron with the troops from new york they then sailed again to louisbourg where they remained until the 6th of june 1759 and then joined durell at the mouth of the saint lawrence  wolfes force had been intended to be larger and should have amounted to fourteen thousand men but some regiments which were to have joined him from the west indies were at the last moment countermanded and amherst who no doubt felt some jealousy at the command of this important expedition being given to an officer who had served under his orders at the taking of louisbourg sent a smaller contingent of troops than had been expected  among the regiments which sailed was that of james walsham after the fight at ticonderoga in which upwards of half of his force had fallen the little corps had been broken up and the men had returned to duty with their regiments owing to the number of officers who had fallen james now stood high on the list of lieutenants he had had enough of scouting and was glad to return to the regiment his principal regret being that he had to part from his two trusty scouts  there was great joy in the regiment when the news was received that they were to go with the expedition against quebec they had formed part of wolfs division at louisbourg and like all who had served with him regarded with enthusiasm and confidence the leader whose frail body seemed wholly incapable of sustaining fatigue or hardship but whose indomitable spirit and courage placed him ever in the front and set an example which the bravest of his followers were proud to imitate  from time to time james had received letters from home communication was irregular but his mother and mr wilks wrote frequently and sometimes he received half a dozen letters at once he had now been absent from home for four years and his mother told him that he would scarcely recognize aggie who was now as tall as herself mrs walsham said that the girl was almost as interested as she was in his letters and in the despatches from the war in which his name had several times been mentioned in connection with the services rendered by his scouts  richard horton had twice during jamess absence returned home the squire mrs walsham said had received him very coolly in consequence of the letter he had written when james was pressed as a seaman and she said that aggie seemed to have taken a great objection to him she wondered indeed that he could stay an hour in the house after his reception there but he seemed as if he didnt notice it and took especial pains to try and overcome aggies feeling against him  while waiting at the mouth of the saint lawrence admiral durell had succeeded in obtaining pilots to take the fleet up the river he had sailed up the river to the point where the difficult navigation began and where vessels generally took on board river pilots here he hoisted the french flag at the masthead and the pilots believing the ships to be a french squadron which had eluded the watch of the english came off in their boats and were all taken prisoners and forced under pain of death to take the english vessels safely up  the first difficulty of the passage was at cape tourmente where the channel describes a complete zigzag had the french planted some guns on a plateau high up on the side of the mountains they could have done great damage by a plunging fire but vaudreuil had neglected to take this measure and the fleet passed up in safety the manner in which they were handled and navigated astonishing the canadians who had believed it to be impossible that large ships could be taken up  on the 26th the whole fleet were anchored off the island of orleans a few miles below quebec the same night a small party landed on the island they were opposed by the armed inhabitants but beat them off and during the night the canadians crossed to the north shore the whole army then landed  from the end of the island wolfe could see the full strength of the position which he had come to attack three or four miles in front of him the town of quebec stood upon its elevated rock beyond rose the loftier height of cape diamond with its redoubts and parapets three great batteries looked threateningly from the upper rock of quebec while three others were placed near the edge of the water in the lower town on the right was the great camp of montcalm stretching from the saint charles at the foot of the city walls to the gorge of the montmorenci from the latter point to the village of beauport in the centre of the camp the front was covered with earthworks along the brink of a lofty height and from beauport to the saint charles were broad flats of mud swept by the fire of redoubts and intrenchments by the guns of a floating battery and by those of the city itself  wolfe could not see beyond quebec but above the city the position was even stronger than below the river was walled by a range of steeps often inaccessible and always so difficult that a few men could hold an army in check  montcalm was perfectly confident of his ability to resist any attack which the british might make bougainville had long before examined the position in view of the possibility of an english expedition against it and reported that with a few intrenchments the city would be safe if defended by three or four thousand men sixteen thousand were now gathered there and montcalm might well believe the position to be impregnable  he was determined to run no risk by advancing to give battle but to remain upon the defensive till the resources of the english were exhausted or till the approach of winter forced them to retire his only source of uneasiness lay in the south for he feared that amherst with his army might capture ticonderoga and advance into the colony in which case he must weaken his army by sending a force to oppose him  on the day after the army landed on the island a sudden and very violent squall drove several of the ships ashore and destroyed many of the flatboats on the following night the sentries at the end of the island saw some vessels coming down the river suddenly these burst into flames they were the fire ships which vaudreuil had sent down to destroy the fleet they were filled with pitch tar and all sorts of combustibles with shell and grenades mixed up with them while on their decks were a number of cannon crammed to the mouth with grapeshot and musketballs  fortunately for the english the french naval officer in command lost his nerve and set fire to his ship half an hour too soon the other captains following his example this gave the english time to recover from the first feeling of consternation at seeing the fire ships each a pillar of flame advancing with tremendous explosion and noise against them the troops at once got under arms lest the french should attack them while the vessels lowered their boats and the sailors rowed up to meet the fire ships when they neared them they threw grapnels on board and towed them towards land until they were stranded and then left them to burn out undisturbed  finding that it would be impossible to effect a landing under the fire of the french guns wolfe determined as a first step to seize the height of point levi opposite quebec from this point he could fire on the town across the saint lawrence which is here less than a mile wide  on the afternoon of the 29th moncktons brigade crossed in the boats to beaumont on the south shore his advanced guard had a skirmish with a party of canadians but these soon fell back and no further opposition was offered to the landing  in the morning a proclamation issued by wolfe was posted on the doors of the parish churches it called upon the canadians to stand neutral in the contest promising them if they did so full protection to their property and religion but threatening that if they resisted their houses goods and harvest should be destroyed and their churches sacked  the brigade marched along the river to point levi and drove off a body of french and indians posted there and the next morning began to throw up intrenchments and to form batteries wolfe did not expect that his guns here could do any serious damage to the fortifications of quebec his object was partly to discourage the inhabitants of the city exposed to his fire partly to keep up the spirits of his own troops by setting them to work  the guns of quebec kept up a continual fire against the working parties but the batteries continued to rise and the citizens alarmed at the destruction which threatened their houses asked the governor to allow them to cross the river and dislodge the english although he had no belief that they would succeed he thought it better to allow them to try accordingly some fifteen hundred armed citizens and canadians from the camp with a few indians and a hundred volunteers from the regulars marched up the river and crossed on the night of the 12th of july  the courage of the citizens evaporated very quickly now they were on the same side of the river as the english although still three miles from them in a short time a wild panic seized them they rushed back in extreme disorder to their boats crossed the river and returned to quebec  the english guns soon opened and carried destruction into the city in one day eighteen houses and the cathedral were burned by exploding shells and the citizens soon abandoned their homes and fled into the country  the destruction of the city however even if complete would have advanced wolfes plans but little it was a moral blow at the enemy but nothing more  on the 8th of july several frigates took their station before the camp of general levis who with his division of canadian militia occupied the heights along the saint lawrence next to the gorge of montmorenci here they opened fire with shell and continued it till nightfall owing to the height of the plateau on which the camp was situated they did but little damage but the intention of wolfe was simply to keep the enemy occupied and under arms  towards evening the troops on the island broke up their camp and leaving a detachment of marines to hold the post the brigades of townshend and murray three thousand strong embarked after nightfall in the boats of the fleet and landed a little below the montmorenci at daybreak they climbed the heights and routing a body of canadians and indians who opposed them gained the plateau and began to intrench themselves there  a company of rangers supported by the regulars was sent into the neighbouring forests to prevent the parties from cutting bushes for the fascines to explore the bank of the montmorenci and if possible to discover a ford across the river  levis with his aidedecamp a jacobite scotchman named johnston was watching the movements of wolfe from the heights above the gorge levis believed that no ford existed but johnston found a man who had only that morning crossed a detachment was at once sent to the place with orders to intrench themselves and levis posted eleven hundred canadians under repentigny close by in support  four hundred indians passed the ford and discovered the english detachment in the forest and langlade their commander recrossed the river and told repentigny that there was a body of english in the forest who might be destroyed if he would cross at once with his canadians repentigny sent to levis and levis to vaudreuil then three or four miles distant  before vaudreuil arrived on the spot the indians became impatient and attacked the rangers and drove them back with loss upon the regulars who stood their ground and repulsed the assailants the indians however carried thirtysix scalps across the ford  if repentigny had advanced when first called upon and had been followed by levis with his whole command the english might have suffered a very severe check for the canadians were as much superior to the regulars in the forest as the regulars to the canadians in the open  vaudreuil called a council of war but he and montcalm agreed not to attack the english who were on their part powerless to injure them wolfes position on the heights was indeed a dangerous one a third of his force was six miles away on the other side of the saint lawrence and the detachment on the island was separated from each by a wide arm of the river any of the three were liable to be attacked and overpowered before the others could come to its assistance  wolfe indeed was soon well intrenched but although safe against attack he was powerless to take the offensive the fact however that he had taken up his position so near their camp had discomfited the canadians and his battery played with considerable effect on the left of their camp  the time passed slowly the deep and impassable gulf of the montmorenci separated the two enemies but the crests of the opposite cliffs were within easy gunshot of each other and men who showed themselves near the edge ran a strong chance of being hit along the river from the montmorenci to point levi continued fighting went on between the guns of the frigates and the gunboats and batteries on shore the indians swarmed in the forest near the english camp and constant skirmishing went on between them and the rangers  the steady work of destruction going on in the city of quebec by the fire from point levi and the ceaseless cannonade kept up by the ships and wolfes batteries added to the inactivity to which they were condemned began to dispirit the canadian militia and many desertions took place the men being anxious to return to their villages and look after the crops and many more would have deserted had it not been for the persuasion of the priests and the fear of being maltreated by the indians whom the governor threatened to let loose upon any who should waver in their resistance  on the 18th of july a fresh move was made by the english the french had believed it impossible for any hostile ships to pass the batteries of quebec but covered by a furious cannonade from point levi the man of war sutherland with a frigate and several small vessels aided by a favouring wind ran up the river at night and passed above the town montcalm at once despatched six hundred men under dumas to defend the accessible points in the line of precipices above quebec and on the following day when it became known that the english had dragged a fleet of boats over point levi and had launched them above the town a reinforcement of several hundreds more was sent to dumas  on the night of the 20th colonel carleton with six hundred men rowed eighteen miles up the river and landed at pointe aux trembles on the north shore here many of the fugitives from quebec had taken refuge and a hundred women children and old men were taken prisoners by carleton and brought down the next day with the retiring force wolfe entertained the prisoners kindly and sent them on the following day with a flag of truce into quebec  on the night of the 28th the french made another attempt to burn the english fleet sending down a large number of schooners shallops and rafts chained together and filled as before with combustibles  this time the fire was not applied too soon and the english fleet was for some time in great danger but was again saved by the sailors who in spite of the storm of missiles vomited out by cannon swivels grenades shell and gun and pistol barrels loaded up to the muzzle grappled with the burning mass and towed it on shore  it was now the end of july and wolfe was no nearer taking quebec than upon the day when he first landed there in vain he had tempted montcalm to attack him the french general confident in the strength of his position refused to leave it  wolfe therefore determined to attack the camp in front the plan was a desperate one for after leaving troops enough to hold his two camps he had less than five thousand men to attack a position of commanding strength where montcalm could at an hours notice collect twice as many to oppose him  at a spot about a mile above the gorge of the montmorenci a flat strip of ground some two hundred yards wide lay between the river and the foot of the precipices and at low tide the river left a flat of mud nearly half a mile wide beyond the dry ground  along the edge of the highwater mark the french had built several redoubts from the river wolfe could not see that these redoubts were commanded by the musketry of the intrenchments along the edge of the heights above which also swept with their fire the whole face of the declivity which was covered with grass and was extremely steep wolfe hoped that if he attacked one of the redoubts the french would come down to defend it and that a battle might be so brought on or that if they did not do so he might find a spot where the heights could be stormed with some chance of success at low tide it was possible to ford the mouth of the montmorenci and wolfe intended that the troops from his camp on the heights above that river should cross here and advance along the strand to cooperate with moncktons brigade who were to cross from point levi  on the morning of the 31st of july the centurion of 64 guns and two armed transports each with 14 guns stood close in to one of the redoubts and opened fire upon it while the english batteries from the heights of the montmorenci opened fire across the chasm upon the french lines  at eleven oclock the troops from point levi put off in their boats and moved across the river as if they intended to make a landing between beauport and the city for some hours montcalm remained ignorant as to the point on which the english attack was to be made but became presently convinced that it would be delivered near the montmorenci and he massed the whole of his army on that flank of his position  at halfpast five oclock the tide was low and the english boats dashed forward and the troops sprang ashore on to the broad tract of mud left bare by the tide while at the same moment a column 2000 strong moved down from the height towards the ford at the mouth of the montmorenci the first to land were thirteen companies of grenadiers and a detachment of royal americans who without waiting for the two regiments of moncktons brigade dashed forward against the redoubt at the foot of the hill the french at once abandoned it but the grenadiers had no sooner poured into it than a storm of bullets rained down upon them from the troops who lined the heights above  without a moments hesitation the grenadiers and americans dashed forward and strove to climb the steep ascent swept as it was by a terrific hail of bullets and buckshot from the french and canadians numbers rolled dead or wounded to the bottom of the hill but the others struggled on  but at this moment the cloud which had been threatening all day suddenly opened and the rain poured down in a torrent the grassy slopes instantly became so slippery that it was absolutely impossible to climb them and the fire from above died away as the wet rendered the firelocks unserviceable  the grenadiers fell back into the redoubt wolfe who had now arrived upon the spot saw that it was absolutely impossible to carry the heights under the present conditions and ordered the troops to retreat carrying off many of the wounded with them they fell back in good order those of the grenadiers and americans who survived recrossed in their boats to the island the 15th regiment rowed back to point levi and the 78th highlanders who belonged to moncktons brigade joined the column from below the montmorenci and slowly retired along the flats and across the ford  the loss fell entirely upon the grenadiers and americans and was in proportion to their number enormousfour hundred and fortythree including one colonel eight captains twentyone lieutenants and three ensigns being killed wounded or missing the blow to the english was a severe one and even wolfe began to despair and meditated leaving a portion of his troops on isle aux coudres and fortifying them there and sailing home with the rest to prepare another expedition in the following year  in the middle of august he issued a third proclamation to the canadians declaring as they had refused his offers of protection and had practised the most unchristian barbarity against his troops on all occasions he could no longer refrain in justice to himself and his army in chastising them as they deserved the barbarities consisted in the frequent scalping and mutilating of sentinels and men on outpost duty which were perpetrated alike by the canadians and indians  wolfes object was twofold first to cause the militia to desert and secondly to exhaust the colony accordingly the rangers light infantry and highlanders were sent out in all directions to waste the settlements wherever resistance was offered farm houses and villages were laid in ashes although the churches were generally spared wolfes orders were strict that women and children were to be treated with honour  if any violence is offered to a woman the offender shall be punished with death  these orders were obeyed and except in one instance none but armed men in the act of resistance were killed  vaudreuil in his despatches home loudly denounced these barbarities but he himself was answerable for atrocities incomparably worse and on a far larger scale for he had for years sent his savages red and white along a frontier of 600 miles to waste burn and murder at will and these as he was perfectly aware spared neither age nor sex  montcalm was not to be moved from his position by the sight of the smoke of the burning villages he would not risk the loss of all canada for the sake of a few hundred farm houses  seeing the impossibility of a successful attack below the town wolfe determined to attempt operations on a large scale above it accordingly with every fair wind and tide ships and transports ran the gauntlet of the batteries of quebec and covered by a hot fire from point levi generally succeeded with more or less damage in getting above the town a fleet of flatboats was also sent up and 1200 troops marched overland under brigadier murray to embark in them  to meet this danger above the town bougainville was sent from the camp at beaufort with 1500 men murray made another descent at pointeauxtrembles but was repulsed with loss he tried a second time at another place but a body of ambushed canadians poured so heavy a fire into the boats that he was forced to fall back again with considerable loss his third attempt was more successful for he landed at deschambault and burned a large building filled with stores and with all the spare baggage of the officers of the french regular troops  vaudreuil now regretted having sent the french frigates up the river and withdrawing their crews to work in the batteries had they been kept just above the town they could have overpowered the english vessels as they passed up the sailors were now sent up to man their ships again but admiral holmes who had taken command of the ships of war above quebec was already too strong for them and the sailors were recalled to quebec  both armies were suffering dysentery and fever had broken out in the english camp and the number of effective men was greatly reduced upon the other hand the french were suffering from shortness of supplies the english frigates above the town prevented food being brought down from montreal in boats and the difficulties of land carriage were very great  the canadians deserted in great numbers and montcalms force had been weakened by the despatch of levis to assist in checking the advance of amherst the latter had captured ticonderoga and crown point niagara had also been taken by the english amherst however fell back again and levis was able to rejoin montcalm  but the greatest misfortune which befell the english was the dangerous illness of wolfe who always suffering from disease was for a time utterly prostrate at the end of august however he partially recovered and dictated a letter to his three brigadier generals asking them to fix upon one of three plans which he laid before them for attacking the enemy the first was that the army should march eight or ten miles up the montmorenci ford the river and fall upon the rear of the enemy the second was to cross the ford at the mouth of the montmorenci and march along the shore until a spot was found where the heights could be climbed the third was to make a general attack from the boats upon beauport  monckton townshend and murray met in consultation and considered all the plans to be hopeless but they proposed that an attempt should be made to land above the town and so to place the army between quebec and its base of supplies thereby forcing montcalm to fight or to surrender  the attempt seemed a desperate one but wolfe determined to adopt it he had not much hope of its succeeding but should it not do so there was nothing for him but to sail with his weakened army back to england he therefore determined at last to make the attempt and implored his physician to patch him up so that he could in person take the command  i know perfectly well that you cannot cure me he wrote but pray make me up so that i may be without pain for a few days and able to do my duty that is all i want  on the 3rd of september wolfe took the first steps towards the carrying out of his plans by evacuating the camp at montmorenci montcalm sent a strong force to attack him as he was moving but monckton at point levi saw the movement and embarking two battalions in boats made a feint of landing at beauport montcalm recalled his troops to repulse the threatened attack and the english were able to draw off from montmorenci without molestation  on the night of the 4th a fleet of flatboats passed above the town with the baggage and stores on the 5th the infantry marched up by land and the united force of some 3600 men embarked on board the ships of admiral holmes  the french thought that the abandonment of montmorenci and the embarkation of the troops was a sign that the english were about to abandon their enterprise and sail for england nevertheless montcalm did not relax his vigilance being ever on the watch riding from post to post to see that all was in readiness to repel an attack in one of his letters at this time he mentioned that he had not taken off his clothes since the 23d of june  he now reinforced the troops under bougainville above quebec to 3000 men he had little fear for the heights near the town believing them to be inaccessible and that a hundred men could stop a whole army this he said especially in reference to the one spot which presented at least a possibility of being scaled here captain de vergor with a hundred canadian troops were posted the battalion of guienne had been ordered to encamp close at hand and the post which was called anse du foulon was but a mile and a half distant from quebec thus although hoping that the english would soon depart the french knowing the character of wolfe made every preparation against a last attack before he started  from the 7th to the 12th holmes fleet sailed up and down the river threatening a landing now at one point and now at another wearing out the french who were kept night and day on the qui vive and were exhausted by following the ships up and down so as to be ready to oppose a landing wherever it might be made  james walshams regiment formed part of moncktons brigade and his colonel had frequently selected him to command parties who went out to the canadian villages as from the knowledge he had acquired of irregular warfare he could be trusted not to suffer himself to be surprised by the parties of canadians or indians who were always on the watch to cut off detachments sent out from the british camp there were still ten men in the regiment who had formed part of his band on the lakes these were drafted into his company and whatever force went out they always accompanied him  although james had seen much and heard more of the terrible barbarities perpetrated by the canadians and their indian allies on the frontier he lamented much the necessity which compelled wolfe to order the destruction of canadian villages and when engaged on this service whether in command of the detachment or as a subaltern if more than one company went out he himself never superintended the painful work but with his ten men scouted beyond the village and kept a vigilant lookout against surprise in this way he had several skirmishes with the canadians but the latter never succeeded in surprising any force to which he was attached walsham and his scouts were often sent out with parties from other regiments and general monckton was so pleased with his vigilance and activity that he specially mentioned him to general wolfe at the same time telling him of the services he had performed on the lakes and the very favourable reports which had been made by johnson monro lord howe and abercromby of the work done by the corps which he had organized and commanded  i wish we had a few more officers trained to this sort of warfare general wolfe said send him on board the sutherland tomorrow i have some service which he is well fitted to carry out  james accordingly repaired on board the sutherland and was conducted to the generals cabin  general monckton has spoken to me in high terms of you lieutenant walsham and he tells me that you have been several times mentioned in despatches by the generals under whom you served and you were with braddock as well as with johnson howe and abercromby and with monro at the siege of fort william henry how is it that so young an officer should have seen so much service  james informed him how having been pressed on board a man of war he had been discharged in accordance with orders from home and hearing that his friends were going to obtain a commission for him in a regiment under orders for america he had thought it best to utilize his time by accompanying general braddock as a volunteer in order to learn something of forest warfare that after that disastrous affair he had served with johnson in a similar capacity until on his regiment arriving he had been selected to drill a company of scouts and had served with them on the lakes until the corps was broken up when the regiment sailed for canada  in fact you have seen more of this kind of warfare than any officer in the army general wolfe said your special services ought to have been recognized before i shall have you put in orders tomorrow as promoted to the rank of captain and now i am about to employ you upon a service which if you are successful will give you your brevet majority  there must be some points at which those precipices can be climbed i want you to find out where they are it is a service of great danger you will go in uniform otherwise if caught you would meet with the fate of a spy but at the same time even in uniform you would probably meet with but little mercy if you fell into the hands of the canadians or indians would you be willing to undertake such a duty  i will try sir james said do you wish me to start tonight  no the general replied you had better think the matter over and let me know tomorrow how you had best proceed it is not an enterprise to be undertaken without thinking it over in every light you will have to decide whether you will go alone or take anyone with you when and how you will land how you will regain the ships you will of course have carte blanche in all respects  after james had returned on shore he thought the matter over in every light he knew that the french had many sentries along the edge of the river for boats which at night went over towards that side of the river were always challenged and fired upon the chance of landing undetected therefore seemed but slight nor even did he land would he be likely at night to discover the paths which could be little more than tracks up the heights  had he been able to speak canadian french the matter would have been easy enough as he could have landed higher up the river and dressed as a canadian farmer have made his way through the french lines without suspicion but he knew nothing of french and even had he spoken the language fluently there was sufficient difference between the canadian french and the language of the old country for the first canadian who spoke to him to have detected the difference  nor could he pass as an indian for although he had picked up enough of the language to converse with the redskin allies of the english on the lakes the first indian who spoke to him would detect the difference and indeed it needed a far more intimate acquaintance with the various tribes than he possessed for him to be able to paint and adorn himself so as to deceive the vigilant eyes of the french indians  had his two followers nat and jonathan been with him they could have painted and dressed him so that he could have passed muster but in their absence he abandoned the idea as out of the question the prospect certainly did not seem hopeful  after long thought it seemed to him that the only way which promised even a chance of success would be for him to be taken prisoner by the french soldiers once fairly within their lines half the difficulty was over he had learned to crawl as noiselessly as an indian and he doubted not that he should be able to succeed in getting away from any place of confinement in which they might place him then he could follow the top of the heights and the position of the sentries or of any body of men encamped there would in itself be a guide to him as to the existence of paths to the strand below  the first step was the most difficult how should he manage to get himself taken prisoner and this was the more difficult as it was absolutely necessary that he should fall into the hands of french regulars and not of the canadians who would finish the matter at once by killing and scalping him  the next morning he again went off to the sutherland he was in high spirits for his name had appeared in orders as captain and as appointed assistant quartermaster general on the headquarter staff on entering the generals cabin he thanked him for the promotion  you have earned it over and over again the general said there are no thanks due to me now have you thought out a plan  james briefly stated the difficulties which he perceived in the way of any other scheme than that of getting himself taken prisoner by the french and showed that that was the only plan that seemed to offer even a chance of success  but you may not be able to escape wolfe said  i may not james replied and in that case sir i must of course remain a prisoner until you take quebec or i am exchanged even then you would be no worse off than you are at present for i must of course be taken prisoner at some point where the french are in force and where you do not mean to land my presence there would give them no clue whatever to your real intentions whereas were i taken prisoner anywhere along the shore they would naturally redouble their vigilance as they would guess that i was looking for some way of ascending the heights  how do you propose being taken wolfe asked  my idea was james replied that i should land with a party near cap rouge as if to reconnoitre the french position there we should of course be speedily discovered and would then retreat to the boats i should naturally be the last to go and might well manage to be cut off  yes wolfe replied but you might also and that far more easily manage to get shot i dont think that would do captain walsham the risks would be twenty to one against your escaping being shot can you think of no other plan  the only other plan that i can think of james said might involve others being taken prisoners i might row in towards cap rouge in broad daylight as if to examine the landing place and should of course draw their fire upon the boat before starting i should fire two or three shots into the boat close to the water line and afterwards plug them up with rags then when their fire became heavy i should take the plugs out and let the boat fill as she did so i could shout that i surrendered and then we could drift till we neared the shore in the waterlogged boat or swim ashore i can swim well myself and should of course want four men who could swim well also picked out as the crew  the plan is a dangerous one wolfe said but less so than the other  one cannot win a battle without risking life sir james said quietly some of us might of course be hit but as we risk our lives whenever we get within range of the enemy i do not see that that need be considered at any rate sir i am ready to make the attempt if the plan has your approval  i tell you frankly captain walsham that i think your chances of success are absolutely nil at the same time there is just a faint possibility that you may get ashore alive escape from the french discover a pathway and bring me the news and as the only chance of the expedition being successful now depends upon our discovering such a path i am not justified in refusing even this faint chance  the general touched a bell which stood on the table before him  will you ask the captain to come here he said to the officer who answered the summons  captain peters he said when the captain appeared i want you to pick out for me four men upon whom you can thoroughly rely in the first place they must be good swimmers in the second place they must be able to hold their tongues and lastly they must be prepared to pass some months in a french prison a midshipman with the same qualifications will be required to go with them  the captain naturally looked surprised at so unusual a request  captain walsham is going to be taken prisoner by the french general wolfe explained and the only way it can be done is for a whole boats crew to be taken with him and he then detailed the plan which had been arranged of course you can offer the men any reward you may think fit and can promise the midshipman early promotion he concluded  very well general i have no doubt i can find four men and a midshipman willing to volunteer for the affair especially as if you succeed their imprisonment will be a short one when will the attempt be made  if you can drift up the river as far as cap rouge before daylight james said in answer to an inquiring look from the general we will attempt it tomorrow morning i should say that the best plan would be for me to appear opposite their camp when day breaks as if i was trying to obtain a close view of it in the early morning  the sooner the better general wolfe said every day is of importance but how do you propose to get back again that is supposing that everything goes well  i propose general that i should conceal myself somewhere on the face of the heights i will spread a handkerchief against a rock or tree so that it will not be seen either from above or below but will be visible from the ships in the river i cannot say of course whether it will be near cap rouge or quebec but if you will have a sharp lookout kept through a glass as the ships drift up and down you are sure to see it and can let me know that you do so by dipping the ensign at night i will make my way down to the shore and if at midnight exactly you will send a boat for me i shall be ready to swim off to her when they show a lantern as they approach the shore of course i cannot say on what day i may be in a position to show the signal but at any rate if a week passes without your seeing it you will know that i have failed to make my escape or that i have been killed after getting out    chapter 19 a dangerous expedition   the details of the proposed expedition being thus arranged the captain left the cabin with james and the latter paced to and fro on the quarterdeck while the captain sent for the boatswain and directed him to pick out four men who could swim well and who were ready to volunteer for desperate service  while the captain was so engaged james saw a naval officer staring fixedly at him he recognized him instantly though more than four years had elapsed since he had last seen him he at once stepped across the quarterdeck  how are you lieutenant horton it is a long time since we last parted on the potomac  horton would have refused the proffered hand but he had already injured himself very sorely in the eyes of the squire by his outburst of ill feeling against james so he shook hands and said coldly  yes your position has changed since then  yes james said with a laugh but that was only a temporary eclipse that two months before the mast was a sort of interlude for which i am deeply thankful had it not been for my getting into that smuggling scrape i should have been at the present moment commencing practice as a doctor instead of being a captain in his majestys service  the words were not calculated to improve hortons temper what a mistake he had made had he interfered on james walshams behalfand a word from him saying that james was the son of a medical man and was assuredly mixed up in this smuggling affair only by accidenthe would have been released he had not spoken that word and the consequence was he had himself fallen into bad odour with the squire and james walsham instead of drudging away as a country practitioner was an officer of rank equal to himself for he as second lieutenant in the sutherland ranked with a captain in the army  not only this but whenever he went to sidmouth he had heard how james had been mentioned in the despatches and how much he was distinguishing himself everything seemed to combine against him he had hated james walsham from the day when the latter had thrashed him and had acted as aggies champion against him he had hated him more when he found aggie installed as the squires heiress and saw how high james stood in her good graces and that he had been taken up by the squire  he had hoped that he had gained the advantage over him when he had come back a naval officer while james was still a schoolboy and had kept aloof from the house while he devoted himself to the young heiress everything had seemed going on well with his plans until the very circumstance which at the time seemed so opportune namely the pressing james as a seaman on board the thetis had turned out so disastrous the letter in which he had suffered his exultation to appear had angered the squire had set mrs walsham and her friend the exsergeant against him and had deeply offended aggie it had too enabled the squire to take instant measures for procuring jamess discharge and had now placed the latter in a position equal to his own  james on his part did not like richard horton but he felt no active animosity against him he had got the best of it in that first quarrel of theirs and although he had certainly felt very sore and angry at the time richard was staying at the hall and seemed to have taken his place altogether as aggies friend this feeling had long since died away for he knew from the letters of mr wilks that aggie had no liking whatever for richard horton  you were at sidmouth in the spring i heard he said you found my mother looking well i hope  yes i was there a fortnight before we sailed richard said i think she was looking about as usual  for a few minutes they talked in a stiff and somewhat constrained tone for richard could not bring himself to speak cordially to this man whom he regarded as a dangerous rival presently the captain came up to them  i have picked four volunteers for your work captain walsham they were somewhat surprised at first to find that they were required for a bout in a french prison but sailors are always ready for any harebrained adventure and they made no objection whatever when i explained what they would have to do next to fighting a frenchman theres nothing a sailor likes so much as taking him in young middleton goes in command of the boat he is a regular young pickle and is as pleased at the prospect as if a french prison were the most amusing place in the world he knows of course that there will be some considerable danger of his being shot before he is taken prisoner but i need hardly say that the danger adds to the interest of the scheme its a risky business you have undertaken captain walsham terribly risky but if you succeed you will have saved the expedition from turning out a failure and we shall all be under obligations to you for the rest of our lives  has captain walsham told you what he is undertaking mr horton  no sir  he is going to get taken prisoner in the gig in order that he may if possible give the french the slip again find out some way down that line of cliffs and so enable the general to get into the heart of the french expedition it is a grand scheme but a risky one  the chances are a hundred to one against you captain walsham  that is just what the general said james replied with a smile i dont think myself they are more than five to one against me but even if they were a thousand it would be worth trying for a thousand lives would be cheaply sacrificed to ensure the success of this expedition  there are not many men who would like to try it the captain said i say honestly i shouldnt myself anything in the nature of duty whether its laying your ship alongside a frenchman of twice her weight of metal or a boat expedition to cut out a frigate from under the guns of the battery i should be ready to take my share in but an expedition like yours to be carried out alone in cold blood and in the dark i should have no stomach for i dont want to discourage you and i honour your courage in undertaking it but i am heartily glad that the general did not propose to me instead of to you to undertake it  you would have done it if he had sir james said smiling and so would any officer of this expedition i consider myself most highly honoured in the general entrusting me with the mission besides you must remember that it is not so strange to me as it would be to most men i have been for four years engaged in forest warfare scouting at night in the woods and keeping my ears open to the slightest sound which might tell of a skulking redskin being at hand my eyes have become so accustomed to darkness that although still very far short of those of the indians i can see plainly where one unaccustomed to such work would see nothing i am accustomed to rely upon my own senses to step noiselessly or to crawl along on the ground like an indian therefore you see to me this enterprise does not present itself in the same light as it naturally would to you  you may make light of it the captain said but its a dangerous business look at it as you will well if you go through it safely captain walsham you will be the hero of this campaign  late in the afternoon the tide turned and the vessels began to drift up the river the four sailors had of course mentioned to their comrades the service upon which they were about to be engaged the captain had not thought it necessary to enjoin secrecy upon them for there was no communication with the shore no fear of the knowledge spreading beyond the ship besides the boat had to be damaged and this alone would tell the sailors when she was lowered in the water that she was intended to be captured  a marine was called up to where the captains gig was hanging from the davits james pointed out a spot just below the waterline and the man standing a yard or two away fired at it the ball making a hole through both sides of the boat another shot was fired two or three inches higher and the four holes were then plugged up with oakum  all was now in readiness for the attempt james dined with captain peters the first lieutenant and four officers of the generals staff being also present general wolfe himself being too ill to be at table and admiral holmes having early in the morning gone down the river to confer with admiral saunders  i drink good health and a safe return to you captain walsham for our sake as well as yours as a general thing when an officer is chosen for dangerous service he is an object of envy by all his comrades but for once i do not think anyone on board would care to undertake your mission  why sir your little midshipman is delighted at going with me he and i have been chatting the matter over and he is in the highest glee  ah he has only got the first chance of being shot at captain peters said that comes in the line of duty and i hope there isnt an officer on board a ship but would volunteer at once for that service but your real danger only begins when his ends  by the way he asked as after dinner was over he was walking up and down the quarterdeck talking to james have you and lieutenant horton met before i thought you seemed to know each other when i came up but since then i have noticed that while all the other officers of the ship have been chatting with you he has kept aloof  we knew each other at home sir james said but we were never very good friends our acquaintanceship commenced when we were boys with a fight i got the best of it and horton has never i think quite forgiven me  i dont like the young fellow captain peters said shortly i know he was not popular in the thetis and they say he showed the white feather out in the east i wouldnt have had him on board but the first lord asked me as a personal favour to take him i have had no reason to complain of him since he joined but i know that he is no more popular among my other officers than he was in the thetis  i never heard a word against him sir james said earnestly his uncle mr linthorne has large estates near sidmouth and has been the kindest friend to me and mine at one time it was thought that horton would be his heir but a granddaughter who had for years been missing was found but still horton will take i should think a considerable slice of the property and it would grieve the squire terribly if horton failed in his career i think its only a fault of manners sir if i may say so and certainly i myself know nothing whatever against him  i dont know captain peters replied thoughtfully just before i sailed i happened to meet an old friend and over our dinner i mentioned the names of my officers he told me he knew this mr linthorne well and that horton had gone to sea with him for the first time as a midshipman and that there was certainly something queer about him as a boy for linthorne had specially asked him to keep his eye upon him and had begged him frankly to let him know how he conducted himself that rather set me against him you know  i dont think that was anything james urged i do not much like horton but i should not like you to have a false impression of him it was a mere boyish affair sirin fact it was connected with that fight with me i dont think he gave a very strictly accurate account of it and his uncle who in some matters is very strict although one of the kindest of men took the thing up and sent him away to sea horton was certainly punished severely enough for that stupid business without its counting against him afterwards  i like the way you speak up in his defence captain walsham especially as you frankly say you dont like him and henceforth i will dismiss the affair from my mind but i should say that he has never forgiven it although you may have done so  thats natural enough james laughed because i came best out of it  to richard horton the news that james walsham was about to undertake a desperate enterprise which if he succeeded in it would bring him great honour and credit was bitter in the extreme and the admiration expressed by the other officers at his courage in undertaking it added to his anger and disgust he walked moodily up and down the quarterdeck all the afternoon to think the matter over and at each moment his fury increased could he in any way have put a stop to the adventure he would instantly have done so but there was no possible way of interfering  the thought that annoyed him most was of the enthusiasm with which the news of the successful termination of the enterprise would be received at sidmouth already as he knew aggie regarded james as a hero and the squire was almost as proud of his mention in despatches as if he had been his own son but for this he cared but little it was aggies good opinion richard horton desired to gain james walsham still thought of her as the girl of twelve he had last seen but richard horton knew her as almost a woman and although at first he had resolved to marry her as his uncles heiress he now really cared for her for herself  on the visit before james had left home richard had felt certain that his cousin liked him but since that time he had not only made no progress but he felt that he had lost rather than gained ground the girl was always friendly with him but it was the cool friendliness of a cousin and somehow richard instinctively felt james walsham was the cause  in vain he had angrily told himself that it was absurd to suppose that his cousin could care for this fellow whom she had only seen as an awkward boy who had been content to stop away from the house and never go near her for weeks still though he told himself it was absurd he knew that it was so when the conversation happened to turn upon james she seldom took any part in it but richard knew that it was not from indifference as to the subject there was a soft flush on her cheek a light in her eyes which he had never been able to call up and many a time he had ground his teeth in silent rage when the squire and mr wilks were discussing the news received in jamess last letter and expressing their hopes that ere long he would be back from foreign service  although by no means fond of encountering danger richard felt that he would gladly pick an open quarrel with the man he regarded as his rival and shoot him like a dogfor in those days duels were matters of everyday occurrencebut there was no possibility of doing this at the present juncture and moreover he knew that this would be the worst possible way of ridding himself of him for were james to fall by his hands his chances of winning aggie would be hopelessly extinguished  no he said to himself that is out of the question but i will do something come what may he shall never go back to sidmouth  the squadron drifted up beyond cap rouge and anchored at the top of the flood an hour before daybreak the gig was lowered and james walsham amid many good wishes and hearty farewells from the officers took his place in her by the side of the midshipman  look out for my signal he said any time after today you may see it  we will see it if you make it my boy said the captain who had come on deck to see him off dont you fear about that if you make your signal you may rely upon it our boat will be ashore for you that night  another moment and the boat pulled away from the side of the ship  take it easy lads young middleton said only just dip your oars in the water we have but three miles to row with the stream and dont want to be there till the day begins to show  the oars had been muffled and noiselessly the boat dropped down the stream until she neared cap rouge then they rowed in towards the french shore the day was just beginning to break in the east as they neared the spot where the french camp was situated it stood high up on the plateau but there were a small number of tents on the low ground by the river as some batteries had been erected here they were but two hundred yards from the shore when a french sentry challenged they gave no answer and the soldier at once fired  keep about this distance out james ordered row quietly i will stand up as if i were watching the shore  as soon as the shot was fired it was answered by shots from other sentries a minute later a drum was heard to beat sharply and then in the faint light a number of french soldiers could be seen running at full speed towards the shore the shots fell thickly round the boat and one of the men dropped his oar as a bullet struck him on the shoulder  pull out the plugs james said  the oakum was pulled out and thrown overboard and the water rushed in  now turn her head from the shore as if we were trying to escape  so rapidly did the water rush in through the four holes that in a minute the gunwale was nearly level with the water  turn her over now james said and in a moment the boat was upset and the men clinging to the bottom  a shout of exultation rose from the shore as the boat was seen to upset and the firing at once ceased  swim towards the shore and push the boat before you the young midshipman said they wont fire any more now and we have finished the first part of our business  pushing the boat before them the men made their way slowly towards the shore striking the land half a mile below the point where they had overturned the french soldiers had followed them down the bank and surrounded them as they landed the holes in the boat explained for themselves the cause of the disaster  an officer stepped forward  you are our prisoners he said to james  the latter bowed  it is the fortune of war he said your men are better shots than i gave them credit for and he pointed to the holes in the boat  he spoke in english but the officer guessed his meaning  some of the indians and canadians soon came flocking down and with angry gestures demanded that the prisoners should be shot but the french officer waived them off and placed a strong guard of his own men around them to prevent their being touched by the indians the young midshipman spoke french fluently having been specially selected by the captain for that reason but it had been agreed between him and james that he should not betray his knowledge of the language as he might thereby pick up information which might be useful  they were at once conducted before bougainville  do you speak french he asked  james shook his head the midshipman looked as if he had not understood the question  it is clear the french officer said to those standing around him that they came in to reconnoitre the landing place and thought in the dim light they could run the gauntlet of our sentries fire it was more accurate than they gave them credit for  the boat was struck twice you say  yes general the officer who conducted them into the tent replied two balls right through her and one of the men was hit on the shoulder  the reconnaissance looks as if wolfe meant to attempt a landing here bougainville said we must keep a sharp lookout i will send them on to quebec for the general to question them he will find someone there who speaks their language i will send at once to tell him we have captured them but i cant very well do so till we have a convoy going with regulars to guard it if they were to go in charge of canadians the chances of their arriving alive in quebec would be slight  let the sailors be placed in a tent in your lines chateaudun and place a sentry over them to see that the indians dont get at them the two officers can have the tent that le boeuf gave up yesterday you can put a sentry there but they can go in and out as they like there is no fear of their trying to escape for if they once went outside the lines of the regulars the indians and canadians would make short work of them  the officer led james and the midshipman to a tent in the staff lines whose owner had ridden to quebec on the previous night with despatches and motioned to them that it was to be theirs he also made signs to them that they could move about as they chose but significantly warned them by a gesture that if they ventured beyond the tents the indians would make short work of them  for a time the prisoners made no attempt to leave the tent for the indians stood scowling at a short distance off and would have entered had not the sentry on duty prevented them from doing so  do not talk too loudly james said it is probable that in a camp like this there is someone who understands english very likely they are playing the same game with us that we are with them they pretend there is no one who can speak to us but very likely there may be someone standing outside now trying to listen to what we say  then raising his voice he went on  what abominable luck i have who could have reckoned upon the boat being hit twice at that distance i thought we had fairly succeeded the general will be in a nice way when he finds we dont come back  yes middleton rejoined and to think that we are likely to spend the winter in prison at quebec instead of old england i am half inclined to try and escape  nonsense james replied it would be madness to think of such a thing these indians can see in the dark and the moment you put your foot outside the lines of these french regulars you would be carried off and scalped no no my boy that would be simply throwing away our lives there is nothing for it but to wait quietly till either wolfe takes quebec or you are exchanged  the prisoners were treated with courtesy by the french officers and comfortable meals were provided in the evening they went outside the tent for a short time but did not venture to go far for indians were still moving about and the hostile glances which they threw at the prisoners were sufficient to indicate what would happen to the latter if they were caught beyond the protection of the sentry  bougainville was right in supposing that prisoners would not be likely to attempt to escape james said in a low voice the look of those indians would be quite sufficient to prevent anyone from attempting it under ordinary circumstances it is well that my business will take me down the river towards quebec while they will make sure that i shall have made up the river with a view of making my way off to the ships the next time they go up above cap rouge  it will be risky work getting through them the midshipman remarked but all the same i wish i was going with you instead of having to stick here in prison  it would be running too great a risk of spoiling my chance of success james said i am accustomed to the redskins and can crawl through them as noiselessly as they could themselves besides one can hide where two could not i only hope that when they find i have gone they wont take it into their heads to revenge my escape upon you  there is no fear of that the midshipman said i shall be sound asleep in the tent and when they wake me up and find you are gone i shall make a tremendous fuss and pretend to be most indignant that you have deserted me  the two prisoners had eaten but little of the meals served to them that day putting the greater portion aside and hiding it in the straw which served for their beds in order that james might take with him a supply for it might be three or four days before he could be taken off by the ships boats  i suppose you wont go very far tonight the midshipman said suddenly  no james replied i shall hide somewhere along the face of the cliff a mile or so away they are not likely to look for me down the river at all but if they do they will think i have gone as far as i can away and the nearer i am to this place the safer  look here the midshipman said i am going strictly to obey orders but at the same time it is just possible that something may turn up that you ought to know or that might make me want to bolt suppose for instance i heard them say that they meant to shoot us both in the morningits not likely you know still its always as well to be prepared for whatever might happenif so i should crawl out of camp and make my way along after you and if so i shall walk along the edge and sometimes give two little whistles like this and if you hear me you answer me  dont be foolish middleton james said seriously you would only risk your life and mine by any nonsense of that sort there cant be any possible reason why you should want to go away you have undertaken to carry this out knowing that you would have perhaps to remain a prisoner for some time and having undertaken it you must keep to the plans laid down  but i am going to captain walsham still you know something might turn up  i dont see that anything possibly could turn up james insisted but if at any future time you do think of any madbrained attempt of escaping you must take off your shoes and you must put your foot down each time as gently as if the ground were covered with nails for if you were to tread upon a twig and there were an indian within half a mile of you he would hear it crack but dont you attempt any such folly no good could possibly come of it and you would be sure to fall into the hands of the savages or canadians and you know how they treat prisoners  i know the boy said and i have no wish to have my scalp hanging up in any of their wigwams  it was midnight before the camp was perfectly still and then james walsham quietly loosened one of the pegs of the canvas at the back of the tent and with a warm grasp of the midshipmans hand crawled out the lad listened attentively but he could not hear the slightest sound the sentinel was striding up and down in front of the tent humming the air of a french song as he walked half an hour passed without the slightest stir and the midshipman was sure that james was by this time safely beyond the enemys camp  he was just about to compose himself to sleep when he heard a trampling of feet the sentry challenged the password was given and the party passed on towards the generals tent it was some thirty yards distant and the sentry posted there challenged  i wonder whats up the midshipman said to himself and lifting the canvas he put his head out where james had crawled through  the men had halted before the generals tent and the boy heard the generals voice from inside the tent ask sharply what is it  i regret to disturb you monsieur le general but we have here one of the canadian pilots who has swam ashore from the enemys fleet higher up the river and who has important news for you  the midshipman at once determined to hear what passed he had already taken off his shoes and he now crawled out from the tent and moving with extreme caution made his way round to the back of the generals tent just as the latter having thrown on his coat and lighted a candle unfastened the entrance the midshipman determined to see as well as hear what was going on lifted up the flap a few inches behind and as he lay on the ground peered in a french officer had just entered and he was followed by a canadian whom the midshipman recognized at once as being the one who piloted the sutherland up and down the river  where do you come from bougainville asked  i swam ashore two hours ago from the english ship sutherland the canadian said  how did you manage to escape  i would have swam ashore long ago but at night i have always been locked up ever since i was captured in a cabin below tonight the door opened quietly and someone came in and said  hushcan you swim  like a fish i said  are you ready to try and escape if i give you the chance  i should think so i replied  then follow me but dont make the slightest noise  i followed him we passed along the main deck where the sailors were all asleep in their hammocks a lantern was burning here and i saw by its light that my conductor was an officer he led me along till we entered a cabinhis own i suppose  look he whispered there is a rope from the porthole down to the water if you slide quietly down by it and then let yourself drift till you are well astern of the ship the sentry on the quarterdeck will not see you here is a letter put it in your cap if you are fired at and a boat is lowered to catch you throw the paper away at once will you swear to do that  i said i would swear by the virgin  very well he went on if you get away safely and swim to shore make your way without a minutes delay to the french camp at cap rouge and give this letter to the general it is a matter of the most extreme importance  this is the letter general  he handed a small piece of paper tightly folded up to bougainville who opened it and read it by the light of the candle  he gave a sharp exclamation  quick he exclaimed come along to the tent of the prisoners i am warned that the capture was a ruse and that the military officer is a spy whose object here is to discover a landing place he is to escape the first opportunity  the three men at once ran out from the tent the instant they did so the midshipman crawled in under the flap rushed to the table on which the general had thrown the piece of paper seized it and then darted out again and stole quietly away in the darkness he had not gone twenty yards when a volley of angry exclamations told him that the french general had discovered that the tent was empty  the night was a dark one and to prevent himself from falling over tent ropes the midshipman threw himself down and crawled along on his hands and knees but he paused before he had gone many yards and listened intently the general was returning to his tent  it is no use doing anything tonight he said even an indian could not follow the track of a waggon at daybreak major dorsay let the redskins know that the prisoners have escaped and offer a reward of fifty crowns for their recapture dead or alivei care not which let this good fellow turn in at the guard tent i will talk to him in the morning good night  the midshipman kept his eyes anxiously on the dim light that could be faintly seen through the tent if the general missed the paper he might guess that it had been taken by the fugitives and might order an instant search of the camp he gave a sigh of relief when he saw the light disappear the moment the french officer had entered the tent and then crawled away through the camp    chapter 20 the path down the heights   as the midshipman crawled away from the tent of the french general he adopted the precautions which james had suggested and felt the ground carefully for twigs or sticks each time he moved the stillglowing embers of the campfires warned him where the indians and canadians were sleeping and carefully avoiding these he made his way up beyond the limits of the camp there were no sentries posted here for the french were perfectly safe from attack from that quarter and once fairly beyond the camp the midshipman rose to his feet and made his way to the edge of the slopes above the saint lawrence he walked for about a mile and then paused on the very edge of the sharp declivity and whistled as agreed upon  a hundred yards further he repeated the signal the fourth time he whistled he heard just below him the answer and a minute later james walsham stood beside him  you young scamp what are you doing here  it was not my fault captain walsham it wasnt indeed but i should have been tomahawked if i had stayed there a moment longer  what do you mean by you would have been tomahawked james asked angrily for he was convinced that the midshipman had made up his mind all along to accompany him  the pilot of the sutherland swam ashore with the news that you had been taken prisoner on purpose and were really a spy  but how on earth did he know that james asked i took care the man was not on deck when we made the holes in the boat and he does not understand a word of english so he could not have overheard what the men said  i am sorry to say sir that it is a case of treachery and that one of our officers is concerned in it the man said that an officer released him from his cell and took him to his cabin and then lowered him by a rope through the porthole  impossible james walsham said  it sounds impossible sir but i am afraid it isnt for the officer gave him a note to bring to the general telling him all about it and that note i have got in my pocket now  the midshipman then related the whole circumstances of his discovery  it is an extraordinary affair james said however you are certainly not to blame for making your escape when you did you could not have got back into your tent till too late and even could you have done so it might have gone hard with you for of course they would have known that you were what they would call an accomplice in the affair  i will go on if you like sir the boy said and hide somewhere else so that if they track me they will not find you  no no james said i dont think theres any fear of our being tracked indian eyes are sharp but they cant perform miracles in the forest it would be hopeless to escape them but here the grass is short and the ground dry and without boots we cannot have left any tracks that would be followed especially as bodies of french troops have been marching backwards and forwards along the edge of these heights for the last fortnight i wont say that it is impossible that they can find us but it will not be by our tracks  now come down to this bush where i was lying we will wait there till daylight breaks it is as far down as i dare go by this light but when we can see we will find a safer place further down  cautiously they made their way down to a clump of bushes twenty feet below the edge and there lying down dozed until it became light enough to see the ground the slope was very steep but bushes grew here and there upon it and by means of these and projecting rocks they worked their way down some thirty feet lower and then sat down among some bushes which screened them from the sight of anyone who might be passing along the edge of the river while the steep slope effectually hid them from anyone moving along above  is there any signature to that letter james asked presently  the midshipman took the piece of paper out and looked at it  no there is no signature he said but i know the handwriting i have seen it in orders over and over again  james was silent a few minutes  i wont ask you who it is though i fear i know too well look here middleton i should like you to tear that letter up and say no more about it  no sir the boy said putting the paper in his pocket i cant do that of course i am under your orders for this expedition but this is not an affair in which i consider that i am bound to obey you this concerns the honour of the officers of my ship and i should not be doing my duty if i did not upon my return place this letter in the hands of the captain a man who would betray the generals plans to the enemy would betray the ship and i should be a traitor myself if i did not inform the captain i am sorry awfully sorry that this should happen to an officer of the sutherland but it will be for the captain to decide whether he will make it public or not  there is one thing if it was to be anyone i would rather that it was he than anyone else for there isnt a man on board can abide him no sir i am sorry but i cannot give up the letter and even if you had torn it up when you had it in your hand just now i should have reported the whole thing to the captain and say i could swear to the handwriting  james was silent the boy was right and was only doing his duty in determining to denounce the act of gross treachery which had been perpetrated he was deeply grieved however to think of the consequences of the discovery and especially of the blow that it would be to the squire to hear that his nephew was a traitor and indeed a murderer at heart for had not his flight taken place before the discovery was made he would certainly have been executed as a spy  the day passed quietly that the indians were searching for him far and wide james walsham had no doubt and indeed from their hiding place he saw several parties of redskins moving along on the river bank carefully examining the ground  its lucky we didnt move along there he said to his companion for the ground is so soft that they would assuredly have found our tracks i expect that they think it possible that we may have been taken off in a boat during the night  i hope they will keep on thinking so the midshipman said then they will give up looking for us  they wont do that james replied for they will be sure that they must have seen our tracks had we passed along that muddy bank fortunately they have no clue to where we really are we might have gone east west or north and the country is so covered with bush that anything like a regular search is absolutely impossible  i hope we aint going to be very long before we get on board again the midshipman said as he munched the small piece of bread james served out to him for his dinner the grub wont last more than two days even at this starvation rate and that one bottle of water is a mockery i could finish it all straight off why we shall be as badly off as if we were adrift at sea in a boat  not quite so bad james replied we can chew the leaves of some of these bushes besides people dont die of hunger or thirst in four days and i hope before that to be safely on board  not until it was perfectly dark did they leave their hiding place and by the aid of the bushes worked their way up to the top of the ascent again james had impressed on his companion that on no account was he to speak above a whisper that he was to stop whenever he did and should he turn off and descend the slope he was at once to follow his example the midshipman kept close to his companion and marvelled how assuredly the latter walked along for he himself could see nothing  several times james stopped and listened presently he turned off to the right saying hush in the lowest possible tone and proceeding a few paces down the slope noiselessly lay down behind the bush the midshipman imitated his example though he wondered why he was so acting for he could hear nothing two or three minutes later he heard a low footfall and then the sound of men speaking in a low voice in some strange tongue he could not see them but held his breath as they were passing not till they had been gone some minutes did james rise and pursue his course  two indians he said and on the search for us one was just saying to the other he expected when they got back to camp to find that some of the other parties had overtaken us  another mile further and they saw the light of several fires ahead  that is a french battery james said we must make a detour and get to the other side of it then i will crawl back and see if there is any path down to the river  the detour was made and then leaving the midshipman in hiding a few paces from the edge james crawled back he soon saw by the fires that the battery was manned by sailors from the french fleet and he had little fear of these discovering him keeping well below them he came presently upon a narrow path above him he could hear a french sentry walking he followed the path down with the greatest caution stepping with the most extreme care to avoid displacing a stone he found the path was excessively steep and rugged little more indeed than a sheep track it took him half an hour to reach the bottom and he found that in some places sappers had been lately at work obliterating the path and that it could scarcely be considered practicable for men hampered with their arms and ammunition  another half hours work took him to the top again and a few minutes later he rejoined his companion  that wont do he said we must try again there is a path but the troops could scarcely climb it if unopposed and certainly could not do so without making such a noise as would attract the notice of the sentinels above  that is the battery they call sillery the midshipman said they have fired at us over and over again from there as we went up or down the river there is another about a mile further on it is called samos  upon reaching the samos battery james again crept up and reconnoitred the way down however was even more difficult than at sillery there was indeed no regular path and so steep was the descent that he doubted whether it would be possible for armed men to climb it even he exceptionally strong and active as he was and unencumbered with arms had the greatest difficulty in making his way down and up again and indeed could only do so by grasping the trunks of trees and strong bushes  it cant be done there he said to the midshipman when he joined him again and now we must look for a hiding place we must have been five or six hours since we started and the nights are very short at any rate we cannot attempt another exploration before morning  i wish we could explore the inside of a farm house and light upon something to eat and drink the midshipman said  its no use wishing james replied we cant risk anything of that sort and probably all the farm houses are full of troops we have got a little bread left that will hold us over tomorrow comfortably  it may hold us middleton said but it certainly wont hold me comfortably my idea of comfort at the present time would be a round of beef and a gallon of ale  ah you are an epicure james laughed if you had had three or four years of campaigning in the forest as i have had you would learn to content yourself on something a good deal less than that  i might the boy said but i have my doubts about it theres one comfort we shall be able to sleep all day tomorrow and so i shant think about it as the indians did not find our tracks yesterday they are not likely to do so today  they were some time before they found a hiding place for the descent was so steep that they had to try several times before they could get down far enough to reach a spot screened by bushes and hidden from the sight of anyone passing above at last they did so and soon lay down to sleep after partaking of a mouthful of water each and a tiny piece of bread they passed the day for the most part in sleep but the midshipman woke frequently being now really parched with thirst each time he chewed a few leaves from the bush in which they were lying but derived but small comfort from it  its awful to think of tomorrow he said as evening approached even supposing you find a way down tonight it must be midnight tomorrow before we are taken off  if i find a way down james said i will if possible take you down with me and then we can take a long drink at the river but at any rate i will take the bottle down with me and bring it up full for you the next place to try is the spot where we saw some tents as we went up the river there is no battery there and the tents can only have been pitched there because there was some way down to the water it cannot be more than half a mile away for it was not more than a mile from fort samos  cant i go with you the midshipman said i will be as quiet as a cat and if you find it is a good path and come up to fetch me down you see there will be a treble risk of being seen  very well james agreed only mind if you set a stone rolling or break a twig it will cost us both our lives to say nothing of the failure of our expedition  i will be as quiet as a mouse you see if i aint the midshipman said confidently and i will try not to think even once of the water below there so as not to hurry  together they crept cautiously along the edge of the ridge until they came to a clump of some fifteen tents as they approached they could see by the light of the fires that the encampment was one of canadian troops  james had not intended to move forward until all were asleep but the men were all chatting round the fires and it did not seem to him that a sentry had as yet been placed on the edge of the descent he therefore crept forward at once followed closely by the midshipman keeping as far as possible down beyond the slope of the descent  presently he came to a path he saw at once that this was very different from the othersit was regularly cut sloping gradually down the face of the sharp descent and was wide enough for a cart to pass he at once took his way down it moving with the greatest caution lest a sentry should be posted some distance below it was very dark for in many places the trees met overhead  about halfway down he suddenly came to a stop for in front of him rose a bank breast high here if anywhere a sentry should have been placed and holding his companions arm james listened intently for some time  mind what you are doing he said in a whisper this is a breastwork and probably the path is cut away on the other side fortunately we are so far down the hill now that there is not much risk of their hearing any slight noise we might make you stand here till i find out whats on the other side  james climbed over the breastwork and cautiously let himself go on the other side he fell some five or six feet  come on he said in a low voice lower yourself down by your arms i can reach your legs then  the gap cut in the path was some ten feet across and six feet deep when with some difficulty they clambered up on the other side they found the path obstructed by a number of felled trees forming a thick abattis they managed to climb the steep hillside and kept along it until past the obstruction then they got on to the path again and found it unbroken to the bottom  so far so good james said now do you stop here while i crawl forward to the water the first thing to discover is whether they have a sentinel stationed anywhere near the bottom of this path  the time seemed terribly long to middleton before james returned though it was really but a few minutes  all right he said as he approached him there is no one here though i can hear some sentries farther up the river now you can come forward and have a drink fortunately the river is high  after having satisfied their thirst middleton asked  where are you going now i dont care how far we have got to march for after that drink i feel ready for anything  it wont do to hide anywhere near james said for if the boat which comes to take us off were to be seen it would put them on their guard and there would be plenty of sentries about here in future no we will keep along at the foot of the precipice till we are about halfway as far as we can tell between samos and sillery and then we will climb up as high as we can get and show our signal in the morning but you must be careful as we walk for as i told you there are some sentries posted by the waters edge higher up  i will be careful dont you fear the midshipman said there is not much fear of a fellow walking about in the dark without boots not being careful i knocked my toe against a rock just now and it was as much as i could do not to halloa i will be careful in future i can tell you  an hours walking brought them to a spot where the hill was rather less steep than usual they climbed up until they gained a spot some fifty feet above the level of the river and there sat down in a clump of bushes  as soon as its daylight we will choose a spot where we can show a signal without the risk of its being seen from below james said we mustnt go to sleep for we must move directly the dawn commences else those sentries below might make us out  at daybreak they shifted their position and gained a spot completely hidden from below but from which an entire view of the river could be obtained  tide will be low in a couple of hours the midshipman said there are the fleet below they will come up with the first flood so in three or four hours they will be abreast of us i hope they will make out our signal  i have no fear of that james replied they are sure to keep a sharp lookout for it  presently the tide grew slacker and half an hour later the ships were seen to hoist their sails and soon began to drop slowly up the river when they approached james fastened his handkerchief against the trunk of a tree well open to view from the river and then stood with his eyes fixed on the approaching ships just as the sutherland came abreast of the spot where they were standing the ensign was dipped james at once removed his handkerchief  now he said middleton you can turn in and take a sleep at twelve oclock tonight there will be a boat below for us  two or three hours after darkness had fallen james and his companion made their way down the slope and crawled out to the waters edge there was no sentry within hearing and they sat down by the edge of the river until suddenly a light gleamed for an instant low down on the water two or three hundred yards from the shore  they at once stepped into the river and wading out for some little distance struck out towards where they had seen the light a few minutes swimming and they saw something dark ahead another few strokes took them alongside and they were hauled into the boat  the slight noise attracted the attention of a sentry some little distance along the shore and his qui vive came sharply across the water followed a few seconds later by the flash of his gun  the crew now bent to their oars and a quarter of an hour later the boat was alongside the sutherland which with her consorts was slowly drifting up the stream general wolfe and the admiral were on deck and anxiously waiting the arrival of the boat the former in his anxiety hailed the boat as it approached  is captain james walsham on board  yes sir james replied  bravo bravo the general cried delighted  bravo he repeated seizing james walshams hand as he stepped on deck i did not expect to see you again captain walsham at least until we took quebec now come to my cabin at once and tell me all about it but perhaps you are hungry  i am rather hungry general james said quietly we have had nothing to eat but a crust of bread for three days  we who are we the general asked quickly  mr middleton and myself sir he escaped after i had left and joined me  the galley fires are out the admiral said but you shall have some cold meat in my cabin instantly  james was at once led to the cabin where in two or three minutes food and a bottle of wine were placed before him the general would not allow him to speak a word till his hunger was satisfied then when he saw him lay down his knife and fork he said  now captain walsham in the first place have you succeededhave you found a practicable path down to the river  i have found a path sir it is cut in one place and blocked with felled trees but the obstacles can be passed there are some canadians in tents near the top of the path but they seem to keep a very careless watch and no sentry is placed at the bottom or on the edge of the river anywhere near  admirable admirable wolfe exclaimed at last there is a chance of our outreaching montcalm and you were not seen examining the path nothing occurred to excite their suspicion and lead them to keep a better lookout in future  no sir james replied they have had no suspicion of my presence anywhere near the spot where i was taken off was two miles higher i moved away in order that if we were seen swimming off to the boat no suspicion should occur that we had been reconnoitring the pathway  that is right the general said now tell me the whole story of what you have been doing in your own way  james related his adventures up to the time when he was joined by the midshipman  but what made mr middleton escape the admiral asked i thought that his instructions were precise that he was to permit himself to be taken prisoner and was to remain quietly in quebec until we could either exchange him or take the place  that was how he understood his instructions sir james said but i would rather that you should question him yourself as to his reasons for escaping i may say they appear to me to be perfectly valid as an occurrence took place upon which it was impossible for captain peters to calculate when he gave them  james then finished the report of his proceedings and general wolfe expressed his great satisfaction at the result  i will put you in orders tomorrow for your brevetmajority he said and never was the rank more honourably earned  the admiral rang a hand bell  send mr middleton to me where is he  he is having supper in captain peters cabin  ask captain peters if he will be good enough to come in with him  a minute later captain peters entered followed by the midshipman  i suppose peters you have been asking young middleton the reason why he did not carry out his instructions  i have admiral captain peters said gravely and i was only waiting until you were disengaged to report the circumstance to you he had better tell you sir his own way  captain peters then took a seat at the table while the midshipman related his story in nearly the same words in which he had told it to james when he told of the account the canadian pilot had given of his escape the admiral exclaimed  but it seems altogether incredible that some one has unbolted the mans cabin from the outside seems manifest and it is clear that either gross treachery or gross carelessness enabled him to get free i own that although the sergeant of marines declares positively that he fastened the bolts i think that he could not have done so for treachery seems almost out of the question that an officer should have done this seems impossible and yet what the man says about the cabin and being let out by a rope would seem to show that it must have been an officer  i am sorry to say sir middleton said that the man gave proofs of the truth of what he was saying the officer he said gave him a paper which i heard and saw the general reading aloud it was a warning that captain walsham had purposely allowed himself to be captured and that he was in fact a spy the french officer in his haste laid down the paper on the table when he rushed out and i had just time to creep under the canvas seize it and make off with it here it is sir i have showed it to captain peters  the admiral took the paper and read it and handed it without a word to general wolfe  that is proof conclusive he said peters do you know the handwriting  yes captain peters said gravely i recognized it at once as did mr middleton it is the handwriting of lieutenant horton  but what on earth could be the motive of this unhappy young man the admiral asked  i imagine sir from what i saw on the evening before captain walsham set out and indeed from what captain walsham said when i questioned him that it was a case of private enmity against captain walsham  is this so captain walsham general wolfe asked  i have no enmity against him sir james said though i own that his manner impressed me with the idea that he regarded me as an enemy the fact is we lived near each other as boys and we had a fight i got the best of it he gave an account of the affair which was not exactly correct to his uncle mr linthorne a wealthy landowner and a magistrate the latter had me up at the justice room but i brought forward witnesses who gave their account of the affair mr linthorne considered that his nephewwhom he had at that time regarded as his heirhad not given a correct account and was so angry that he sent him to sea  i would say sir he said earnestly that were it possible i should have wished this unhappy affair to be passed over  impossible the admiral and general said together  i fear it is impossible now sir james said gravely but it might have been stopped before  captain walsham wanted me to tear up the note the midshipman put in but though i was awfully sorry such a thing should happen to an officer of the sutherland i was obliged to refuse to do so as i thought it was my duty to hand the note to you  certainly it was mr middleton the admiral said there can be no question about that  i wonder that you even suggested such a thing captain walsham the general remarked this was not a private affair the whole success of the enterprise was jeopardized  it was sir james said quietly but you must remember that at the time i asked mr middleton to tear up the note it had ceased to be jeopardized for i had got fairly away i am under great obligations to mr linthorne and would do much to save him pain i regarded this act not as one of treason against the country but as one of personal enmity to myself and i am sure that lieutenant horton himself did not think of the harm that his letter might do to the cause but was blinded by his passion against me  your conduct does credit to your heart captain walsham if not to your head general wolfe said  the admiral rang the bell  tell lieutenant horton that i wish to speak to him and order a corporal with a file of marines to be at the door  the messenger found lieutenant horton pacing the quarterdeck with hurried steps on the receipt of the message instead of going directly to the admirals cabin he ran down below caught something from a shelf by his berth placed it in the breast of his coat and then went to the admirals cabin the corporal with the two marines had already taken his station there the young officer drew a deep breath and entered  a deadly fear had seized him from the moment he saw the signal of james walsham although it seemed impossible to him that his treachery could have been discovered the sudden summons at this hour of the night confirmed his fears and it was with a face almost as pale as death that he entered the cabin  lieutenant horton the admiral said you are accused of having assisted in the escape of the pilot who was our prisoner on board this ship you are further accused of releasing him with the special purpose that the plans which general wolfe had laid to obtain information might be thwarted  who accuses me richard horton asked captain walsham is my enemy he has for years intrigued against me and sought to do me harm he was the companion of smugglers and was captured by the thetis and had the choice of being sent to prison and tried for his share in the killing of some of the coast guards or of going before the mast i was a lieutenant in the thetis at the time and i suppose because i did not then interfere on his behalf he has now trumped up this accusation against me an accusation i defy him to prove  you are mistaken lieutenant horton the admiral said captain walsham is not your accuser nay more he has himself committed a grave dereliction of duty in trying to screen you and by endeavouring to destroy the principal evidence against you mr middleton overheard a conversation between the canadian pilot and the french general and the former described how he had been liberated by an english officer who assisted him to escape by a rope from the porthole in his cabin  i do not see that that is any evidence against me richard horton said in the first place the man may have been lying in the second place unless he mentioned my name why am i suspected more than any other officer and even if he did mention my name my word is surely as good as that of a canadian prisoner it is probable that the man was released by one of the crewsome man perhaps who owed me a grudgewho told him to say that it was i who freed him in hopes that some day this outrageous story might get about  your suggestions are plausible mr horton the admiral said coldly unfortunately it is not on the word of this canadian that we have to depend  there sir he said holding out the letter there is the chief witness against you captain peters instantly recognized your handwriting as mr middleton had done before him  richard horton stood gazing speechlessly at the letter so confounded was he by the unexpected production of this fatal missive that he was unable to utter a single word of explanation or excuse  lay your sword on the table sir the admiral said and retire to your cabin where you will remain under close arrest till a court martial can be assembled  richard horton unbuckled his sword and laid it on the table and left the cabin without a word  it would have been better to send a guard with him captain peters said he might jump overboard or blow his brains out  quite so peters the admiral said the very thing that was in my mind when i told him to retire to his cabinthe very best thing he could do for himself and for the service a nice scandal it would be to have to try and hang a naval officer for treachery  i am sure you agree with me general  thoroughly the general said let him blow his brains out or desert but you had best keep a sharp lookout that he does not desert at present after we have once effected our landing i should say keep as careless a watch over him as possible but dont let him go before it is bad enough that the french know that captain walsham went ashore for the purpose of discovering a landing place but it would be worse were they to become aware that he has rejoined the ships and that he was taken off by a boat within a couple of miles of the spot where we mean to land  the admiral was right richard horton had when summoned to the cabin hastily placed a pistol in his bosom with the intention of blowing out his brains should he find that the discovery he dreaded had been made had the marines posted outside the cabin been ordered to accompany him he would at once have carried his purpose into execution but finding himself free he walked to his cabin still determined to blow out his brains before morning but the impulse once past he could not summon up resolution to carry his resolve into effect he would do it he said to himself before the court martial came on that would be time enough  this was the decision he arrived at when the morning dawned upon him lying despairing in his cot    chapter 21 the capture of quebec   on the day on which he received james report wolfe issued his orders for the attack colonel burton at point levi was to bring up every man who could be spared to assist in the enterprise and that officer accordingly marched to the spot indicated for embarkation after nightfall with 1200 men  as night approached the main fleet under admiral saunders below quebec ranged itself opposite beauport and opened a tremendous cannonade while the boats were lowered and filled with sailors and marines montcalm believing that the movements of the english above the town were only a feint and that their main body was still below it massed his troops in front of beauport to repel the expected landing  to colonel howe of the light infantry was given the honour of leading the little party who were to suddenly attack vergors camp at the head of the path james walsham knowing the way was to accompany him as second in command twentyfour picked men volunteered to follow them thirty large troop boats and some boats belonging to the ships were in readiness and 1700 men took their places in them  the tide was still flowing and the better to deceive the french the vessels and boats were allowed to drift upwards for a little distance as if to attempt to effect a landing above cap rouge wolfe had that day gained some intelligence which would assist him to deceive the enemy for he learned that a number of boats laden with provisions from quebec were coming down with the tide  wolfe was on board the sutherland he was somewhat stronger than he had been for some days but felt a presentiment that he would die in the approaching battle about two oclock the tide began to ebb and two lanternsthe signal for the troops to put offwere shown in the rigging of the sutherland  fortune favoured the english bougainville had watched the vessels until he saw them begin to drift down again with the stream and thinking that they would return again with the flood as they had done for the last seven days allowed his weary troops to retire to their camp the battalion of guienne instead of encamping near the heights had remained on the saint charles and vergor an incapable and cowardly officer had gone quietly to bed and had allowed a number of the canadians under him to go away to their village to assist in getting in the harvest  for two hours the english boats drifted down with the stream as they neared their destination they suddenly were challenged by a french sentry an officer who spoke the language replied france  a quel regiment  de la reine the officer replied knowing that a part of that regiment was with bougainville the sentry believing that they were the expected provision boats allowed them to pass on  a few hundred yards further another sentry challenged them the same officer replied in french provision boats dont make a noise the english will hear us  a few minutes later the boats rowed up to the strand at the foot of the heights vergor had placed no sentry on the shore and the troops landed unchallenged guided by james walsham colonel howe with his twentyfour volunteers led the way as silently as they could they moved up the pathway until they gained the top and saw before them the outline of the tents they went at them with a rush vergor leaped from his bed and tried to run off but was shot in the heel and captured his men taken by surprise made little resistance one or two were caught but the rest fled  the main body of the troops were waiting for the most part in the boats by the edge of the bank not a word was spoken as the men listened almost breathlessly for a sound which would tell them whether the enterprise had succeeded suddenly the stillness was broken by the musketry on the top of the heights followed by a loud british cheer then all leapt from the boats and each man with his musket slung at his back scaled the rocks as best he might the narrow path had been made impassable by trenches and abattis but the obstructions were soon cleared away and the stream of soldiers poured steadily up  as soon as a sufficient number had gained the plateau strong parties were sent off to seize the batteries at samos and sillery which had just opened fire upon the boats and ships this was easily done and the english footing on the plateau was assured as fast as the boats were emptied of the men they rowed back to the ships to fetch more and the whole force was soon on shore the day began to break a few minutes after the advanced troops had gained the heights and before it was fairly daylight all the first party were drawn up in line ready to resist attack but no enemy was in sight a body of canadians who had sallied from the town on hearing the firing and moved along the strand towards the landing place had been quickly driven back and for the present no other sign of the enemy was to be seen  wolfe reconnoitred the ground and found a suitable place for a battle at a spot known as the plains of abraham from a pilot of that name who had owned a piece of land there in the early days of the colony it was a tract of grass with some cornfields here and there and studded by clumps of bushes on the south it was bounded by the steep fall down to the saint lawrence on the north it sloped gradually down to the saint charles  wolfe led his troops to this spot and formed them in line across the plateau and facing the city the right wing rested on the edge of the height along the saint lawrence but the left did not extend far enough to reach the slopes down to the saint charles to prevent being outflanked on this wing brigadier townshend was stationed here with two battalions drawn up at right angles to the rest and facing the saint charles webbs regiment formed the reserve the 3d battalion of royal americans were left to guard the landing and howes light infantry occupied a wood far in the rear of the force to check bougainville should he approach from that direction wolfe with his three brigadiers commanded the main body which when all the troops had arrived numbered less than three thousand five hundred men  quebec was less than a mile distant from the spot where the troops were posted in order of battle but an intervening ridge hid it from the sight of the troops at six oclock the white uniforms of the battalion of guienne which had marched up in hot haste from their camp on the saint charles made their appearance on the ridge and halted there awaiting reinforcements shortly afterwards there was an outbreak of hot firing in the rear where the light troops under colonel howe repulsed a detachment of bougainvilles command which came up and attacked them  montcalm had been on the alert all night the guns of saunders fleet thundered unceasingly opposite beauport and its boats hovered near the shore threatening a landing all night the french troops remained in their intrenchments accompanied by the chevalier johnston he remained all night in anxious expectation he felt that the critical moment had come but could not tell from which direction the blow was to arrive he had sent an officer to vaudreuil whose quarters were near quebec begging him to send word instantly should anything occur above the town  just at daybreak he heard the sound of cannon from that direction this was the battery at samos opening fire upon the english ships but no word came from vaudreuil and about six oclock montcalm mounted and accompanied by johnston rode towards the town as he approached the bridge across the saint charles the country behind the town opened to his view and he presently saw the red line of british troops drawn up on the heights above the river two miles away instantly he sent johnston off at full gallop to bring up the troops from the centre and left vaudreuil had already ordered up those on the right montcalm rode up to vaudreuils quarters and after a few words with the governor galloped over the bridge of the saint charles towards the seat of danger  it must have been a bitter moment for him the fruits of his long care and watching were in a moment snatched away and just when he hoped that the enemy foiled and exhausted were about to return to england he found that they had surmounted the obstacles he had deemed impregnable and were calmly awaiting him on a fair field of battle one who saw him said that he rode towards the field with a fixed look uttering not a word  the army followed in hot haste crossed the saint charles passed through quebec and hurried on to the ridge where the battalion of guienne had taken up its position nothing could have been stronger than the contrast which the two armies afforded on the one side was the red english line quiet and silent save that the war pipes of the highlanders blew loud and shrilly on the other were the whitecoated battalions of the regular army of france the blueclad canadians the bands of indians in their war paint and feathers all hurried and excited by their rapid march and by the danger which had so unexpectedly burst upon them  now the evils of a divided command were apparent vaudreuil countermanded montcalms orders for the advance of the left of the army as he feared that the english might make a descent upon beauport nor was the garrison of quebec available for ramesay its commander was under the orders of vaudreuil and when montcalm sent to him for twentyfive field guns from one of its batteries he only sent three saying that he wanted the rest for his own defence  montcalm held a council of war with all his officers and determined to attack at once for this he has been blamed that he must have fought was certain for the english in the position which they occupied cut him off from the base of his supplies but he might have waited for a few hours and in that time he could have sent messengers and brought up the force of bougainville which could have marched by a circuitous route and have joined him without coming in contact with the english  upon the other hand montcalm had every reason to believe that the thirtyfive hundred men he saw before him formed a portion only of the english army that the rest were still on board the fleet opposite beauport and that a delay would bring larger reinforcements to wolfe than he could himself receive he was as we know mistaken but his reasoning was sound and he had all along believed the english army to be far more numerous than it really was he was doubtless influenced by the fact that his troops were full of ardour and that any delay would greatly dispirit the canadians and indians  he therefore determined to attack at once the three field pieces sent by ramesay opened fire upon the english line with canister while fifteen hundred canadians and indians crept up among the bushes and knolls and through the cornfield and opened a heavy fire wolfe threw out skirmishers in front of the line to keep these assailants in check and ordered the rest of the troops to lie down to avoid the fire  on the british left the attack was most galling bands of the sharpshooters got among the thickets just below the edge of the declivity down to the saint charles and from these and from several houses scattered there they killed and wounded a considerable number of townshends men  howe was called up with his light troops from the rear and he and the two flank battalions of townshend dashed at the thickets and after some sharp fighting partially cleared them and took and burned some of the houses  towards ten oclock the french advanced to the attack their centre was formed of regular troops only with regulars and canadian battalions on either flank two field pieces which with enormous labour the english had dragged up the path from the landing place at once opened fire with grape upon the french line  the advance was badly conducted the french regulars marched steadily on but the canadians firing as they advanced threw themselves on the ground to reload and this broke the regularity of the line the english advanced some little distance to meet their foes and then halted  not a shot was fired until the french were within forty paces and then at the word of command a volley of musketry crashed out along the whole length of the line so regularly was the volley given that the french officers afterwards said that it sounded like a single cannon shot another volley followed and then the continuous roar of independent firing  when the smoke cleared off a little its effects could be seen the french had halted where they stood and among them the dead and wounded were thickly strewn all order and regularity had been lost under that terrible fire and in three minutes the line of advancing soldiers was broken up into a disorderly shouting mob then wolfe gave the order to charge and the british cheer mingled with the wild yell of the highlanders rose loud and fierce the english regiments advanced with levelled bayonets the highlanders drew their broadswords and rushed headlong forward  the charge was decisive the french were swept helplessly before it and the battle was at an end save that the scattered parties of canadians and indians kept up for some time a fire from the bushes and cornfields  their fire was heaviest on the british right where wolfe himself led the charge at the head of the louisbourg grenadiers a shot shattered his wrist he wrapped his handkerchief around it and kept on another shot struck him but he still advanced when a third pierced his breast he staggered and sat down two or three officers and men carried him to the rear and then laid him down and asked if they should send for a surgeon  there is no need he said it is all over with me  a moment later one of those standing by him cried out  they run see how they run  who run wolfe asked  the enemy sir they give way everywhere  go one of you to colonel burton wolfe said tell him to march webbs regiment down to the charles river to cut off their retreat from the bridge then turning on his side he said  now god be praised i will die in peace and a few minutes later he expired  montcalm still on horseback was borne by the tide of fugitives towards the town as he neared the gate a shot passed through his body  it needed some hard work before the canadians who fought bravely could be cleared out from the thickets the french troops did not rally from their disorder till they had crossed the saint charles the canadians retired in better order  decisive as the victory was the english for the moment were in no condition to follow it up while on the french side montcalm was dying and his second in command was mortally wounded on the english wolfe was dead and monckton second in rank badly wounded and the command had fallen upon townshend at the moment when the enemy were in full flight knowing that the french could cut the bridge of boats across the saint charles and so stop his pursuit and that bougainville was close at hand he halted his troops and set them to work to intrench themselves on the field of battle  their loss had been six hundred and sixtyfour of all ranks killed and wounded while the french loss was estimated at about double that number in point of numbers engaged and in the total loss on both sides the fight on the plains of abraham does not deserve to rank as a great battle but its results were of the most extreme importance for the victory transferred canada from france to england  vaudreuil after joining his force with that of bougainville would have still vastly outnumbered the english and could by taking up a fresh position in their rear have rendered himself impregnable until the winter forced the english to retire while the latter had no means of investing or besieging quebec but his weakness was now as great as his presumption had been before and on the evening of the battle he abandoned the lines of beauport and leaving all his tents and stores behind him retreated hastily or rather it may be said fled for as the chevalier johnston said of it  it was not a retreat but an abominable flight with such disorder and confusion that had the english known it three hundred men sent after us would have been sufficient to have cut all our army to pieces the soldiers were all mixed scattered dispersed and running as hard as they could as if the english army were at their heels  the flight was continued until they reached the impregnable position of jacques cartier on the brink of the saint lawrence thirty miles from the scene of action  montcalm died in quebec the next morning levis soon arrived at jacques cartier from montreal and took the command and at once attempted to restore order and persuaded vaudreuil to march back to join bougainville who had remained firmly with his command at cap rouge while the horde of fugitives swept by him vaudreuil before leaving had given orders to ramesay to surrender if quebec was threatened by assault and levis on his march to its relief was met by the news that on the morning of the 18th ramesay had surrendered  the garrison was utterly dispirited and unwilling to fight the officers were even more anxious to surrender than the men and on the fleet approaching the walls ramesay obeyed vaudreuils orders and surrendered townshend granted favourable conditions for he knew that levis was approaching and that his position was dangerous in the extreme he therefore agreed that the troops and sailors of the garrison should march out from the place with the honours of war and were to be carried to france and that the inhabitants should have protection in person and property and free exercise of religion  the day after the capture of quebec james walsham returned on board ship the thought of richard horton awaiting the court martial which would assuredly award him the sentence of death for his treachery was constantly in his mind he remembered the conversation between captain peters and the admiral and general wolfes words i should say keep as careless a watch over him as possible and he determined if possible to aid him in making his escape confident that in the general exultation at the success of the enterprise no one would trouble greatly about the matter and that the admiral would be only too pleased that an inquiry should be avoided which could but end in the disgrace and execution of a naval officer  james was relieved when on his arrival he found that richard horton was still in confinement for he feared that he might have carried out the other alternative spoken of by the admiral and might have committed suicide  captain peters he said going up to that officer i should be obliged if you would give me an order to see lieutenant horton  cant do it my lad the admirals orders are precise nobody is to be admitted to see him without an order signed by himself  james accordingly sought the admirals cabin  what do you want to see him for eh the admiral asked  james hesitated he would not tell an untruth in the matter and yet he could think of no excuse which could answer without doing so  i want to see him sir to have some conversation with him  ah the admiral said looking at him keenly conversation eh you are not going to take him a pistol or poison or anything of that sort to help him to put an end to his wretched existence  no indeed sir james said warmly  humph you are not thinking i hope he said with a twinkle of the eye of helping him to escape  james was silent  well well the admiral said hastily thats not a fair question to ask however i will tell you in confidence that if he should escape which is the most unlikely thing in the world you know no one would be particularly sorry and there would be no great fuss made about it everyone in the navy here would feel it cast a slur upon the service if at a time like this a naval officer were tried and shot for treachery however if it must be it must  here is an order for you to see him if it was anyone else i might have my doubts about granting it but as you are the man against whom he played this scurvy trick i feel safe in doing so  there you are my lad give me your hand you are a fine fellow major walsham a very fine fellow  immediately upon entering quebec james had purchased a large turnscrew some ten yards of fine but strong rope and three or four bladders when he procured the order he went to his cabin took off his coat wound the rope round his body and then putting on his coat placed the flattened bladders under it and buttoned it up slipping the turnscrew up his sleeve and then proceeded to the prisoners cabin the sentry at once admitted him on producing the admirals order  richard horton was lying down on his berth and started with surprise as his visitor entered  i am glad you have come to see me james walsham for i have been wishing to speak to you and i thought you would come i have been thinking much for the last two days i know that it is all up with me the proofs are too strong and i will not face a court martial for i have the meansi know i may tell you safelyof avoiding it the hour that brings me news that the court is ordered to assemble i cease to live  when a man is at that point he sees things more clearly perhaps than he did before i know that i have wronged you and when the admiral said that you had done all in your power to shield me i felt more humiliated than i did when that fatal letter was produced i know what you have come forto tell me that you bear me no malice you are a fine fellow walsham and deserve all your good fortune just as i deserve what has befallen me i think if it had not been for the squire taking me up i should never have come to this but might have grown up a decent fellow but my head was turned i thought i was going to be a great man and this is what has come of it  i have come partly as you suppose to tell you that i bear you no malice richard horton i too have thought matters over and understand your feeling against me that first unfortunate quarrel and its unfortunate result set you against me and perhaps i never did as much as i might to turn your feelings the other way however we will not talk more of that all that is past and over i come to you now as the nephew of the man who has done so much for me i have brought with me the means of aiding your escape  of aiding my escape walsham you must be mad i am too securely fastened here and even were it not so i would not accept a kindness which would cost you your commission were it known  as to the second reason you may make your mind easy from words which dropped from the admiral i am sure that everyone will be so glad at your escape that no very strict inquiry will be made in the next place your fastenings are not so very secure the porthole is screwed down as usual  yes horton said but in addition there are a dozen strong screws placed round it  here is a long turnscrew which will take them out as quickly as the carpenter put them in james said producing the tool and here and he opened his coat is a rope for lowering yourself down into the water  you are very good james horton said quietly but it is no use i cant swim  i know you could not as a boy james replied and i thought it likely enough that you have not learned since but i think with these you may make a shift to get ashore and he produced four bladders and some strong lashing if you blow these out fasten the necks tightly and then lash them round you you cant sink the drift of the tide will take you not very far from the point below and if you do your best to strike out towards the shore i have no doubt you will be able to make it you must lower yourself into the water very quietly and allow yourself to float down till you are well astern of the vessel  richard horton stood for a minute or two with his hand over his eyes then he said in a broken voice  god bless you walsham i will try it if i am shot tis better than dying by my own hand if i escape i will do my best to retrieve my life i shall never return to england again but under a new name may start afresh in the colonies god bless you and make you happy  the young men wrung each other hands with a silent clasp and james returned to his own cabin  the next morning the officer of marines reported to captain peters that the prisoner was missing the porthole was found open and a rope hanging to the waters edge the captain at once took the report to the admiral  a bad job the admiral said with a twinkle of the eye a very bad job how could it have happened  the sentries report sir that they heard no noise during the night and that the only person who visited the cabin with the exception of the sergeant with the prisoners food was major walsham with your own order  yes now i think of it i did give him an order but of course he can have had nothing to do with it horton must have managed to unscrew the porthole somehow perhaps with a pocketknife and he might have had a coil of rope somewhere in his cabin great carelessness you know however at a time like this we need not bother our heads about it hes gone and theres an end of it  he could not swim sir the captain said i heard him say so once  then most likely hes drowned the admiral remarked briskly thats the best thing that could happen enter it so in the log book lieutenant horton fell out of his cabin window while under arrest for misconduct supposed to have been drowned that settles the whole matter  captain peters smiled to himself as he made the entry he was convinced by the calm manner in which the admiral took it that he more than suspected that the prisoner had escaped and that james walsham had had a hand in getting him off  shortly after quebec surrendered townshend returned to england with the fleet leaving murray in command of the army at quebec in the spring levis advanced with eight or nine thousand men against quebec and murray with three thousand advanced to meet him and gave battle nearly on the same ground on which the previous battle had been fought the fight was a desperate one but the english being outflanked by the superior numbers of the french were driven back into quebec with the loss of a third of their number  quebec was now besieged by the french until in may an english fleet arrived and destroyed the vessels which had brought down the stores and ammunition of levis from montreal the french at once broke up their camp and retreated hastily but all hope was now gone the loss of quebec had cut them off from france  amherst invaded the country from the english colonies and the french were driven back to montreal before which the united english forces 17000 strong took up their position and on the 8th of september 1760 vaudreuil signed the capitulation by which canada and all its dependencies passed to the english crown all the french officers civil and military and the french troops and sailors were to be sent back to france in english ships  james walsham was not present at the later operations round quebec he had been struck in the side by a shot by a lurking indian when a column had marched out from quebec a few days after its capture and for three or four weeks he lay between life and death on board ship when convalescence set in he found that he was already on blue water all the serious cases being taken back by the fleet when soon after the capture of quebec it sailed for england  the voyage was a long one and by the time the fleet sailed with their convoy into portsmouth harbour james had recovered much of his strength an hour after landing he was in a post chaise on his way home it seemed strange indeed to him as he drove through the little town on his way up to the hall he had left it in the beginning of 1755 a raw young fellow of eighteen he returned in the last month of 1759 a man of twentythree with the rank of major and no inconsiderable share of credit and honour  he stopped the vehicle at the lodge gate had his baggage taken out there and proceeded on foot towards the hall for he was afraid that if he drove straight up to the door the sudden delight of seeing him would be too much for his mother  john petersham opened the door and recognizing him at once was about to exclaim loudly when james made a motion for him to be silent  show me quietly into the squires study john he said grasping the butlers hand with a hearty squeeze and dont say anything about my being here until he has seen my mother they are all well i hope  all well sir and right glad they will be to see you for mrs walsham and all of them have been fretting sorely since the news came that you were badly wounded  i have had a narrow shave of it james said but thank god i am as well now as ever  as he spoke he opened the door of the study and entered the squire who was reading the paper looked up and leapt to his feet with a cry of satisfaction  my dear boy i am gladthank god you are back again what a relief your coming will be to us all  and he shook james warmly by both hands  i should hardly have known you and yet you are not so much changed either dear dear how delighted your mother will be you have not seen her yet  no sir james said i dismissed the post chaise at the gate and walked up quietly i was afraid if i drove suddenly up the shock might be too much for her  quite right the squire said we must break it to her quietly wilks must do itor no he shall tell aggie and she shall tell your mother  he rang the bell and john who had been expecting a summons instantly appeared  tell mr wilks i want to speak to him john  the old soldier speedily appeared and his delight was as great as if james had been his son he went off to break the news and in a short time mrs walsham was in the arms of her son  major walsham went no more to the wars nor did he follow his original intention of entering the medical profession indeed there was no occasion for him to do either for aggie insisted on his leaving the army and she had a very strong voice in the matter james had not long been home before he and the young lady came to an understanding before speaking to her james had consulted his old friend  you know how i feel he said but i dont know whether it would be right you see although i am major in the service i have nothing but my pay i owe everything to the squire and he would naturally look very much higher for a husband for his granddaughter  dont you be a fool james walsham mr wilks said i made up my mind that you should marry aggie ever since the day when you got her out of the sea the squire has known for years what i thought on the subject you will meet with no opposition from him for he is almost as proud of you as i am besides he thinks only of aggies happiness and unless i am greatly mistaken that young lady has fully made up her mind on the subject  this was indeed the case for aggie when james had settled the point with her made no hesitation in telling him that she had regarded him as her special property since she had been a child  i considered it all settled years and years ago she said demurely and i was quite aggrieved i can tell you when on your arrival you just held out your hand to me instead ofwell instead of doing the same to me as to your mother  you shall have no reason for complaint that way in the future aggie i promise you but how could i tell the last time i saw you you were flirting as hard as you could with someone else  well sir whose fault was that you chose to make yourself disagreeable and stay away and what was i to do i should do the same in the future i can tell you if you neglected me in the same way  i shant give you the chance aggie you can rely upon that  the squire was fully prepared for the communication which james had to make to him and as there were no reasons for waiting the ceremony took place very shortly afterwards  the squire never asked any questions about his nephew the official report had come home that lieutenant horton had died of drowning while under arrest but the squire forbore all inquiry and to the end of his life remained in ignorance of the disgraceful circumstances  perhaps in his heart the news was a relief to him he had never been fond of richard as a lad and his confidence once shaken had never been restored he had intended to carry out his promise to leave him twenty thousand pounds but he was well pleased that all that belonged to him should descend to his granddaughter mr wilks was the only resident at the hall who ever learned from james the facts of richard hortons disgrace  years afterwards a few lines without signature or address came to james from america the writer said that he was sure that he would be glad to hear that under a changed name he was doing very well  i shall never return to england he ended nor ever forget your kindness and generosity  the marriage of the young people made but few changes at the hall the squire proposed to give aggie at once a sum which would have purchased an estate in the neighbourhood but he was delighted to find that she and james had made up their minds that the party at the hall should not be broken up  what do you want to send us away for grandpapa she asked you three will be happier for having us with you and james and i will be happier for having you with us what nonsense to talk about buying another estate we might get a little house up in london it would make a change for james and me to spend two or three months every year there but of course this will be our home  and so it was arranged and so matters continued until in the lapse of time the seniors passed away and james walsham and his wife and it may be said their children became the sole occupants of the hall the estate having been largely increased by the purchase of adjoining property by the squire before his death james walsham might have represented his county in parliament had he chosen but he was far too happy in his country life varied by a few months passed every year in town to care about taking part in the turmoil of politics he did much for sidmouth and especially for its fishermen and to the end of his life retained a passionate love for the sea
