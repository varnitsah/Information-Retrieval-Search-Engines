88679260	the rise and progress of palaeontology  this is essay 2 from science and hebrew tradition  by thomas henry huxley    that application of the sciences of biology and geology which is commonly known as palaeontology took its origin in the mind of the first person who finding something like a shell or a bone naturally imbedded in gravel or rock indulged in speculations upon the nature of this thing which he had dug outthis fossiland upon the causes which had brought it into such a position in this rudimentary form a high antiquity may safely be ascribed to palaeontology inasmuch as we know that 500 years before the christian era the philosophic doctrines of xenophanes were influenced by his observations upon the fossil remains exposed in the quarries of syracuse from this time forth not only the philosophers but the poets the historians the geographers of antiquity occasionally refer to fossils and after the revival of learning lively controversies arose respecting their real nature but hardly more than two centuries have elapsed since this fundamental problem was first exhaustively treated it was only in the last century that the archaeological value of fossilstheir importance i mean as records of the history of the earthwas fully recognised the first adequate investigation of the fossil remains of any large group of vertebrated animals is to be found in cuviers recherches sur les ossemens fossiles completed in 1822 and so modern is stratigraphical palaeontology that its founder william smith lived to receive the just recognition of his services by the award of the first wollaston medal in 1831  but although palaeontology is a comparatively youthful scientific speciality the mass of materials with which it has to deal is already prodigious in the last fifty years the number of known fossil remains of invertebrated animals has been trebled or quadrupled the work of interpretation of vertebrate fossils the foundations of which were so solidly laid by cuvier was carried on with wonderful vigour and success by agassiz in switzerland by von meyer in germany and last but not least by owen in this country while in later years a multitude of workers have laboured in the same field in many groups of the animal kingdom the number of fossil forms already known is as great as that of the existing species in some cases it is much greater and there are entire orders of animals of the existence of which we should know nothing except for the evidence afforded by fossil remains with all this it may be safely assumed that at the present moment we are not acquainted with a tittle of the fossils which will sooner or later be discovered if we may judge by the profusion yielded within the last few years by the tertiary formations of north america there seems to be no limit to the multitude of mammalian remains to be expected from that continent and analogy leads us to expect similar riches in eastern asia whenever the tertiary formations of that region are as carefully explored again we have as yet almost everything to learn respecting the terrestrial population of the mesozoic epoch and it seems as if the western territories of the united states were about to prove as instructive in regard to this point as they have in respect of tertiary life my friend professor marsh informs me that within two years remains of more than 160 distinct individuals of mammals belonging to twenty species and nine genera have been found in a space not larger than the floor of a goodsized room while beds of the same age have yielded 300 reptiles varying in size from a length of 60 feet or 80 feet to the dimensions of a rabbit  the task which i have set myself tonight is to endeavour to lay before you as briefly as possible a sketch of the successive steps by which our present knowledge of the facts of palaeontology and of those conclusions from them which are indisputable has been attained and i beg leave to remind you at the outset that in attempting to sketch the progress of a branch of knowledge to which innumerable labours have contributed my business is rather with generalisations than with details it is my object to mark the epochs of palaeontology not to recount all the events of its history  that which i just now called the fundamental problem of palaeontology the question which has to be settled before any other can be profitably discussed is this what is the nature of fossils are they as the healthy common sense of the ancient greeks appears to have led them to assume without hesitation the remains of animals and plants or are they as was so generally maintained in the fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth centuries mere figured stones portions of mineral matter which have assumed the forms of leaves and shells and bones just as those portions of mineral matter which we call crystals take on the form of regular geometrical solids or again are they as others thought the products of the germs of animals and of the seeds of plants which have lost their way as it were in the bowels of the earth and have achieved only an imperfect and abortive development it is easy to sneer at our ancestors for being disposed to reject the first in favour of one or other of the last two hypotheses but it is much more profitable to try to discover why they who were really not one whit less sensible persons than our excellent selves should have been led to entertain views which strike us as absurd the belief in what is erroneously called spontaneous generation that is to say in the development of living matter out of mineral matter apart from the agency of preexisting living matter as an ordinary occurrence at the present daywhich is still held by some of us was universally accepted as an obvious truth by them they could point to the arborescent forms assumed by hoarfrost and by sundry metallic minerals as evidence of the existence in nature of a plastic force competent to enable inorganic matter to assume the form of organised bodies then as every one who is familiar with fossils knows they present innumerable gradations from shells and bones which exactly resemble the recent objects to masses of mere stone which however accurately they repeat the outward form of the organic body have nothing else in common with it and thence to mere traces and faint impressions in the continuous substance of the rock what we now know to be the results of the chemical changes which take place in the course of fossilisation by which mineral is substituted for organic substance might in the absence of such knowledge be fairly interpreted as the expression of a process of development in the opposite directionfrom the mineral to the organic moreover in an age when it would have seemed the most absurd of paradoxes to suggest that the general level of the sea is constant while that of the solid land fluctuates up and down through thousands of feet in a secular ground swell it may well have appeared far less hazardous to conceive that fossils are sports of nature than to accept the necessary alternative that all the inland regions and highlands in the rocks of which marine shells had been found had once been covered by the ocean it is not so surprising therefore as it may at first seem that although such men as leonardo da vinci and bernard palissy took just views of the nature of fossils the opinion of the majority of their contemporaries set strongly the other way nor even that error maintained itself long after the scientific grounds of the true interpretation of fossils had been stated in a manner that left nothing to be desired in the latter half of the seventeenth century the person who rendered this good service to palaeontology was nicolas steno professor of anatomy in florence though a dane by birth collectors of fossils at that day were familiar with certain bodies termed glossopetrae and speculation was rife as to their nature in the first half of the seventeenth century fabio colonna had tried to convince his colleagues of the famous accademia dei lincei that the glossopetrae were merely fossil sharks teeth but his arguments made no impression fifty years later steno reopened the question and by dissecting the head of a shark and pointing out the very exact correspondence of its teeth with the glossopetrae left no rational doubt as to the origin of the latter thus far the work of steno went little further than that of colonna but it fortunately occurred to him to think out the whole subject of the interpretation of fossils and the result of his meditations was the publication in 1669 of a little treatise with the very quaint title of de solido intra solidum naturaliter contento the general course of stenos argument may be stated in a few words fossils are solid bodies which by some natural process have come to be contained within other solid bodies namely the rocks in which they are embedded and the fundamental problem of palaeontology stated generally is this given a body endowed with a certain shape and produced in accordance with natural laws to find in that body itself the evidence of the place and manner of its production 1 the only way of solving this problem is by the application of the axiom that like effects imply like causes or as steno puts it in reference to this particular case that bodies which are altogether similar have been produced in the same way 2 hence since the glossopetrae are altogether similar to sharks teeth they must have been produced by sharklike fishes and since many fossil shells correspond down to the minutest details of structure with the shells of existing marine or freshwater animals they must have been produced by similar animals and the like reasoning is applied by steno to the fossil bones of vertebrated animals whether aquatic or terrestrial to the obvious objection that many fossils are not altogether similar to their living analogues differing in substance while agreeing in form or being mere hollows or impressions the surfaces of which are figured in the same way as those of animal or vegetable organisms steno replies by pointing out the changes which take place in organic remains embedded in the earth and how their solid substance may be dissolved away entirely or replaced by mineral matter until nothing is left of the original but a cast an impression or a mere trace of its contours the principles of investigation thus excellently stated and illustrated by steno in 1669 are those which have consciously or unconsciously guided the researches of palaeontologists ever since even that feat of palaeontology which has so powerfully impressed the popular imagination the reconstruction of an extinct animal from a tooth or a bone is based upon the simplest imaginable application of the logic of steno a moments consideration will show in fact that stenos conclusion that the glossopetrae are sharks teeth implies the reconstruction of an animal from its tooth it is equivalent to the assertion that the animal of which the glossopetrae are relics had the form and organisation of a shark that it had a skull a vertebral column and limbs similar to those which are characteristic of this group of fishes that its heart gills and intestines presented the peculiarities which those of all sharks exhibit nay even that any hard parts which its integument contained were of a totally different character from the scales of ordinary fishes these conclusions are as certain as any based upon probable reasonings can be and they are so simply because a very large experience justifies us in believing that teeth of this particular form and structure are invariably associated with the peculiar organisation of sharks and are never found in connection with other organisms why this should be we are not at present in a position even to imagine we must take the fact as an empirical law of animal morphology the reason of which may possibly be one day found in the history of the evolution of the shark tribe but for which it is hopeless to seek for an explanation in ordinary physiological reasonings every one practically acquainted with palaeontology is aware that it is not every tooth nor every bone which enables us to form a judgment of the character of the animal to which it belonged and that it is possible to possess many teeth and even a large portion of the skeleton of an extinct animal and yet be unable to reconstruct its skull or its limbs it is only when the tooth or bone presents peculiarities which we know by previous experience to be characteristic of a certain group that we can safely predict that the fossil belonged to an animal of the same group any one who finds a cows grinder may be perfectly sure that it belonged to an animal which had two complete toes on each foot and ruminated any one who finds a horses grinder may be as sure that it had one complete toe on each foot and did not ruminate but if ruminants and horses were extinct animals of which nothing but the grinders had ever been discovered no amount of physiological reasoning could have enabled us to reconstruct either animal still less to have divined the wide differences between the two cuvier in the discours sur les revolutions de la surface du globe strangely credits himself and has ever since been credited by others with the invention of a new method of palaeontological research but if you will turn to the recherches sur les ossemens fossiles and watch cuvier not speculating but working you will find that his method is neither more nor less than that of steno if he was able to make his famous prophecy from the jaw which lay upon the surface of a block of stone to the pelvis of the same animal which lay hidden in it it was not because either he or any one else knew or knows why a certain form of jaw is as a rule constantly accompanied by the presence of marsupial bones but simply because experience has shown that these two structures are coordinated   the settlement of the nature of fossils led at once to the next advance of palaeontology viz its application to the deciphering of the history of the earth when it was admitted that fossils are remains of animals and plants it followed that in so far as they resemble terrestrial or freshwater animals and plants they are evidences of the existence of land or fresh water and in so far as they resemble marine organisms they are evidences of the existence of the sea at the time at which they were parts of actually living animals and plants moreover in the absence of evidence to the contrary it must be admitted that the terrestrial or the marine organisms implied the existence of land or sea at the place in which they were found while they were yet living in fact such conclusions were immediately drawn by everybody from the time of xenophanes downwards who believed that fossils were really organic remains steno discusses their value as evidence of repeated alteration of marine and terrestrial conditions upon the soil of tuscany in a manner worthy of a modern geologist the speculations of de maillet in the beginning of the eighteenth century turn upon fossils and buffon follows him very closely in those two remarkable works the theorie de la terre and the epoques de la nature with which he commenced and ended his career as a naturalist  the opening sentences of the epoques de la nature show us how fully buffon recognised the analogy of geological with archaeological inquiries as in civil history we consult deeds seek for coins or decipher antique inscriptions in order to determine the epochs of human revolutions and fix the date of moral events so in natural history we must search the archives of the world recover old monuments from the bowels of the earth collect their fragmentary remains and gather into one body of evidence all the signs of physical change which may enable us to look back upon the different ages of nature it is our only means of fixing some points in the immensity of space and of setting a certain number of waymarks along the eternal path of time  buffon enumerates five classes of these monuments of the past history of the earth and they are all facts of palaeontology in the first place he says shells and other marine productions are found all over the surface and in the interior of the dry land and all calcareous rocks are made up of their remains secondly a great many of these shells which are found in europe are not now to be met with in the adjacent seas and in the slates and other deepseated deposits there are remains of fishes and of plants of which no species now exist in our latitudes and which are either extinct or exist only in more northern climates thirdly in siberia and in other northern regions of europe and of asia bones and teeth of elephants rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses occur in such numbers that these animals must once have lived and multiplied in those regions although at the present day they are confined to southern climates the deposits in which these remains are found are superficial while those which contain shells and other marine remains lie much deeper fourthly tusks and bones of elephants and hippopotamuses are found not only in the northern regions of the old world but also in those of the new world although at present neither elephants nor hippopotamuses occur in america fifthly in the middle of the continents in regions most remote from the sea we find an infinite number of shells of which the most part belong to animals of those kinds which still exist in southern seas but of which many others have no living analogues so that these species appear to be lost destroyed by some unknown cause it is needless to inquire how far these statements are strictly accurate they are sufficiently so to justify buffons conclusions that the dry land was once beneath the sea that the formation of the fossiliferous rocks must have occupied a vastly greater lapse of time than that traditionally ascribed to the age of the earth that fossil remains indicate different climatal conditions to have obtained in former times and especially that the polar regions were once warmer that many species of animals and plants have become extinct and that geological change has had something to do with geographical distribution  but these propositions almost constitute the framework of palaeontology in order to complete it but one addition was needed and that was made in the last years of the eighteenth century by william smith whose work comes so near our own times that many living men may have been personally acquainted with him this modest landsurveyor whose business took him into many parts of england profited by the peculiarly favourable conditions offered by the arrangement of our secondary strata to make a careful examination and comparison of their fossil contents at different points of the large area over which they extend the result of his accurate and widelyextended observations was to establish the important truth that each stratum contains certain fossils which are peculiar to it and that the order in which the strata characterised by these fossils are superimposed one upon the other is always the same this most important generalisation was rapidly verified and extended to all parts of the world accessible to geologists and now it rests upon such an immense mass of observations as to be one of the best established truths of natural science to the geologist the discovery was of infinite importance as it enabled him to identify rocks of the same relative age however their continuity might be interrupted or their composition altered but to the biologist it had a still deeper meaning for it demonstrated that throughout the prodigious duration of time registered by the fossiliferous rocks the living population of the earth had undergone continual changes not merely by the extinction of a certain number of the species which had at first existed but by the continual generation of new species and the no less constant extinction of old ones  thus the broad outlines of palaeontology in so far as it is the common property of both the geologist and the biologist were marked out at the close of the last century in tracing its subsequent progress i must confine myself to the province of biology and indeed to the influence of palaeontology upon zoological morphology and i accept this limitation the more willingly as the no less important topic of the bearing of geology and of palaeontology upon distribution has been luminously treated in the address of the president of the geographical section 3  the succession of the species of animals and plants in time being established the first question which the zoologist or the botanist had to ask himself was what is the relation of these successive species one to another and it is a curious circumstance that the most important event in the history of palaeontology which immediately succeeded william smiths generalisation was a discovery which could it have been rightly appreciated at the time would have gone far towards suggesting the answer which was in fact delayed for more than half a century i refer to cuviers investigation of the mammalian fossils yielded by the quarries in the older tertiary rocks of montmartre among the chief results of which was the bringing to light of two genera of extinct hoofed quadrupeds the anoplotherium and the palaeotherium the rich materials at cuviers disposition enabled him to obtain a full knowledge of the osteology and of the dentition of these two forms and consequently to compare their structure critically with that of existing hoofed animals the effect of this comparison was to prove that the anoplotherium though it presented many points of resemblance with the pigs on the one hand and with the ruminants on the other differed from both to such an extent that it could find a place in neither group in fact it held in some respects an intermediate position tending to bridge over the interval between these two groups which in the existing fauna are so distinct in the same way the palaeotherium tended to connect forms so different as the tapir the rhinoceros and the horse subsequent investigations have brought to light a variety of facts of the same order the most curious and striking of which are those which prove the existence in the mesozoic epoch of a series of forms intermediate between birds and reptilestwo classes of vertebrate animals which at present appear to be more widely separated than any others yet the interval between them is completely filled in the mesozoic fauna by birds which have reptilian characters on the one side and reptiles which have ornithic characters on the other so again while the group of fishes termed ganoids is at the present time so distinct from that of the dipnoi or mudfishes that they have been reckoned as distinct orders the devonian strata present us with forms of which it is impossible to say with certainty whether they are dipnoi or whether they are ganoids  agassizs long and elaborate researches upon fossil fishes published between 1833 and 1842 led him to suggest the existence of another kind of relation between ancient and modern forms of life he observed that the oldest fishes present many characters which recall the embryonic conditions of existing fishes and that not only among fishes but in several groups of the invertebrata which have a long palaeontological history the latest forms are more modified more specialised than the earlier the fact that the dentition of the older tertiary ungulate and carnivorous mammals is always complete noticed by professor owen illustrated the same generalisation  another no less suggestive observation was made by mr darwin whose personal investigations during the voyage of the beagle led him to remark upon the singular fact that the fauna which immediately precedes that at present existing in any geographical province of distribution presents the same peculiarities as its successor thus in south america and in australia the later tertiary or quaternary fossils show that the fauna which immediately preceded that of the present day was in the one case as much characterised by edentates and in the other by marsupials as it is now although the species of the older are largely different from those of the newer fauna  however clearly these indications might point in one direction the question of the exact relation of the successive forms of animal and vegetable life could be satisfactorily settled only in one way namely by comparing stage by stage the series of forms presented by one and the same type throughout a long space of time within the last few years this has been done fully in the case of the horse less completely in the case of the other principal types of the ungulata and of the carnivora and all these investigations tend to one general result namely that in any given series the successive members of that series present a gradually increasing specialisation of structure that is to say if any such mammal at present existing has specially modified and reduced limbs or dentition and complicated brain its predecessors in time show less and less modification and reduction in limbs and teeth and a less highly developed brain the labours of gaudry marsh and cope furnish abundant illustrations of this law from the marvellous fossil wealth of pikermi and the vast uninterrupted series of tertiary rocks in the territories of north america  i will now sum up the results of this sketch of the rise and progress of palaeontology the whole fabric of palaeontology is based upon two propositions the first is that fossils are the remains of animals and plants and the second is that the stratified rocks in which they are found are sedimentary deposits and each of these propositions is founded upon the same axiom that like effects imply like causes if there is any cause competent to produce a fossil stem or shell or bone except a living being then palaeontology has no foundation if the stratification of the rocks is not the effect of such causes as at present produce stratification we have no means of judging of the duration of past time or of the order in which the forms of life have succeeded one another but if these two propositions are granted there is no escape as it appears to me from three very important conclusions the first is that living matter has existed upon the earth for a vast length of time certainly for millions of years the second is that during this lapse of time the forms of living matter have undergone repeated changes the effect of which has been that the animal and vegetable population at any period of the earths history contains certain species which did not exist at some antecedent period and others which ceased to exist at some subsequent period the third is that in the case of many groups of mammals and some of reptiles in which one type can be followed through a considerable extent of geological time the series of different forms by which the type is represented at successive intervals of this time is exactly such as it would be if they had been produced by the gradual modification of the earliest forms of the series these are facts of the history of the earth guaranteed by as good evidence as any facts in civil history  hitherto i have kept carefully clear of all the hypotheses to which men have at various times endeavoured to fit the facts of palaeontology or by which they have endeavoured to connect as many of these facts as they happened to be acquainted with i do not think it would be a profitable employment of our time to discuss conceptions which doubtless have had their justification and even their use but which are now obviously incompatible with the wellascertained truths of palaeontology at present these truths leave room for only two hypotheses the first is that in the course of the history of the earth innumerable species of animals and plants have come into existence independently of one another innumerable times this of course implies either that spontaneous generation on the most astounding scale and of animals such as horses and elephants has been going on as a natural process through all the time recorded by the fossiliferous rocks or it necessitates the belief in innumerable acts of creation repeated innumerable times the other hypothesis is that the successive species of animals and plants have arisen the later by the gradual modification of the earlier this is the hypothesis of evolution and the palaeontological discoveries of the last decade are so completely in accordance with the requirements of this hypothesis that if it had not existed the palaeontologist would have had to invent it  i have always had a certain horror of presuming to set a limit upon the possibilities of things therefore i will not venture to say that it is impossible that the multitudinous species of animals and plants may have been produced one separately from the other by spontaneous generation nor that it is impossible that they should have been independently originated by an endless succession of miraculous creative acts but i must confess that both these hypotheses strike me as so astoundingly improbable so devoid of a shred of either scientific or traditional support that even if there were no other evidence than that of palaeontology in its favour i should feel compelled to adopt the hypothesis of evolution happily the future of palaeontology is independent of all hypothetical considerations fifty years hence whoever undertakes to record the progress of palaeontology will note the present time as the epoch in which the law of succession of the forms of the higher animals was determined by the observation of palaeontological facts he will point out that just as steno and as cuvier were enabled from their knowledge of the empirical laws of coexistence of the parts of animals to conclude from a part to the whole so the knowledge of the law of succession of forms empowered their successors to conclude from one or two terms of such a succession to the whole series and thus to divine the existence of forms of life of which perhaps no trace remains at epochs of inconceivable remoteness in the past     footnotes  footnote 1 de solidoiintra solidum p5dato corpore
