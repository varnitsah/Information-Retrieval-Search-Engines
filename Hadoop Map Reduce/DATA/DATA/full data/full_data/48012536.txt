48012536	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     in the library   the fire had burnt low in the library for the night was wet and warm it was now little more than a grey shell and looked desolate  trayton burleigh still hot rose from his armchair and turning out one of the gasjets took a cigar from a box on a sidetable and resumed his seat again  the apartment which was on the third floor at the back of the house was a combination of library study and smokeroom and was the daily despair of the old housekeeper who with the assistance of one servant managed the house  it was a bachelor establishment and had been left to trayton burleigh and james fletcher by a distant connection of both men some ten years before  trayton burleigh sat back in his chair watching the smoke of his cigar through halfclosed eyes  occasionally he opened them a little wider and glanced round the comfortable wellfurnished room or stared with a cold gleam of hatred at fletcher as he sat sucking stolidly at his brier pipe it was a comfortable room and a valuable house half of which belonged to trayton burleigh and yet he was to leave it in the morning and become a rogue and a wanderer over the face of the earth  james fletcher had said so  james fletcher with the pipe still between his teeth and speaking from one corner of his mouth only had pronounced his sentence  it hasnt occurred to you i suppose said burleigh speaking suddenly that i might refuse your terms  no said fletcher simply  burleigh took a great mouthful of smoke and let it roll slowly out  i am to go out and leave you in possession  he continued  you will stay here sole proprietor of the house you will stay at the office sole owner and representative of the firm  you are a good hand at a deal james fletcher  i am an honest man said fletcher and to raise sufficient money to make your defalcations good will not by any means leave me the gainer as you very well know  there is no necessity to borrow began burleigh eagerly  we can pay the interest easily and in course of time make the principal good without a soul being the wiser  that you suggested before said fletcher and my answer is the same i will be no mans confederate in dishonesty i will raise every penny at all costs and save the name of the firmand yours with itbut i will never have you darken the office again or sit in this house after tonight  you wont cried burleigh starting up in a frenzy of rage  i wont said fletcher  you can choose the alternative disgrace and penal servitude  dont stand over me you wont frighten me i can assure you  sit down  you have arranged so many things in your kindness said burleigh slowly resuming his seat again have you arranged how i am to live  you have two strong hands and health replied fletcher  i will give you the two hundred pounds i mentioned and after that you must look out for yourself  you can take it now  he took a leather case from his breast pocket and drew out a roll of notes  burleigh watching him calmly stretched out his hand and took them from the table  then he gave way to a sudden access of rage and crumpling them in his hand threw them into a corner of the room fletcher smoked on  mrs marl is out said burleigh suddenly  fletcher nodded  she will be away the night he said slowly and jane too they have gone together somewhere but they will be back at halfpast eight in the morning  you are going to let me have one more breakfast in the old place then said burleigh  halfpast eight halfpast  he rose from his chair again  this time fletcher took his pipe from his mouth and watched him closely  burleigh stooped and picking up the notes placed them in his pocket  if i am to be turned adrift it shall not be to leave you here he said in a thick voice  he crossed over and shut the door as he turned back fletcher rose from his chair and stood confronting him  burleigh put his hand to the wall and drawing a small japanese sword from its sheath of carved ivory stepped slowly toward him  i give you one chance fletcher he said grimly  you are a man of your word  hush this up and let things be as they were before and you are safe  put that down said fletcher sharply  by  i mean what i say  cried the other  i mean what i said  answered fletcher  he looked round at the last moment for a weapon then he turned suddenly at a sharp sudden pain and saw burleighs clenched fist nearly touching his breastbone  the hand came away from his breast again and something with it  it went a long way off  trayton burleigh suddenly went to a great distance and the room darkened  it got quite dark and fletcher with an attempt to raise his hands let them fall to his side instead and fell in a heap to the floor  he was so still that burleigh could hardly realize that it was all over and stood stupidly waiting for him to rise again  then he took out his handkerchief as though to wipe the sword and thinking better of it put it back into his pocket again and threw the weapon on to the floor  the body of fletcher lay where it had fallen the white face turned up to the gas  in life he had been a commonplacelooking man not to say vulgar now burleigh with a feeling of nausea drew back toward the door until the body was hidden by the table and relieved from the sight he could think more clearly  he looked down carefully and examined his clothes and his boots  then he crossed the room again and with his face averted turned out the gas  something seemed to stir in the darkness and with a faint cry he blundered toward the door before he had realized that it was the clock  it struck twelve  illustration burleigh with a feeling of nausea drew back toward the dooor  he stood at the head of the stairs trying to recover himself trying to think  the gas on the landing below the stairs and the furniture all looked so prosaic and familiar that he could not realize what had occurred  he walked slowly down and turned the light out  the darkness of the upper part of the house was now almost appalling and in a sudden panic he ran down stairs into the lighted hall and snatching a hat from the stand went to the door and walked down to the gate  except for one window the neighbouring houses were in darkness and the lamps shone tip a silent street  there was a little rain in the air and the muddy road was full of pebbles  he stood at the gate trying to screw up his courage to enter the house again  then he noticed a figure coming slowly up the road and keeping close to the palings  the full realization of what he had done broke in upon him when he found himself turning to fly from the approach of the constable  the wet cape glistening in the lamplight the slow heavy step made him tremble suppose the thing upstairs was not quite dead and should cry out suppose the constable should think it strange for him to be standing there and follow him in  he assumed a careless attitude which did not feel careless and as the man passed bade him goodnight and made a remark as to the weather  ere the sound of the others footsteps had gone quite out of hearing he turned and entered the house again before the sense of companionship should have quite departed  the first flight of stairs was lighted by the gas in the hall and he went up slowly  then he struck a match and went up steadily past the library door and with firm fingers turned on the gas in his bedroom and lit it  he opened the window a little way and sitting down on his bed tried to think  he had got eight hours  eight hours and two hundred pounds in small notes  he opened his safe and took out all the loose cash it contained and walking about the room gathered up and placed in his pockets such articles of jewellery as he possessed  the first horror had now to some extent passed and was succeeded by the fear of death  with this fear on him he sat down again and tried to think out the first moves in that game of skill of which his life was the stake  he had often read of people of hasty temper evading the police for a time and eventually falling into their hands for lack of the most elementary common sense  he had heard it said that they always made some stupid blunder left behind them some damning clue  he took his revolver from a drawer and saw that it was loaded  if the worst came to the worst he would die quickly  eight hours start two hundred odd pounds  he would take lodgings at first in some populous district and let the hair on his face grow  when the hueandcry had ceased he would go abroad and start life again  he would go out of a night and post letters to himself or better still postcards which his landlady would read  postcards from cheery friends from a sister from a brother  during the day he would stay in and write as became a man who described himself as a journalist  or suppose he went to the sea  who would look for him in flannels bathing and boating with ordinary happy mortals  he sat and pondered one might mean life and the other death  which  his face burned as he thought of the responsibility of the choice  so many people went to the sea at that time of year that he would surely pass unnoticed  but at the sea one might meet acquaintances  he got up and nervously paced the room again  it was not so simple now that it meant so much as he had thought  the sharp little clock on the mantelpiece rang out one followed immediately by the deeper note of that in the library  he thought of the clock it seemed the only live thing in that room and shuddered  he wondered whether the thing lying by the far side of the table heard it he wondered  he started and held his breath with fear  somewhere down stairs a board creaked loudly then another  he went to the door and opening it a little way but without looking out listened  the house was so still that he could hear the ticking of the old clock in the kitchen below  he opened the door a little wider and peeped out  as he did so there was a sudden sharp outcry on the stairs and he drew back into the room and stood trembling before he had quite realized that the noise had been made by the cat  the cry was unmistakable but what had disturbed it  there was silence again and he drew near the door once more  he became certain that something was moving stealthily on the stairs  he heard the boards creak again and once the rails of the balustrade rattled  the silence and suspense were frightful  suppose that the something which had been fletcher waited for him in the darkness outside  he fought his fears down and opening the door determined to see what was beyond  the light from his room streamed out on to the landing and he peered about fearfully  was it fancy or did the door of fletchers room opposite close as he looked  was it fancy or did the handle of the door really turn  in perfect silence and watching the door as he moved to see that nothing came out and followed him he proceeded slowly down the dark stairs  then his jaw fell and he turned sick and faint again  the library door which he distinctly remembered closing and which moreover he had seen was closed when he went up stairs to his room now stood open some four or five inches  he fancied that there was a rustling inside but his brain refused to be certain  then plainly and unmistakably he heard a chair pushed against the wall  he crept to the door hoping to pass it before the thing inside became aware of his presence  something crept stealthily about the room  with a sudden impulse he caught the handle of the door and closing it violently turned the key in the lock and ran madly down the stairs  a fearful cry sounded from the room and a heavy hand beat upon the panels of the door  the house rang with the blows but above them sounded the loud hoarse cries of human fear  burleigh halfway down to the hall stopped with his hand on the balustrade and listened  the beating ceased and a mans voice cried out loudly for gods sake to let him out  at once burleigh saw what had happened and what it might mean for him he had left the hall door open after his visit to the front and some wandering bird of the night had entered the house  no need for him to go now  no need to hide either from the hangmans rope or the felons cell the fool above had saved him  he turned and ran up stairs again just as the prisoner in his furious efforts to escape wrenched the handle from the door  whos there  he cried loudly  let me out  cried a frantic voice  for gods sake open the door theres something here  stay where you are  shouted burleigh sternly  stay where you are if you come out ill shoot you like a dog  the only response was a smashing blow on the lock of the door  burleigh raised his pistol and aiming at the height of a mans chest fired through the panel  the report and the crashing of the wood made one noise succeeded by an unearthly stillness then the noise of a window hastily opened  burleigh fled hastily down the stairs and flinging wide the hall door shouted loudly for assistance  it happened that a sergeant and the constable on the beat had just met in the road  they came toward the house at a run  burleigh with incoherent explanations ran up stairs before them and halted outside the library door  the prisoner was still inside still trying to demolish the lock of the sturdy oaken door  burleigh tried to turn the key but the lock was too damaged to admit of its moving  the sergeant drew back and shoulder foremost hurled himself at the door and burst it open  he stumbled into the room followed by the constable and two shafts of light from the lanterns at their belts danced round the room  a man lurking behind the door made a dash for it and the next instant the three men were locked together  burleigh standing in the doorway looked on coldly reserving himself for the scene which was to follow  except for the stumbling of the men and the sharp catch of the prisoners breath there was no noise  a helmet fell off and bounced and rolled along the floor  the men fell there was a sobbing snarl and a sharp click  a tall figure rose from the floor the other on his knees still held the man down  the standing figure felt in his pocket and striking a match lit the gas  the light fell on the flushed face and fair beard of the sergeant  he was bareheaded and his hair dishevelled  burleigh entered the room and gazed eagerly at the halfinsensible man on the floora short thickset fellow with a white dirty face and a black moustache  his lip was cut and bled down his neck  burleigh glanced furtively at the table  the cloth had come off in the struggle and was now in the place where he had left fletcher  hot work sir said the sergeant with a smile  its fortunate we were handy  the prisoner raised a heavy head and looked up with unmistakable terror in his eyes  all right sir he said trembling as the constable increased the pressure of his knee  i aint been in the house ten minutes altogether  by  ive not  the sergeant regarded him curiously  it dont signify he said slowly ten minutes or ten seconds wont make any difference  the man shook and began to whimper  it was ere when i come he said eagerly take that down sir  ive only just come and it was ere when i come  i tried to get away then but i was locked in  what was  demanded the sergeant  that he said desperately  the sergeant following the direction of the terrorstricken black eyes stooped by the table  then with a sharp exclamation he dragged away the cloth  burleigh with a sharp cry of horror reeled back against the wall  all right sir said the sergeant catching him all right  turn your head away  he pushed him into a chair and crossing the room poured out a glass of whiskey and brought it to him  the glass rattled against his teeth but he drank it greedily and then groaned faintly  the sergeant waited patiently  there was no hurry  who is it sir  he asked at length  my friendfletcher said burleigh with an effort  we lived together  he turned to the prisoner  you damned villain  he was dead when i come in the room gentlemen said the prisoner strenuously  he was on the floor dead and when i see im i tried to get out  s elp me he was  you heard me call out sir  i shouldnt ha called out if id killed him  all right said the sergeant gruffly youd better hold your tongue you know  you keep quiet urged the constable  the sergeant knelt down and raised the dead mans head  i ad nothing to do with it repeated the man on the floor  i ad nothing to do with it  i never thought of such a thing  ive only been in the place ten minutes put that down sir  the sergeant groped with his left hand and picking up the japanese sword held it at him  ive never seen it before said the prisoner struggling  it used to hang on the wall said burleigh  he must have snatched it down  it was on the wall when i left fletcher a little while ago  how long  inquired the sergeant  perhaps an hour perhaps half an hour was the reply  i went to my bedroom  the man on the floor twisted his head and regarded him narrowly  you done it  he cried fiercely  you done it and you want me to swing for it  that ll do said the indignant constable  the sergeant let his burden gently to the floor again  you hold your tongue you devil  he said menacingly  he crossed to the table and poured a little spirit into a glass and took it in his hand  then he put it down again and crossed to burleigh  feeling better sir  he asked  the other nodded faintly  you wont want this thing any more said the sergeant  he pointed to the pistol which the other still held and taking it from him gently put it into his pocket  youve hurt your wrist sir he said anxiously  burleigh raised one hand sharply and then the other  this one i think said the sergeant  i saw it just now  he took the others wrists in his hand and suddenly holding them in the grip of a vice whipped out something from his pocketsomething hard and cold which snapped suddenly on burleighs wrists and held them fast  thats right said the sergeant keep quiet  the constable turned round in amaze burleigh sprang toward him furiously  take these things off  he choked  have you gone mad  take them off  all in good time said the sergeant  take them off  cried burleigh again  for answer the sergeant took him in a powerful grip and staring steadily at his white face and gleaming eyes forced him to the other end of the room and pushed him into a chair  collins he said sharply  sir  said the astonished subordinate  run to the doctor at the corner hard as you can run  said the other this man is not dead  as the man left the room the sergeant took up the glass of spirits he had poured out and kneeling down by fletcher again raised his head and tried to pour a little down his throat  burleigh sitting in his corner watched like one in a trance  he saw the constable return with the breathless surgeon saw the three men bending over fletcher and then saw the eyes of the dying man open and the lips of the dying man move  he was conscious that the sergeant made some notes in a pocketbook and that all three men eyed him closely  the sergeant stepped toward him and placed his hand on his shoulder and obedient to the touch he arose and went with him out into the night
