kindness wrote out for me all historical     allusions to dervorgilla                            the dreaming of the bones   the stage is any bare place in a room close to the wall a screen with a pattern of mountain and sky can stand against the wall or a curtain with a like pattern hang upon it but the pattern must only symbolize or suggest one musician enters and then two others the first stands singing while the others take their places then all three sit down against the wall by their instruments which are already therea drum a zither and a flute or they unfold a cloth as in the hawks well while the instruments are carried in  first musician              or all three musicians singing   why does my heart beat so   did not a shadow pass   it passed but a moment ago   who can have trod in the grass   what rogue is nightwandering   have not old writers said   that dizzy dreams can spring   from the dry bones of the dead   and many a night it seems   that all the valley fills   with those fantastic dreams   they overflow the hills   so passionate is a shade   like wine that fills to the top   a greygreen cup of jade   or maybe an agate cup   speaking the hour before dawn and the moon covered up   the little village of abbey is covered up   the little narrow trodden way that runs   from the white road to the abbey of corcomroe   is covered up and all about the hills   are like a circle of agate or of jade   somewhere among great rocks on the scarce grass   birds cry they cry their loneliness   even the sunlight can be lonely here   even hot noon is lonely i hear a footfall   a young man with a lantern comes this way   he seems an aran fisher for he wears   the flannel bawneen and the cowhide shoe   he stumbles wearily and stumbling prays    a young man enters praying in irish    once more the birds cry in their loneliness   but now they wheel about our heads and now   they have dropped on the grey stone to the northeast    a man and a girl both in the costume of a past time come in they   wear heroic masks  young man                          raising his lantern   who is there i cannot see what you are like   come to the light  stranger                     but what have you to fear  young man    and why have you come creeping through the dark    the girl blows out lantern    the wind has blown my lantern out where are you   i saw a pair of heads against the sky   and lost them after but you are in the right   i should not be afraid in county clare   and should be or should not be have no choice   i have to put myself into your hands   now that my candles out  stranger                     you have fought in dublin  young man    i was in the post office and if taken   i shall be put against a wall and shot  stranger    you know some place of refuge have some plan   or friend who will come to meet you  young man                                    i am to lie   at daybreak on the mountain and keep watch   until an aran coracle puts in   at muckanish or at the rocky shore   under finvarra but would break my neck   if i went stumbling there alone in the dark  stranger    we know the pathways that the sheep tread out   and all the hidingplaces of the hills   and that they had better hidingplaces once  young man    youd say they had better before english robbers   cut down the trees or set them upon fire   for fear their owners might find shelter there   what is that sound  stranger                       an old horse gone astray   he has been wandering on the road all night  young man    i took him for a man and horse police   are out upon the roads in the late rising   i think there was no man of us but hated   to fire at soldiers who but did their duty   and were not of our race but when a man   is born in ireland and of irish stock   when he takes part against us  stranger                           i will put you safe   no living man shall set his eyes upon you   i will not answer for the dead  young man                                      the dead  stranger    for certain days the stones where you must lie   have in the hour before the break of day   been haunted  young man                but i was not born at midnight  stranger    many a man born in the full daylight   can see them plain will pass them on the highroad   or in the crowded marketplace of the town   and never know that they have passed  young man                                     my grandam   would have it they did penance everywhere   or lived through their old lives again  stranger                                    in a dream   and some for an old scruple must hang spitted   upon the swaying tops of lofty trees   some are consumed in fire some withered up   by hail and sleet out of the wintry north   and some but live through their old lives again  young man    well let them dream into what shape they please   and fill waste mountains with the invisible tumult   of the fantastic conscience i have no dread   they cannot put me into jail or shoot me   and seeing that their blood has returned to fields   that have grown red from drinking blood like mine   they would not if they could betray  stranger                                   this pathway   runs to the ruined abbey of corcomroe   the abbey passed we are soon among the stone   and shall be at the ridge before the cocks   of aughanish or bailevlehan   or grey aughtmana shake their wings and cry    they go round the stage once  first musician    speaking theyve passed the shallow well and the flat stone   fouled by the drinking cattle the narrow lane   where mourners for five centuries have carried   noble or peasant to his burial   an owl is crying out above their heads   singing why should the heart take fright   what sets it beating so   the bitter sweetness of the night   has made it but a lonely thing   red bird of march begin to crow   up with the neck and clap the wing   red cock and crow    they go once round the stage the first musician speaks    and now they have climbed through the long grassy field   and passed the ragged thorn trees and the gap   in the ancient hedge and the tombnested owl   at the foots level beats with a vague wing   singing my head is in a cloud   id let the whole world go   my rascal heart is proud   remembering and remembering   red bird of march begin to crow   up with the neck and clap the wing   red cock and crow    they go round the stage the first musician speaks    they are among the stones above the ash   above the briar and thorn and the scarce grass   hidden amid the shadow far below them   the catheaded bird is crying out   singing the dreaming bones cry out   because the night winds blow   and heavens a cloudy blot   calamity can have its fling   red bird of march begin to crow   up with the neck and clap the wing   red cock and crow  the stranger    were almost at the summit and can rest   the road is a faint shadow there and there   the abbey lies amid its broken tombs   in the old days we should have heard a bell   calling the monks before day broke to pray   and when the day has broken on the ridge   the crowing of its cocks  young man                              is there no house   famous for sanctity or architectural beauty   in clare or kerry or in all wide connacht   the enemy has not unroofed  stranger                             close to the altar   broken by wind and frost and worn by time   donogh obrien has a tomb a name in latin   he wore fine clothes and knew the secrets of women   but he rebelled against the king of thomond   and died in his youth  young man                       and why should he rebel   the king of thomond was his rightful master   it was men like donogh who made ireland weak   my curse on all that troop and when i die   ill leave my body if i have any choice   far from his ivy tod and his owl have those   who if your tale is true work out a penance   upon the mountaintop where i am to hide   come from the abbey graveyard  the girl                       they have not that luck   but are more lonely those that are buried there   warred in the heat of the blood if they were rebels   some momentary impulse made them rebels   or the comandment of some petty king   who hated thomond being but common sinners   no callers in of the alien from oversea   they and their enemies of thomonds party   mix in a brief dream battle above their bones   or make one drove or drift in amity   or in the hurry of the heavenly round   forget their earthly names these are alone   being accursed  young man                      and if what seems is true   and there are more upon the other side   than on this side of death many a ghost   must meet them face to face and pass the word   even upon this grey and desolate hill  young girl    until this hour no ghost or living man   has spoken though seven centuries have run   since they weary of life and of mens eyes   flung down their bones in some forgotten place   being accursed  young man              i have heard that there are souls   who having sinned after a monstrous fashion   take on them being dead a monstrous image   to drive the living should they meet its face   crazy and be a terror to the dead  young girl                                      but these   were comely even in their middle life   and carry now that they are dead the image   of their first youth for it was in that youth   their sin began  young man                   i have heard of angry ghosts   who wander in a wilful solitude  the girl    these have no thought but love nor joy   but that upon the instant when their penance   draws to its height and when two hearts are wrung   nearest to breaking if hearts of shadows break   his eyes can mix with hers nor any pang   that is so bitter as that double glance   being accursed  young man             but what is this strange penance   that when their eyes have met can wring them most  the girl    though eyes can meet their lips can never meet  young man    and yet it seems they wander side by side   but doubtless you would say that when lips meet   and have not living nerves it is no meeting  the girl    although they have no blood or living nerves   who once lay warm and live the livelong night   in one anothers arms and know their part   in life being now but of the people of dreams   is a dreams part although they are but shadows   hovering between a thorn tree and a stone   who have heaped up night on winged night although   no shade however harried and consumed   would change his own calamity for theirs   their manner of life were blessed could their lips   a moment meet but when he has bent his head   close to her head or hand would slip in hand   the memory of their crime flows up between   and drives them apart  young man                        the memory of a crime   he took her from a husbands house it may be   but does the penance for a passionate sin   last for so many centuries  the girl                                        no no   the man she chose the man she was chosen by   cared little and cares little from whose house   they fled towards dawn amid the flights of arrows   or that it was a husbands and a kings   and how if that were all could she lack friends   on crowded roads or on the unpeopled hill   helen herself had opened wide the door   where night by night she dreams herself awake   and gathers to her breast a dreaming man  young man    what crime can stay so in the memory   what crime can keep apart the lips of lovers   wandering and alone  the girl                             her king and lover   was overthrown in battle by her husband   and for her sake and for his own being blind   and bitter and bitterly in love he brought   a foreign army from across the sea  young man    you speak of dermot and of dervorgilla   who brought the norman in  the girl                               yes yes i spoke   of that most miserable most accursed pair   who sold their country into slavery and yet   they were not wholly miserable and accursed   if somebody of their race at last would say   i have forgiven them  young man                               oh never never   will dermot and dervorgilla be forgiven  the girl    if someone of their race forgave at last   lip would be pressed on lip  young man                               oh never never   will dermot and dervorgilla be forgiven   you have told your story well so well indeed   i could not help but fall into the mood   and for a while believe that it was true   or half believe but better push on now   the horizon to the east is growing bright    they go once round stage    so here were on the summit i can see   the aran islands connemara hills   and galway in the breaking light there too   the enemy has toppled wall and roof   and torn from ancient walls to boil his pot   the oaken panelling that had been dear   to generations of children and old men   but for that pair for whom you would have my pardon   it might be now like bayeux or like caen   or little italian town amid its walls   for though we have neither coal nor iron ore   to make us rich and cover heaven with smoke   our country if that crime were uncommitted   had been most beautiful why do you dance   why do you gaze and with so passionate eyes   one on the other and then turn away   covering your eyes and weave it in a dance   who are you what are you you are not natural  the girl    seven hundred years our lips have never met  young man    why do you look so strangely at one another   so strangely and so sweetly  the girl                           seven hundred years  young man    so strangely and so sweetly all the ruin   all all their handiwork is blown away   as though the mountain air had blown it away   because their eyes have met they cannot hear   being folded up and hidden in their dance   the dance is changing now they have dropped their eyes   they have covered up their eyes as though their hearts   had suddenly been brokennever never   shall dermot and dervorgilla be forgiven   they have drifted in the dance from rock to rock   they have raised their hands as though to snatch the sleep   that lingers always in the abyss of the sky   though they can never reach it a cloud floats up   and covers all the mountain head in a moment   and now it lifts and they are swept away   i had almost yielded and forgiven it all   this is indeed a place of terrible temptation    the musicians begin unfolding and folding a black cloth the first   musician comes forward to the front of the stage at the centre he   holds the cloth before him the other two come one on either side   and unfold it they afterwards fold it up in the same way while it   is unfolded the young man leaves the stage  the musicians  i    singing at the grey round of the hill   music of a lost kingdom   runs runs and is suddenly still   the winds out of claregalway   carry it suddenly it is still    i have heard in the night air   a wandering airy music   and moidered in that snare   a man is lost of a sudden   in that sweet wandering snare    what finger first began   music of a lost kingdom   they dreamed that laughed in the sun   dry bones that dream are bitter   they dream and darken our sun    those crazy fingers play   a wandering airy music   our luck is withered away   and wheat in the wheatear withered   and the wind blows it away  ii    my heart ran wild when it heard   the curlew cry before dawn   and the eddying catheaded bird   but now the night is gone   i have heard from far below   the strong march birds acrow   stretch neck and clap the wing   red cocks and crow                            the only jealousy of emer   enter musicians who are dressed as in the earlier play they have the same musical instruments which can either be already upon the stage or be brought in by the first musician before he stands in the centre with the cloth between his hands or by a player when the cloth is unfolded the stage as before can be against the wall of any room  first musician    during the unfolding and folding of the cloth    a womans beauty is like a white   frail bird like a white seabird alone   at daybreak after stormy night   between two furrows upon the ploughed land   a sudden storm and it was thrown   between dark furrows upon the ploughed land   how many centuries spent   the sedentary soul   in toils of measurement   beyond eagle or mole   beyond hearing or seeing   or archimedes guess   to raise into being   that loveliness    a strange unserviceable thing   a fragile exquisite pale shell   that the vast troubled waters bring   to the loud sands before day has broken   the storm arose and suddenly fell   amid the dark before day had broken   what death what discipline   what bonds no man could unbind   being imagined within   the labyrinth of the mind   what pursuing or fleeing   what wounds what bloody press   dragged into being   this loveliness    when the cloth is folded again the musicians take their place   against wall the folding of the cloth shows on one side of the   stage the curtained bed or litter on which lies a man in his   graveclothes he wears an heroic mask another man with exactly   similar clothes and mask crouches near the front emer is sitting   beside the bed  first musician    speaking i call before the eyes a roof   with crossbeams darkened by smoke   a fishers net hangs from a beam   a long oar lies against the wall   i call up a poor fishers house   a man lies dead or swooning   that amorous man   that amorous violent man renowned cuchulain   queen emer at his side   at her own bidding all the rest have gone   but now one comes on hesitating feet   young eithne inguba cuchulains mistress   she stands a moment in the open door   beyond the open door the bitter sea   the shining bitter sea is crying out   singing white shell white wing   i will not choose for my friend   a frail unserviceable thing   that drifts and dreams and but knows   that waters are without end   and that wind blows  emer    speaking come hither come sit down beside the bed   you need not be afraid for i

alone may watch together here   because we have loved him best  eithne inguba                                and is he dead  emer    although they have dressed him out in his graveclothes   and stretched his limbs cuchulain is not dead   the very heavens when that days at hand   so that his death may not lack ceremony   will throw out fires and the earth grow red with blood   there shall not be a scullion but foreknows it   like the worlds end  eithne inguba                       how did he come to this  emer    towards noon in the assembly of the kings   he met with one who seemed a while most dear   the kings stood round some quarrel was blown up   he drove him out and killed him on the shore   at bailes tree and he who was so killed   was his own son begot on some wild woman   when he was young or so i have heard it said   and thereupon knowing what man he had killed   and being mad with sorrow he ran out   and after to his middle in the foam   with shield before him and with sword in hand   he fought the deathless sea the kings looked on   and not a king dared stretch an arm or even   dared call his name but all stood wondering   in that dumb stupor like cattle in a gale   until at last as though he had fixed his eyes   on a new enemy he waded out   until the water had swept over him   but the waves washed his senseless image up   and laid it at this door  eithne inguba                             how pale he looks  emer    he is not dead  eithne inguba                   you have not kissed his lips   nor laid his head upon your breast  emer

sea   now that his joints are stiff  eithne inguba                              cry out his name   all that are taken from our sight they say   loiter amid the scenery of their lives   for certain

goes to one   side of platform and moves her hand as though putting logs on a fire   and stirring it into a blaze while she makes these movements the   musicians play marking the movements with drum and flute perhaps    having finished she stands beside the imaginary fire at a distance   from cuchulain  eithne inguba  call on cuchulain now  eithne inguba    can you not hear my voice  emer
