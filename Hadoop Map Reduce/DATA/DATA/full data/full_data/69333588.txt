     rollos experiments     jonas an astronomer   one day when rollo was about seven years old he was sitting upon the steps of the door and he heard a noise in the street as of some sort of carriage approaching a moment afterwards a carryall came in sight it drove up to the front gate and stopped rollos father and mother and his little brother nathan got out his father fastened the horse to the post and came in  when rollo first heard the noise of the carryall he was sitting still upon the steps of the door thinking he was thinking of something that jonas his fathers hired boy had told him about the suns shining in at the barn door there was a very large double door to rollos fathers barn and as this door opened towards the south the sun used to shine in very warm upon the barn floor in the middle of the day  rollo and jonas had been sitting there husking some cornfor it was in the fall of the yearand as it was rather a cool autumnal day rollo said it was lucky that the sun shone in for it kept them warm  yes said jonas and what is remarkable it always shines in farther in the winter than it does in the summer  does it said rollo  yes said jonas  and what is the reason asked rollo  i dont know said jonas unless it is because we want it in the barn more in the winter than we do in the summer  ho said rollo i dont believe that is the reason  why not said jonas  o i dont believe the sun moves about in the heavens to different places only just to shine into barn doors  why it keeps a great many farmers boys more comfortable said jonas  is it so in all barns asked rollo  i suppose so said jonas  after some further conversation on the subject the boys determined to watch the reflection of the suns beams upon the barn floor for a good many days and to mark the place that it came in to at noon every day with a piece of chalk it was only a few minutes before the carryall came up that they had determined upon this and had marked the place for that day and then rollo had come out of the barn and was sitting upon the door step thinking of the subject when his reflections were interrupted in the manner already described  so when rollo saw his father getting out of the carryall he ran to meet him and called out to him talking very loud and rapidly  father jonas says that the sun shines farther in upon the barn floor in winter than in summerdoes it do you think  but this was not a proper time for rollo to bring up his philosophical question his father had a carpet bag and several packages in his hands and he was also conducting rollos mother in and thinking about the horse and carryall so he told rollo that he must not speak to him then for he could not attend to him  rollo then walked along back into the yard and began to think of the subject of the suns shining in at the south door he looked up towards the sun and began to consider what sort of a change in its place at noon on different days would be necessary in order to account for its shining in more at south doors and windows on some days than on others he reflected that if the sun were exactly overhead at noon it could not shine in at any doors at all for the rays would then strike perpendicularly down the sides of the houses while he was standing thus lost in thought looking up to the sun with his arm across his forehead to shelter his eyes a little from the dazzling rays he suddenly felt the pressure of two soft hands upon his ears as of somebody who had come up behind him he turned round and found his cousin lucy standing there  lucy asked him what he was thinking of and he told her he then took lucy into the barn and showed her the chalk mark upon the floor she looked on with a good deal of interest and said she thought it was an excellent plan and she wished there was a great barn with a south floor at their house lucy knew more about the subject than rollo did and she gave him some explanations about it you see said she that the sun rises in the east every morning and comes up higher and higher every hour till noon and then it begins to go down again and at last it sets in the west but at some times in the year it comes up higher at noon than it does at other times and so it does not shine so much into the door  it shines more you mean said rollo  no said lucy not so much in the winter the sun moves around by the south and keeps pretty low all day and of course shines farther into doors and windows  then after a moments pause she added  if we should mark the place on the floor all the year round we should find what time the sun is farthest to the south  so we should said rollo  it would be in the winter said lucy  yes said rollo in the middle of the winter exactly  yes said lucy and in the middle of the summer it would be nearest overhead  jonas and i will try it said rollo  i can try it in the house said lucy where the sun shines in at my chamber window  o no said rollo that wont do  why not said lucy  because the window does not come down to the floor and so does not let the sun in enough  o that makes no difference said lucy we have nothing to do with the bottom of the door you only mark where it shines in the farthest and that place is made by the top of the door for it shines in farthest by the top of the door  well said rollo i dont know but that the house will do but then you cant chalk on the carpet  chalk on the carpet said lucy  yes to mark the place  no said lucy thinking but i can mark it some other way  how asked rollo  why i can put a pin in said lucy  o dear said rollo with a laugh put a pin in thats no way to mark a shadow  it isnt a shadow said lucy  yes it is said rollo  no said lucy a shadow is dark and this is bright  yes said rollo this is a bright shadow some shadows are bright and some are dark  o rollo said lucy and she turned away from him a little out of humor  the truth was that rollo and lucy were getting decidedly into a dispute from the sublime heights of practical astronomy they had fallen by a sad and very rapid descent to a childish altercation rollo had a very high idea of the superior facilities afforded by jonass barn floor for observing the daily changes in the suns meridian altitude and he did not like the idea of lucys finding that she had equally good opportunities for observation at her home lucy was a little fretted at rollos captious spirit but then her mind soon became unruffled again and she turned back towards rollo and said as they walked along the yard  i dont think the sunshine on the floor is a shadow rollo but then i dont see why a shadow would not do just as well  how said rollo  why look there at the shadow of that postthat would do  she pointed to a post with a rounded top upon it which stood by the side of the garden gate the shadow clear distinct and well defined was projected upon the walk and lucy told rollo that they might mark the place where the top of that shadow came every day and that that would do just as well  but how could we mark it said rollo  why we could drive a little stake unto the ground  o that would not do said rollo people would trip over them and break them down they would be exactly in the walk  lucy saw that this would be a difficulty and for a moment seemed to be at a loss at length she said  we might go somewhere else then where the people would not come  but what should we do for a post said rollo  could not we get jonas to drive a tall stake down said lucy  yes said rollo i suppose so  the children went out into the garden to find a good smooth place and while they were walking about there rollos mother came out and they told her the whole story she seemed quite interested in the plan and told them of a better way than any that they had thought of  you see said she that the height of the stake or pole that makes the shadow is not material for the shadow of a small one will vary just as much in proportion to its length as that of a long one will so instead of taking a wooden stake out of doors you might take a large pin and drive it down a little way into the window sill in the house then you can mark the shadow with a pen very exactly  so we can said lucy clapping her hands  and you might put a piece of white paper or a card down first continued rollos mother and drive the pin through that and then mark the places where the end of the shadow comes every day directly on the card with a fine pen thus you could be a great deal more exact than you can in chalking upon a barn floor  rollo asked his mother if she would not be kind enough to help them fix their apparatus but she said she would give them particular directions though she should prefer letting them do the whole themselves and then if they met with any difficulties they might come and report them to her and she would tell them how to surmount them so she recommended to them to go and find a blank card or piece of white pasteboard or of stiff white paper as big as a common card then said she choose some window where the sun shines in at noon and put the card down upon the sill and drive the pin down through it but you must not drive the pin through the middle of the card for the shadow will always be off to the north of the pin and therefore the pin may be pretty near the south end of the card then the shadow will be more likely to come wholly upon the card even when it is longest you had better place the card in such a position too that its sides shall lie in the direction of north and south then the shadow at noon will lie along exactly in the middle of it you must get a large and stout pin too and drive it in firmly a little way with a small hammer it will be well too to drive another smaller pin into the other end of the card so as to keep it fixed in its north and south position  how can we know when it is north and south exactly said lucy  you cannot do it exactly said rollos mother but you can get it pretty near one way is to borrow fathers little compass and adjust it by that another way is to see when it is exactly twelve oclock by the clock and then the shadow of the pin will of itself be about north  then you might move the north end of the card until the shadow is brought exactly into the middle of the card and then put the other pin in and fix it in that place then if you make a mark along where the shadow comes that mark will be a north and south line and you can mark the place where the shadow of the pins head crosses that line when it crosses it every day at noon  the children said that they believed they understood the directions and they determined to try the plan they thought they would fix two cards one at rollos house and one at lucys and they immediately went off in pursuit of blank cards and big pins     pruning   one afternoon rollo saw his father coming out into the garden with a little saw and a knife and a small pot of paint in his hands  father said he are you going to prune your trees now  yes said his father  then shall i go and get my wheelbarrow  yes replied his father again  so rollo ran off after his wheelbarrow it had been arranged between him and his father that morning that they should work in the garden an hour or two in the afternoon and that rollo should pick up all the cuttings from the trees and wheel them away and then when they were dry make a bonfire with them  rollo found his wheelbarrow in its proper place and trundled it along into the garden  father said he what trees are you going to prune first  o i am going to begin at the back side of the garden and prune them all advancing regularly to the front  what is the saw for said rollo  to saw off the large branches that i cant cut off easily with a knife  but i should not think you would want to saw off any large branches for so you will lose all the apples that would grow on them next year  why sometimes the branches are dead and then they would do no good but only be in the way  but do they do any hurt said rollo  why they look badly  but i mean would they do any actual hurt to the tree  why i dont know said his father perhaps they would not at any rate if i cut them off pretty close to the living part of the tree the bark will then gradually extend out over the little stump that i leave and finally cover it over and take it all in as it were  by this time rollo and his father had reached the back side of the garden and his father showed him the place where he had cut off a limb the year before and he saw how the fresh young bark had protruded itself all around it and was spreading in towards the centre so as to cover it over rollo then saw that it was better that all old dead limbs should be cut off  thats curious said rollo  yes very curious said his father a tree will take in and cover up almost any thing that is fastened to the wood in the same manner  will it said rollo  yes said his father if you drive a nail into a tree the bark will after a time cover it over entirely sometimes people find things in old trees which were put upon them when they were young  how big things said rollo  o i dont know exactly how big the tree will make an effort to enclose any thing small or large only if it is very large it will take a great while to enclose it and it might be so large that it never could enclose it  well father how large must it be so that the tree never could enclose it  o i dont know exactly once i saw a tree that was growing very near a rock after a time it came in contact with it and it grew and pressed against it until the rock crowded into the wood then the bark began to protrude in every direction along the rock as if it was making an effort to spread out and take the rock all in but i dont think it will ever succeed for the rock was part of a ledge in a pretty large hill  what a silly tree said rollo  father i believe i will try the experiment some time continued rollo after a pause  very well said his father  what shall i put into the tree asked rollo  you might put in a cent said his father and then if it should get fairly enclosed i presume the tree will keep it safe for you a good many years  rollo determined to do it then said he i shall never be out of money and that will be excellent his father told him that he must make a small cleft in the bark and wood with a chisel and mallet and then drive the cent in edgewise a little way  so rollo got his chisel and mallet and inserted the cent according to his fathers directions and by that time there were a good many branches and twigs on the ground which his father had taken off from the trees and so he began to pick them up and put them into his wheelbarrow  they went on working together for some time and talking while they worked rollo was continually asking his father questions and his father sometimes answered them and sometimes did not but was silent and thoughtful as if he was thinking of something else but whether he got answers or not rollo went on talking  illustration  father said rollo at length after a short pause during which he had been busily at work putting twigs into his wheelbarrow henry has got a very interesting book  his father did not answer  i think it is a very interesting book indeed should not you like to read it father  his father was just then reaching up very high to saw off a pretty large limb and he paid no attention to what rollo was saying so rollo went on talking half to himself  one story is about aladdin and his lamp if he rubbed his lamp he could have whatever he wished something would come i have forgotten what its name was and bring him whatever he asked for  just then down came the great branch which his father had been sawing off falling from its place on the tree to the ground  rollo looked at it a moment and then when his father began sawing again he said  should not you like such a lamp father  such a lamp as what my son said his father  why such a one as aladdins  aladdins why what do you know of aladdins lamp  why i read about it in henrys story book said rollo i just told you father  did you said his father wont you just hand me up the paint brush  well father said rollo as he handed him the brush dont you wish you had an aladdins lamp  no not particularly said his father  o father exclaimed rollo with surprise i am sure i do dont you wish i had such a lamp father  no said his father  why father i really think i could do some good with it for instance i could just rub my lamp and then have all your trees pruned for you at once without any further trouble  but that would not be worth while for you might have a much larger and better garden than this made at once with thousands of trees bearing delicious fruit and ponds and waterfalls and beautiful groves  o so i could said rollo  and then how soon do you think you should get tired of it and want another  o perhaps i should want another pretty soon but then i could have another you know  yes and how long do you think you could find happiness in calling beautiful gardens into existence one after another  o i dont knowa good while  a day  o yes father  a week  why perhaps i should be tired in a week  then all your power of receiving enjoyment from gardens would be run out and exhausted in a week whereas mine without any aladdins lamp lasts me year after year pleasantly increasing all the time without ever reaching satiety  what is satiety father  the feeling we experience when we have had so much of a good thing that we are completely tired and sick of it if i should give a little child as much honey as he could eat or let him play all the time or buy him a vast collection of pictures he would soon get tired of these things  o father i never should get tired of looking at pictures  i think you would said his father  here the conversation stopped a few minutes while rollo went to wheel away a load of his sticks before he returned he had prepared himself to renew his argument he said  father even if i did get tired of making beautiful gardens i could then do something else with the lamp and that would give me new pleasure  yes but the new pleasure would be run out and exhausted just as soon as the pleasure of having a garden would have been so that you would in a short time be satiated with every thing and become completely wretched and miserable  but father said rollo after being silent a little while i dont think i should get tired of my beautiful gardens very soon i dont think i should get tired even of looking at pictures of them  should you like to try the experiment  yes sir said rollo very eagerly  rollos father had a great many books of pictures and engravings of various kinds in his library and sometimes he used to allow the children to see them but only a very few at a time they had not yet seen them all he only allowed them to see them as fast as they had time to examine them thoroughly and read about them and understand them but now he said to rollo  i could let you have all the books of prints and engravings i have got and see them all at one time and that would be giving you aladdins lamp exactly so far as my pictures are concerned  well said rollo clapping his hands  but then in a short time you would get tired of looking at them you would become satiated and would in fact spoil the whole pleasure by attempting to enjoy it too fast but then i think it would perhaps do you good  how father  why by teaching you the value of moderation and the uselessness of aladdins lamps in all human enjoyments it would be a very valuable experiment in intellectual philosophy which i think it very probable might be of use to you so if you please you may try it  well father i am sure i should like to see the pictures  that is all settled then said his father some day you shall     the great beetle and wedge   rollo was coming home one morning after having been away on an errand and he saw a large wood pile near farmer cropwells door now it happened that rollo had once been on a journey pretty far back into the country it was at the time when jonas told him and lucy the stories related in the book called jonass stories on that journey jonas had one day told him that the sap of the mapletree was sweet and had let him taste of some where it oozed out at the end of the log seeing farmer cropwells wood pile reminded rollo of this and he thought he would look at the ends of all the logs and see if he could not find some drops of sweet sap there  but he could not for two reasons none of those trees were mapletrees and then besides they were all dry there was no sap in them of any kind at least not enough to ooze out while rollo was looking there one of farmer cropwells large boys came out with an axe in his hand he rolled out a pretty large log of wood though it was not very long and struck his axe into the end of it as if he was going to split it  i dont believe you can split that great log said rollo  i dont expect to do it with the axe said the boy as he left the axe sticking in the log  how then said rollo  i have got beetle and wedges here round behind the wood pile  so the boy went to another side of the wood pile and brought a large beetle and an iron wedge when he got back to his log he started out the axe which he had left sticking into it then rollo saw that the axe had made a little indentation or cleft in the wood he put the point of the wedge into this cleft and drove it in a very little with a few light blows with the axe then he took the great heavy beetle and began driving the wedge in with very heavy blows  presently rollo saw a little crack beginning to extend out each side from the wedge the crack ran along across the end of the log and thence down the side and grew wider and wider every moment at last the wedge was driven in as far as it would go and still the log was not split open  now stop said rollo i will put a stick in and keep the crack open while you drive the wedge in in another place  o that wont do said the boy a stick would not keep it open  why not said rollo  because it is not solid enough the sides of the cleft draw together very hard they would crush the stick  here rollo put his hand into his pocket and drew out a walnut and he asked the boy if it would crack a walnut  try it said the boy  so rollo put the walnut into the crack he slipped it along until he got it to a place where the crack was just wide enough to receive it and hold it steady he left it there and then the boy began to knock out the wedge  he struck it first upon one side and then upon the other and thus gradually worked it out the walnut was crushed all to pieces the boy then drove in the wedge again so as to open the log as it was before he then went to the place where he had got the beetle and wedge at first and brought a large wooden wedge which he had made before and began to put that into the crack not very far from the iron wedge  this will keep it open said he  yes i think it will said rollo but put it up close to the iron wedge  no said the boy for then i cant knock the iron wedge out  so the boy put the large wooden wedge in at a little distance from the iron one and drove it in rather gently with the beetle this opened the cleft a little more so that the iron wedge came out pretty easily  i dont see what makes the sides of the logs draw together so hard said rollo  o they cant help it said the boy  that is no reason rejoined rollo i should think that after the log is once split open it would stay so if i split a piece of wood in two with my knife the pieces dont try to come together again  so rollo began to examine the log and to look into the cracks to see if he could find out what it was that made the parts draw together so hard as to crush the walnut presently he observed that the log was not split open from end to end the crack commenced at one end and extended nearly towards the other but not quite so that at this other end the log was solid and whole just as it always had been so rollo perceived that the two halves being joined and held together firmly here they could only be separated at the other end by the wedge springing them open and of course by their elasticity they tended to spring together again then besides he saw by looking into the crack a great number of splinters large and small which extended obliquely from one side to the other and bound the two sides strongly towards each other  by this time the boy had got the wedge knocked out  it is strange said rollo that such a small wedge will split such a tough and solid log  o not very strange said the boy you see he continued taking up the wedge and pointing to the several parts as he explained them you see here at this part where it enters the wood it is sharp and the sides spread out each way so that when i drive it in they force the wood apart  why dont they have the back of the wedge wider still and then it would force the wood open farther and then you would not have to put in a wooden wedge afterwardsso he added making a sign with his fingers he put the tips of his fingers together and then separated his hands so as to represent a very bluntshaped wedge  then it would not drive in so easily answered the boy perhaps i could not drive it in at all if it was so blunt  they might have the wedge longer then said rollo and then it would be just as tapering and yet it would be a great deal broader at the back because the back would be farther off  that would make the wedge a great deal too heavy it would not drive  why yes it would said rollo  no it would not said the boy it would be just like a shoemakers lapstone pounding it would hardly move it  rollo did not understand what the boy meant by what he said about the shoemakers lapstone so he paused a moment and presently he said  i dont think it would make any difference if it was heavy and besides it might be made of wood and that wouldnt be heavy  o wood wouldnt do said the boy  now it happened that while they had been talking the boy had gone on driving in his wooden wedge into the cleft that the iron one had made and it had been gradually splitting the log open more and more so that just as the boy was saying that a wooden wedge wouldnt do rollo was actually seeing with his own eyes that it would do for at that moment the boy gave the last blow and the halves of the log came apart and fell over one to one side and the other to the other  why there said rollo you have split the log open with a wooden wedge  o that is because i had an iron one in first said the boy  what difference does that make said rollo  a great deal of difference said the boy  but what difference persisted rollo  i dont know exactly what difference said the boy only i know you cant do any thing with a wooden wedge until you have first opened a seam with an iron one  rollo was confident that it could not possibly make any difference whether a wooden wedge was used first or last the boy was sure that it did though he could not tell why finally they determined to try it so the boy struck his axe into the end of the next log and then attempted to drive in his wooden wedge but he did not succeed at all the wedge would not stay rollo told him that he did not strike hard enough then he struck harder but it did no good the wedge dropped out the moment he let go of it and on taking it up they found that the edge of it was bruised and battered so that even rollo gave up all hopes of making it enter  ah said the boy taking up the wedge and looking at it now i know what the reason is it is the edge  where said rollo let me see  why when there is no crack said the boy you see the edge of the wedge comes against the solid wood and when i drive it only bruises and batters it but the iron is hard and goes in but then when a crack is made the wedge can go in easily for the edge does not touch then only the sides rub against the wood  how said rollo i dont understand  ill show you in a minute said the boy so he took the iron wedge and went to work driving it into the log it soon began to make a crack which ran along the log and opened wider and wider when at length it was pretty wide he put the wooden wedge in and he showed rollo that the edge of the wedge did not now have to force its way but went easily into the crack and only the sides came in contact with the two parts of the log which it was separating  thats curious said rollo  yes said the boy  i wish i had a little beetle and wedge said rollo i have got a hammer that would do for a beetle if i only had a wedge  o a hammer wont do said the boy  why not would not an axe do as well as a beetle  no said the boy it would spoil the axe and the wedge too  how asked rollo  why it would bruise it all uphard iron knocking against the hard iron  would it said rollo  yes replied the farmers boy it would spoil the head of the axe and the head of the wedge too  is that the reason why they make a wooden beetle  yes said the boy and they put iron rings around the ends to keep the wood from being bruised and battered  o i wish i had a little beetle and wedge said rollo  perhaps you might make one  o i could not make an iron wedgenor the beetle rings  no but you might make wedges of woodpretty hard wood that would do to split up pieces of pine boards and then you would not need any rings to your beetle  jonas can help me said rollo  yes said the boy jonas will know all about it  so rollo set out to go home full of the idea of making a wooden beetle and wedge so as to split up pieces of boards he determined in case he should succeed to make a smaller one still for thanny     the little beetle and wedge   when rollo got home he looked about for jonas every where but could not find him he went around the house and yard calling jonas jonas very loud presently nathan came out to the door and told him that his mother wanted to see him so rollo went in to his mother  you ought not to make such a noise said she calling jonas you disturb us all  but mother said he i want to find him very much  no doubt said his mother but you must find him with your eyes not with your tongue  why mother said rollo laughing what do you mean by that  boys very generally have a habit of trying to find people with their tongues that is by calling them but it is a very bad habit you see she continued there are five or six persons now in and about the house and if you go around calling out for jonas you disturb us all but if you go about quietly and look for him you do not disturb any body  but then it is not so easy to find him by looking for him said rollo  why not asked his mother  because said rollo i can call out for him in a moment in the yard and then if he is any where within hearing he answers and so i know where he is but it would take me some time to go to all the places that are within hearing  true said his mother i see it is more trouble to find any body with your eyes than with your voice but then it is so much pleasanter for all the rest of us that you must submit to it  so rollo went away again to look for jonas he inquired of dorothy in the kitchen and she told him that she saw jonas going out towards the barn a few minutes before so rollo went off in pursuit of him  he found him at work in a little back room in the barn looking over some harnesses  what are you doing jonas said rollo  i am overhauling these harnesses to get them all ready for winter  for winter said rollo  yes replied jonas they are sleighharnesses  well jonas said rollo i wanted to see you about a beetle and wedge do you think you could help me about making a little beetle and wedge  i can help you by my advice said jonas  o but i want you to help me make them  then jonas asked rollo what made him think of a beetle and wedge and rollo told him of the conversation he had held with the farmers boy then jonas talked a long time about it giving him particular advice and direction about the plan though he said he could not himself go and help him then for he could not leave his harnesses  the advice which jonas gave him was substantially this  the boy was right in what he said about the necessity of having iron wedges to split up large logs of hard wood but you had better have short pieces of pine boards for your logs and then wedges of hard wood will do instead of iron for hard wood is so much more solid than pine that i think wedges of it will answer very well there are some pieces of walnut under the bench which will do finely and i will give you one of them  ill go now and get it said rollo  no said jonas not yet let me tell you about making the beetle  so rollo stood in the door way waiting to hear what jonas had to say about the beetle but evidently quite impatient to go  if you make your wedges of hard wood it will not be necessary to have iron rings to your beetle because it will not get battered much in driving wooden wedges now you must go to the wood pile and look out a piece of round wood about as large round as my arm and bore a hole in it  a hole in it said rollo  yes a small auger hole to put the handle into then you must put the wood into the sawhorse and saw off the ends at a little distance from the hole so that when the handle is put in it will be like a mallet  a mallet said rollo but i wanted a beetle  well a mallet is a small beetle without rings  is it said rollo thoughtfully  yes replied jonas and if you work slowly and carefully i think you can make a pretty good one yourself  rollo thought so too and away he ran to make the experiment under the great work bench he found among a quantity of boards and bits of wood a number of long bars of walnut which jonas had split out from the wood pile to keep for handles he took one of these and carried it off to the shed to look for the saw and the hatchet  the first thing was as he supposed to saw off a piece of the wood just long enough for a wedge but in this he was mistaken in doing any piece of work of this kind it is always very important to consider which part it is best to do first rollo did not think of this and so he marked off a piece of the walnut wood about long enough for a wedge and then sawed it off  now said he i must make the sides smooth and sharpen it  so he took the piece of wood in his hand and put one end of it down upon a large log of wood and then attempted to smooth and sharpen it as he had seen jonas sharpen a stake but he could not succeed very well the wood was very hard and he could not cut it then it was so short that it was almost impossible to hold it at almost every blow of the hatchet it slipped out of his hand and then besides he was very much afraid of cutting his fingers so that after working laboriously for some time he came back to jonas in despair holding his wedge in his hands which however instead of being properly sharpened was only rounded off a little at the corners  o dear me said he to jonas as he came up to him with the intended wedge in his hands i cant make a wedge at all its no use to try then he explained to jonas the difficulties that he had met with  true said jonas i see i advise you to give it up  yes said rollo the wood is so hard  o no said jonas that is no great troubleyou could easily manage that  but then i cant hold it  that is of no consequence either i could tell you a way to hold it well enough  what is the reason then why you think i had better give up  because you have not patience enough  rollo stood silent and thoughtful as jonas said this with his piece of wood in one hand and his hatchet in the other  it takes a great deal of patience to make a thing which we never made before  why said rollo  o because there are always unforeseen difficulties we dont know exactly how to do it and are apt to make mistakes and so we spoil some of our work and this makes us impatient and fretful  but i could not help coming to you said rollo when i found i could not sharpen my wedge  i did not blame you for coming to me said jonas  but you said i was impatient  yes but not for coming to mei judged by your looks and tone of voice now if you can keep goodnatured and pleasant so as to go on steadily and patiently difficulties or no difficulties i will help you by my advice otherwise i think you had better give up the plan  rollo stood a few minutes leaning on the door and swinging it back and forth a little he seemed to be in doubt whether to be goodnatured or not at length the better feelings triumphed and he said  well jonas i will try how can i hold my wedge while i sharpen it  you must not saw it off until it is all sharpened and smoothed by that means you see the long end of the stick that you make it from will serve for a handle  so it will said rollo i never thought of that  so rollo went off in pursuit of the stick from which he had sawed off his first wedge intending to make another upon the end of it and then saw it off when it was all ready  he found that now he could hold his wood very easily and there was no danger of cutting his fingers so he could strike much heavier blows he soon sharpened his wedge and then carried it to jonas to ask him if he thought it would do  no said jonas i dont think it will do very well  wont it asked rollo looking somewhat disappointed  why you see the sides are not smooth and then you have not sharpened it uniformly you have cut away more at the corners than you have in the middle so that it is thicker in the middle that is the way that boys always sharpen wedges  why do they asked rollo  i suppose it is because it is easier to cut away at the edges and so they get more off there now you had better get your wedge as true and perfect and smooth as you can before you saw it off it will be a great deal pleasanter to work with a good wedge than with a poor one and so you had better take pains with it and make as perfect a one as you can if you make any  but jonas said rollo i can smooth it and finish it after i get it sawed off  not half as easily as you can now said jonas  during all this time jonas kept on with his own work and now he said no more and seemed disposed to leave rollo to his own decision  rollo walked slowly back to the shed he longed to have his wedge done but then jonas had often told him before that if he was attempting to make any thing it was best to take pains with it and make it as complete and perfect as possible and then he would prize it more and take more pleasure in it when it was done rollo knew that this was good advice though like almost all other boys he was always in such a hurry to finish any thing that he undertook and to have it ready for use that he did not like to take the necessary pains  on reflection however he concluded to take jonass advice and he accordingly began to smooth the sides of his wedge again with the hatchet he did it slowly and carefully and after some time he found that he had got the wedge into a much more perfect shape than before he then carried it to jonas again  now jonas approved it very much but told him that he had better smooth it a little more with his knife before sawing it off rollo did so and then he carried it back to the horse and sawed it off at the right distance and it made an excellent wedge the edges at the head of the wedge were left somewhat rough by the saw these however he trimmed off with his knife and then carried the wedge to jonas  very well said jonas now you want one more  one more said rollo no i want my beetle next  no said jonas one more wedge make all your wedges first  why jonas you see if i make my beetle next i can try it with this wedge and then i can make another if i want it afterwards  no replied jonas that is not a good way you ought to finish up your apparatus all complete before you try it at all then you will take a great deal more pleasure in trying it besides if you get to work splitting up your wood you will not want to leave it and go to making a new wedge then now is the time to do it  rollo felt very desirous to make his beetle first so as just to try it a little as he said still he had so often found when he had not followed jonass advice that he was sorry for it afterwards that he concluded to make another wedge now he accordingly went to work again and having learned how to do it by his practice upon the first one he succeeded very easily and finished it much quicker than he did before  then he went to work upon his beetle he selected a round stick of wood of about the right size and then examined it carefully to find the part which was most uniform and regular in its shape and he bored a hole for the handle in the middle of this part he made his handle of pine wood for this was much easier to cut and jonas told him he thought it would do nearly as well when the handle was finished he drove it into the hole and then he sawed off the ends of the stick of wood at the right distances from the hole he first took pains to measure on each side so as to have the distances exactly the same  when this was done he had quite a pretty little mallet that is it was made very much like a carpenters mallet still as a mallet is made chiefly for the purpose of driving a chisel and this was on the other hand only intended to be used for splitting wood with a wedge jonas told him he thought it would be strictly proper to call it a little beetle he worked so slowly and carefully however in doing all this that the afternoon had entirely passed away when he got the beetle and the wedges done and just when he was thinking that he was ready to try them he saw dorothy at the kitchen door ringing the bell to call him in to tea     splitting   when play time came the next day rollo ran after nathan to show him his beetle and wedges and to get him to go out and see him split with them nathan trotted along after him very much pleased  rollo had his beetle in one hand and his two wedges in the other and as he walked along he looked over his shoulder towards nathan who was following him and talked to him by the way explaining to him something about his beetle and wedges  you see i am going to split thanny i am going to split some kindling wood for dorothy i shall put my wedges into the wood and then drive them in with my beetle and that will make the wood split open more and more and perhaps i will let you split a little thanny  by this time rollo had got out to the shed and he put his beetle and wedges down upon the floor while he went away to get some boards to split there were some old boards behind the barn which jonas told him were to be split up to burn and from these he chose one which was not very long and dragged it to the shed he placed this upon the sawhorse and then sawed off a piece from one end about as long as he thought it would be well to have the sticks of kindling wood after he had sawed off one piece he was going to split it up but then he reflected that it would be more systematic and workmanlike to finish his sawing first so he sawed off another and another piece until the board was all sawed up into short pieces he placed these together neatly in a pile and then taking one of them he sat down upon the floor with thanny and prepared to try his beetle and wedges  now said rollo i think i must have a knifesome old knife or otherto make a little place to drive my wedge in thanny why cant you go and ask dorothy to let me have a knife come thats a good boy  so nathan got up off of the floor where he had been sitting by rollos side and went in for a knife in a few minutes he came out and asked rollo if a broken one would do he had brought out a broken knife the handle was whole and strong but the blade was broken in two about in the middle  why yes said rollo taking the knife and looking at it i believe that will do  yes he continued i shall like this better for i can keep this all the time with my wedges and besides i believe that i can drive it better  so rollo held the edge of the knife to the end of the board and then drove it in a little way with his little beetle this made a small opening or cleft in the angle or edge of the board at one end then he began to drive in his wooden wedge telling nathan to look carefully and see when it began to split nathan stood near him stooping down with his hands upon his knees and looking on with great attention  illustration  rollo drove in his wedge and it proceeded admirably the wood soon began to crack and the crack gradually extended almost to the end of the board when he had driven it in pretty far he told nathan to see how he was going to manage with his second wedge he was now very glad that he had followed jonass advice and made the second wedge before trying the first he inserted the second wedge in the crack and drove it in this forced the wood open more and loosened the first wedge so that he could easily get it out again and very soon the board was split entirely in two nathan was very much delighted with the whole operation  in the same manner rollo split two or three other pieces off from his board and then nathan wanted him to let him split one rollo was at first somewhat unwilling to let his little beetle go out of his hand at all he was so interested in using it but considering that it would give nathan a good deal of pleasure he concluded to let him try it once  i will start it for you thanny said he and he accordingly made a small cleft by driving in his knife and then he inserted the wedge and drove that in too just far enough to start the crack and enable the wood to retain the wedge nathan then took the beetle and pounded away  he found that he could not strike such heavy blows as rollo could and yet the wedge gradually penetrated farther and farther and the crack opened wider and wider to nathans great delight rollo was himself gratified to see how much his little brother was pleased with his beetle and wedges when the first wedge was driven fully in he handed him the other and showed him how to insert that into the crack made by the first wedge at a little distance from it nathan then drove in the second wedge and this soon finished the work for it split the piece off entirely and nathan took it up and looked at it very much pleased at what he had done  now said rollo give me the beetle again  no said nathan i want to split some more  o no said rollo in a tone of goodhumored expostulation no it is my beetle and wedge i let you have it to split one stick off but now you ought to let me have it again immediately  no said nathan i want to split some more  rollo took up the two wedges and would not let nathan have them and nathan held the beetle away behind him so that rollo should not have that thus they seemed to be in inextricable difficulty rollo did not know what to do  nathan said he at length after a pause give me my beetle  no said nathan i want to split  o dear me said rollo with a sigh  at first he thought that he would take the beetle away from nathan by force but he reflected in a moment that this would be wrong and so finally he concluded to go and state the case to his mother  so he rose and began to walk away saying  well nathan i mean to go and tell mother that you wont let me have my beetle  then nathan whose conscience secretly reproved him for what he was doing pulled the beetle round from behind him and threw it down upon the floor where rollo had been sitting this was wrong it was a very illnatured way of giving it up if he was satisfied that he was wrong he ought to have handed it to rollo pleasantly instead of that he threw it down with a sullen look and sat still  then rollo thinking that it was now no longer necessary to go and trouble his mother with the difficulty began to return as he came back he said in a kind and soothing tone  now you are a good boy nathan that is rightto give me back my beetle now i will let you split again some time  but rollo was mistaken in supposing that nathan was a good boy boys are not good until their hearts are right when a child has something which he ought not to have it is not enough for him to throw it down upon the floor sullenly because he is afraid to have his father or mother told that he has got it he ought to give it up pleasantly and feel that it is right that he should do so if nathan had said to himself i ought not to keep this beetle for it is not mineit is rollos he made it and he has been kind enough to lend it to me and now i ought to be willing to give it back to him pleasantly again and then had given it to him with a pleasant countenancethat would have been really being a good boy but to throw it down in a pet because he was afraid to have rollo complain to his mother was very far from being like a good boy  however it was very kind in rollo to speak soothingly and pleasantly to nathan though if he had reflected how much goodness depends upon the state of the heart he would not have supposed that nathan was yet a good boy in fact when he saw that rollo was coming back again and was not going to his mother after standing still looking quite sullen for a moment he suddenly stooped down seized rollos knife and ran off with it out into the yard  rollo instantly pursued him calling out nathan bring back my knife nathan nathan give me my knife  nathan however ran on though rollo ran the fastest and was rapidly overtaking him and just at the instant before he reached him nathans foot tripped he fell and as he threw forward his hands to try to save himself they came down upon the ground and his forehead struck the corner of the knife blade he immediately screamed out with pain and terror dorothy alarmed by his cries came out took him up in her arms and carried him into the house  she took him to the table and began to bathe the wounded forehead in cold water this was what she always did when the children got cut or scratched or hurt in any such way it prevents inflammation she saw that nathan was not hurt much though he continued to cry very loud his crying was however partly from pain and partly from vexation  in a few minutes rollos mother came down stairs to see what was the matter rollo thought that his mother might suppose that he had hurt nathan and so he began to explain at once how it happened but his mother held up her hand to him as a signal for him to be silent she knew that it was then no time to ascertain the facts  she came up and looked at nathans forehead a moment and she saw that it was not much hurt besides she knew by the sound of nathans cries that they did not proceed from much pain she therefore said to him gently  stop crying nathan  now nathan knew that his mother did not tell him not to cry except when she was sure that he could control himself if he chose to do so and he also knew that she punished him if he did not obey so he began immediately to repress his sobs and cries and very soon became still she then put a small plaster of some sort upon his forehead and then carried him up stairs and laid him on the bed  there said she thanny lie still there a little while till your forehead has done aching and you get pleasant again then you may get up and come to me  then she went to her work again and rollo came and stood by her side and told her the whole story  nathan did wrong said she but it would have been better for you not to have run after him  why mother said rollo he was running away with my knife and i cant split at all without my knife one thing i knowi shall not let him split any more with my beetle and wedges  that would be one way to treat him said his mother but there is another thing you might do if you chose  what mother asked rollo  why make him a beetle and wedge for his own  why mother said rollo with surprise  yes said she you might make him one think how pleased he would be with it then he could sit down with you and you could both be splitting together  but seems to me mother that that would be rewarding him for being a naughty boy  it would be so if you were to make him a beetle and wedge because he was a bad boy but i proposed that you should make it for another reason that is to please him  but perhaps he would think i did it because he ran away with my knife said rollo  i dont think there is any danger that he would imagine that you did it as a reward for that replied his mother  here rollo paused a moment he did not feel quite ready to undertake to make nathan a beetle and wedges but he did not know exactly how to reply to his mothers reasoning at length he said in a timid and hesitating voice  but mother it seems to me that it would be better to punish nathan rather than reward him or do any thing which would seem like rewarding him for acting so  that may be true said his mother and it is true also that if you should refuse to let him split wood any more with your wedges it would be punishing him while on the other hand if you should make him a little beetle and wedge of his own it would be forgiving him now i do not say that he ought not to be punished but which do you think is your duty towards himyou yourself being only another child a few years older than heto punish or to forgive  whyto forgivei suppose said rollo rather doubtfully  i am rather inclined to that opinion myself said his mother but you can do just as you please  rollo remained some minutes about his mothers chair not knowing exactly what to do or say next he sat down upon the floor and began to play with some shreds of cloth which were lying there presently he looked up and said  mother what was the reason why you would not let me tell you what was the matter with nathan in the kitchen  because said she he was crying then and it is no time to learn how an injury happened during the excitement of the moment if you find nathan crying out in the yard for instance and try to get him to tell you how he got hurt you only make him cry the more get him quiet first and then learn the story afterwards  then besides the difficulty of his speaking intelligibly she continued at such a time boys are very strongly tempted to misrepresent the facts during the excitement of the first moments they are very likely to be a little vexed or angry and under the influence of those feelings not to give a correct and honest account so that it is always best to put off inquiries till the trouble is all over  here nathan came into the room his forehead had ceased to give him pain and so he had clambered down from the bed where his mother had placed him and now came into the room looking quiet and calm though still not very happy  rollo went to him and said come nathan now we will go down stairs to play again and he began to lead him down stairs as they walked along rollo said  i am going to make you a beetle and wedge for your own nathan and then you and i can split together only it is not a reward you must understand it was wrong for you to keep my beetle and run away with my knife and you are sorry you did so ant you nathan  yes said nathan  and you wont do so any more will you nathan  no said nathan i wont do so any more  whether nathan was really sorry for what he had done or whether he only said so because rollo was going to make him a beetle is very doubtful though it is not impossible that he was a little sorry  rollo went down into the shed again with nathan and while he was at work making the new beetle and wedge he let nathan use his the first piece of board had been split up so he laid another one before nathan and gave him his beetle and wedges and knife and then went away out to the barn to get some more wood for wedges and an auger  when he came back he found nathan standing at the shed door with the little beetle in his hand waiting for him as nathan saw rollo coming he called to him saying  come rollo come and help me the board wont split  what is the matter with it said rollo  i dont know said nathan only it wont split  so rollo went in to see he found that nathan had gone to work wrong instead of trying to drive the wedge into the end of the board so as to split it along the grain he had made the cleft with the knife in the side of the board and was attempting to drive it in there as if he supposed he could split the board across the grain  why nathan said rollo that isnt right you cant split it across  then he put the wedge into the end where it ought to be put and set nathan to driving it now it began to split at once though nathan could not see why the board should not split one way as well as the other  rollo himself did not understand it very well nathan asked him why it would not split the other way and he said that that was across the grain but when nathan asked him what he meant by grain he could not tell  he took up the wood and examined it and observed little lines and ridges running along in the direction in which it would split but at the ends of the board where it had been sawed across the grain it was rough he determined to ask jonas about it or his father  he then went to work and made the wedges and a little beetle for nathan he made nathans beetle smaller than his own because nathan was not strong enough to strike hard with such a heavy beetle he did not get it done in season to use that day but the next day he and nathan sat down upon the shed floor and spent an hour in splitting up the boards they split them all up into good fine kindling wood then they piled the pieces up in a neat pile and then brought dorothy out to see them  dorothy seemed very much pleased and promised the boys that the next time she baked pies she would kindle the fire in the oven with their kindling wood and then she would bake them each a little apple turnover                                       that evening just before rollo went to bed he asked jonas if he could tell him why boards would only split along the grain  yes said jonas i think i can tell you but do you know what the grain is  no said rollo i dont know any thing about it  you know that boards are made from the stems of tall trees  yes said rollo  well now when trees are growing there are little channels running up and down from the roots to the branches  what are they for said rollo  they are for the sap the sap flows up and down in them but then there are no channels across from one side of the tree to the other because there is no sap to go across the sap all has to go up from the roots to the branches and so the channels must all be up and down the tree  now continued jonas when they cut down the tree the trunk will split easily up and down the way the channels and fibres all go but it wont split easily across and just so when they saw it up into boards the boards will all split lengthwise from end to end for this is the way the channels and fibres all lie but it wont split across for that would be across all the fibres and the wood is made very strong in that direction and it is well it is so  why said rollo  because if trees would split across as easily as they do up and down the first good wind would blow down all the forests in the world  o jonas exclaimed rollo all the forests in the world  yes replied jonas if the wind blew all over the world     horology   one day at eleven oclock rollo after having put away his books carefully into his desk went out to play it was a calm and pleasant autumnal day brown and yellow leaves were falling from the trees and lying about the yard rollo found nathan sitting upon the steps of the door which looked toward the garden yard he felt satisfied and happy for he had studied his lessons diligently and when he saw nathan he concluded to have a little play with him  now nathan said rollo i will lie down upon the steps and make believe i am a bear gone to sleep and you come and poke me with your stick and then i will growl at you  well said nathan i will  so rollo laid down upon the steps putting his arms upon the threshold of the door for a pillow and his head upon his arms and pretended to be asleep but he did not look much as if he was asleep after all for he could not look quite sober he tried to look sober but there was a lurking smile upon his face which made his countenance look quite different from that of a bear nathan came creeping along softly and when he got near enough he began to poke him with the end of his little whiphandle then rollo would start up and begin to growl when nathan would scamper away shouting with laughter rollo after him upon allfours  this play lasted several minutes until at length nathan spoiled it by punching rollo too hard with his whiphandle a great many plays are spoiled by roughness on the part of some who are engaged rollo being hurt a little got out of patience he ought to have asked nathan pleasantly not to punch him so hard instead of that however he declared that he would not play any more and got up and went away nathan followed him lashing the ground and the leaves with his whip  they both went into a corner of the yard where rollo used to have his sandgarden this sandgarden was made of clean sand which rollo and his cousin james once wheeled up from the brook and then after they had smoothed it out and raked it over they used to get plants and flowers without any roots and stick down and then call it their garden they used to water the plants and so they could keep them green and bright for several days which was long enough for them for after that they generally preferred putting down fresh ones but now the sandgarden had been for a long time neglected the remains of some of the old plants were there withered and dried and the leaves of autumn were scattered over its surface  rollo began to rake off the leaves with his fingers and then sat down and went to digging a hole in the sand it was very dry upon the top but on digging down a little way he found it damp and so it would hold together pretty well and he could pat it into any shape a load of clean sand makes a very good place for children to play in in a corner of a yard  rollo sat down on one side of the sandgarden and nathan on the other and both busied themselves in digging and building little houses they both became very much interested and sat some time very still until at length rollo looked around to see what nathan might be doing  what are you doing thanny said he  o im making the sand run down through  rollo observed that nathan had an old tin dipper which he was holding up in one hand and putting some dry sand into it with the other there was a very small hole in the bottom of the dipper for it was an old one which had been worn out and thrown away and the sand ran out of this little hole in a fine stream and it was this which interested nathan so much  o nathan said rollo let me have the dipper  no said nathan i want it myself  rollo would not take it away from nathan though he wanted it very much indeed  yes nathan said he let me have the dipper and i will make you an hourglass out of it  but nathan said no no and moved away a little farther  rollo then remembered that such a little boy was generally not interested in any one thing very long and that if he should let nathan alone he would soon put the dipper down and then he could have it without any difficulty so he went on making houses in the sand and in a few minutes nathan put the dipper down then soon after rollo took it up and put some dry sand into it and he found that the sand would run very smoothly in a fine stream through a small hole there was in the bottom of it  he determined to make an hourglass of it he had seen an hourglass at his uncle georges it was made of glass big at the bottom and at the top and narrow in the middle between the two through the narrow part in the middle there was a very small hole to let the sand run down through and there was just sand enough put in to run through in an hour so that if a person should set the sand to running he would know when an hour had expired by observing when the sand had all run through  rollo thought that he could make an hourglass and he thought it would be a great convenience to him to have an hourglass in the yard because it often happened when he came out to play that his mother would tell him that he might stay out an hour and then he had to go in very often to look at the clock in order to know exactly when the hour had expired  there were however so many little sticks and old leaves in the sand that it kept getting continually clogged up and at last rollo began to get discouraged he tried to pick out the little sticks but he found he could not do that and at last it occurred to him that probably dorothy had some sand in the house that was cleaner  he accordingly went in and asked her she told him that he must wash his own sand and that would make it clean  but havent you got some that is clean already said he  yes said dorothy but you will like your hourglass better if you make it all yourself  so dorothy told him how to wash sand for rollo said that he did not know she said he must put a little in a basin and then pump water into it when the basin is nearly full of water you must stir it round and then pour off the water and pump in moredo this until the water comes off clear  so rollo took the basin which dorothy gave him and went out to his sandgarden and put in a little sand then he went to the pump and pumped water into it then he stirred it about with his hand the water immediately became very turbid and a great many little sticks and leaves came floating up to the surface rollo was surprised to find how rapidly the water separated the light things which would float upon the top from the heavy sand which would sink to the bottom he kept pouring off the water and pumping in more until at length no more sticks and leaves came off and the water appeared pretty clear then he carried the sand away and spread it out upon a clean board in the sun to dry  while he was thus at work preparing the sand for his hourglass jonas happened to come by and asked rollo what he was doing rollo told him that he was making an hourglass jonas looked on for a few minutes and then he told rollo that he thought that was a pretty good plan and i am going to have a timekeeper too said he  are you said rollo what  i am going to make a dial said he  a dial said rollo what a real dial  rollo had an idea that a dial was exceedingly complicated and difficult to make or to understand and in fact it is difficult to make one that shall be exact in its indications he did not think it possible that jonas could make one  yes said jonas a real dial and i have got a noon mark already  a noon mark said rollo what is a noon mark  it is a mark to show when it is exactly twelve oclock  let me go and see it said rollo while my sand is drying  rollo followed jonas off into the barn and when there jonas pointed to a small line which he had cut with his penknife upon the barn floor it began at the foot of one of the posts by the side of the door and extended back into the barn exactly straight  is that the noon mark said rollo he was surprised to see that a noon mark was nothing but a cut with a penknife upon a barn floor  yes said jonas that is a meridian  a meridian said rollo looking upon it with an air of great curiosity and respect  yes said jonas a line drawn exactly north and south is called a meridian line and that is exactly north and south  what do you call it a noon mark for said rollo  because said jonas the shadow of the edge of the door post will always be exactly upon it at noon so that i can always tell now when it is noon by the shadow of the post upon my noon mark if the sun shines  all this was very new and very curious to rollo he had never seen or heard of a noon mark before and it seemed to him a very simple and beautiful way of knowing when it was noon he asked jonas how he found out about it and jonas told him that he had been reading about it in a book on astronomy  your father let me have the book said he and see my chalk marks for the suns shadow  rollo looked and found that jonas had put down quite a number of chalk marks along in a line where they had first began to mark the place where the shadow of the door reached into rollo and lucy had forgotten all about their plan of making such a series of observations but jonas had gone on regularly making a mark every monday at noon precisely as the sun at that season of the year was going round farther and farther to the south every week it shone in farther and farther upon the floor so that each chalk mark was farther in than the one made the week before  in order to make his marks at the right time jonas wanted to know every monday when it was precisely twelve oclock and this led him to make his noon mark having seen the account of it in the book which rollos father had lent him he learned there that the shadows of all upright objects are cast exactly north at twelve oclock or rather very nearly north near enough for his purposes now as the post of the barn door was upright he knew that the shadow of it would be in the north and south line at noon of course if he had a north and south line or a meridian line as it was called in the book drawn upon the floor he knew that he could tell when it was noon by the shadow of the post coming then exactly upon that line he explained this all to rollo and rollo was very much pleased with it indeed he determined to have a noon line somewhere in the house  rollo asked jonas what was the way to draw a noon line jonas told him that there were several ways one way he said was to observe some day by the clock when it was exactly noon and then to mark upon the barn floor the line where the shadow of the edge of the post fell precisely at that moment another way was to get a compass needle and put it down upon the floor and then draw a north and south line precisely in the direction that the needle indicated that would of course be a north and south line because the compass needle always pointed north and south he said that he adopted both these methods to make his noon line first he got a compass needle which rollos father had lent him and put that down upon the barn floor just at the foot of the door post and observed the direction and he also noticed when it was twelve by the clock in the house and he found that when it was twelve by the clock the shadow of the post came exactly to the line indicated by the direction of the compass needle and so he knew that that was a correct meridian line     jonass dial   that evening rollo told his father about his hourglass and also about jonass noon line his father said it was very difficult to draw a meridian line  o no father said rollo jonas has drawn one and he told me how and it was a very easy way  yes said his father it is easy to draw something which you can call a noon mark but it is a very difficult and delicate operation to do it with any considerable degree of exactness  i think that jonass is exact said rollo  it probably may be as exact as he could make it with his means and instruments but there are a great many sources of error which he could not possibly have avoided  what asked rollo  why in the first place the clock is not exact it is near enough to answer all the purposes of a family but it may often be a minute or more out of the way then besides while jonas is going from the clock out to the barn the shadow is slowly moving on all the time so that he cannot tell exactly where the shadow was when it was precisely twelve by the clock  then again it is not always exactly noon when the shadow comes to the north and south line it varies a little at different seasons of the year though it is so near that we say in general terms that at noon all shadows of upright objects point to the north still it is not precisely true except on a very few days in the year then again the post of the barn door is not exactly upright  i thought they always made door posts exactly upright said rollo  they do make them as nearly upright as they can with the common carpenters instruments but they are not exact to set a post of any kind with great precision perpendicular to the horizon would require very expensive mathematical instruments and very laborious and nice observations then again if the clock had been exact and the post perfectly upright jonas could not have marked the place of the shadow exactly the shadow has not an exact and welldefined edge and then even while he was marking at one end the shadow would be moving along at the other end and so his noon mark would not be exactly straight  why father he could make the mark right along quick  no matter how quick he might make it it would take some time wouldnt it  only a very little said rollo  and do you suppose the sun would stand still even during that little time so as to let the shadow remain stationary  however continued his father i dont say this to disparage jonass noon mark i dare say it is accurate enough for his purposes he only wants to know from it when it is time for him to come in to dinner or something like that i only want you to understand what exactness is and to see a little how difficult it is to attain to any considerable degree of it in such cases so thus it seems that jonas has got a sort of a dial  why it only tells him what oclock it is at one hour in the day said rollo but i think he might make it do for all the afternoon and forenoon  how inquired his father  why all he has got to do is to watch some day when it is nine oclock and ten oclock and so on every hour and then make a line where the shadow comes every hour just as he did for twelve oclock then he will have marks for every hour in the day and when the shadow comes along to these marks one after another he will know what time it is  o but the difficulty is said his father that the shadow will not come to the same places at the same hours on different days it will come to the meridian line at twelve alwaysthat is nearly to it but it will not come to any other lines regularlythat is if the object which casts the shadow is upright  will any other kind of object carry the shadow regularly asked rollo  yes said his father an object that leans over to the north so as to point to the north star if you and jonas could put a post into the ground so as to have it point to the north star then you could mark all around it the places to which the shadow would come for every hour in the day and afterwards it would come to the same places regularly or nearly so it would be near enough for your purposes and i dont know but that it would be quite a respectable dial for you  rollo then asked his father why it was that a post which pointed to the north star would bring a shadow any more regularly to the hour marks than an upright one would but he said that rollo did not know enough yet to understand the explanation even if he were to try to explain it therefore said he you must wait until you study astronomy before you can expect to understand it but you can now in the mean time make such a dial if you wish to do it  rollo did wish to do it very much he accordingly told jonas all that his father had said it seemed very strange to jonas that a post pointing to the north star should have its shadows move round any more regularly than a post in any other position he could not imagine what the north star could have to do with the shadows still he determined to try the experiment  a few days after this jonas did try the experiment he got two narrow boards which were once pickets belonging to a picket fence one end of each was sharp so that it could be driven down into the ground then he selected a certain part of the yard in a corner where the dial would be out of the way and yet the path to the barn led along pretty near it the reason why jonas got two boards was this he knew that if he drove only one stake into the ground and inclined it towards the north star it would be very likely to get started out of its proper position but if he had two he could drive the second one down perpendicularly from the end of the first and then nail the two ends together and that would keep all steady  after having got every thing ready the boys waited till the evening before fixing up the dial because they could not see the north star in the day time but when the evening came they went out and began their preparations it was a clear and pretty cold evening and the stars were out in thousands  which is the north star asked rollo  jonas looked about a minute or two saying let me seewheres the dipper o i see a part of it the rest is down behind the barn it was up high the last time i saw it  where is the dipper said rollo looking eagerly in the direction to which jonas was turned  come this way said jonas so as to be out of the way of the barn and you can see it better  so jonas pointed out the dipper to rollo with its square body and long bent handle it was at first quite difficult for rollo to see any thing that looked at all like a dipper as it consisted only of stars which it required some imagination to make look like one  the handle reaches almost down to the ground said rollo  down to the horizon you mean said jonas  is that the horizon said rollo  yes said jonas where the earth and sky meet not long ago the dipper handle was away up there he continued pointing up very high  does the dipper move said rollo  yes it goes round and round the north star all the time all the stars that are near the north star keep going round and round it once every day  and the rest of the stars said rollo do they go round too  yes said jonas only they are so far from the north star that they go in larger circles and so go down below the horizon and are out of sight sometimes they come up in the east like the sun and go over and down in the west but they dont go over straight he added they dont come right up straight and so go directly over they slant away off to the south so as to keep always just so far from the north star  thats curious said rollo  i think it is said jonas and they all go together they dont move about among themselves at all  dont they said rollo  no said jonas only there are a few wandering stars that keep wandering about among the others but the rest all keep exactly in their places and all go round together so they are called fixed stars  show me one of the wandering stars said rollo  i dont know which they are said jonas only they are pretty bright ones  i guess thats one said rollo pointing to a pretty bright star in the east  perhaps it is said jonas  i wish i knew said rollo  ill tell you how you can find out said jonas  how asked rollo  why when you go into the house take a piece of paper and go to the window and make some dots upon it for all the stars around that one make the dots just in the places that the stars seem to be in then let them all go they will rise more and more and go overhead and down in the west and tomorrow night they will come up in the east again and then you can look at them again and see if the bright star has changed its place at all  rollo said that he meant to do that and then he said that he began to feel cold and wanted to go in but jonas told him that he ought to wait and help finish the dial  so they went to the place which jonas had selected and jonas looking up first at the north star made a hole in the ground with an iron bar in an oblique direction so that the bar should point pretty nearly to the north star then he drove in one of his stakes in the same way he then made a hole perpendicularly directly under the end of this inclined stake and drove the other stake down into that the two upper ends of the stakes were now together  then jonas stooped down so as to bring his eye near the edge of the inclined stake at the lower end so that he could sight along the edge of it towards the star he had previously cut a notch in it so that he could get his eye down far enough to look directly along the edge at the same time rollo took hold of the upper end and stood ready to move it either way as jonas might direct until it should point exactly towards the north star  down said jonas  then rollo moved it a little down  down more  rollo moved it farther  upup a little added jonas therethat will do now hold the two stakes firmly together exactly so  then jonas took some nails which he had before provided and nailed the tops of the stakes together rollo holding the axe up against them on the opposite side this supported the end of the inclined stake firmly so that it could not move up or down this was all that the boys wanted to do in the evening and so they both went in  the next day jonas sawed off the ends of both stakes where they projected beyond the junction and then rollo said he would watch the clock all day and mark the place where the shadow came each hour and drive a little stake down then said he our dial will be done  but what do you suppose is the reason said rollo that we must make it point to the north star more than to any other  i dont know said jonas unless it is because the north star is the only one that keeps always in the same place the rest move round and round every day those that are far enough from the north star to go down below the horizon rise and set and those that are not far enough go round and round in circles in the open sky but the north star keeps still  does it said rollo turning around and looking up to the part of the heavens where he had seen the star the evening before  yes said jonas and the reason why we cannot see it now is the bright daylight it is up there now just where it was last night  and the dipper too said rollo  yes and the dipper too only that has moved half round i suppose and is now away up above the north star  i wish i could see it said rollo and he looked as steadily and intently into the clear blue sky as he could but he could not possibly see the least sign of a star                                       however the sun shone bright and it cast a strong shadow from the stakes which they had driven into the ground jonas soon went away to his work and left rollo to mark the hours by means of the clock  so rollo had to go into the house very often to see what time it was and at last his father who was sitting there at his writing asked him what made him want to see the clock so much rollo told him the reason so his father put down his pen and came out to see the dial  when he saw the two stakes with their lower ends driven into the ground and the upper ends nailed firmly together he looked at them with a smile but did not say any thing  will that do said rollo looking up very eagerly into his fathers face  his father did not answer but continued to examine the work on all sides with a countenance expressive of curiosity and pleasure  it points to the north star exactly added rollo jonas sighted it  yes said his father i think that will do you have got quite a respectable gnomon  gnomon said rollo  yes said his father we call such a thing a gnomon in common dials they are made of brass but i dont see why this wont do very well it is rather a large gnomon  is it said rollo  yes said his father i think it is the biggest gnomon i ever saw  but how are you going to mark the hour lines rollo asked his father  why we are going to drive little stakes down into the ground  seems to me that you can contrive some better plan than that said his father  why said rollo is not that a good plan  not very good he replied because you cannot be exact in driving down stakes the beauty of a dial is its exactness i should think that you would do better to put a board down upon the ground and mark your lines upon that  o the board would get knocked about said rollo  i dare say that jonas would contrive some way to keep it steady  but he says he cant do any thing more about the dial today for he must attend to his work  let me seehe is putting the harnesses in order i believe  yes sir said rollo  well you may tell him that after he has done the harness that he is at work upon now he may finish his dial  then rollos father went into the house and away went rollo in pursuit of jonas  jonas liked the plan of putting a board down very much and in a short time he went to work to do it he planed out a board of the right length and then put it down upon the ground under and between the two stakes but nearest to the upright one they placed it across at right angles to the line between the stakes and of course as the stakes were in a north and south line the board was in an east and west line and so the shadows were cast exactly across it  the board being planed smooth the edge of the shadow could be seen much more distinctly upon it than upon the ground so jonas was satisfied that it would be a great deal better to draw the hour lines upon the board after having determined upon the place where it was to go he took it up again and then drove down two strong but short stakes sawed off square at the top into the ground one on each side so that they should come under the two ends of the board then he laid the board down again upon the stakes and nailed the ends of the board to them the stakes had been driven in until they were just level with the surface of the ground and so the board seemed to be lying along upon the ground too though it was in fact fastened securely to the short stakes then the boys marked the hour lines upon the board with some black paint and thus they had a very respectable dial when the sun shone rollo could tell what oclock it was near enough for all his purposes  illustration     the beehive   one of the drollest of all of rollos experiments was his plan for getting a beehive  one day he was in the garden with a playmate of his named henry who lived not very far from his fathers house  in the back part of the garden were some tall hollyhocks growing they were in full flower hollyhocks are very tall they grow up in a straight stem as high as a mans head with leaves and flowers from top to bottom  the flowers are large and shaped somewhat like a cup or rather a wineglass and bees often go into them to get honey  now it happened that as rollo and henry were sauntering about near these hollyhocks rollo happened to see a bee in one of the flowers loading himself up with wax or honey the flower that the bee was in was just about as high as rollos head  o theres a bee said rollo lets catch him  catch him said henry if you do youll catch a sting i rather think  no said rollo i can catch him without getting stung  how said henry  i will show you said rollo  so saying rollo approached the hollyhocks and put both his hands up slowly to the flower which the bee was in he then very carefully gathered together the edges of the flower so as to enclose and imprison the bee he then gently broke off the stem of the flower and held it up to henrys ear to let him hear the bee buzz within  now said rollo i wish i had a little beehive i would put him in and perhaps he would make some honey in there  do you think he would said henry  yes replied rollo i have no doubt he would bees always make honey in beehives  havent you got some box that will do said henry  i dont know said rollo let us go along towards the barn and see if we cant find one i suppose it is no matter what the shape of it is he added if it is only a box with a small hole for the bees to go in and out  but you havent got but one bee said henry as they walked along towards the barn  rollo held the flower with the bee imprisoned in it safely in his fingers  o i can catch plenty more i could catch a whole hive of them in time  but i dont believe they will stay and work in your hive said henry they will all fly off and go home to where they belong  no said rollo i will plug up the hole and keep them shut in until they get used to it when they get wonted to the new hive they will stay there after that i know thats the way they do with doves  but you wont have any queen bee said henry bees wont work without a queen bee i read it in a book  well perhaps i can catch a queen bee some day said rollo rather doubtfully  rollo was so much interested in his plan that he was determined not to see any difficulties in the way of it and yet he could not help feeling that there was some uncertainty about his succeeding in entrapping a queen bee  however just at this point in the conversation he suddenly stopped and pointed down to a flowerpot which stood bottom upwards upon a seat near where they were walking  there said he that will do for a beehive  ho said henry that is not a box  no matter said rollo it is just as good and there is a little hole for the bees to go out and in at  there is always a little hole in the bottom of a flowerpot  so there is said henry but do you think that the bees will make honey in an earthen pot  o yes said rollo just as well as in any thing the bees dont care what they make the honey in sometimes they make it in old logs  well said henry and well call it a honeypot and where shall we put it  we can keep it on this seat it is as good a place as any the bees will be right in the garden as soon as they come out of their hive  so saying rollo asked henry to hold his bee a minute while he got the honeypot ready henry took the flower very carefully so as not to let the bee escape and then rollo lifted up the flowerpot and looked inside it was pretty clean but as rollo knew that bees were very nice in their habits he thought he would just take it to the pump and wash it out a little  in a few minutes he brought it back and replaced it bottom upwards upon the seat and then prepared to put the bee in he took the flower again from henrys hand and then very carefully inserted the edges of it which had been gathered together with his fingers into the hole he then began to knock and push the bottom of the flower to make the bee go in the bee not knowing what to make of this treatment kept up a great buzzing but soon went in  there said rollo now henry you be ready to clap your thumb over the hole as soon as i take the flower away or else hell come out  o no said henry hell fly up and sting me  no he wont said rollo i only want you to keep him in a minute while i go and get a plug  henry then with much hesitation and fear put his thumb over the hole as rollo withdrew the flower he stood there while rollo went for a plug but he seemed to feel very uneasy and continually called rollo to be quick  rollo could not find a plug but he picked up a small flat stone and concluded that that would do just as well so he released henry from his dangerous position and put the stone over the hole  there said rollo with a tone of great satisfaction when he had done this now he is safe well let him stay while we go and catch another bee  so they went back to the hollyhocks and there quite fortunately they found another bee just going into one of the flowers rollo secured him in the same way and carried him along and pushed him into the flowerpot henry stood ready to clap the stone on as soon as he was in and then they came back to the hollyhocks again they had then to wait a little while watching for bees at length however one came and by and by another and so in the course of an hour or two they got seven bees all safe in the honeypot and rollo said he thought seven were about enough to go to work at least to begin they had not yet found any one however that seemed to rollo to be a queen bee  at last it was time for henry to go home and rollo concluded to leave his beehive until the next morning he thought he would leave the hole stopped up so that the bees might get used to their new accommodations but he intended to open it the next day in order to let them begin their work  the next morning henry came over soon after breakfast to see how affairs stood in respect to the beehive he and rollo went out into the garden to look at the establishment and found every thing as they had left it the night before rollo felt quite confident of the success of his experiment the only thing that gave him any uneasiness was the want of a queen bee he and henry were just speculating upon the expediency of sending in a bumblebee instead for a king when their attention was arrested by hearing jonas calling rollo they looked up and saw him standing at the garden gate  rollo said jonas do you want to go out with me to the pasture and catch the horse  whyyes said rollo but yet he did not go he seemed to feel in doubt must you go this minute said he  yes said jonas come and henry may go too  well wait a minute just till i go and open the door in my beehive  your beehive said jonas what do you mean by that  but rollo did not hear what jonas said for he had run off along the alley henry after him towards the place where they had established their hive  what does he mean by his beehive said jonas to himself i mean to go and see  so jonas opened the garden gate and came in when he came up near the seat where henry and rollo stood he found the boys standing a step or two back from the flowerpot both watching the hole with the utmost intentness  what are you looking at there boys said jonas with great surprise  o we are looking to see the bees come out  the bees come out said jonas  yes said rollo that is our beehivehoneypot we call it we have put some bees in it  here jonas burst into a loud and long and apparently incontrollable fit of laughter henry and rollo looked upon him with an expression of ludicrous gravity and perplexity  what are you laughing at said rollo  jonas could hardly control himself sufficiently to speak but presently he succeeded in asking rollo if he supposed that bees would make honey there  certainly i do said rollo with a positive air why should they not they dont care what shape their hive is or what it is made of and this flowerpot is as good as any thing else there there see henry he exclaimed interrupting himself and pointing down to the flowerpot one is coming out  henry and jonas both looked and they saw a poor forlornlooking bee cautiously putting forth his head at the hole and then slowly crawling out he came on until he was fairly out of the hole and then extending his wings rose and flew away through the air  here jonas burst out again in a fit of laughter  you neednt laugh jonas said rollo hell come back again i know he will thats the way they always do  and you suppose that the bees will fill up the flowerpot with honey said jonas  yes said rollo and then i shall take it away without killing any of the bees i read how to do it in a book  how shall you do it said jonas  why when this honeypot is full of honey i shall get another and put on the top of it bottom upwards then the bees will work up into that and come out at the upper hole when they get fairly at work in the upper hive then i shall get henry to hold it while i slip the lower one out and put the upper one down in its place  illustration  as rollo was speaking these words in order to show jonas more exactly how he meant to perform the operation he took hold of the flowerpot with both his hands and slid it suddenly off of the seat now it happened that the poor bees that were inside chilled with the dampness and cold were nearly all crawling about upon the seat and when rollo suddenly moved the flowerpot along forgetting for a moment what there was inside the rough edges of the flowerpot bruised and ground them to death and they dropped down upon the walk some dead some buzzing a little and one trying to crawl  there now rollo said henry in a tone of great disappointment and sorrow now you have killed all our bees  rollo looked astonished enough he had no idea of such a catastrophe and he and henry both at the same instant took up the honeypot to see if any of the bees had escaped destruction their eyes fell at the same moment upon one solitary bee that was standing upon the inside of the flowerpot his attention had been arrested by the sudden glare of light and so just as rollo and henry first observed him and before they had time to put the flowerpot down again he spread his wings and flew out towards them  down dropped the flowerpot the boys started run exclaimed jonas following them with shouts of laughter run run boys for dear life and away they all went towards the garden gate  the bee however was not following them his only object was to get away he flew in another direction but rollo henry and jonas did not stop to look behind them they kept on running until jonas was well on his way towards the pasture and rollo and henry were safe in the shed and this was the last time that rollo ever attempted to make up a hive of bees     jonass magnet   one evening after tea rollo was seated upon his cricket before the fire reading his mother was upon the sofa also reading and so the room was very still  by and by rollo finished his book it was quite a small storybook and he had been reading it some time and so he had got to the end he laid the book down therefore upon the table and began to consider what he should do next  mother said rollo what shall i do  i dont know said his mother you must contrive some way to amuse yourself for i am busy reading now  rollo sat still looking at the fire a few minutes and then he thought he would go out into the kitchen and see what nathan was about accordingly he went into the kitchen dorothy was at work making some bread for the next day jonas was bringing in wood nathan was sitting upon the floor before the fire very much interested in looking at something which he held in his hand  what have you got nathan said rollo  i am seeing this nail stick on said nathan  stick on said rollo what does the child mean he accordingly came up to nathan and found that he had a smooth flat bar of steel not very regular in its shape in one hand and a nail in the other and he was amusing himself with applying the nail to the bar of steel and seeing it adhere  it is a magnet said rollo what a big magnet where did you get it nathan  jonas gave it to me said nathan  let me try it said rollo and he stooped down by the side of nathan and offered to take away the magnet  but nathan held it off upon one side and said no no i must have it jonas gave it to me  well thanny said rollo i wont take it away only you let me sit here and see you play with it  so rollo sat still and did not molest nathan but only looked on and saw him touch the little nail to the bar and leave it hanging there rollo knew it was a magnet for he had heard of magnets though he had never before had an opportunity of seeing one as nathan found that rollo was not going to take the magnet away from him he soon ceased to appear afraid of him and presently he let rollo have the magnet in his hands rollo said he only wanted to look at it a moment to see what made the nail stick on  he examined the steel bar carefully it was not quite a foot long and was shaped like a common flat ruler only instead of being straight from end to end it was swelled out a little along in the middle on looking at the bar very attentively rollo observed some very fine hairlike lines crossing each other so as to produce the appearance of fine network rollo supposed that this was what caused the magnet to take up the nail he observed that there was one place near the middle of the bar where this network was more distinct and strong than in the other parts of the bar and so he put the nail there expecting that it would be attracted very strongly but he was surprised at observing that it was not attracted there at all he then tried it at different places all along the bar and he found that it was not attracted any where in the middle but only at the two ends  while he was wondering what could be the cause of this he heard the front door open and he knew that his father had come home so he jumped up and ran off into the entry nathan following him to show his father the magnet his father was busy putting away his coat and hat and told the boys to go into the parlor and he would come in in a moment and see it when he came in he sat down before the fire and took the magnet rollo and nathan standing by his side and looking on with eager curiosity  rollos father examined the magnet from end to end very carefully for some time without speaking at length he said  it is an old file  an old file said rollo  yes said his father some of jonass work i suppose  yes sir replied rollo at least it is jonass magnet  there you see the marks continued his father pointing to the network of the old file teeth jonas ground them nearly out  are those the marks of the file teeth said rollo i thought it was the magnetism  no said his father smiling those are the traces of the file teeth undoubtedly you may go and ask jonas how he got his magnet  so away went rollo and nathan in pursuit of jonas they found him in the kitchen just arranging his wood for the morning fires they asked him where he got his magnet and jonas replied as follows  why the other day i went into town with your fathers watch to get a new crystal put in and when i was at the watchmakers i saw a curiousshaped piece of iron hanging up i asked the man what it was he said it was a magnet that he kept to touch needles then he gave me a nail and let me see how the magnet would attract it he told me too that if i had a knife and would rub my knife on the magnet the knife would attract too and so i did rub it and i found that my knife would attract the nail though not very strong then i asked him if any piece of iron would attract after it was rubbed upon the magnet and he said that iron would not but that any piece of steel would he told me that if i would bring a larger piece of steel when i came after the watch he would rub it for me and then i should have a larger magnet i told him i had not any steel but he said any old file would do and that i might grind the sides and edges a little and make it smooth  so when i came home i found some old files in the barn some were threecornered and some were flat i thought the flat would be the best shape and i asked your father if he would give me one of them he said he would and so i ground the ends square and the sides smooth upon the grindstone then when i went after the watch the man rubbed it for me and it makes a very good magnet  then rollo and nathan went back and repeated this story to their father  very well said their father that was a very good way to get a magnet i remember giving jonas the file but i did not know what he wanted it for  i think a magnet is a very curious thing said rollo see how the nail sticks to it  there are a great many other things curious about it said his father besides that  what said rollo  i should want some other apparatus to show you replied his father  and cant you get the other apparatus  i dont know perhaps mother might get it yes ill tell you what we will do i will name some things which mother may prepare and you may get them together upon the table in the kitchen when they have got the kitchen all in order then i will come out and give you all out there a lecture upon magnetism  rollo and nathan were exceedingly pleased with this plan and even rollos mother looked somewhat gratified she said she did not know much about magnetism and she meant to go out into the kitchen herself and hear the lecture  and what things shall we get said rollo  two or three needles replied his father some fine and some coarse some thread a saucer nearly full of water a cork the sandbox off of my table and a sheet of white paper put them all in good order upon the table and set the chairs around it then when all is ready come and tell me  so rollos mother put down her book and went to help rollo collect the articles which his father had said he should require she began to look into her needle book for the needles and thread while rollo went for the sandbox when rollo came back with the sandbox and the sheet of paper in his hand he found nathan with his high chair at the kitchen door trying to get in  what are you doing here nathan said rollo  i want to get my high chair in he replied  the truth was that nathan having learned from the conversation what was going on was eager to secure a good seat for himself and so he was attempting to drag out the high chair which was kept in the parlor for him to sit up to the table in  rollo as he happened to feel rather goodnatured than otherwise just then after putting down his things helped nathan get his chair through the door and placed it up at the kitchen table which stood out in the middle of the floor he then went into a closet and opened a little drawer where he knew corks were kept and brought out one or two selecting the cleanest and softest that he could find when he came back he found nathan pouring out some black sand from the sandbox upon the sheet of paper  now nathan exclaimed rollo running up to him and seizing the sandbox you are a very naughty boy and he attempted to take away the sandbox violently  but nathan though he knew very well that he was doing wrong did not seem fully disposed to admit rollos authority to set him right by violence he resisted and in the struggle the table was pushed away and the water in the saucer spilled over the water ran along under the sheet of paper nathan seeing the mischief that had been done was a little frightened and released his hold rollo then took up the paper which had sand upon the upper side and water dripping off from the under side saying  there nathan now see what you have done  i didnt do it said nathan  you did said rollo  i didnt said nathan  hereupon jonas came up to the table to see what was the matter each of the boys told his story  now we are in pretty trouble said jonas we thought we were going to have a fine lecture instead of that there are two boys to be punished and wet paper to be dried  punished said rollo  yes said jonas nathan for touching the sandbox and you for touching him  why he was pouring out all the sand said rollo and i was only trying to stop him  yes but you know said jonas that you had no right to stop him by violence that always makes the difficulty worse  here rollo began to look pretty sober he knew that he had done what he had very often been forbidden to do  now said jonas we can wait and tell your mother about it when she comes out or we can just settle it all among ourselves  how said rollo with an anxious look  why i can dry the paper and the sand said jonas if you and nathan will only punish the boys  how shall we do it asked rollo looking up with a faint and doubtful smile  i think a pretty good punishment said jonas would be for you and nathan to go and sit in two corners of the room with your faces to the wall until i get the paper and sand dryif you think that would be punishment enough  well said rollohis eye brightening at the idea of winding up so unpleasant a business so easilywell nathan lets go  nathan was ready and so he climbed down from his high chair and as rollo went to one corner of the room he went to the other and they took their places as jonas had directed only nathan could not resist the temptation of looking round now and then to see how jonas got on with the drying of the paper they however bore their selfinflicted punishment very patiently and when jonas had got the paper dried and the table wiped down and every thing replaced as it was before he told them that it was time for them to get up again the punishment was not very severe it is true but then it was probably a pretty efficacious one in respect to its effect in impressing it upon nathans mind that he must not touch things without leave and upon rollos that when nathan is doing wrong he must not set him right by violence  in a short time after this the things were all ready upon the table the chairs were placed around it and rollo went to call his father he found him writing a letter as soon as he reached the end of a sentence he came out and took his place at the table rollos mother sat next to him at the same side of the table and jonas and dorothy in two chairs on the opposite side rollo then was placed at one end of the table and nathan in his high chair at the other  just then however rollos mother observed that the table was wet a little  why rollo said she how came the table wet  why nathan and i did it said he  how said his mother  why we did itehpulling but jonas has settled it all mother  ah jonas has settled it has he very well then we will all now attend to the lecture     magnetism   rollos father looked over the things which had been arranged upon the table for a moment in silence and then took up jonass magnet  this bar is what they call a magnet said he but all the magnetism is in the two ends  it is said rollo and what is the reason of that  you can see that it is so said his father without answering rollos question in this way  so he laid a small nail down upon the table and then touched the middle of the magnet to the nail it was not attracted at all then he moved it along a little towards one end and touched it again still it was not attracted then he moved it along farther and farther but the nail was not attracted until he got to the end of the bar and then the nail hopped up and adhered to it quite strongly  how curious said rollo  his father then repeated the same experiment with the other half of the bar and found the result the same the nail did not appear to be at all attracted until he reached the end and then it was lifted and held by this end just as it was by the other  so that you see said rollos father that the attractive power of the magnet resides in the ends  well father what is the reason  i dont know said his father  dont you know father said rollo i thought you were going to tell us all about it  no said his father i only know a very little about it myself i am going to explain to you some of the factssuch as i happen to know so you must all remember this fact that in the magnet the attractive power is not distributed over the whole mass but resides only in the opposite ends these ends are called poles  yes sir said rollo we will remember  now i can make this apparent in another way said his father then he asked rollos mother to thread a needle and when it was threaded he asked jonas to stand up and hold the thread in such a manner as to let the needle hang over the middle of the table  then when the needle was still he brought up the middle of the magnet very near to the needle but it did not move towards it at all then he drew the magnet along towards himself keeping it at the same distance from the needle and when the end of the bar came opposite to the needle it immediately leaped out of its place and adhered strongly to it  there is another way still continued the lecturer better than either of these  so saying he took off the needle which had adhered to the magnet and drawing out the thread he laid the needle itself carefully away upon a distant corner of the table rollo took it up and was going to place it back with the others but his father told him to put it down again by itself where he had placed it and not to touch any of the things without his direction  i am going to show you another way he added of making it evident that the attractive power of the magnet resides at or near the poles  so saying he opened the sheet of paper and spread it out upon the table then he laid the magnet down upon it  now jonas said he sprinkle some sand upon it from my sandbox carefully and see where the sand will adhere  so jonas took the sandbox and held it over the bar not very high and moved it slowly along from one end to the other and thus sanded the magnet all over the sand fell off of it however freely at every part except the ends and jonas observing that it seemed to adhere there held the sandbox a little longer over those places and thus there was formed a sort of a black bur at the extremities consisting of an accumulation of the black particles of sand rollos father then took up the bar carefully and passed it around so that all who were seated at the table could examine it closely  it is thickest on all the edges and corners said rollo  yes said his mother and the sand forms little black bristles pointing off in every direction  they all examined it attentively and observed the little black bristles pointing out every way from the edges and corners at the ends  this shows you said rollos father exactly how the magnetic power so far as its attractive force on other bodies is concerned is distributed you see it resides in the two ends and the two ends seem to be exactly alike  yes sir said rollo exactly  they seem to be so continued his father but the fact is the magnetism of one end is very different from that of the other  i see that the cluster of sand is a little bigger at one end than it is at the other said rollos mother she was more observing than the others and had noticed a little difference which had escaped the rest  that indicates only a difference in degree said rollos father but there is a difference in kind  what do you mean by that father asked rollo  why if the attractive powers at the two ends were both alike in their nature only one was stronger than the other then the difference would be in degree but there is a difference in the nature of the magnetism itself in fact the magnetisms of the two ends are of opposite natures in some respects  why both ends attract the sand said rollo just alike  true said his father they seem to attract the sand in precisely the same way and looking at the bar as i now hold it up he added with the sand adhering in the same way at the two ends one would suppose that they were both magnetic alike but in fact there is a great difference between them  all the company looked upon the two ends of the bar as rollos father held it up wondering how he would show that there was any difference between them  now in the first place he continued we must get the sand off of the ends do you think you can get it off for me rollo said he  rollo took the bar very eagerly and attempted to brush the sand back upon the paper he succeeded in brushing off a little of it but the greater portion remained when he rubbed upon one side it moved round to the other and he could not get it off  hand it to me said his father and i will show you how it can be done  he also asked jonas to hand him the tongs which were standing by the side of the fire he then held the tongs over the sheet of paper in a horizontal position and gently rapped the end of the magnet against them letting the end project a little over the tongs this knocked all the sand off and left the bar clean as it was before  now let me see said he what was it that i was going to tell you next  you were going to show us said rollos mother that there are two different kinds of magnetisms in the two ends of the bar  o yes said he in order to do this i must poise a needle in a new way  he then took up one of the corks which rollo had put upon the table from one end of this cork he cut off with his penknife a round flat piece it was about as large around as a wafer but somewhat thicker he cut a little groove along the upper side of this and laid the same needle which he had before used and which he had put away upon the corner of the table into this groove then he put the whole carefully into the saucer of water which he had previously drawn up towards him  there said he we call a cork like that a float because it is intended to float a needle upon now you see the needle being supported by the cork and the cork floating freely in the water the needle is at liberty to move in any way  nathan thought it was a very curious experiment to poise a needle so upon a piece of corkeven without the magnetism and he watched it as it slowly moved about with a face full of interest and curiosity  the needle swung round a little one way and the other and finally came to a state of rest then rollos father held the magnet in his hands in such a manner as to point it towards the needle and then gradually brought it down near the water just by the side of the point of the needle the point immediately began to move slowly towards the bar but rollos father lifted it up suddenly before the needle had time to touch it then he brought the same end of the magnet down upon the other side of the point of the needle and that drew it back again  there said he you all see that the point of the needle is attracted by the bar whichever side i put it  they all said they saw it very plainly  now said he i am going to turn the magnet and bring the other end of it down to the point of the needle and if the magnetism at this end is the same with that in the other the point of the needle will of course be attracted by this end too  certainly said rollos mother  then he brought down the other end of the bar towards the needle this other end was a little bigger than the one which he had tried first because the file had been a little bigger at that end but the needle instead of being drawn towards it as it had been towards the other end began to move slowly away from it  why it is going away said rollo  his father did not answer but immediately raised the bar and put it down upon the other side of the point and then the point began to move away back again being evidently driven away from the large end of the magnet on whichever side it was presented  then rollos father reversed the magnet again that is he brought the smaller end towards the needle as at first the point of the needle was now attracted that is drawn towards the magnet and then when he changed it again and brought the large end to the needle it was always repelled that is driven away again  now you see he said that the small end of the magnet attracts the point of the needle and the large end drives it away that shows that the magnetism in the two ends is of two different kinds  and now he continued there is one thing more which is remarkable about it and i want you to observe it very carefully you see he says that the small end of the magnet attracts the point of the needle but if i try it now upon the other end of the needle where the eye is it will repel that just as the large end of the magnet repels the point  he tried it and the result was just as he had said and he repeated the experiment in a great many ways and they always found that the large end of the magnet would draw the eye of the needle towards it and drive the point away and the small end of the magnet would draw the point of the needle and drive the eye away this proved as rollos father said some great difference between the magnetisms of the two ends and you see he added that it is a difference in kind not merely a difference in degree  but one thing seems strange to me said rollos mother and that is that both ends of the magnet dont attract the point of the needle just as both of them attracted the nail  and the sand said rollo  yes added his mother when you brought both ends of the magnet one after the other to the nail they both attracted it  and so they did the needle which hung down by the thread said jonas  yes said rollos mother but now this needle that is floating upon the water is half attracted and half repelled  the reason is said rollos father that the needle that is floating upon the water is a magnet itself and has two magnetic poles but the sand and the nail and the needle that jonas held up by the thread were not magnets they were only common pieces of iron and steel  why father said rollo that was the very same needle you laid it away upon the corner of the table  yes said his father but it was not a magnet then  when asked rollo  why when jonas held it up by the thread  and is it a magnet now  yes said his father we will see if it is not  so he took the needle off from the float and put it upon the paper he then sprinkled a little sand over it from the sandbox and upon taking it up they all saw that there was a little tuft of black sand both upon the point and at the eye showing that it was magnetic at both ends  it became magnetic said rollos father only by being touched by the bar magnet and that was the reason why i put it away by itself as soon as it had touched the bar i did not want to have it mixed with the other needles which had not been touched and which of course were not magnetic now if i take one of the needles which has not been touched and put it upon the float you will see that both ends of it will be attracted by both ends of the bar  so he placed away the magnetized needle upon the corner of the table again and took another one and placed it very carefully upon the float then he brought down one end of jonass magnet very near the point of the needle it attracted it then he brought it down very near the eye of the needle it attracted the eye too then he turned the magnet and tried the other end and he found that that end also would attract both the eye and the point of the needle  try the magnetized needle and see if that will attract it too said rollos mother  then rollos father took the magnetized needle from the corner again and brought the two ends of that one after another near to the ends of the needle upon the float it attracted them just as jonass magnet had done only a great deal more feebly  so you see that this needle is really a little magnet just like jonass great one  only there is no proof that it has the two different kinds of magnetism in the two ends said rollos mother  we can easily show that said his father he asked dorothy to get another saucer full of water while he prepared another float then he put the magnetized needle upon the new float leaving the unmagnetized one upon the old float they both looked almost precisely alike each upon its own little disc of cork in its saucer of water  there said he you cannot see any difference between them but there is a great deal of difference between them for one is only a common needle of steel but the other has its two extremities magnetic in opposite ways  to prove this rollos father brought one end of the bar to the point of the magnetized needle and the point was repelled he brought it then to the eye of the same needle and it attracted it then he brought the same end of the bar first to the point and then to the eye of the unmagnetic needle and it attracted them both so it was evident that there was a considerable difference in reality between the condition of the two though there was no difference in external appearance  now you see from all this added rollos father that when a magnet touches a piece of steel like a needle it immediately makes it a magnet itself that is it makes the two ends magnetic one having one kind of magnetism and the other the other kind and then if you take two magnets and bring those two poles which have the same magnetism together they repel one another and if you bring those together which have different magnetisms they attract each other  how do you know that they are the same magnetisms that repel and different that attract said rollos mother  i will show you said his father  then he took the needles that he had used off from their floats and laid them away he took next two new needles exactly of a size and he held them together between his thumb and finger with the eyes projecting together then he rubbed them once or twice upon the end of jonass magnet saying  there you see i use both of these needles alike of course the eyes have both the same magnetisms now you will find that when i put one of them upon the float and then bring the eyes together they will repel each other but an eye and a point will attract so two points will repel  but you have not magnetized the points said rollos mother  yes said his father when we magnetize one end the other end becomes magnetized itself in the contrary way  so he put one of the needles upon the float and then brought the eye of the other down very near to its eye it was repelled as he had said it would be he then brought the two points together and they were repelled but if he brought an eye towards a point or a point towards an eye they were attracted  this is the end of my lecture said he for tonight  o father said rollo a little more  no more tonight only to recapitulate said he  recapitulate what is that  why tell you briefly the substance of what i have explained so that you may remember it  well father said rollo  in the first place a magnet has a peculiar and mysterious attractive power for iron residing in its two extremities which are called its poles and the power which resides in one extremity is in some way or other opposite in its nature to that of the other extremity each of these poles repels a pole like itself and attracts one different from itself in any other magnet  poor nathan could not understand this grave philosophical disquisition very well and he began to get pretty sleepy he had however been somewhat amused during the greater part of the time in seeing the corks float about upon the water with the needles upon them so his father took the needles off and let him have the two floats in one of the saucers to play with a few minutes while dorothy put the other things away he asked her to put all the things away together so that they could get them ready the next evening and then he said that perhaps he would give them another lecture     intellectual philosophy   rollos father gave one or two other lectures upon magnetism in the course of which rollo found out a good deal about the subject and having learned from his fathers explanations that any magnet when balanced freely would point to the north and south that is one end to the north and the other to the south he determined to try the experiment he accordingly poised a needle carefully upon a cork as his father had done in his lecture and put it in a basin of water upon the platform but he did not succeed very well the needle would always swing round and turn its point towards the garden gate but rollo knew very well that the garden gate was not north from the platform he remembered that the north star was over the barn for he and jonas had noticed it particularly when they had made the dial the needle therefore ought to have pointed towards the barn according to his fathers lecture but it would not rollo took up a straw and pushed the point of the needle round and said point there point there i tell you but all in vain the needle would not heed either his pushing or his commands but as soon as he let it go it would immediately swing back into its old position where it pointed towards the garden gate  rollo was just about giving up in despair when he saw his sister mary coming in from the garden gate with a book under her arm  o mary said he what shall i do my needle wont point right  why what is the matter with it said mary  it will point over towards the garden said rollo look  so mary came up and looked at his needle she saw that it was pointing towards the garden gate  now ill push it away said rollo and you will see that it comes directly back again  so he took up his straw and pushed the point of the needle away the cork moved turning round rapidly until at length it swung away towards one side of the basin and then suddenly drifted up against the side and stuck there  thats another plague said rollo it will run up to the side of the basin and stick there  what makes it said mary  i dont know said rollo  mary sat down upon the platform and examined the needle and the surface of the water very carefully she observed that the water was heaped up a little against the side of the basin all around she asked rollo to observe it  yes said he and the needle and cork run right up that ridge of water  and the bubbles too said mary  mary pointed when she said this to several little bubbles which were adhering closely to the side of the basin in another place  she took up a little straw and pushed away some of the bubbles from the side of the basin and then gently moved them back again until they were pretty near and observed that they would immediately rush up against the side again she did not understand this phenomenon especially as the water was raised a little along the edge by the side of the basin so that the bubbles and the needle actually appeared to rush up hill  after examining this for some time mary moved the cork float with the needle upon it back into the middle of the basin and then left it to itself it slowly moved around until it pointed to the garden gate as it had done before  now what is the reason said rollo that isnt north  mary looked upon it very attentively for a few minutes in silence and then said suddenly  o i see  what said rollo  she did not answer but pointed down to the platform by the side of the basin  rollo looked where she pointed and saw the hammer lying there he had had it to play with a short time before and when he brought the basin of water he had laid it down by his side  what said rollo  the hammer attracts the needle replied mary  the hammer said rollo  yes replied mary dont you know that iron attracts the needle and it will not point to the north if there is any iron near to draw it away  rollo was just going to take the hammer up but mary stopped him saying  wait a moment let me take it away slowly and see the effect  so mary told rollo to watch the needle while she carefully drew the hammer away  rollo did so he and mary both watched the needle it was pointing pretty nearly toward the hammer and when mary gently moved the hammer away the needle released from the influence which the iron exerted upon it slowly moved back towards the direction of the barn that is the direction of a north and south line which is called the meridian  its going back its going back said rollo  mary said nothing but watched it carefully the needle swung beyond the direction of the meridian a little way and then came slowly back again so it continued vibrating from one side to the other though to a less and less distance every time finally it came to a state of rest but it was not then however exactly in the meridian  what makes it swing so back and forth said rollo  i dont know exactly said mary i suppose the force that it moves with carries it a little beyond and then it is drawn back again and that makes the oscillations  oscillations said rollo inquiringly  yes they call this swinging back and forth oscillating and each movement is an oscillation  is that the name of it said rollo  yes said mary when you tie a little stone to a string and hold the upper end of the string still and let the stone swing back and forth it makes oscillations  i mean to try it said rollo  yes said mary and i will help you by and by after i have studied my philosophy lesson  your philosophy lesson asked rollo have you got a philosophy lesson to get  yes said mary in that great book  so rollo took up marys book which she had laid down upon the platform near rollos apparatus he found that the title of it was intellectual philosophy  intellectual philosophy said rollo and what sort of philosophy is intellectual philosophy  it is the philosophy of the mind replied mary it explains to us about the thoughts and feelings of our minds  are there any experiments in intellectual philosophy asked rollo  yes said mary we can try experiments in intellectual philosophy  what experiments said rollo  why there is a question whether we always dream when we are asleep  i do said rollo every night  yes but perhaps not all night long  yes i do said rollo i have good long dreams  but replied mary you may dream several hours in the night so as to remember good long dreams in the morning and yet perhaps you might have been for some time perfectly sound asleep so as not to have any dreams in your mind at all some persons think we dream all the time when we are asleep and others think we dont dream all the time now we might contrive some experiments to decide the question  how said rollo  why you and i might agree to wake each other up several times from a sound sleep and then if we were dreaming at that time we should probably remember it  well said rollo let us try it  that would be an experiment in intellectual philosophy said mary  rollo determined to try the experiment and then he took marys book and asked her where her lesson was that day she found the place and rollo read a little he could not understand it very well and so he concluded that he would rather have mary go and study her lesson and then come down and help him make the experiments of oscillation  mary accordingly took her book and went in and left rollo at his play     oscillations   in about an hour mary came down into the yard in pursuit of rollo in order to try the experiments which she had proposed  when rollo saw her coming he left his play and ran to meet her  well mary said he have you come to make the oscillations  yes said mary i have brought some thread for strings and i want you to get some pebble stonessome large and some small ones  rollo went for the pebble stones while mary looked about for a suitable place for making the experiments in a corner of the yard there was a bench under a tree and the branches came down pretty low mary thought that this would be a good place for she could tie her strings to these branches with the pebbles hanging down below and she and rollo could watch the oscillations while seated upon the bench  mary took her station here and rollo presently appeared with the crown of his cap half filled with pebble stones mary said they would do finely she poured them out upon the bench by her side and rollo put his cap upon his head again  now rollo said she we will study the art of experimenting  no said rollo we are going to study oscillation  yes replied mary the experiments are to be on oscillations but what i want principally to teach you is the proper way to make experiments  well said rollo  mary said no more but she proceeded to tie a small pebble to the end of one of the long threads which she had brought out with her then she tied the other end of the thread to the branch of the tree which was over her head the pebble then hung down before them so that both rollo and herself could plainly see all its motions  the first thing said mary is to get a clear idea of the nature of the oscillation for we must know what we are experimenting about  so saying mary carefully took hold of the suspended pebble stone and began to draw it off towards one side she showed rollo that as it was confined by its string above it must move in a curved line when she drew it away from its place rising higher and higher the farther it was drawn away and when she had drawn it out to a considerable distance to one side it was at a much higher level than when it hung down freely in its natural position  now said mary you see that if i let it go it will descend of course as much as it can for the earth draws it downwards  the earth draws it said rollo  yes said mary the reason why things fall is that they are attracted or drawn down by the earth now the earth draws the pebble it would go straight towards it if it could but the string confines it and so it can only go down in the same way that it came up that is by the curved line  mary then held one of her hands open at the place where the pebble had hung when it had been at liberty and let go the pebble which she had been holding with the other it fell down in the curved line or arc as mary had said it would until it struck her hand and there it stopped and remained at rest  what did you stop it for said rollo  so that we could see and attend to one part of the phenomenon at a time said mary that is the descent of the pebble you see the attraction of the earth causes the pebble to go down if it can and the confinement of the string prevents its going down in any other way than in that curve or arc for the string keeps it always just its own length from the branch and so that makes the curved line the arc of a circle  yes said rollo i understand  then mary drew up the pebble once or twice more and let rollo see it fall against her hand rollo observed that it was a very regular arc  now we see continued mary that i hold my hand so as to stop the pebble stone at the lowest point to which it can go for i hold it exactly under the point where the upper end of the string is fastened to the tree now i will take my hand away and then let the pebble fall and we will see what takes place  so mary took her hand away and let the pebble fall freely it descended as before through the arc and then by the force which it acquired in moving so far it was propelled beyond the lowest point and ascended in another curve upon the other side similar to the first when the force was expended it came back again and thus it swung to and fro several times and at length came almost to a state of rest  there said mary those are the oscillations we are going to experiment upon  yes said rollo  and first said mary we notice that they are regular  so she swung the pebble again and as it moved to and fro she counted the oscillations aloud beating time with her hand down and up thus  onetwothreefour c rollo perceived that they were very regular  now first we will endeavor to ascertain by our experiments said mary what the time of the vibrations depends upon  well said rollo  you see continued mary it swings back and forth with a certain degree of rapidity now we want to know what this rapidity depends upon and then we could make a pendulum so that it would oscillate faster or slower just as we pleased  a pendulum asked rollo  yes said mary we call it a pendulum any heavy body hung in this manner so as to swing back and forth by its weight is called a pendulum so that we are experimenting upon the oscillations of a pendulum  yes said rollo i understand  now the question which we are going to examine said mary is what the rapidity of the vibrations depends upon  o it depends upon the bigness of the pebble said rollo  how do you know said mary  why of course a bigger pebble will be heavier and will fall quicker and that will make it vibrate faster  that is reasoning about it said mary and what we want to do now is to experiment now in order to decide it by experiment we must try two pendulums one with a small pebble and the other with a large one  very well said rollo we will and then we shall see that the big one will vibrate the quickest  let us think first what other circumstances there are that it may depend upon  i cant think of any thing else said rollo  why there is the nature of the body which we suspend a piece of cork may oscillate differently from a piece of stone  yes said rollo it will oscillate slower  we must not decide said mary in our own minds before we try the experiment we must leave our minds free to observe the facts and wait until we make the experiment before we come to any conclusion or else we shall not be good experimenters  why not said rollo  because said mary when persons make up their minds beforehand what the facts will be they are very apt not to observe fairly so good observers or experimenters always take care to keep their minds free and unbiassed  well said rollo and what else is there that the oscillations may depend upon  the length of the string replied mary  o yes said rollo it may depend upon that  let us see continued mary there are three experiments we have already proposed a large and a small pebble a pebble and a cork a long and a short string and now there is one morea long and short arc  how said rollo  why if i draw up the weight which forms the pendulum pretty high it will swing back and forth through a long arc but if i move it only a little way it will swing through only a short arc and that may make a difference in the length of the vibrations  well said rollo and now let us try  first let us see whether we have got all the apparatus we want here are strings and pebblesonly we want a cork  ill go and get one said rollo  so rollo went off towards the house to get the cork in a few minutes he came back saying  i have got the cork now how shall we begin  first replied mary we will try what effect the weight of the pebble will have upon the oscillations  very well said rollo  now in order to test that added mary we must take two pebble stones of different sizes and hang them together by strings of the same kind and of the same length and then we must set them agoing exactly together and then watch the oscillations you see that as they will be alike in every respect excepting the size of the pebble stones whatever difference there is in the mode of vibration will probably be caused by the difference in the size of the stones  is that the way they do it said rollo  yes replied mary whenever we want to know what effect any one circumstance produces in such a case we always arrange two experiments making them very different in respect to the circumstance which we wish to examine and as nearly alike as possible in all other respects  i think that is a very good way said rollo  yes replied mary i think it is an excellent way  while mary was thus explaining her plan to rollo she was going on steadily with preparations rollo standing all the time by her side looking on with great interest mary selected two pebbles one was as big as a walnut and the other about as big as an egg she tied two of her threads to these stones one to each and then tied the other ends of these threads to a small branch of the tree which extended horizontally over their heads they hung down about two feet she took care so to adjust the strings as to have the centres of the stones as nearly as possible on a level  the big one is twice as large and so it will go twice as fast said rollo  we shall see said mary  she then drew them both carefully out a little way on one side and holding them there steadily a moment she let them go they immediately began to swing back and forth together  after a few oscillations however the large stone began to gain a little upon the other and seemed to be moving faster presently it had gained half an oscillation i e when the large one was moving forward the small one would be coming back  the big one moves the fastest said rollo  not much said mary  no said rollo not much  and i dont think it is owing to the difference in the bigness of the stones  what else can it be said rollo they are exactly alike in all other respects  not exactly said mary we have made them as nearly alike as we could but not exactly there may be a good many little differences that we do not observe but if the size of the stone would cause any difference in the vibrations i should think it would make a much greater difference for one is twice as big as the other  let us try a very big stone said rollo  well said mary  so rollo got a stone as large as an orange which was as heavy a one as mary thought the thread would hold and mary suspended that from the branch of the tree and then swung it in company with the two others they all went very nearly together at first though there was evidently a slight difference which in a short time separated the oscillations so that the stones did not keep together while yet they each swung back and forth in nearly the same time rollo and mary both concluded from the result of this experiment that the size of the vibrating body did not perceptibly affect the rapidity of the vibrations  now said mary we will try different lengths of string  so she began to look over rollos pebbles to find two as nearly as possible alike  the pebble stones must be of the same size this time for we want the two pendulums to be alike in all respects except the length of the string for that is the circumstance which we are now going to consider we will have one string twice as long as the other  mary found two pebbles very nearly equal in size and similar in shape she tied them to two strings making one string twice as long as the other she suspended them as before and then taking hold of one with one hand and the other with the other she drew them out to the same distance on one side and let them go the short one began at once to swing back and forth very quick while the other followed quite slowly  that makes a difference said rollo clapping his hands  it goes twice as fast said mary  more than twice as fast said rollo i think  let us see said mary  they set them vibrating again but they did not succeed in ascertaining whether the short one went more or less than twice as fast as the other the two motions so rapid and so near together confused them at length mary proposed that rollo should count the vibrations of the long pendulum while she counted those of the short one and when she had got up to twenty she said they would both stop and then rollo could tell how many he had got in the same time but this plan though apparently a very simple one they found it somewhat difficult to put into practice marys pendulum puzzled rollos counting and rollo who could not count very well without at least whispering the numbers puzzled mary and so pretty soon they gave it up  rollo then said that he meant to try a very short pendulum indeed and he asked mary to tie one up for him not more than an inch in length she however said that it would not be necessary to tie it to the branch but instead of that she took hold of the string of one of the pebbles which was already hanging before them about an inch above the pebble itself and then set the pebble in motion and they were both very much interested in observing how quick it vibrated to and fro  rollo then wanted to try a very long one and proposed that he should climb up into the tree and tie the end of the string to a high branch but mary was afraid that he would fall and besides she said that the pendulum would not swing clear of the branches below she however immediately thought of the chamber window and said that she would try it there she accordingly went up into her chamber taking a large pebble stone with her and rollo remained below to set the pendulum in motion when it should be ready mary soon appeared at the window and rollo watched her while she tied her pebble to the end of a thread  have you got your thread long enough said rollo it will take a good long thread to reach away down here  it is a whole spool of cotton said mary and so saying she held up in her hand the spool to the thread of which she was tying her pebble stone  when it was secured she slowly let it down until it reached rollos hand which was held up from below ready to receive it mary then held the thread steady above at a little distance out from the window while rollo took the stone along the side of the house three or four feet from the place where it would naturally hang he then let it go and it swung back very slowly  o how slow said rollo  yes said mary it is very slow indeed  i wish you had gone up to the garret window said rollo  o this will do very well said mary  rollo determined to see how many he could count while the stone made one oscillation to and fro he counted sixteen  mary then said she was tired of experimenting and so she should not come down again she however asked rollo to set the pendulum swinging and that then she would draw the thread in and he could see that it would go faster and faster the farther she drew it up for that would make the string grow shorter and shorter  rollo did so and this was the end of the experiments on oscillations
