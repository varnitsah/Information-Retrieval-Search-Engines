22808881	the europeans  by henry james      chapter i  a narrow graveyard in the heart of a bustling indifferent city seen from the windows of a gloomylooking inn is at no time an object of enlivening suggestion and the spectacle is not at its best when the mouldy tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual refreshment of a dull moist snowfall if while the air is thickened by this frosty drizzle the calendar should happen to indicate that the blessed vernal season is already six weeks old it will be admitted that no depressing influence is absent from the scene this fact was keenly felt on a certain 12th of may upwards of thirty years since by a lady who stood looking out of one of the windows of the best hotel in the ancient city of boston she had stood there for half an hourstood there that is at intervals for from time to time she turned back into the room and measured its length with a restless step in the chimneyplace was a redhot fire which emitted a small blue flame and in front of the fire at a table sat a young man who was busily plying a pencil he had a number of sheets of paper cut into small equal squares and he was apparently covering them with pictorial designsstrangelooking figures he worked rapidly and attentively sometimes threw back his head and held out his drawing at armslength and kept up a soft gaysounding humming and whistling the lady brushed past him in her walk her muchtrimmed skirts were voluminous she never dropped her eyes upon his work she only turned them occasionally as she passed to a mirror suspended above the toilettable on the other side of the room here she paused a moment gave a pinch to her waist with her two hands or raised these membersthey were very plump and prettyto the multifold braids of her hair with a movement half caressing half corrective an attentive observer might have fancied that during these periods of desultory selfinspection her face forgot its melancholy but as soon as she neared the window again it began to proclaim that she was a very illpleased woman and indeed in what met her eyes there was little to be pleased with the windowpanes were battered by the sleet the headstones in the graveyard beneath seemed to be holding themselves askance to keep it out of their faces a tall iron railing protected them from the street and on the other side of the railing an assemblage of bostonians were trampling about in the liquid snow many of them were looking up and down they appeared to be waiting for something from time to time a strange vehicle drew near to the place where they stoodsuch a vehicle as the lady at the window in spite of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions had never seen before a huge low omnibus painted in brilliant colors and decorated apparently with jangling bells attached to a species of groove in the pavement through which it was dragged with a great deal of rumbling bouncing and scratching by a couple of remarkably small horses when it reached a certain point the people in front of the graveyard of whom much the greater number were women carrying satchels and parcels projected themselves upon it in a compact bodya movement suggesting the scramble for places in a lifeboat at seaand were engulfed in its large interior then the lifeboator the lifecar as the lady at the window of the hotel vaguely designated itwent bumping and jingling away upon its invisible wheels with the helmsman the man at the wheel guiding its course incongruously from the prow this phenomenon was repeated every three minutes and the supply of eagerlymoving women in cloaks bearing reticules and bundles renewed itself in the most liberal manner on the other side of the graveyard was a row of small red brick houses showing a series of homely domesticlooking backs at the end opposite the hotel a tall wooden churchspire painted white rose high into the vagueness of the snowflakes the lady at the window looked at it for some time for reasons of her own she thought it the ugliest thing she had ever seen she hated it she despised it it threw her into a state of irritation that was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive she had never known herself to care so much about churchspires  she was not pretty but even when it expressed perplexed irritation her face was most interesting and agreeable neither was she in her first youth yet though slender with a great deal of extremely wellfashioned roundness of contoura suggestion both of maturity and flexibilityshe carried her three and thirty years as a lightwristed hebe might have carried a brimming winecup her complexion was fatigued as the french say her mouth was large her lips too full her teeth uneven her chin rather commonly modeled she had a thick nose and when she smiledshe was constantly smilingthe lines beside it rose too high toward her eyes but these eyes were charming gray in color brilliant quickly glancing gently resting full of intelligence her forehead was very lowit was her only handsome feature and she had a great abundance of crisp dark hair finely frizzled which was always braided in a manner that suggested some southern or eastern some remotely foreign woman she had a large collection of earrings and wore them in alternation and they seemed to give a point to her oriental or exotic aspect a compliment had once been paid her which being repeated to her gave her greater pleasure than anything she had ever heard a pretty woman some one had said why her features are very bad i dont know about her features a very discerning observer had answered but she carries her head like a pretty woman you may imagine whether after this she carried her head less becomingly  she turned away from the window at last pressing her hands to her eyes it s too horrible she exclaimed i shall go backi shall go back and she flung herself into a chair before the fire  wait a little dear child said the young man softly sketching away at his little scraps of paper  the lady put out her foot it was very small and there was an immense rosette on her slipper she fixed her eyes for a while on this ornament and then she looked at the glowing bed of anthracite coal in the grate did you ever see anything so hideous as that fire she demanded did you ever see anything soso affreux asas everything she spoke english with perfect purity but she brought out this french epithet in a manner that indicated that she was accustomed to using french epithets  i think the fire is very pretty said the young man glancing at it a moment those little blue tongues dancing on top of the crimson embers are extremely picturesque they are like a fire in an alchemists laboratory  you are too goodnatured my dear his companion declared  the young man held out one of his drawings with his head on one side his tongue was gently moving along his underlip goodnaturedyes too goodnaturedno  you are irritating said the lady looking at her slipper  he began to retouch his sketch i think you mean simply that you are irritated  ah for that yes said his companion with a little bitter laugh it s the darkest day of my lifeand you know what that means  wait till tomorrow rejoined the young man  yes we have made a great mistake if there is any doubt about it today there certainly will be none tomorrow ce sera clair au moins  the young man was silent a few moments driving his pencil then at last there are no such things as mistakes he affirmed  very truefor those who are not clever enough to perceive them not to recognize ones mistakesthat would be happiness in life the lady went on still looking at her pretty foot  my dearest sister said the young man always intent upon his drawing it s the first time you have told me i am not clever  well by your own theory i cant call it a mistake answered his sister pertinently enough  the young man gave a clear fresh laugh you at least are clever enough dearest sister he said  i was not so when i proposed this  was it you who proposed it asked her brother  she turned her head and gave him a little stare do you desire the credit of it  if you like i will take the blame he said looking up with a smile  yes she rejoined in a moment you make no difference in these things you have no sense of property  the young man gave his joyous laugh again if that means i have no property you are right  dont joke about your poverty said his sister that is quite as vulgar as to boast about it  my poverty i have just finished a drawing that will bring me fifty francs  voyons said the lady putting out her hand  he added a touch or two and then gave her his sketch she looked at it but she went on with her idea of a moment before if a woman were to ask you to marry her you would say certainly my dear with pleasure and you would marry her and be ridiculously happy then at the end of three months you would say to her you know that blissful day when i begged you to be mine  the young man had risen from the table stretching his arms a little he walked to the window that is a description of a charming nature he said  oh yes you have a charming nature i regard that as our capital if i had not been convinced of that i should never have taken the risk of bringing you to this dreadful country  this comical country this delightful country exclaimed the young man and he broke into the most animated laughter  is it those women scrambling into the omnibus asked his companion what do you suppose is the attraction  i suppose there is a very goodlooking man inside said the young man  in each of them they come along in hundreds and the men in this country dont seem at all handsome as for the womeni have never seen so many at once since i left the convent  the women are very pretty her brother declared and the whole affair is very amusing i must make a sketch of it and he came back to the table quickly and picked up his utensilsa small sketchingboard a sheet of paper and three or four crayons he took his place at the window with these things and stood there glancing out plying his pencil with an air of easy skill while he worked he wore a brilliant smile brilliant is indeed the word at this moment for his stronglylighted face he was eight and twenty years old he had a short slight wellmade figure though he bore a noticeable resemblance to his sister he was a better favored person fairhaired clearfaced wittylooking with a delicate finish of feature and an expression at once urbane and not at all serious a warm blue eye an eyebrow finely drawn and excessively archedan eyebrow which if ladies wrote sonnets to those of their lovers might have been made the subject of such a piece of verseand a light moustache that flourished upwards as if blown that way by the breath of a constant smile there was something in his physiognomy at once benevolent and picturesque but as i have hinted it was not at all serious the young mans face was in this respect singular it was not at all serious and yet it inspired the liveliest confidence  be sure you put in plenty of snow said his sister bonte divine what a climate  i shall leave the sketch all white and i shall put in the little figures in black the young man answered laughing and i shall call itwhat is that line in keatsmidmays eldest child  i dont remember said the lady that mamma ever told me it was like this  mamma never told you anything disagreeable and it s not like thisevery day you will see that tomorrow we shall have a splendid day  quen savezvous tomorrow i shall go away  where shall you go  anywhere away from here back to silberstadt i shall write to the reigning prince  the young man turned a little and looked at her with his crayon poised my dear eugenia he murmured were you so happy at sea  eugenia got up she still held in her hand the drawing her brother had given her it was a bold expressive sketch of a group of miserable people on the deck of a steamer clinging together and clutching at each other while the vessel lurched downward at a terrific angle into the hollow of a wave it was extremely clever and full of a sort of tragicomical power eugenia dropped her eyes upon it and made a sad grimace how can you draw such odious scenes she asked i should like to throw it into the fire and she tossed the paper away her brother watched quietly to see where it went it fluttered down to the floor where he let it lie she came toward the window pinching in her waist why dont you reproach meabuse me she asked i think i should feel better then why dont you tell me that you hate me for bringing you here  because you would not believe it i adore you dear sister i am delighted to be here and i am charmed with the prospect  i dont know what had taken possession of me i had lost my head eugenia went on  the young man on his side went on plying his pencil it is evidently a most curious and interesting country here we are and i mean to enjoy it  his companion turned away with an impatient step but presently came back high spirits are doubtless an excellent thing she said but you give one too much of them and i cant see that they have done you any good  the young man stared with lifted eyebrows smiling he tapped his handsome nose with his pencil they have made me happy  that was the least they could do they have made you nothing else you have gone through life thanking fortune for such very small favors that she has never put herself to any trouble for you  she must have put herself to a little i think to present me with so admirable a sister  be serious felix you forget that i am your elder  with a sister then so elderly rejoined felix laughing i hoped we had left seriousness in europe  i fancy you will find it here remember that you are nearly thirty years old and that you are nothing but an obscure bohemiana penniless correspondent of an illustrated newspaper  obscure as much as you please but not so much of a bohemian as you think and not at all penniless i have a hundred pounds in my pocket i have an engagement to make fifty sketches and i mean to paint the portraits of all our cousins and of all their cousins at a hundred dollars a head  you are not ambitious said eugenia  you are dear baroness the young man replied  the baroness was silent a moment looking out at the sleetdarkened graveyard and the bumping horsecars yes i am ambitious she said at last and my ambition has brought me to this dreadful place she glanced about herthe room had a certain vulgar nudity the bed and the window were curtainlessand she gave a little passionate sigh poor old ambition she exclaimed then she flung herself down upon a sofa which stood near against the wall and covered her face with her hands  her brother went on with his drawing rapidly and skillfully after some moments he sat down beside her and showed her his sketch now dont you think that s pretty good for an obscure bohemian he asked i have knocked off another fifty francs  eugenia glanced at the little picture as he laid it on her lap yes it is very clever she said and in a moment she added do you suppose our cousins do that  do what  get into those things and look like that  felix meditated awhile i really cant say it will be interesting to discover  oh the rich people cant said the baroness  are you very sure they are rich asked felix lightly  his sister slowly turned in her place looking at him heavenly powers she murmured you have a way of bringing out things  it will certainly be much pleasanter if they are rich felix declared  do you suppose if i had not known they were rich i would ever have come  the young man met his sisters somewhat peremptory eye with his bright contented glance yes it certainly will be pleasanter he repeated  that is all i expect of them said the baroness i dont count upon their being clever or friendlyat firstor elegant or interesting but i assure you i insist upon their being rich  felix leaned his head upon the back of the sofa and looked awhile at the oblong patch of sky to which the window served as frame the snow was ceasing it seemed to him that the sky had begun to brighten i count upon their being rich he said at last and powerful and clever and friendly and elegant and interesting and generally delightful tu vas voir and he bent forward and kissed his sister look there he went on as a portent even while i speak the sky is turning the color of gold the day is going to be splendid  and indeed within five minutes the weather had changed the sun broke out through the snowclouds and jumped into the baronesss room bonte divine exclaimed this lady what a climate  we will go out and see the world said felix  and after a while they went out the air had grown warm as well as brilliant the sunshine had dried the pavements they walked about the streets at hazard looking at the people and the houses the shops and the vehicles the blazing blue sky and the muddy crossings the hurrying men and the slowstrolling maidens the fresh red bricks and the bright green trees the extraordinary mixture of smartness and shabbiness from one hour to another the day had grown vernal even in the bustling streets there was an odor of earth and blossom felix was immensely entertained he had called it a comical country and he went about laughing at everything he saw you would have said that american civilization expressed itself to his sense in a tissue of capital jokes the jokes were certainly excellent and the young mans merriment was joyous and genial he possessed what is called the pictorial sense and this first glimpse of democratic manners stirred the same sort of attention that he would have given to the movements of a lively young person with a bright complexion such attention would have been demonstrative and complimentary and in the present case felix might have passed for an undispirited young exile revisiting the haunts of his childhood he kept looking at the violent blue of the sky at the scintillating air at the scattered and multiplied patches of color  comme cest bariole eh he said to his sister in that foreign tongue which they both appeared to feel a mysterious prompting occasionally to use  yes it is bariole indeed the baroness answered i dont like the coloring it hurts my eyes  it shows how extremes meet the young man rejoined instead of coming to the west we seem to have gone to the east the way the sky touches the housetops is just like cairo and the red and blue signboards patched over the face of everything remind one of mahometan decorations  the young women are not mahometan said his companion they cant be said to hide their faces i never saw anything so bold  thank heaven they dont hide their faces cried felix their faces are uncommonly pretty  yes their faces are often very pretty said the baroness who was a very clever woman she was too clever a woman not to be capable of a great deal of just and fine observation she clung more closely than usual to her brothers arm she was not exhilarated as he was she said very little but she noted a great many things and made her reflections she was a little excited she felt that she had indeed come to a strange country to make her fortune superficially she was conscious of a good deal of irritation and displeasure the baroness was a very delicate and fastidious person of old more than once she had gone for entertainments sake and in brilliant company to a fair in a provincial town it seemed to her now that she was at an enormous fairthat the entertainment and the disagreements were very much the same she found herself alternately smiling and shrinking the show was very curious but it was probable from moment to moment that one would be jostled the baroness had never seen so many people walking about before she had never been so mixed up with people she did not know but little by little she felt that this fair was a more serious undertaking she went with her brother into a large public garden which seemed very pretty but where she was surprised at seeing no carriages the afternoon was drawing to a close the coarse vivid grass and the slender treeboles were gilded by the level sunbeamsgilded as with gold that was fresh from the mine it was the hour at which ladies should come out for an airing and roll past a hedge of pedestrians holding their parasols askance here however eugenia observed no indications of this custom the absence of which was more anomalous as there was a charming avenue of remarkably graceful arching elms in the most convenient contiguity to a large cheerful street in which evidently among the more prosperous members of the bourgeoisie a great deal of pedestrianism went forward our friends passed out into this well lighted promenade and felix noticed a great many more pretty girls and called his sisters attention to them this latter measure however was superfluous for the baroness had inspected narrowly these charming young ladies  i feel an intimate conviction that our cousins are like that said felix  the baroness hoped so but this is not what she said they are very pretty she said but they are mere little girls where are the womenthe women of thirty  of thirtythree do you mean her brother was going to ask for he understood often both what she said and what she did not say but he only exclaimed upon the beauty of the sunset while the baroness who had come to seek her fortune reflected that it would certainly be well for her if the persons against whom she might need to measure herself should all be mere little girls the sunset was superb they stopped to look at it felix declared that he had never seen such a gorgeous mixture of colors the baroness also thought it splendid and she was perhaps the more easily pleased from the fact that while she stood there she was conscious of much admiring observation on the part of various nicelooking people who passed that way and to whom a distinguished strikinglydressed woman with a foreign air exclaiming upon the beauties of nature on a boston street corner in the french tongue could not be an object of indifference eugenias spirits rose she surrendered herself to a certain tranquil gayety if she had come to seek her fortune it seemed to her that her fortune would be easy to find there was a promise of it in the gorgeous purity of the western sky there was an intimation in the mild unimpertinent gaze of the passers of a certain natural facility in things  you will not go back to silberstadt eh asked felix  not tomorrow said the baroness  nor write to the reigning prince  i shall write to him that they evidently know nothing about him over here  he will not believe you said the young man i advise you to let him alone  felix himself continued to be in high good humor brought up among ancient customs and in picturesque cities he yet found plenty of local color in the little puritan metropolis that evening after dinner he told his sister that he should go forth early on the morrow to look up their cousins  you are very impatient said eugenia  what can be more natural he asked after seeing all those pretty girls today if ones cousins are of that pattern the sooner one knows them the better  perhaps they are not said eugenia we ought to have brought some lettersto some other people  the other people would not be our kinsfolk  possibly they would be none the worse for that the baroness replied  her brother looked at her with his eyebrows lifted that was not what you said when you first proposed to me that we should come out here and fraternize with our relatives you said that it was the prompting of natural affection and when i suggested some reasons against it you declared that the voix du sang should go before everything  you remember all that asked the baroness  vividly i was greatly moved by it  she was walking up and down the room as she had done in the morning she stopped in her walk and looked at her brother she apparently was going to say something but she checked herself and resumed her walk then in a few moments she said something different which had the effect of an explanation of the suppression of her earlier thought you will never be anything but a child dear brother  one would suppose that you madam answered felix laughing were a thousand years old  i amsometimes said the baroness  i will go then and announce to our cousins the arrival of a personage so extraordinary they will immediately come and pay you their respects  eugenia paced the length of the room again and then she stopped before her brother laying her hand upon his arm they are not to come and see me she said you are not to allow that that is not the way i shall meet them first and in answer to his interrogative glance she went on you will go and examine and report you will come back and tell me who they are and what they are their number gender their respective agesall about them be sure you observe everything be ready to describe to me the locality the accessorieshow shall i say itthe mise en scene then at my own time at my own hour under circumstances of my own choosing i will go to them i will present myselfi will appear before them said the baroness this time phrasing her idea with a certain frankness  and what message am i to take to them asked felix who had a lively faith in the justness of his sisters arrangements  she looked at him a momentat his expression of agreeable veracity and with that justness that he admired she replied say what you please tell my story in the way that seems to you mostnatural and she bent her forehead for him to kiss        chapter ii  the next day was splendid as felix had prophesied if the winter had suddenly leaped into spring the spring had for the moment as quickly leaped into summer this was an observation made by a young girl who came out of a large square house in the country and strolled about in the spacious garden which separated it from a muddy road the flowering shrubs and the neatlydisposed plants were basking in the abundant light and warmth the transparent shade of the great elmsthey were magnificent treesseemed to thicken by the hour and the intensely habitual stillness offered a submissive medium to the sound of a distant churchbell the young girl listened to the churchbell but she was not dressed for church she was bareheaded she wore a white muslin waist with an embroidered border and the skirt of her dress was of colored muslin she was a young lady of some two or three and twenty years of age and though a young person of her sex walking bareheaded in a garden of a sunday morning in springtime can in the nature of things never be a displeasing object you would not have pronounced this innocent sabbathbreaker especially pretty she was tall and pale thin and a little awkward her hair was fair and perfectly straight her eyes were dark and they had the singularity of seeming at once dull and restlessdiffering herein as you see fatally from the ideal fine eyes which we always imagine to be both brilliant and tranquil the doors and windows of the large square house were all wide open to admit the purifying sunshine which lay in generous patches upon the floor of a wide high covered piazza adjusted to two sides of the mansiona piazza on which several strawbottomed rockingchairs and half a dozen of those small cylindrical stools in green and blue porcelain which suggest an affiliation between the residents and the eastern trade were symmetrically disposed it was an ancient houseancient in the sense of being eighty years old it was built of wood painted a clean clear faded gray and adorned along the front at intervals with flat wooden pilasters painted white these pilasters appeared to support a kind of classic pediment which was decorated in the middle by a large triple window in a boldly carved frame and in each of its smaller angles by a glazed circular aperture a large white door furnished with a highlypolished brass knocker presented itself to the rurallooking road with which it was connected by a spacious pathway paved with worn and cracked but very clean bricks behind it there were meadows and orchards a barn and a pond and facing it a short distance along the road on the opposite side stood a smaller house painted white with external shutters painted green a little garden on one hand and an orchard on the other all this was shining in the morning air through which the simple details of the picture addressed themselves to the eye as distinctly as the items of a sum in addition  a second young lady presently came out of the house across the piazza descended into the garden and approached the young girl of whom i have spoken this second young lady was also thin and pale but she was older than the other she was shorter she had dark smooth hair her eyes unlike the others were quick and bright but they were not at all restless she wore a straw bonnet with white ribbons and a long red india scarf which on the front of her dress reached to her feet in her hand she carried a little key  gertrude she said are you very sure you had better not go to church  gertrude looked at her a moment plucked a small sprig from a lilacbush smelled it and threw it away i am not very sure of anything she answered  the other young lady looked straight past her at the distant pond which lay shining between the long banks of firtrees then she said in a very soft voice this is the key of the diningroom closet i think you had better have it if any one should want anything  who is there to want anything gertrude demanded i shall be all alone in the house  some one may come said her companion  do you mean mr brand  yes gertrude he may like a piece of cake  i dont like men that are always eating cake gertrude declared giving a pull at the lilacbush  her companion glanced at her and then looked down on the ground i think father expected you would come to church she said what shall i say to him  say i have a bad headache  would that be true asked the elder lady looking straight at the pond again  no charlotte said the younger one simply  charlotte transferred her quiet eyes to her companions face i am afraid you are feeling restless  i am feeling as i always feel gertrude replied in the same tone  charlotte turned away but she stood there a moment presently she looked down at the front of her dress does nt it seem to you somehow as if my scarf were too long she asked  gertrude walked half round her looking at the scarf i dont think you wear it right she said  how should i wear it dear  i dont know differently from that you should draw it differently over your shoulders round your elbows you should look differently behind  how should i look charlotte inquired  i dont think i can tell you said gertrude plucking out the scarf a little behind i could do it myself but i dont think i can explain it  charlotte by a movement of her elbows corrected the laxity that had come from her companions touch well some day you must do it for me it does nt matter now indeed i dont think it matters she added how one looks behind  i should say it mattered more said gertrude then you dont know who may be observing you you are not on your guard you cant try to look pretty  charlotte received this declaration with extreme gravity i dont think one should ever try to look pretty she rejoined earnestly  her companion was silent then she said well perhaps it s not of much use  charlotte looked at her a little and then kissed her i hope you will be better when we come back  my dear sister i am very well said gertrude  charlotte went down the large brick walk to the garden gate her companion strolled slowly toward the house at the gate charlotte met a young man who was coming ina tall fair young man wearing a high hat and a pair of thread gloves he was handsome but rather too stout he had a pleasant smile oh mr brand exclaimed the young lady  i came to see whether your sister was not going to church said the young man  she says she is not going but i am very glad you have come i think if you were to talk to her a little and charlotte lowered her voice it seems as if she were restless  mr brand smiled down on the young lady from his great height i shall be very glad to talk to her for that i should be willing to absent myself from almost any occasion of worship however attractive  well i suppose you know said charlotte softly as if positive acceptance of this proposition might be dangerous but i am afraid i shall be late  i hope you will have a pleasant sermon said the young man  oh mr gilman is always pleasant charlotte answered and she went on her way  mr brand went into the garden where gertrude hearing the gate close behind him turned and looked at him for a moment she watched him coming then she turned away but almost immediately she corrected this movement and stood still facing him he took off his hat and wiped his forehead as he approached then he put on his hat again and held out his hand his hat being removed you would have perceived that his forehead was very large and smooth and his hair abundant but rather colorless his nose was too large and his mouth and eyes were too small but for all this he was as i have said a young man of striking appearance the expression of his little cleancolored blue eyes was irresistibly gentle and serious he looked as the phrase is as good as gold the young girl standing in the garden path glanced as he came up at his thread gloves  i hoped you were going to church he said i wanted to walk with you  i am very much obliged to you gertrude answered i am not going to church  she had shaken hands with him he held her hand a moment have you any special reason for not going  yes mr brand said the young girl  may i ask what it is  she looked at him smiling and in her smile as i have intimated there was a certain dullness but mingled with this dullness was something sweet and suggestive because the sky is so blue she said  he looked at the sky which was magnificent and then said smiling too i have heard of young ladies staying at home for bad weather but never for good your sister whom i met at the gate tells me you are depressed he added  depressed i am never depressed  oh surely sometimes replied mr brand as if he thought this a regrettable account of ones self  i am never depressed gertrude repeated but i am sometimes wicked when i am wicked i am in high spirits i was wicked just now to my sister  what did you do to her  i said things that puzzled heron purpose  why did you do that miss gertrude asked the young man  she began to smile again because the sky is so blue  you say things that puzzle me mr brand declared  i always know when i do it proceeded gertrude but people puzzle me more i think and they dont seem to know  this is very interesting mr brand observed smiling  you told me to tell you about mymy struggles the young girl went on  let us talk about them i have so many things to say  gertrude turned away a moment and then turning back you had better go to church she said  you know the young man urged that i have always one thing to say  gertrude looked at him a moment please dont say it now  we are all alone he continued taking off his hat all alone in this beautiful sunday stillness  gertrude looked around her at the breaking buds the shining distance the blue sky to which she had referred as a pretext for her irregularities that s the reason she said why i dont want you to speak do me a favor go to church  may i speak when i come back asked mr brand  if you are still disposed she answered  i dont know whether you are wicked he said but you are certainly puzzling  she had turned away she raised her hands to her ears he looked at her a moment and then he slowly walked to church  she wandered for a while about the garden vaguely and without purpose the churchbell had stopped ringing the stillness was complete this young lady relished highly on occasions the sense of being alonethe absence of the whole family and the emptiness of the house today apparently the servants had also gone to church there was never a figure at the open windows behind the house there was no stout negress in a red turban lowering the bucket into the great shinglehooded well and the front door of the big unguarded home stood open with the trustfulness of the golden age or what is more to the purpose with that of new englands silvery prime gertrude slowly passed through it and went from one of the empty rooms to the otherlarge clearcolored rooms with white wainscots ornamented with thinlegged mahogany furniture and on the walls with oldfashioned engravings chiefly of scriptural subjects hung very high this agreeable sense of solitude of having the house to herself of which i have spoken always excited gertrudes imagination she could not have told you why and neither can her humble historian it always seemed to her that she must do something particularthat she must honor the occasion and while she roamed about wondering what she could do the occasion usually came to an end today she wondered more than ever at last she took down a book there was no library in the house but there were books in all the rooms none of them were forbidden books and gertrude had not stopped at home for the sake of a chance to climb to the inaccessible shelves she possessed herself of a very obvious volumeone of the series of the arabian nightsand she brought it out into the portico and sat down with it in her lap there for a quarter of an hour she read the history of the loves of the prince camaralzaman and the princess badoura at last looking up she beheld as it seemed to her the prince camaralzaman standing before her a beautiful young man was making her a very low bowa magnificent bow such as she had never seen before he appeared to have dropped from the clouds he was wonderfully handsome he smiledsmiled as if he were smiling on purpose extreme surprise for a moment kept gertrude sitting still then she rose without even keeping her finger in her book the young man with his hat in his hand still looked at her smiling and smiling it was very strange  will you kindly tell me said the mysterious visitor at last whether i have the honor of speaking to miss wentworth  my name is gertrude wentworth murmured the young woman  thentheni have the honorthe pleasureof being your cousin  the young man had so much the character of an apparition that this announcement seemed to complete his unreality what cousin who are you said gertrude  he stepped back a few paces and looked up at the house then glanced round him at the garden and the distant view after this he burst out laughing i see it must seem to you very strange he said there was after all something substantial in his laughter gertrude looked at him from head to foot yes he was remarkably handsome but his smile was almost a grimace it is very still he went on coming nearer again and as she only looked at him for reply he added are you all alone  every one has gone to church said gertrude  i was afraid of that the young man exclaimed but i hope you are not afraid of me  you ought to tell me who you are gertrude answered  i am afraid of you said the young man i had a different plan i expected the servant would take in my card and that you would put your heads together before admitting me and make out my identity  gertrude had been wondering with a quick intensity which brought its result and the result seemed an answera wondrous delightful answerto her vague wish that something would befall her i knowi know she said you come from europe  we came two days ago you have heard of us thenyou believe in us  we have known vaguely said gertrude that we had relations in france  and have you ever wanted to see us asked the young man  gertrude was silent a moment i have wanted to see you  i am glad then it is you i have found we wanted to see you so we came  on purpose asked gertrude  the young man looked round him smiling still well yes on purpose does that sound as if we should bore you he added i dont think we shalli really dont think we shall we are rather fond of wandering too and we were glad of a pretext  and you have just arrived  in boston two days ago at the inn i asked for mr wentworth he must be your father they found out for me where he lived they seemed often to have heard of him i determined to come without ceremony so this lovely morning they set my face in the right direction and told me to walk straight before me out of town i came on foot because i wanted to see the country i walked and walked and here i am it s a good many miles  it is seven miles and a half said gertrude softly now that this handsome young man was proving himself a reality she found herself vaguely trembling she was deeply excited she had never in her life spoken to a foreigner and she had often thought it would be delightful to do so here was one who had suddenly been engendered by the sabbath stillness for her private use and such a brilliant polite smiling one she found time and means to compose herself however to remind herself that she must exercise a sort of official hospitality we are veryvery glad to see you she said wont you come into the house and she moved toward the open door  you are not afraid of me then asked the young man again with his light laugh  she wondered a moment and then we are not afraidhere she said  ah comme vous devez avoir raison cried the young man looking all round him appreciatively it was the first time that gertrude had heard so many words of french spoken they gave her something of a sensation her companion followed her watching with a certain excitement of his own this tall interestinglooking girl dressed in her clear crisp muslin he paused in the hall where there was a broad white staircase with a white balustrade what a pleasant house he said it s lighter inside than it is out  it s pleasanter here said gertrude and she led the way into the parlora high clean rather emptylooking room here they stood looking at each otherthe young man smiling more than ever gertrude very serious trying to smile  i dont believe you know my name he said i am called felix young your father is my uncle my mother was his half sister and older than he  yes said gertrude and she turned roman catholic and married in europe  i see you know said the young man she married and she died your fathers family did nt like her husband they called him a foreigner but he was not my poor father was born in sicily but his parents were american  in sicily gertrude murmured  it is true said felix young that they had spent their lives in europe but they were very patriotic and so are we  and you are sicilian said gertrude  sicilian no let s see i was born at a little placea dear little placein france my sister was born at vienna  so you are french said gertrude  heaven forbid cried the young man gertrudes eyes were fixed upon him almost insistently he began to laugh again i can easily be french if that will please you  you are a foreigner of some sort said gertrude  of some sortyes i suppose so but who can say of what sort i dont think we have ever had occasion to settle the question you know there are people like that about their country their religion their profession they cant tell  gertrude stood there gazing she had not asked him to sit down she had never heard of people like that she wanted to hear where do you live she asked  they cant tell that either said felix i am afraid you will think they are little better than vagabonds i have lived anywhereeverywhere i really think i have lived in every city in europe gertrude gave a little long soft exhalation it made the young man smile at her again and his smile made her blush a little to take refuge from blushing she asked him if after his long walk he was not hungry or thirsty her hand was in her pocket she was fumbling with the little key that her sister had given her ah my dear young lady he said clasping his hands a little if you could give me in charity a glass of wine  gertrude gave a smile and a little nod and went quickly out of the room presently she came back with a very large decanter in one hand and a plate in the other on which was placed a big round cake with a frosted top gertrude in taking the cake from the closet had had a moment of acute consciousness that it composed the refection of which her sister had thought that mr brand would like to partake her kinsman from across the seas was looking at the pale highhung engravings when she came in he turned and smiled at her as if they had been old friends meeting after a separation you wait upon me yourself he asked i am served like the gods she had waited upon a great many people but none of them had ever told her that the observation added a certain lightness to the step with which she went to a little table where there were some curious red glassesglasses covered with little gold sprigs which charlotte used to dust every morning with her own hands gertrude thought the glasses very handsome and it was a pleasure to her to know that the wine was good it was her fathers famous madeira felix young thought it excellent he wondered why he had been told that there was no wine in america she cut him an immense triangle out of the cake and again she thought of mr brand felix sat there with his glass in one hand and his huge morsel of cake in the othereating drinking smiling talking i am very hungry he said i am not at all tired i am never tired but i am very hungry  you must stay to dinner said gertrude at two oclock they will all have come back from church you will see the others  who are the others asked the young man describe them all  you will see for yourself it is you that must tell me now about your sister  my sister is the baroness munster said felix  on hearing that his sister was a baroness gertrude got up and walked about slowly in front of him she was silent a moment she was thinking of it why did nt she come too she asked  she did come she is in boston at the hotel  we will go and see her said gertrude looking at him  she begs you will not the young man replied she sends you her love she sent me to announce her she will come and pay her respects to your father  gertrude felt herself trembling again a baroness munster who sent a brilliant young man to announce her who was coming as the queen of sheba came to solomon to pay her respects to quiet mr wentworthsuch a personage presented herself to gertrudes vision with a most effective unexpectedness for a moment she hardly knew what to say when will she come she asked at last  as soon as you will allow hertomorrow she is very impatient answered felix who wished to be agreeable  tomorrow yes said gertrude she wished to ask more about her but she hardly knew what could be predicated of a baroness munster is sheis shemarried  felix had finished his cake and wine he got up fixing upon the young girl his bright expressive eyes she is married to a german princeprince adolf of silberstadtschreckenstein he is not the reigning prince he is a younger brother  gertrude gazed at her informant her lips were slightly parted is she aa princess she asked at last  oh no said the young man her position is rather a singular one it s a morganatic marriage  morganatic these were new names and new words to poor gertrude  that s what they call a marriage you know contracted between a scion of a ruling house andand a common mortal they made eugenia a baroness poor woman but that was all they could do now they want to dissolve the marriage prince adolf between ourselves is a ninny but his brother who is a clever man has plans for him eugenia naturally enough makes difficulties not however that i think she cares muchshe s a very clever woman i m sure you ll like herbut she wants to bother them just now everything is en lair  the cheerful offhand tone in which her visitor related this darkly romantic tale seemed to gertrude very strange but it seemed also to convey a certain flattery to herself a recognition of her wisdom and dignity she felt a dozen impressions stirring within her and presently the one that was uppermost found words they want to dissolve her marriage she asked  so it appears  and against her will  against her right  she must be very unhappy said gertrude  her visitor looked at her smiling he raised his hand to the back of his head and held it there a moment so she says he answered that s her story she told me to tell it you  tell me more said gertrude  no i will leave that to her she does it better  gertrude gave her little excited sigh again well if she is unhappy she said i am glad she has come to us  she had been so interested that she failed to notice the sound of a footstep in the portico and yet it was a footstep that she always recognized she heard it in the hall and then she looked out of the window they were all coming back from churchher father her sister and brother and their cousins who always came to dinner on sunday mr brand had come in first he was in advance of the others because apparently he was still disposed to say what she had not wished him to say an hour before he came into the parlor looking for gertrude he had two little books in his hand on seeing gertrudes companion he slowly stopped looking at him  is this a cousin asked felix  then gertrude saw that she must introduce him but her ears and by sympathy her lips were full of all that he had been telling her this is the prince she said the prince of silberstadtschreckenstein  felix burst out laughing and mr brand stood staring while the others who had passed into the house appeared behind him in the open doorway       chapter iii  that evening at dinner felix young gave his sister the baroness munster an account of his impressions she saw that he had come back in the highest possible spirits but this fact to her own mind was not a reason for rejoicing she had but a limited confidence in her brothers judgment his capacity for taking rosecolored views was such as to vulgarize one of the prettiest of tints still she supposed he could be trusted to give her the mere facts and she invited him with some eagerness to communicate them i suppose at least they did nt turn you out from the door she said you have been away some ten hours  turn me from the door felix exclaimed they took me to their hearts they killed the fatted calf  i know what you want to say they are a collection of angels  exactly said felix they are a collection of angelssimply  cest bien vague remarked the baroness what are they like  like nothing you ever saw  i am sure i am much obliged but that is hardly more definite seriously they were glad to see you  enchanted it has been the proudest day of my life never never have i been so lionized i assure you i was cock of the walk my dear sister said the young man nous navons qua nous tenir we shall be great swells  madame munster looked at him and her eye exhibited a slight responsive spark she touched her lips to a glass of wine and then she said describe them give me a picture  felix drained his own glass well it s in the country among the meadows and woods a wild sort of place and yet not far from here only such a road my dear imagine one of the alpine glaciers reproduced in mud but you will not spend much time on it for they want you to come and stay once for all  ah said the baroness they want me to come and stay once for all bon  it s intensely rural tremendously natural and all overhung with this strange white light this faraway blue sky there s a big wooden housea kind of threestory bungalow it looks like a magnified nuremberg toy there was a gentleman there that made a speech to me about it and called it a venerable mansion but it looks as if it had been built last night  is it handsomeis it elegant asked the baroness  felix looked at her a moment smiling it s very clean no splendors no gilding no troops of servants rather straightbacked chairs but you might eat off the floors and you can sit down on the stairs  that must be a privilege and the inhabitants are straightbacked too of course  my dear sister said felix the inhabitants are charming  in what style  in a style of their own how shall i describe it it s primitive it s patriarchal it s the ton of the golden age  and have they nothing golden but their ton are there no symptoms of wealth  i should say there was wealth without symptoms a plain homely way of life nothing for show and very little forwhat shall i call itfor the senses but a great faisance and a lot of money out of sight that comes forward very quietly for subscriptions to institutions for repairing tenements for paying doctors bills perhaps even for portioning daughters  and the daughters madame munster demanded how many are there  there are two charlotte and gertrude  are they pretty  one of them said felix  which is that  the young man was silent looking at his sister charlotte he said at last  she looked at him in return i see you are in love with gertrude they must be puritans to their fingertips anything but gay  no they are not gay felix admitted they are sober they are even severe they are of a pensive cast they take things hard i think there is something the matter with them they have some melancholy memory or some depressing expectation it s not the epicurean temperament my uncle mr wentworth is a tremendously hightoned old fellow he looks as if he were undergoing martyrdom not by fire but by freezing but we shall cheer them up we shall do them good they will take a good deal of stirring up but they are wonderfully kind and gentle and they are appreciative they think one clever they think one remarkable  that is very fine so far as it goes said the baroness but are we to be shut up to these three people mr wentworth and the two young womenwhat did you say their names weredeborah and hephzibah  oh no there is another little girl a cousin of theirs a very pretty creature a thorough little american and then there is the son of the house  good said the baroness we are coming to the gentlemen what of the son of the house  i am afraid he gets tipsy  he then has the epicurean temperament how old is he  he is a boy of twenty a pretty young fellow but i am afraid he has vulgar tastes and then there is mr branda very tall young man a sort of laypriest they seem to think a good deal of him but i dont exactly make him out  and is there nothing asked the baroness between these extremesthis mysterious ecclesiastic and that intemperate youth  oh yes there is mr acton i think said the young man with a nod at his sister that you will like mr acton  remember that i am very fastidious said the baroness has he very good manners  he will have them with you he is a man of the world he has been to china  madame munster gave a little laugh a man of the chinese world he must be very interesting  i have an idea that he brought home a fortune said felix  that is always interesting is he young goodlooking clever  he is less than forty he has a baldish head he says witty things i rather think added the young man that he will admire the baroness munster  it is very possible said this lady her brother never knew how she would take things but shortly afterwards she declared that he had made a very pretty description and that on the morrow she would go and see for herself  they mounted accordingly into a great barouchea vehicle as to which the baroness found nothing to criticise but the price that was asked for it and the fact that the coachman wore a straw hat at silberstadt madame munster had had liveries of yellow and crimson they drove into the country and the baroness leaning far back and swaying her lacefringed parasol looked to right and to left and surveyed the wayside objects after a while she pronounced them affreux her brother remarked that it was apparently a country in which the foreground was inferior to the plans recules and the baroness rejoined that the landscape seemed to be all foreground felix had fixed with his new friends the hour at which he should bring his sister it was four oclock in the afternoon the large cleanfaced house wore to his eyes as the barouche drove up to it a very friendly aspect the high slender elms made lengthening shadows in front of it the baroness descended her american kinsfolk were stationed in the portico felix waved his hat to them and a tall lean gentleman with a high forehead and a clean shaven face came forward toward the garden gate charlotte wentworth walked at his side gertrude came behind more slowly both of these young ladies wore rustling silk dresses felix ushered his sister into the gate be very gracious he said to her but he saw the admonition was superfluous eugenia was prepared to be gracious as only eugenia could be felix knew no keener pleasure than to be able to admire his sister unrestrictedly for if the opportunity was frequent it was not inveterate when she desired to please she was to him as to every one else the most charming woman in the world then he forgot that she was ever anything else that she was sometimes hard and perverse that he was occasionally afraid of her now as she took his arm to pass into the garden he felt that she desired that she proposed to please and this situation made him very happy eugenia would please  the tall gentleman came to meet her looking very rigid and grave but it was a rigidity that had no illiberal meaning mr wentworths manner was pregnant on the contrary with a sense of grand responsibility of the solemnity of the occasion of its being difficult to show sufficient deference to a lady at once so distinguished and so unhappy felix had observed on the day before his characteristic pallor and now he perceived that there was something almost cadaverous in his uncles highfeatured white face but so clever were this young mans quick sympathies and perceptions that he already learned that in these semimortuary manifestations there was no cause for alarm his light imagination had gained a glimpse of mr wentworths spiritual mechanism and taught him that the old man being infinitely conscientious the special operation of conscience within him announced itself by several of the indications of physical faintness  the baroness took her uncles hand and stood looking at him with her ugly face and her beautiful smile have i done right to come she asked  very right very right said mr wentworth solemnly he had arranged in his mind a little speech but now it quite faded away he felt almost frightened he had never been looked at in just that waywith just that fixed intense smileby any woman and it perplexed and weighed upon him now that the woman who was smiling so and who had instantly given him a vivid sense of her possessing other unprecedented attributes was his own niece the child of his own fathers daughter the idea that his niece should be a german baroness married morganatically to a prince had already given him much to think about was it right was it just was it acceptable he always slept badly and the night before he had lain awake much more even than usual asking himself these questions the strange word morganatic was constantly in his ears it reminded him of a certain mrs morgan whom he had once known and who had been a bold unpleasant woman he had a feeling that it was his duty so long as the baroness looked at him smiling in that way to meet her glance with his own scrupulously adjusted consciously frigid organs of vision but on this occasion he failed to perform his duty to the last he looked away toward his daughters we are very glad to see you he had said allow me to introduce my daughtersmiss charlotte wentworth miss gertrude wentworth  the baroness thought she had never seen people less demonstrative but charlotte kissed her and took her hand looking at her sweetly and solemnly gertrude seemed to her almost funereal though gertrude might have found a source of gayety in the fact that felix with his magnificent smile had been talking to her he had greeted her as a very old friend when she kissed the baroness she had tears in her eyes madame munster took each of these young women by the hand and looked at them all over charlotte thought her very strangelooking and singularly dressed she could not have said whether it was well or ill she was glad at any rate that they had put on their silk gownsespecially gertrude my cousins are very pretty said the baroness turning her eyes from one to the other your daughters are very handsome sir  charlotte blushed quickly she had never yet heard her personal appearance alluded to in a loud expressive voice gertrude looked awaynot at felix she was extremely pleased it was not the compliment that pleased her she did not believe it she thought herself very plain she could hardly have told you the source of her satisfaction it came from something in the way the baroness spoke and it was not diminishedit was rather deepened oddly enoughby the young girls disbelief mr wentworth was silent and then he asked formally wont you come into the house  these are not all you have some other children said the baroness  i have a son mr wentworth answered  and why does nt he come to meet me eugenia cried i am afraid he is not so charming as his sisters  i dont know i will see about it the old man declared  he is rather afraid of ladies charlotte said softly  he is very handsome said gertrude as loud as she could  we will go in and find him we will draw him out of his cachette and the baroness took mr wentworths arm who was not aware that he had offered it to her and who as they walked toward the house wondered whether he ought to have offered it and whether it was proper for her to take it if it had not been offered i want to know you well said the baroness interrupting these meditations and i want you to know me  it seems natural that we should know each other mr wentworth rejoined we are near relatives  ah there comes a moment in life when one reverts irresistibly to ones natural tiesto ones natural affections you must have found that said eugenia  mr wentworth had been told the day before by felix that eugenia was very clever very brilliant and the information had held him in some suspense this was the cleverness he supposed the brilliancy was beginning yes the natural affections are very strong he murmured  in some people the baroness declared not in all charlotte was walking beside her she took hold of her hand again smiling always and you cousine where did you get that enchanting complexion she went on such lilies and roses the roses in poor charlottes countenance began speedily to predominate over the lilies and she quickened her step and reached the portico this is the country of complexions the baroness continued addressing herself to mr wentworth i am convinced they are more delicate there are very good ones in englandin holland but they are very apt to be coarse there is too much red  i think you will find said mr wentworth that this country is superior in many respects to those you mention i have been to england and holland  ah you have been to europe cried the baroness why did nt you come and see me but it s better after all this way she said they were entering the house she paused and looked round her i see you have arranged your houseyour beautiful housein thein the dutch taste  the house is very old remarked mr wentworth general washington once spent a week here  oh i have heard of washington cried the baroness my father used to tell me of him  mr wentworth was silent a moment and then i found he was very well known in europe he said  felix had lingered in the garden with gertrude he was standing before her and smiling as he had done the day before what had happened the day before seemed to her a kind of dream he had been there and he had changed everything the others had seen him they had talked with him but that he should come again that he should be part of the future part of her small familiar muchmeditating lifethis needed afresh the evidence of her senses the evidence had come to her senses now and her senses seemed to rejoice in it what do you think of eugenia felix asked is nt she charming  she is very brilliant said gertrude but i cant tell yet she seems to me like a singer singing an air you cant tell till the song is done  ah the song will never be done exclaimed the young man laughing dont you think her handsome  gertrude had been disappointed in the beauty of the baroness munster she had expected her for mysterious reasons to resemble a very pretty portrait of the empress josephine of which there hung an engraving in one of the parlors and which the younger miss wentworth had always greatly admired but the baroness was not at all like thatnot at all though different however she was very wonderful and gertrude felt herself most suggestively corrected it was strange nevertheless that felix should speak in that positive way about his sisters beauty i think i shall think her handsome gertrude said it must be very interesting to know her i dont feel as if i ever could  ah you will know her well you will become great friends felix declared as if this were the easiest thing in the world  she is very graceful said gertrude looking after the baroness suspended to her fathers arm it was a pleasure to her to say that any one was graceful  felix had been looking about him and your little cousin of yesterday he said who was so wonderfully prettywhat has become of her  she is in the parlor gertrude answered yes she is very pretty she felt as if it were her duty to take him straight into the house to where he might be near her cousin but after hesitating a moment she lingered still i did nt believe you would come back she said  not come back cried felix laughing you did nt know then the impression made upon this susceptible heart of mine  she wondered whether he meant the impression her cousin lizzie had made well she said i did nt think we should ever see you again  and pray what did you think would become of me  i dont know i thought you would melt away  that s a compliment to my solidity i melt very often said felix but there is always something left of me  i came and waited for you by the door because the others did gertrude went on but if you had never appeared i should not have been surprised  i hope declared felix looking at her that you would have been disappointed  she looked at him a little and shook her head nono  ah par exemple cried the young man you deserve that i should never leave you  going into the parlor they found mr wentworth performing introductions a young man was standing before the baroness blushing a good deal laughing a little and shifting his weight from one foot to the othera slim mildfaced young man with neatlyarranged features like those of mr wentworth two other gentlemen behind him had risen from their seats and a little apart near one of the windows stood a remarkably pretty young girl the young girl was knitting a stocking but while her fingers quickly moved she looked with wide brilliant eyes at the baroness  and what is your sons name said eugenia smiling at the young man  my name is clifford wentworth maam he said in a tremulous voice  why did nt you come out to meet me mr clifford wentworth the baroness demanded with her beautiful smile  i did nt think you would want me said the young man slowly sidling about  one always wants a beau cousinif one has one but if you are very nice to me in future i wont remember it against you and madame m auunster transferred her smile to the other persons present it rested first upon the candid countenance and longskirted figure of mr brand whose eyes were intently fixed upon mr wentworth as if to beg him not to prolong an anomalous situation mr wentworth pronounced his name eugenia gave him a very charming glance and then looked at the other gentleman  this latter personage was a man of rather less than the usual stature and the usual weight with a quick observant agreeable dark eye a small quantity of thin dark hair and a small mustache he had been standing with his hands in his pockets and when eugenia looked at him he took them out but he did not like mr brand look evasively and urgently at their host he met eugenias eyes he appeared to appreciate the privilege of meeting them madame munster instantly felt that he was intrinsically the most important person present she was not unconscious that this impression was in some degree manifested in the little sympathetic nod with which she acknowledged mr wentworths announcement my cousin mr acton  your cousinnot mine said the baroness  it only depends upon you mr acton declared laughing  the baroness looked at him a moment and noticed that he had very white teeth let it depend upon your behavior she said i think i had better wait i have cousins enough unless i can also claim relationship she added with that charming young lady and she pointed to the young girl at the window  that s my sister said mr acton and gertrude wentworth put her arm round the young girl and led her forward it was not apparently that she needed much leading she came toward the baroness with a light quick step and with perfect selfpossession rolling her stocking round its needles she had dark blue eyes and dark brown hair she was wonderfully pretty  eugenia kissed her as she had kissed the other young women and then held her off a little looking at her now this is quite another type she said she pronounced the word in the french manner this is a different outline my uncle a different character from that of your own daughters this felix she went on is very much more what we have always thought of as the american type  the young girl during this exposition was smiling askance at every one in turn and at felix out of turn i find only one type here cried felix laughing the type adorable  this sally was received in perfect silence but felix who learned all things quickly had already learned that the silences frequently observed among his new acquaintances were not necessarily restrictive or resentful it was as one might say the silence of expectation of modesty they were all standing round his sister as if they were expecting her to acquit herself of the exhibition of some peculiar faculty some brilliant talent their attitude seemed to imply that she was a kind of conversational mountebank attired intellectually in gauze and spangles this attitude gave a certain ironical force to madame munsters next words now this is your circle she said to her uncle this is your salon these are your regular habitu aaes eh i am so glad to see you all together  oh said mr wentworth they are always dropping in and out you must do the same  father interposed charlotte wentworth they must do something more and she turned her sweet serious face that seemed at once timid and placid upon their interesting visitor what is your name she asked  eugeniacamilladolores said the baroness smiling but you need nt say all that  i will say eugenia if you will let me you must come and stay with us  the baroness laid her hand upon charlottes arm very tenderly but she reserved herself she was wondering whether it would be possible to stay with these people it would be very charmingvery charming she said and her eyes wandered over the company over the room she wished to gain time before committing herself her glance fell upon young mr brand who stood there with his arms folded and his hand on his chin looking at her the gentleman i suppose is a sort of ecclesiastic she said to mr wentworth lowering her voice a little  he is a minister answered mr wentworth  a protestant asked eugenia  i am a unitarian madam replied mr brand impressively  ah i see said eugenia something new she had never heard of this form of worship  mr acton began to laugh and gertrude looked anxiously at mr brand  you have come very far said mr wentworth  very farvery far the baroness replied with a graceful shake of her heada shake that might have meant many different things  that s a reason why you ought to settle down with us said mr wentworth with that dryness of utterance which as eugenia was too intelligent not to feel took nothing from the delicacy of his meaning  she looked at him and for an instant in his cold still face she seemed to see a faraway likeness to the vaguely remembered image of her mother eugenia was a woman of sudden emotions and now unexpectedly she felt one rising in her heart she kept looking round the circle she knew that there was admiration in all the eyes that were fixed upon her she smiled at them all  i came to lookto tryto ask she said it seems to me i have done well i am very tired i want to rest there were tears in her eyes the luminous interior the gentle tranquil people the simple serious lifethe sense of these things pressed upon her with an overmastering force and she felt herself yielding to one of the most genuine emotions she had ever known i should like to stay here she said pray take me in  though she was smiling there were tears in her voice as well as in her eyes my dear niece said mr wentworth softly and charlotte put out her arms and drew the baroness toward her while robert acton turned away with his hands stealing into his pockets       chapter iv  a few days after the baroness munster had presented herself to her american kinsfolk she came with her brother and took up her abode in that small white house adjacent to mr wentworths own dwelling of which mention has already been made it was on going with his daughters to return her visit that mr wentworth placed this comfortable cottage at her service the offer being the result of a domestic colloquy diffused through the ensuing twentyfour hours in the course of which the two foreign visitors were discussed and analyzed with a great deal of earnestness and subtlety the discussion went forward as i say in the family circle but that circle on the evening following madame m auunsters return to town as on many other occasions included robert acton and his pretty sister if you had been present it would probably not have seemed to you that the advent of these brilliant strangers was treated as an exhilarating occurrence a pleasure the more in this tranquil household a prospective source of entertainment this was not mr wentworths way of treating any human occurrence the sudden irruption into the wellordered consciousness of the wentworths of an element not allowed for in its scheme of usual obligations required a readjustment of that sense of responsibility which constituted its principal furniture to consider an event crudely and baldly in the light of the pleasure it might bring them was an intellectual exercise with which felix youngs american cousins were almost wholly unacquainted and which they scarcely supposed to be largely pursued in any section of human society the arrival of felix and his sister was a satisfaction but it was a singularly joyless and inelastic satisfaction it was an extension of duty of the exercise of the more recondite virtues but neither mr wentworth nor charlotte nor mr brand who among these excellent people was a great promoter of reflection and aspiration frankly adverted to it as an extension of enjoyment this function was ultimately assumed by gertrude wentworth who was a peculiar girl but the full compass of whose peculiarities had not been exhibited before they very ingeniously found their pretext in the presence of these possibly too agreeable foreigners gertrude however had to struggle with a great accumulation of obstructions both of the subjective as the metaphysicians say and of the objective order and indeed it is no small part of the purpose of this little history to set forth her struggle what seemed paramount in this abrupt enlargement of mr wentworths sympathies and those of his daughters was an extension of the field of possible mistakes and the doctrine as it may almost be called of the oppressive gravity of mistakes was one of the most cherished traditions of the wentworth family  i dont believe she wants to come and stay in this house said gertrude madame munster from this time forward receiving no other designation than the personal pronoun charlotte and gertrude acquired considerable facility in addressing her directly as eugenia but in speaking of her to each other they rarely called her anything but she  does nt she think it good enough for her cried little lizzie acton who was always asking unpractical questions that required in strictness no answer and to which indeed she expected no other answer than such as she herself invariably furnished in a small innocentlysatirical laugh  she certainly expressed a willingness to come said mr wentworth  that was only politeness gertrude rejoined  yes she is very politevery polite said mr wentworth  she is too polite his son declared in a softly growling tone which was habitual to him but which was an indication of nothing worse than a vaguely humorous intention it is very embarrassing  that is more than can be said of you sir said lizzie acton with her little laugh  well i dont mean to encourage her clifford went on  i m sure i dont care if you do cried lizzie  she will not think of you clifford said gertrude gravely  i hope not clifford exclaimed  she will think of robert gertrude continued in the same tone  robert acton began to blush but there was no occasion for it for every one was looking at gertrudeevery one at least save lizzie who with her pretty head on one side contemplated her brother  why do you attribute motives gertrude asked mr wentworth  i dont attribute motives father said gertrude i only say she will think of robert and she will  gertrude judges by herself acton exclaimed laughing dont you gertrude of course the baroness will think of me she will think of me from morning till night  she will be very comfortable here said charlotte with something of a housewifes pride she can have the large northeast room and the french bedstead charlotte added with a constant sense of the ladys foreignness  she will not like it said gertrude not even if you pin little tidies all over the chairs  why not dear asked charlotte perceiving a touch of irony here but not resenting it  gertrude had left her chair she was walking about the room her stiff silk dress which she had put on in honor of the baroness made a sound upon the carpet i dont know she replied she will want something moremore private  if she wants to be private she can stay in her room lizzie acton remarked  gertrude paused in her walk looking at her that would not be pleasant she answered she wants privacy and pleasure together  robert acton began to laugh again my dear cousin what a picture  charlotte had fixed her serious eyes upon her sister she wondered whence she had suddenly derived these strange notions mr wentworth also observed his younger daughter  i dont know what her manner of life may have been he said but she certainly never can have enjoyed a more refined and salubrious home  gertrude stood there looking at them all she is the wife of a prince she said  we are all princes here said mr wentworth and i dont know of any palace in this neighborhood that is to let  cousin william robert acton interposed do you want to do something handsome make them a present for three months of the little house over the way  you are very generous with other peoples things cried his sister  robert is very generous with his own things mr wentworth observed dispassionately and looking in cold meditation at his kinsman  gertrude lizzie went on i had an idea you were so fond of your new cousin  which new cousin asked gertrude  i dont mean the baroness the young girl rejoined with her laugh i thought you expected to see so much of him  of felix i hope to see a great deal of him said gertrude simply  then why do you want to keep him out of the house  gertrude looked at lizzie acton and then looked away  should you want me to live in the house with you lizzie asked clifford  i hope you never will i hate you such was this young ladys reply  father said gertrude stopping before mr wentworth and smiling with a smile the sweeter as her smile always was for its rarity do let them live in the little house over the way it will be lovely  robert acton had been watching her gertrude is right he said gertrude is the cleverest girl in the world if i might take the liberty i should strongly recommend their living there  there is nothing there so pretty as the northeast room charlotte urged  she will make it pretty leave her alone acton exclaimed  gertrude at his compliment had blushed and looked at him it was as if some one less familiar had complimented her i am sure she will make it pretty it will be very interesting it will be a place to go to it will be a foreign house  are we very sure that we need a foreign house mr wentworth inquired do you think it desirable to establish a foreign housein this quiet place  you speak said acton laughing as if it were a question of the poor baroness opening a wineshop or a gamingtable  it would be too lovely gertrude declared again laying her hand on the back of her fathers chair  that she should open a gamingtable charlotte asked with great gravity  gertrude looked at her a moment and then yes charlotte she said simply  gertrude is growing pert clifford wentworth observed with his humorous young growl that comes of associating with foreigners  mr wentworth looked up at his daughter who was standing beside him he drew her gently forward you must be careful he said you must keep watch indeed we must all be careful this is a great change we are to be exposed to peculiar influences i dont say they are bad i dont judge them in advance but they may perhaps make it necessary that we should exercise a great deal of wisdom and selfcontrol it will be a different tone  gertrude was silent a moment in deference to her fathers speech then she spoke in a manner that was not in the least an answer to it i want to see how they will live i am sure they will have different hours she will do all kinds of little things differently when we go over there it will be like going to europe she will have a boudoir she will invite us to dinnervery late she will breakfast in her room  charlotte gazed at her sister again gertrudes imagination seemed to her to be fairly running riot she had always known that gertrude had a great deal of imaginationshe had been very proud of it but at the same time she had always felt that it was a dangerous and irresponsible faculty and now to her sense for the moment it seemed to threaten to make her sister a strange person who should come in suddenly as from a journey talking of the peculiar and possibly unpleasant things she had observed charlottes imagination took no journeys whatever she kept it as it were in her pocket with the other furniture of this receptaclea thimble a little box of peppermint and a morsel of courtplaster i dont believe she would have any dinneror any breakfast said miss wentworth i dont believe she knows how to do anything herself i should have to get her ever so many servants and she would nt like them  she has a maid said gertrude a french maid she mentioned her  i wonder if the maid has a little fluted cap and red slippers said lizzie acton there was a french maid in that play that robert took me to see she had pink stockings she was very wicked  she was a soubrette gertrude announced who had never seen a play in her life they call that a soubrette it will be a great chance to learn french charlotte gave a little soft helpless groan she had a vision of a wicked theatrical person clad in pink stockings and red shoes and speaking with confounding volubility an incomprehensible tongue flitting through the sacred penetralia of that large clean house that is one reason in favor of their coming here gertrude went on but we can make eugenia speak french to us and felix i mean to beginthe next time  mr wentworth had kept her standing near him and he gave her his earnest thin unresponsive glance again i want you to make me a promise gertrude he said  what is it she asked smiling  not to get excited not to allow thesethese occurrences to be an occasion for excitement  she looked down at him a moment and then she shook her head i dont think i can promise that father i am excited already  mr wentworth was silent a while they all were silent as if in recognition of something audacious and portentous  i think they had better go to the other house said charlotte quietly  i shall keep them in the other house mr wentworth subjoined more pregnantly  gertrude turned away then she looked across at robert acton her cousin robert was a great friend of hers she often looked at him this way instead of saying things her glance on this occasion however struck him as a substitute for a larger volume of diffident utterance than usual inviting him to observe among other things the inefficiency of her fathers designif design it wasfor diminishing in the interest of quiet nerves their occasions of contact with their foreign relatives but acton immediately complimented mr wentworth upon his liberality that s a very nice thing to do he said giving them the little house you will have treated them handsomely and whatever happens you will be glad of it mr wentworth was liberal and he knew he was liberal it gave him pleasure to know it to feel it to see it recorded and this pleasure is the only palpable form of selfindulgence with which the narrator of these incidents will be able to charge him  a three days visit at most over there is all i should have found possible madame munster remarked to her brother after they had taken possession of the little white house it would have been too intimedecidedly too intime breakfast dinner and tea en familleit would have been the end of the world if i could have reached the third day and she made the same observation to her maid augustine an intelligent person who enjoyed a liberal share of her confidence felix declared that he would willingly spend his life in the bosom of the wentworth family that they were the kindest simplest most amiable people in the world and that he had taken a prodigious fancy to them all the baroness quite agreed with him that they were simple and kind they were thoroughly nice people and she liked them extremely the girls were perfect ladies it was impossible to be more of a lady than charlotte wentworth in spite of her little village air but as for thinking them the best company in the world said the baroness that is another thing and as for wishing to live porteaporte with them i should as soon think of wishing myself back in the convent again to wear a bombazine apron and sleep in a dormitory and yet the baroness was in high good humor she had been very much pleased with her lively perception and her refined imagination she was capable of enjoying anything that was characteristic anything that was good of its kind the wentworth household seemed to her very perfect in its kindwonderfully peaceful and unspotted pervaded by a sort of dovecolored freshness that had all the quietude and benevolence of what she deemed to be quakerism and yet seemed to be founded upon a degree of material abundance for which in certain matters of detail one might have looked in vain at the frugal little court of silberstadtschreckenstein she perceived immediately that her american relatives thought and talked very little about money and this of itself made an impression upon eugenias imagination she perceived at the same time that if charlotte or gertrude should ask their father for a very considerable sum he would at once place it in their hands and this made a still greater impression the greatest impression of all perhaps was made by another rapid induction the baroness had an immediate conviction that robert acton would put his hand into his pocket every day in the week if that rattlepated little sister of his should bid him the men in this country said the baroness are evidently very obliging her declaration that she was looking for rest and retirement had been by no means wholly untrue nothing that the baroness said was wholly untrue it is but fair to add perhaps that nothing that she said was wholly true she wrote to a friend in germany that it was a return to nature it was like drinking new milk and she was very fond of new milk she said to herself of course that it would be a little dull but there can be no better proof of her good spirits than the fact that she thought she should not mind its being a little dull it seemed to her when from the piazza of her eleemosynary cottage she looked out over the soundless fields the stony pastures the clearfaced ponds the rugged little orchards that she had never been in the midst of so peculiarly intense a stillness it was almost a delicate sensual pleasure it was all very good very innocent and safe and out of it something good must come augustine indeed who had an unbounded faith in her mistresss wisdom and farsightedness was a great deal perplexed and depressed she was always ready to take her cue when she understood it but she liked to understand it and on this occasion comprehension failed what indeed was the baroness doing dans cette galere what fish did she expect to land out of these very stagnant waters the game was evidently a deep one augustine could trust her but the sense of walking in the dark betrayed itself in the physiognomy of this spare sober sallow middleaged person who had nothing in common with gertrude wentworths conception of a soubrette by the most ironical scowl that had ever rested upon the unpretending tokens of the peace and plenty of the wentworths fortunately augustine could quench skepticism in action she quite agreed with her mistressor rather she quite outstripped her mistressin thinking that the little white house was pitifully bare il faudra said augustine lui faire un peu de toilette and she began to hang up portieres in the doorways to place wax candles procured after some research in unexpected situations to dispose anomalous draperies over the arms of sofas and the backs of chairs the baroness had brought with her to the new world a copious provision of the element of costume and the two miss wentworths when they came over to see her were somewhat bewildered by the obtrusive distribution of her wardrobe there were india shawls suspended curtainwise in the parlor door and curious fabrics corresponding to gertrudes metaphysical vision of an operacloak tumbled about in the sittingplaces there were pink silk blinds in the windows by which the room was strangely bedimmed and along the chimneypiece was disposed a remarkable band of velvet covered with coarse dirtylooking lace i have been making myself a little comfortable said the baroness much to the confusion of charlotte who had been on the point of proposing to come and help her put her superfluous draperies away but what charlotte mistook for an almost culpably delayed subsidence gertrude very presently perceived to be the most ingenious the most interesting the most romantic intention what is life indeed without curtains she secretly asked herself and she appeared to herself to have been leading hitherto an existence singularly garish and totally devoid of festoons  felix was not a young man who troubled himself greatly about anythingleast of all about the conditions of enjoyment his faculty of enjoyment was so large so unconsciously eager that it may be said of it that it had a permanent advance upon embarrassment and sorrow his sentient faculty was intrinsically joyous and novelty and change were in themselves a delight to him as they had come to him with a great deal of frequency his life had been more agreeable than appeared never was a nature more perfectly fortunate it was not a restless apprehensive ambitious spirit running a race with the tyranny of fate but a temper so unsuspicious as to put adversity off her guard dodging and evading her with the easy natural motion of a windshifted flower felix extracted entertainment from all things and all his facultieshis imagination his intelligence his affections his senseshad a hand in the game it seemed to him that eugenia and he had been very well treated there was something absolutely touching in that combination of paternal liberality and social considerateness which marked mr wentworths deportment it was most uncommonly kind of him for instance to have given them a house felix was positively amused at having a house of his own for the little white cottage among the appletreesthe chalet as madame munster always called itwas much more sensibly his own than any domiciliary quatrieme looking upon a court with the rent overdue felix had spent a good deal of his life in looking into courts with a perhaps slightly tattered pair of elbows resting upon the ledge of a highperched window and the thin smoke of a cigarette rising into an atmosphere in which streetcries died away and the vibration of chimes from ancient belfries became sensible he had never known anything so infinitely rural as these new england fields and he took a great fancy to all their pastoral roughnesses he had never had a greater sense of luxurious security and at the risk of making him seem a rather sordid adventurer i must declare that he found an irresistible charm in the fact that he might dine every day at his uncles the charm was irresistible however because his fancy flung a rosy light over this homely privilege he appreciated highly the fare that was set before him there was a kind of freshlooking abundance about it which made him think that people must have lived so in the mythological era when they spread their tables upon the grass replenished them from cornucopias and had no particular need of kitchen stoves but the great thing that felix enjoyed was having found a familysitting in the midst of gentle generous people whom he might call by their first names he had never known anything more charming than the attention they paid to what he said it was like a large sheet of clean finegrained drawingpaper all ready to be washed over with effective splashes of watercolor he had never had any cousins and he had never before found himself in contact so unrestricted with young unmarried ladies he was extremely fond of the society of ladies and it was new to him that it might be enjoyed in just this manner at first he hardly knew what to make of his state of mind it seemed to him that he was in love indiscriminately with three girls at once he saw that lizzie acton was more brilliantly pretty than charlotte and gertrude but this was scarcely a superiority his pleasure came from something they had in commona part of which was indeed that physical delicacy which seemed to make it proper that they should always dress in thin materials and clear colors but they were delicate in other ways and it was most agreeable to him to feel that these latter delicacies were appreciable by contact as it were he had known fortunately many virtuous gentlewomen but it now appeared to him that in his relations with them especially when they were unmarried he had been looking at pictures under glass he perceived at present what a nuisance the glass had beenhow it perverted and interfered how it caught the reflection of other objects and kept you walking from side to side he had no need to ask himself whether charlotte and gertrude and lizzie acton were in the right light they were always in the right light he liked everything about them he was for instance not at all above liking the fact that they had very slender feet and high insteps he liked their pretty noses he liked their surprised eyes and their hesitating not at all positive way of speaking he liked so much knowing that he was perfectly at liberty to be alone for hours anywhere with either of them that preference for one to the other as a companion of solitude remained a minor affair charlotte wentworths sweetly severe features were as agreeable as lizzie actons wonderfully expressive blue eyes and gertrudes air of being always ready to walk about and listen was as charming as anything else especially as she walked very gracefully after a while felix began to distinguish but even then he would often wish suddenly that they were not all so sad even lizzie acton in spite of her fine little chatter and laughter appeared sad even clifford wentworth who had extreme youth in his favor and kept a buggy with enormous wheels and a little sorrel mare with the prettiest legs in the worldeven this fortunate lad was apt to have an averted uncomfortable glance and to edge away from you at times in the manner of a person with a bad conscience the only person in the circle with no sense of oppression of any kind was to felixs perception robert acton  it might perhaps have been feared that after the completion of those graceful domiciliary embellishments which have been mentioned madame m auunster would have found herself confronted with alarming possibilities of ennui but as yet she had not taken the alarm the baroness was a restless soul and she projected her restlessness as it may be said into any situation that lay before her up to a certain point her restlessness might be counted upon to entertain her she was always expecting something to happen and until it was disappointed expectancy itself was a delicate pleasure what the baroness expected just now it would take some ingenuity to set forth it is enough that while she looked about her she found something to occupy her imagination she assured herself that she was enchanted with her new relatives she professed to herself that like her brother she felt it a sacred satisfaction to have found a family it is certain that she enjoyed to the utmost the gentleness of her kinsfolks deference she had first and last received a great deal of admiration and her experience of wellturned compliments was very considerable but she knew that she had never been so real a power never counted for so much as now when for the first time the standard of comparison of her little circle was a prey to vagueness the sense indeed that the good people about her had as regards her remarkable self no standard of comparison at all gave her a feeling of almost illimitable power it was true as she said to herself that if for this reason they would be able to discover nothing against her so they would perhaps neglect to perceive some of her superior points but she always wound up her reflections by declaring that she would take care of that  charlotte and gertrude were in some perplexity between their desire to show all proper attention to madame munster and their fear of being importunate the little house in the orchard had hitherto been occupied during the summer months by intimate friends of the family or by poor relations who found in mr wentworth a landlord attentive to repairs and oblivious of quarterday under these circumstances the open door of the small house and that of the large one facing each other across their homely gardens levied no tax upon hourly visits but the misses wentworth received an impression that eugenia was no friend to the primitive custom of dropping in she evidently had no idea of living without a doorkeeper one goes into your house as into an innexcept that there are no servants rushing forward she said to charlotte and she added that that was very charming gertrude explained to her sister that she meant just the reverse she did nt like it at all charlotte inquired why she should tell an untruth and gertrude answered that there was probably some very good reason for it which they should discover when they knew her better there can surely be no good reason for telling an untruth said charlotte i hope she does not think so  they had of course desired from the first to do everything in the way of helping her to arrange herself it had seemed to charlotte that there would be a great many things to talk about but the baroness was apparently inclined to talk about nothing  write her a note asking her leave to come and see her i think that is what she will like said gertrude  why should i give her the trouble of answering me charlotte asked she will have to write a note and send it over  i dont think she will take any trouble said gertrude profoundly  what then will she do  that is what i am curious to see said gertrude leaving her sister with an impression that her curiosity was morbid  they went to see the baroness without preliminary correspondence and in the little salon which she had already created with its becoming light and its festoons they found robert acton  eugenia was intensely gracious but she accused them of neglecting her cruelly you see mr acton has had to take pity upon me she said my brother goes off sketching for hours i can never depend upon him so i was to send mr acton to beg you to come and give me the benefit of your wisdom  gertrude looked at her sister she wanted to say that is what she would have done charlotte said that they hoped the baroness would always come and dine with them it would give them so much pleasure and in that case she would spare herself the trouble of having a cook  ah but i must have a cook cried the baroness an old negress in a yellow turban i have set my heart upon that i want to look out of my window and see her sitting there on the grass against the background of those crooked dusky little appletrees pulling the husks off a lapful of indian corn that will be local color you know there is nt much of it hereyou dont mind my saying that do youso one must make the most of what one can get i shall be most happy to dine with you whenever you will let me but i want to be able to ask you sometimes and i want to be able to ask mr acton added the baroness  you must come and ask me at home said acton you must come and see me you must dine with me first i want to show you my place i want to introduce you to my mother he called again upon madame m auunster two days later he was constantly at the other house he used to walk across the fields from his own place and he appeared to have fewer scruples than his cousins with regard to dropping in on this occasion he found that mr brand had come to pay his respects to the charming stranger but after actons arrival the young theologian said nothing he sat in his chair with his two hands clasped fixing upon his hostess a grave fascinated stare the baroness talked to robert acton but as she talked she turned and smiled at mr brand who never took his eyes off her the two men walked away together they were going to mr wentworths mr brand still said nothing but after they had passed into mr wentworths garden he stopped and looked back for some time at the little white house then looking at his companion with his head bent a little to one side and his eyes somewhat contracted now i suppose that s what is called conversation he said real conversation  it s what i call a very clever woman said acton laughing  it is most interesting mr brand continued i only wish she would speak french it would seem more in keeping it must be quite the style that we have heard about that we have read aboutthe style of conversation of madame de stael of madame recamier  acton also looked at madame munsters residence among its hollyhocks and appletrees what i should like to know he said smiling is just what has brought madame recamier to live in that place       chapter v  mr wentworth with his cane and his gloves in his hand went every afternoon to call upon his niece a couple of hours later she came over to the great house to tea she had let the proposal that she should regularly dine there fall to the ground she was in the enjoyment of whatever satisfaction was to be derived from the spectacle of an old negress in a crimson turban shelling peas under the appletrees charlotte who had provided the ancient negress thought it must be a strange household eugenia having told her that augustine managed everything the ancient negress includedaugustine who was naturally devoid of all acquaintance with the expurgatory english tongue by far the most immoral sentiment which i shall have occasion to attribute to charlotte wentworth was a certain emotion of disappointment at finding that in spite of these irregular conditions the domestic arrangements at the small house were apparently notfrom eugenias peculiar point of viewstrikingly offensive the baroness found it amusing to go to tea she dressed as if for dinner the teatable offered an anomalous and picturesque repast and on leaving it they all sat and talked in the large piazza or wandered about the garden in the starlight with their ears full of those sounds of strange insects which though they are supposed to be all over the world a part of the magic of summer nights seemed to the baroness to have beneath these western skies an incomparable resonance  mr wentworth though as i say he went punctiliously to call upon her was not able to feel that he was getting used to his niece it taxed his imagination to believe that she was really his halfsisters child his sister was a figure of his early years she had been only twenty when she went abroad never to return making in foreign parts a willful and undesirable marriage his aunt mrs whiteside who had taken her to europe for the benefit of the tour gave on her return so lamentable an account of mr adolphus young to whom the headstrong girl had united her destiny that it operated as a chill upon family feelingespecially in the case of the halfbrothers catherine had done nothing subsequently to propitiate her family she had not even written to them in a way that indicated a lucid appreciation of their suspended sympathy so that it had become a tradition in boston circles that the highest charity as regards this young lady was to think it well to forget her and to abstain from conjecture as to the extent to which her aberrations were reproduced in her descendants over these young peoplea vague report of their existence had come to his earsmr wentworth had not in the course of years allowed his imagination to hover it had plenty of occupation nearer home and though he had many cares upon his conscience the idea that he had been an unnatural uncle was very properly never among the number now that his nephew and niece had come before him he perceived that they were the fruit of influences and circumstances very different from those under which his own familiar progeny had reached a vaguelyqualified maturity he felt no provocation to say that these influences had been exerted for evil but he was sometimes afraid that he should not be able to like his distinguished delicate ladylike niece he was paralyzed and bewildered by her foreignness she spoke somehow a different language there was something strange in her words he had a feeling that another man in his place would accommodate himself to her tone would ask her questions and joke with her reply to those pleasantries of her own which sometimes seemed startling as addressed to an uncle but mr wentworth could not do these things he could not even bring himself to attempt to measure her position in the world she was the wife of a foreign nobleman who desired to repudiate her this had a singular sound but the old man felt himself destitute of the materials for a judgment it seemed to him that he ought to find them in his own experience as a man of the world and an almost public character but they were not there and he was ashamed to confess to himselfmuch more to reveal to eugenia by interrogations possibly too innocentthe unfurnished condition of this repository  it appeared to him that he could get much nearer as he would have said to his nephew though he was not sure that felix was altogether safe he was so bright and handsome and talkative that it was impossible not to think well of him and yet it seemed as if there were something almost impudent almost viciousor as if there ought to bein a young man being at once so joyous and so positive it was to be observed that while felix was not at all a serious young man there was somehow more of himhe had more weight and volume and resonancethan a number of young men who were distinctly serious while mr wentworth meditated upon this anomaly his nephew was admiring him unrestrictedly he thought him a most delicate generous hightoned old gentleman with a very handsome head of the ascetic type which he promised himself the profit of sketching felix was far from having made a secret of the fact that he wielded the paintbrush and it was not his own fault if it failed to be generally understood that he was prepared to execute the most striking likenesses on the most reasonable terms he is an artistmy cousin is an artist said gertrude and she offered this information to every one who would receive it she offered it to herself as it were by way of admonition and reminder she repeated to herself at odd moments in lonely places that felix was invested with this sacred character gertrude had never seen an artist before she had only read about such people they seemed to her a romantic and mysterious class whose life was made up of those agreeable accidents that never happened to other persons and it merely quickened her meditations on this point that felix should declare as he repeatedly did that he was really not an artist i have never gone into the thing seriously he said i have never studied i have had no training i do a little of everything and nothing well i am only an amateur  it pleased gertrude even more to think that he was an amateur than to think that he was an artist the former word to her fancy had an even subtler connotation she knew however that it was a word to use more soberly mr wentworth used it freely for though he had not been exactly familiar with it he found it convenient as a help toward classifying felix who as a young man extremely clever and active and apparently respectable and yet not engaged in any recognized business was an importunate anomaly of course the baroness and her brothershe was always spoken of firstwere a welcome topic of conversation between mr wentworth and his daughters and their occasional visitors  and the young man your nephew what is his profession asked an old gentlemanmr broderip of salemwho had been mr wentworths classmate at harvard college in the year 1809 and who came into his office in devonshire street mr wentworth in his later years used to go but three times a week to his office where he had a large amount of highly confidential trustbusiness to transact  well he s an amateur said felixs uncle with folded hands and with a certain satisfaction in being able to say it and mr broderip had gone back to salem with a feeling that this was probably a european expression for a broker or a grain exporter  i should like to do your head sir said felix to his uncle one evening before them allmr brand and robert acton being also present i think i should make a very fine thing of it it s an interesting head it s very mediaeval  mr wentworth looked grave he felt awkwardly as if all the company had come in and found him standing before the lookingglass the lord made it he said i dont think it is for man to make it over again  certainly the lord made it replied felix laughing and he made it very well but life has been touching up the work it is a very interesting type of head it s delightfully wasted and emaciated the complexion is wonderfully bleached and felix looked round at the circle as if to call their attention to these interesting points mr wentworth grew visibly paler i should like to do you as an old prelate an old cardinal or the prior of an order  a prelate a cardinal murmured mr wentworth do you refer to the roman catholic priesthood  i mean an old ecclesiastic who should have led a very pure abstinent life now i take it that has been the case with you sir one sees it in your face felix proceeded you have been verya very moderate dont you think one always sees that in a mans face  you see more in a mans face than i should think of looking for said mr wentworth coldly  the baroness rattled her fan and gave her brilliant laugh it is a risk to look so close she exclaimed my uncle has some peccadilloes on his conscience mr wentworth looked at her painfully at a loss and in so far as the signs of a pure and abstinent life were visible in his face they were then probably peculiarly manifest you are a beau vieillard dear uncle said madame m auunster smiling with her foreign eyes  i think you are paying me a compliment said the old man  surely i am not the first woman that ever did so cried the baroness  i think you are said mr wentworth gravely and turning to felix he added in the same tone please dont take my likeness my children have my daguerreotype that is quite satisfactory  i wont promise said felix not to work your head into something  mr wentworth looked at him and then at all the others then he got up and slowly walked away  felix said gertrude in the silence that followed i wish you would paint my portrait  charlotte wondered whether gertrude was right in wishing this and she looked at mr brand as the most legitimate way of ascertaining whatever gertrude did or said charlotte always looked at mr brand it was a standing pretext for looking at mr brandalways as charlotte thought in the interest of gertrudes welfare it is true that she felt a tremulous interest in gertrude being right for charlotte in her small still way was an heroic sister  we should be glad to have your portrait miss gertrude said mr brand  i should be delighted to paint so charming a model felix declared  do you think you are so lovely my dear asked lizzie acton with her little inoffensive pertness biting off a knot in her knitting  it is not because i think i am beautiful said gertrude looking all round i dont think i am beautiful at all she spoke with a sort of conscious deliberateness and it seemed very strange to charlotte to hear her discussing this question so publicly it is because i think it would be amusing to sit and be painted i have always thought that  i am sorry you have not had better things to think about my daughter said mr wentworth  you are very beautiful cousin gertrude felix declared  that s a compliment said gertrude i put all the compliments i receive into a little moneyjug that has a slit in the side i shake them up and down and they rattle there are not many yetonly two or three  no it s not a compliment felix rejoined see i am careful not to give it the form of a compliment i did nt think you were beautiful at first but you have come to seem so little by little  take care now your jug does nt burst exclaimed lizzie  i think sitting for ones portrait is only one of the various forms of idleness said mr wentworth their name is legion  my dear sir cried felix you cant be said to be idle when you are making a man work so  one might be painted while one is asleep suggested mr brand as a contribution to the discussion  ah do paint me while i am asleep said gertrude to felix smiling and she closed her eyes a little it had by this time become a matter of almost exciting anxiety to charlotte what gertrude would say or would do next  she began to sit for her portrait on the following dayin the open air on the north side of the piazza i wish you would tell me what you think of ushow we seem to you she said to felix as he sat before his easel  you seem to me the best people in the world said felix  you say that gertrude resumed because it saves you the trouble of saying anything else  the young man glanced at her over the top of his canvas what else should i say it would certainly be a great deal of trouble to say anything different  well said gertrude you have seen people before that you have liked have you not  indeed i have thank heaven  and they have been very different from us gertrude went on  that only proves said felix that there are a thousand different ways of being good company  do you think us good company asked gertrude  company for a king  gertrude was silent a moment and then there must be a thousand different ways of being dreary she said and sometimes i think we make use of them all  felix stood up quickly holding up his hand if you could only keep that look on your face for half an hourwhile i catch it he said it is uncommonly handsome  to look handsome for half an hourthat is a great deal to ask of me she answered  it would be the portrait of a young woman who has taken some vow some pledge that she repents of said felix and who is thinking it over at leisure  i have taken no vow no pledge said gertrude very gravely i have nothing to repent of  my dear cousin that was only a figure of speech i am very sure that no one in your excellent family has anything to repent of  and yet we are always repenting gertrude exclaimed that is what i mean by our being dreary you know it perfectly well you only pretend that you dont  felix gave a quick laugh the half hour is going on and yet you are handsomer than ever one must be careful what one says you see  to me said gertrude you can say anything  felix looked at her as an artist might and painted for some time in silence  yes you seem to me different from your father and sisterfrom most of the people you have lived with he observed  to say that ones self gertrude went on is like sayingby implication at leastthat one is better i am not better i am much worse but they say themselves that i am different it makes them unhappy  since you accuse me of concealing my real impressions i may admit that i think the tendencyamong you generallyis to be made unhappy too easily  i wish you would tell that to my father said gertrude  it might make him more unhappy felix exclaimed laughing  it certainly would i dont believe you have seen people like that  ah my dear cousin how do you know what i have seen felix demanded how can i tell you  you might tell me a great many things if you only would you have seen people like yourselfpeople who are bright and gay and fond of amusement we are not fond of amusement  yes said felix i confess that rather strikes me you dont seem to me to get all the pleasure out of life that you might you dont seem to me to enjoy do you mind my saying this he asked pausing  please go on said the girl earnestly  you seem to me very well placed for enjoying you have money and liberty and what is called in europe a position but you take a painful view of life as one may say  one ought to think it bright and charming and delightful eh asked gertrude  i should say soif one can it is true it all depends upon that felix added  you know there is a great deal of misery in the world said his model  i have seen a little of it the young man rejoined but it was all over therebeyond the sea i dont see any here this is a paradise  gertrude said nothing she sat looking at the dahlias and the currantbushes in the garden while felix went on with his work to enjoy she began at last to take lifenot painfully must one do something wrong  felix gave his long light laugh again seriously i think not and for this reason among others you strike me as very capable of enjoying if the chance were given you and yet at the same time as incapable of wrongdoing  i am sure said gertrude that you are very wrong in telling a person that she is incapable of that we are never nearer to evil than when we believe that  you are handsomer than ever observed felix irrelevantly  gertrude had got used to hearing him say this there was not so much excitement in it as at first what ought one to do she continued to give parties to go to the theatre to read novels to keep late hours  i dont think it s what one does or one does nt do that promotes enjoyment her companion answered it is the general way of looking at life  they look at it as a disciplinethat s what they do here i have often been told that  well that s very good but there is another way added felix smiling to look at it as an opportunity  an opportunityyes said gertrude one would get more pleasure that way  i dont attempt to say anything better for it than that it has been my own wayand that is not saying much felix had laid down his palette and brushes he was leaning back with his arms folded to judge the effect of his work and you know he said i am a very petty personage  you have a great deal of talent said gertrude  nono the young man rejoined in a tone of cheerful impartiality i have not a great deal of talent it is nothing at all remarkable i assure you i should know if it were i shall always be obscure the world will never hear of me gertrude looked at him with a strange feeling she was thinking of the great world which he knew and which she did not and how full of brilliant talents it must be since it could afford to make light of his abilities you need nt in general attach much importance to anything i tell you he pursued but you may believe me when i say thisthat i am little better than a goodnatured featherhead  a featherhead she repeated  i am a species of bohemian  a bohemian gertrude had never heard this term before save as a geographical denomination and she quite failed to understand the figurative meaning which her companion appeared to attach to it but it gave her pleasure  felix had pushed back his chair and risen to his feet he slowly came toward her smiling i am a sort of adventurer he said looking down at her  she got up meeting his smile an adventurer she repeated i should like to hear your adventures  for an instant she believed that he was going to take her hand but he dropped his own hands suddenly into the pockets of his paintingjacket there is no reason why you should nt he said i have been an adventurer but my adventures have been very innocent they have all been happy ones i dont think there are any i should nt tell they were very pleasant and very pretty i should like to go over them in memory sit down again and i will begin he added in a moment with his naturally persuasive smile  gertrude sat down again on that day and she sat down on several other days felix while he plied his brush told her a great many stories and she listened with charmed avidity her eyes rested upon his lips she was very serious sometimes from her air of wondering gravity he thought she was displeased but felix never believed for more than a single moment in any displeasure of his own producing this would have been fatuity if the optimism it expressed had not been much more a hope than a prejudice it is beside the matter to say that he had a good conscience for the best conscience is a sort of selfreproach and this young mans brilliantly healthy nature spent itself in objective good intentions which were ignorant of any test save exactness in hitting their mark he told gertrude how he had walked over france and italy with a painters knapsack on his back paying his way often by knocking off a flattering portrait of his host or hostess he told her how he had played the violin in a little band of musiciansnot of high celebritywho traveled through foreign lands giving provincial concerts he told her also how he had been a momentary ornament of a troupe of strolling actors engaged in the arduous task of interpreting shakespeare to french and german polish and hungarian audiences  while this periodical recital was going on gertrude lived in a fantastic world she seemed to herself to be reading a romance that came out in daily numbers she had known nothing so delightful since the perusal of nicholas nickleby one afternoon she went to see her cousin mrs acton roberts mother who was a great invalid never leaving the house she came back alone on foot across the fieldsthis being a short way which they often used felix had gone to boston with her father who desired to take the young man to call upon some of his friends old gentlemen who remembered his motherremembered her but said nothing about herand several of whom with the gentle ladies their wives had driven out from town to pay their respects at the little house among the appletrees in vehicles which reminded the baroness who received her visitors with discriminating civility of the large light rattling barouche in which she herself had made her journey to this neighborhood the afternoon was waning in the western sky the great picture of a new england sunset painted in crimson and silver was suspended from the zenith and the stony pastures as gertrude traversed them thinking intently to herself were covered with a light clear glow at the open gate of one of the fields she saw from the distance a mans figure he stood there as if he were waiting for her and as she came nearer she recognized mr brand she had a feeling as of not having seen him for some time she could not have said for how long for it yet seemed to her that he had been very lately at the house  may i walk back with you he asked and when she had said that he might if he wanted he observed that he had seen her and recognized her half a mile away  you must have very good eyes said gertrude  yes i have very good eyes miss gertrude said mr brand she perceived that he meant something but for a long time past mr brand had constantly meant something and she had almost got used to it she felt however that what he meant had now a renewed power to disturb her to perplex and agitate her he walked beside her in silence for a moment and then he added i have had no trouble in seeing that you are beginning to avoid me but perhaps he went on one need nt have had very good eyes to see that  i have not avoided you said gertrude without looking at him  i think you have been unconscious that you were avoiding me mr brand replied you have not even known that i was there  well you are here now mr brand said gertrude with a little laugh i know that very well  he made no rejoinder he simply walked beside her slowly as they were obliged to walk over the soft grass presently they came to another gate which was closed mr brand laid his hand upon it but he made no movement to open it he stood and looked at his companion you are very much interestedvery much absorbed he said  gertrude glanced at him she saw that he was pale and that he looked excited she had never seen mr brand excited before and she felt that the spectacle if fully carried out would be impressive almost painful absorbed in what she asked then she looked away at the illuminated sky she felt guilty and uncomfortable and yet she was vexed with herself for feeling so but mr brand as he stood there looking at her with his small kind persistent eyes represented an immense body of halfobliterated obligations that were rising again into a certain distinctness  you have new interests new occupations he went on i dont know that i can say that you have new duties we have always old ones gertrude he added  please open the gate mr brand she said and she felt as if in saying so she were cowardly and petulant but he opened the gate and allowed her to pass then he closed it behind himself before she had time to turn away he put out his hand and held her an instant by the wrist  i want to say something to you he said  i know what you want to say she answered and she was on the point of adding and i know just how you will say it but these words she kept back  i love you gertrude he said i love you very much i love you more than ever  he said the words just as she had known he would she had heard them before they had no charm for her she had said to herself before that it was very strange it was supposed to be delightful for a woman to listen to such words but these seemed to her flat and mechanical i wish you would forget that she declared  how can iwhy should i he asked  i have made you no promisegiven you no pledge she said looking at him with her voice trembling a little  you have let me feel that i have an influence over you you have opened your mind to me  i never opened my mind to you mr brand gertrude cried with some vehemence  then you were not so frank as i thoughtas we all thought  i dont see what any one else had to do with it cried the girl  i mean your father and your sister you know it makes them happy to think you will listen to me  she gave a little laugh it does nt make them happy she said nothing makes them happy no one is happy here  i think your cousin is very happymr young rejoined mr brand in a soft almost timid tone  so much the better for him and gertrude gave her little laugh again  the young man looked at her a moment you are very much changed he said  i am glad to hear it gertrude declared  i am not i have known you a long time and i have loved you as you were  i am much obliged to you said gertrude i must be going home  he on his side gave a little laugh  you certainly do avoid meyou see  avoid me then said the girl  he looked at her again and then very gently no i will not avoid you he replied but i will leave you for the present to yourself i think you will rememberafter a whilesome of the things you have forgotten i think you will come back to me i have great faith in that  this time his voice was very touching there was a strong reproachful force in what he said and gertrude could answer nothing he turned away and stood there leaning his elbows on the gate and looking at the beautiful sunset gertrude left him and took her way home again but when she reached the middle of the next field she suddenly burst into tears her tears seemed to her to have been a long time gathering and for some moments it was a kind of glee to shed them but they presently passed away there was something a little hard about gertrude and she never wept again       chapter vi  going of an afternoon to call upon his niece mr wentworth more than once found robert acton sitting in her little drawingroom this was in no degree to mr wentworth a perturbing fact for he had no sense of competing with his young kinsman for eugenias good graces madame munsters uncle had the highest opinion of robert acton who indeed in the family at large was the object of a great deal of undemonstrative appreciation they were all proud of him in so far as the charge of being proud may be brought against people who were habitually distinctly guiltless of the misdemeanor known as taking credit they never boasted of robert acton nor indulged in vainglorious reference to him they never quoted the clever things he had said nor mentioned the generous things he had done but a sort of frigidlytender faith in his unlimited goodness was a part of their personal sense of right and there can perhaps be no better proof of the high esteem in which he was held than the fact that no explicit judgment was ever passed upon his actions he was no more praised than he was blamed but he was tacitly felt to be an ornament to his circle he was the man of the world of the family he had been to china and brought home a collection of curiosities he had made a fortuneor rather he had quintupled a fortune already considerable he was distinguished by that combination of celibacy property and good humor which appeals to even the most subdued imaginations and it was taken for granted that he would presently place these advantages at the disposal of some wellregulated young woman of his own set mr wentworth was not a man to admit to himself thathis paternal duties aparthe liked any individual much better than all other individuals but he thought robert acton extremely judicious and this was perhaps as near an approach as he was capable of to the eagerness of preference which his temperament repudiated as it would have disengaged itself from something slightly unchaste acton was in fact very judiciousand something more beside and indeed it must be claimed for mr wentworth that in the more illicit parts of his preference there hovered the vague adumbration of a belief that his cousins final merit was a certain enviable capacity for whistling rather gallantly at the sanctions of mere judgmentfor showing a larger courage a finer quality of pluck than common occasion demanded mr wentworth would never have risked the intimation that acton was made in the smallest degree of the stuff of a hero but this is small blame to him for robert would certainly never have risked it himself acton certainly exercised great discretion in all thingsbeginning with his estimate of himself he knew that he was by no means so much of a man of the world as he was supposed to be in local circles but it must be added that he knew also that his natural shrewdness had a reach of which he had never quite given local circles the measure he was addicted to taking the humorous view of things and he had discovered that even in the narrowest circles such a disposition may find frequent opportunities such opportunities had formed for some timethat is since his return from china a year and a half beforethe most active element in this gentlemans life which had just now a rather indolent air he was perfectly willing to get married he was very fond of books and he had a handsome library that is his books were much more numerous than mr wentworths he was also very fond of pictures but it must be confessed in the fierce light of contemporary criticism that his walls were adorned with several rather abortive masterpieces he had got his learningand there was more of it than commonly appearedat harvard college and he took a pleasure in old associations which made it a part of his daily contentment to live so near this institution that he often passed it in driving to boston he was extremely interested in the baroness munster  she was very frank with him or at least she intended to be i am sure you find it very strange that i should have settled down in this outoftheway part of the world she said to him three or four weeks after she had installed herself i am certain you are wondering about my motives they are very pure the baroness by this time was an old inhabitant the best society in boston had called upon her and clifford wentworth had taken her several times to drive in his buggy  robert acton was seated near her playing with a fan there were always several fans lying about her drawingroom with long ribbons of different colors attached to them and acton was always playing with one no i dont find it at all strange he said slowly smiling that a clever woman should turn up in boston or its suburbsthat does not require so much explanation boston is a very nice place  if you wish to make me contradict you said the baroness vous vous y prenez mal in certain moods there is nothing i am not capable of agreeing to boston is a paradise and we are in the suburbs of paradise  just now i am not at all in the suburbs i am in the place itself rejoined acton who was lounging a little in his chair he was however not always lounging and when he was he was not quite so relaxed as he pretended to a certain extent he sought refuge from shyness in this appearance of relaxation and like many persons in the same circumstances he somewhat exaggerated the appearance beyond this the air of being much at his ease was a cover for vigilant observation he was more than interested in this clever woman who whatever he might say was clever not at all after the boston fashion she plunged him into a kind of excitement held him in vague suspense he was obliged to admit to himself that he had never yet seen a woman just like thisnot even in china he was ashamed for inscrutable reasons of the vivacity of his emotion and he carried it off superficially by taking still superficially the humorous view of madame munster it was not at all true that he thought it very natural of her to have made this pious pilgrimage it might have been said of him in advance that he was too good a bostonian to regard in the light of an eccentricity the desire of even the remotest alien to visit the new england metropolis this was an impulse for which surely no apology was needed and madame munster was the fortunate possessor of several new england cousins in fact however madame munster struck him as out of keeping with her little circle she was at the best a very agreeable a gracefully mystifying anomaly he knew very well that it would not do to address these reflections too crudely to mr wentworth he would never have remarked to the old gentleman that he wondered what the baroness was up to and indeed he had no great desire to share his vague mistrust with any one there was a personal pleasure in it the greatest pleasure he had known at least since he had come from china he would keep the baroness for better or worse to himself he had a feeling that he deserved to enjoy a monopoly of her for he was certainly the person who had most adequately gauged her capacity for social intercourse before long it became apparent to him that the baroness was disposed to lay no tax upon such a monopoly  one day he was sitting there again and playing with a fan she asked him to apologize should the occasion present itself to certain people in boston for her not having returned their calls there are half a dozen places she said a formidable list charlotte wentworth has written it out for me in a terrifically distinct hand there is no ambiguity on the subject i know perfectly where i must go mr wentworth informs me that the carriage is always at my disposal and charlotte offers to go with me in a pair of tight gloves and a very stiff petticoat and yet for three days i have been putting it off they must think me horribly vicious  you ask me to apologize said acton but you dont tell me what excuse i can offer  that is more the baroness declared than i am held to it would be like my asking you to buy me a bouquet and giving you the money i have no reason except thatsomehowit s too violent an effort it is not inspiring would nt that serve as an excuse in boston i am told they are very sincere they dont tell fibs and then felix ought to go with me and he is never in readiness i dont see him he is always roaming about the fields and sketching old barns or taking tenmile walks or painting some ones portrait or rowing on the pond or flirting with gertrude wentworth  i should think it would amuse you to go and see a few people said acton you are having a very quiet time of it here it s a dull life for you  ah the quietthe quiet the baroness exclaimed that s what i like it s rest that s what i came here for amusement i have had amusement and as for seeing peoplei have already seen a great many in my life if it did nt sound ungracious i should say that i wish very humbly your people here would leave me alone  acton looked at her a moment and she looked at him she was a woman who took being looked at remarkably well so you have come here for rest he asked  so i may say i came for many of those reasons that are no reasonsdont you knowand yet that are really the best to come away to change to break with everything when once one comes away one must arrive somewhere and i asked myself why i should nt arrive here  you certainly had time on the way said acton laughing  madame munster looked at him again and then smiling and i have certainly had time since i got here to ask myself why i came however i never ask myself idle questions here i am and it seems to me you ought only to thank me  when you go away you will see the difficulties i shall put in your path  you mean to put difficulties in my path she asked rearranging the rosebud in her corsage  the greatest of allthat of having been so agreeable  that i shall be unable to depart dont be too sure i have left some very agreeable people over there  ah said acton but it was to come here where i am  i did nt know of your existence excuse me for saying anything so rude but honestly speaking i did not no the baroness pursued it was precisely not to see yousuch people as youthat i came  such people as me cried acton  i had a sort of longing to come into those natural relations which i knew i should find here over there i had only as i may say artificial relations dont you see the difference  the difference tells against me said acton i suppose i am an artificial relation  conventional declared the baroness very conventional  well there is one way in which the relation of a lady and a gentleman may always become natural said acton  you mean by their becoming lovers that may be natural or not and at any rate rejoined eugenia nous nen sommes pas la  they were not as yet but a little later when she began to go with him to drive it might almost have seemed that they were he came for her several times alone in his high wagon drawn by a pair of charming lightlimbed horses it was different her having gone with clifford wentworth who was her cousin and so much younger it was not to be imagined that she should have a flirtation with clifford who was a mere shamefaced boy and whom a large section of boston society supposed to be engaged to lizzie acton not indeed that it was to be conceived that the baroness was a possible party to any flirtation whatever for she was undoubtedly a married lady it was generally known that her matrimonial condition was of the morganatic order but in its natural aversion to suppose that this meant anything less than absolute wedlock the conscience of the community took refuge in the belief that it implied something even more  acton wished her to think highly of american scenery and he drove her to great distances picking out the prettiest roads and the largest points of view if we are good when we are contented eugenias virtues should now certainly have been uppermost for she found a charm in the rapid movement through a wild country and in a companion who from time to time made the vehicle dip with a motion like a swallows flight over roads of primitive construction and who as she felt would do a great many things that she might ask him sometimes for a couple of hours together there were almost no houses there were nothing but woods and rivers and lakes and horizons adorned with brightlooking mountains it seemed to the baroness very wild as i have said and lovely but the impression added something to that sense of the enlargement of opportunity which had been born of her arrival in the new world  one dayit was late in the afternoonacton pulled up his horses on the crest of a hill which commanded a beautiful prospect he let them stand a long time to rest while he sat there and talked with madame m auunster the prospect was beautiful in spite of there being nothing human within sight there was a wilderness of woods and the gleam of a distant river and a glimpse of half the hilltops in massachusetts the road had a wide grassy margin on the further side of which there flowed a deep clear brook there were wild flowers in the grass and beside the brook lay the trunk of a fallen tree acton waited a while at last a rustic wayfarer came trudging along the road acton asked him to hold the horsesa service he consented to render as a friendly turn to a fellowcitizen then he invited the baroness to descend and the two wandered away across the grass and sat down on the log beside the brook  i imagine it does nt remind you of silberstadt said acton it was the first time that he had mentioned silberstadt to her for particular reasons he knew she had a husband there and this was disagreeable to him and furthermore it had been repeated to him that this husband wished to put her awaya state of affairs to which even indirect reference was to be deprecated it was true nevertheless that the baroness herself had often alluded to silberstadt and acton had often wondered why her husband wished to get rid of her it was a curious position for a ladythis being known as a repudiated wife and it is worthy of observation that the baroness carried it off with exceeding grace and dignity she had made it felt from the first that there were two sides to the question and that her own side when she should choose to present it would be replete with touching interest  it does not remind me of the town of course she said of the sculptured gables and the gothic churches of the wonderful schloss with its moat and its clustering towers but it has a little look of some other parts of the principality one might fancy ones self among those grand old german forests those legendary mountains the sort of country one sees from the windows at shreckenstein  what is shreckenstein asked acton  it is a great castlethe summer residence of the reigning prince  have you ever lived there  i have stayed there said the baroness acton was silent he looked a while at the uncastled landscape before him it is the first time you have ever asked me about silberstadt she said i should think you would want to know about my marriage it must seem to you very strange  acton looked at her a moment now you would nt like me to say that  you americans have such odd ways the baroness declared you never ask anything outright there seem to be so many things you cant talk about  we americans are very polite said acton whose national consciousness had been complicated by a residence in foreign lands and who yet disliked to hear americans abused we dont like to tread upon peoples toes he said but i should like very much to hear about your marriage now tell me how it came about  the prince fell in love with me replied the baroness simply he pressed his suit very hard at first he did nt wish me to marry him on the contrary but on that basis i refused to listen to him so he offered me marriagein so far as he might i was young and i confess i was rather flattered but if it were to be done again now i certainly should not accept him  how long ago was this asked acton  ohseveral years said eugenia you should never ask a woman for dates  why i should think that when a woman was relating history acton answered and now he wants to break it off  they want him to make a political marriage it is his brothers idea his brother is very clever  they must be a precious pair cried robert acton  the baroness gave a little philosophic shrug que voulezvous they are princes they think they are treating me very well silberstadt is a perfectly despotic little state and the reigning prince may annul the marriage by a stroke of his pen but he has promised me nevertheless not to do so without my formal consent  and this you have refused  hitherto it is an indignity and i have wished at least to make it difficult for them but i have a little document in my writingdesk which i have only to sign and send back to the prince  then it will be all over  the baroness lifted her hand and dropped it again of course i shall keep my title at least i shall be at liberty to keep it if i choose and i suppose i shall keep it one must have a name and i shall keep my pension it is very smallit is wretchedly small but it is what i live on  and you have only to sign that paper acton asked  the baroness looked at him a moment do you urge it  he got up slowly and stood with his hands in his pockets what do you gain by not doing it  i am supposed to gain this advantagethat if i delay or temporize the prince may come back to me may make a stand against his brother he is very fond of me and his brother has pushed him only little by little  if he were to come back to you said acton would youwould you take him back  the baroness met his eyes she colored just a little then she rose i should have the satisfaction of saying now it is my turn i break with your serene highness  they began to walk toward the carriage well said robert acton it s a curious story how did you make his acquaintance  i was staying with an old ladyan old countessin dresden she had been a friend of my fathers my father was dead i was very much alone my brother was wandering about the world in a theatrical troupe  your brother ought to have stayed with you acton observed and kept you from putting your trust in princes  the baroness was silent a moment and then he did what he could she said he sent me money the old countess encouraged the prince she was even pressing it seems to me madame munster added gently thatunder the circumstancesi behaved very well  acton glanced at her and made the observationhe had made it beforethat a woman looks the prettier for having unfolded her wrongs or her sufferings well he reflected audibly i should like to see you send his serene highnesssomewhere  madame munster stooped and plucked a daisy from the grass and not sign my renunciation  well i dont knowi dont know said acton  in one case i should have my revenge in another case i should have my liberty  acton gave a little laugh as he helped her into the carriage at any rate he said take good care of that paper  a couple of days afterward he asked her to come and see his house the visit had already been proposed but it had been put off in consequence of his mothers illness she was a constant invalid and she had passed these recent years very patiently in a great flowered armchair at her bedroom window lately for some days she had been unable to see any one but now she was better and she sent the baroness a very civil message acton had wished their visitor to come to dinner but madame m auunster preferred to begin with a simple call she had reflected that if she should go to dinner mr wentworth and his daughters would also be asked and it had seemed to her that the peculiar character of the occasion would be best preserved in a teteatete with her host why the occasion should have a peculiar character she explained to no one as far as any one could see it was simply very pleasant acton came for her and drove her to his door an operation which was rapidly performed his house the baroness mentally pronounced a very good one more articulately she declared that it was enchanting it was large and square and painted brown it stood in a wellkept shrubbery and was approached from the gate by a short drive it was moreover a much more modern dwelling than mr wentworths and was more redundantly upholstered and expensively ornamented the baroness perceived that her entertainer had analyzed material comfort to a sufficiently fine point and then he possessed the most delightful chinoiseriestrophies of his sojourn in the celestial empire pagodas of ebony and cabinets of ivory sculptured monsters grinning and leering on chimneypieces in front of beautifully figured handscreens porcelain dinnersets gleaming behind the glass doors of mahogany buffets large screens in corners covered with tense silk and embroidered with mandarins and dragons these things were scattered all over the house and they gave eugenia a pretext for a complete domiciliary visit she liked it she enjoyed it she thought it a very nice place it had a mixture of the homely and the liberal and though it was almost a museum the large littleused rooms were as fresh and clean as a wellkept dairy lizzie acton told her that she dusted all the pagodas and other curiosities every day with her own hands and the baroness answered that she was evidently a household fairy lizzie had not at all the look of a young lady who dusted things she wore such pretty dresses and had such delicate fingers that it was difficult to imagine her immersed in sordid cares she came to meet madame m auunster on her arrival but she said nothing or almost nothing and the baroness again reflectedshe had had occasion to do so beforethat american girls had no manners she disliked this little american girl and she was quite prepared to learn that she had failed to commend herself to miss acton lizzie struck her as positive and explicit almost to pertness and the idea of her combining the apparent incongruities of a taste for housework and the wearing of fresh parisianlooking dresses suggested the possession of a dangerous energy it was a source of irritation to the baroness that in this country it should seem to matter whether a little girl were a trifle less or a trifle more of a nonentity for eugenia had hitherto been conscious of no moral pressure as regards the appreciation of diminutive virgins it was perhaps an indication of lizzies pertness that she very soon retired and left the baroness on her brothers hands acton talked a great deal about his chinoiseries he knew a good deal about porcelain and bricabrac the baroness in her progress through the house made as it were a great many stations she sat down everywhere confessed to being a little tired and asked about the various objects with a curious mixture of alertness and inattention if there had been any one to say it to she would have declared that she was positively in love with her host but she could hardly make this declarationeven in the strictest confidenceto acton himself it gave her nevertheless a pleasure that had some of the charm of unwontedness to feel with that admirable keenness with which she was capable of feeling things that he had a disposition without any edges that even his humorous irony always expanded toward the point ones impression of his honesty was almost like carrying a bunch of flowers the perfume was most agreeable but they were occasionally an inconvenience one could trust him at any rate round all the corners of the world and withal he was not absolutely simple which would have been excess he was only relatively simple which was quite enough for the baroness  lizzie reappeared to say that her mother would now be happy to receive madame munster and the baroness followed her to mrs actons apartment eugenia reflected as she went that it was not the affectation of impertinence that made her dislike this young lady for on that ground she could easily have beaten her it was not an aspiration on the girls part to rivalry but a kind of laughing childishlymocking indifference to the results of comparison mrs acton was an emaciated sweetfaced woman of five and fifty sitting with pillows behind her and looking out on a clump of hemlocks she was very modest very timid and very ill she made eugenia feel grateful that she herself was not like thatneither so ill nor possibly so modest on a chair beside her lay a volume of emersons essays it was a great occasion for poor mrs acton in her helpless condition to be confronted with a clever foreign lady who had more manner than any ladyany dozen ladiesthat she had ever seen  i have heard a great deal about you she said softly to the baroness  from your son eh eugenia asked he has talked to me immensely of you oh he talks of you as you would like the baroness declared as such a son must talk of such a mother  mrs acton sat gazing this was part of madame munsters manner but robert acton was gazing too in vivid consciousness that he had barely mentioned his mother to their brilliant guest he never talked of this still maternal presencea presence refined to such delicacy that it had almost resolved itself with him simply into the subjective emotion of gratitude and acton rarely talked of his emotions the baroness turned her smile toward him and she instantly felt that she had been observed to be fibbing she had struck a false note but who were these people to whom such fibbing was not pleasing if they were annoyed the baroness was equally so and after the exchange of a few civil inquiries and lowvoiced responses she took leave of mrs acton she begged robert not to come home with her she would get into the carriage alone she preferred that this was imperious and she thought he looked disappointed while she stood before the door with himthe carriage was turning in the gravelwalkthis thought restored her serenity  when she had given him her hand in farewell she looked at him a moment i have almost decided to dispatch that paper she said  he knew that she alluded to the document that she had called her renunciation and he assisted her into the carriage without saying anything but just before the vehicle began to move he said well when you have in fact dispatched it i hope you will let me know       chapter vii  felix young finished gertrudes portrait and he afterwards transferred to canvas the features of many members of that circle of which it may be said that he had become for the time the pivot and the centre i am afraid it must be confessed that he was a decidedly flattering painter and that he imparted to his models a romantic grace which seemed easily and cheaply acquired by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young man who made sitting so entertaining for felix was paid for his pictures making as he did no secret of the fact that in guiding his steps to the western world affectionate curiosity had gone hand in hand with a desire to better his condition he took his uncles portrait quite as if mr wentworth had never averted himself from the experiment and as he compassed his end only by the exercise of gentle violence it is but fair to add that he allowed the old man to give him nothing but his time he passed his arm into mr wentworths one summer morningvery few arms indeed had ever passed into mr wentworthsand led him across the garden and along the road into the studio which he had extemporized in the little house among the appletrees the grave gentleman felt himself more and more fascinated by his clever nephew whose fresh demonstrative youth seemed a compendium of experiences so strangely numerous it appeared to him that felix must know a great deal he would like to learn what he thought about some of those things as regards which his own conversation had always been formal but his knowledge vague felix had a confident gayly trenchant way of judging human actions which mr wentworth grew little by little to envy it seemed like criticism made easy forming an opinionsay on a persons conductwas with mr wentworth a good deal like fumbling in a lock with a key chosen at hazard he seemed to himself to go about the world with a big bunch of these ineffectual instruments at his girdle his nephew on the other hand with a single turn of the wrist opened any door as adroitly as a horsethief he felt obliged to keep up the convention that an uncle is always wiser than a nephew even if he could keep it up no otherwise than by listening in serious silence to felixs quick light constant discourse but there came a day when he lapsed from consistency and almost asked his nephews advice  have you ever entertained the idea of settling in the united states he asked one morning while felix brilliantly plied his brush  my dear uncle said felix excuse me if your question makes me smile a little to begin with i have never entertained an idea ideas often entertain me but i am afraid i have never seriously made a plan i know what you are going to say or rather i know what you think for i dont think you will say itthat this is very frivolous and looseminded on my part so it is but i am made like that i take things as they come and somehow there is always some new thing to follow the last in the second place i should never propose to settle i cant settle my dear uncle i m not a settler i know that is what strangers are supposed to do here they always settle but i have ntto answer your questionentertained that idea  you intend to return to europe and resume your irregular manner of life mr wentworth inquired  i cant say i intend but it s very likely i shall go back to europe after all i am a european i feel that you know it will depend a good deal upon my sister she s even more of a european than i here you know she s a picture out of her setting and as for resuming dear uncle i really have never given up my irregular manner of life what for me could be more irregular than this  than what asked mr wentworth with his pale gravity  well than everything living in the midst of you this way this charming quiet serious family life fraternizing with charlotte and gertrude calling upon twenty young ladies and going out to walk with them sitting with you in the evening on the piazza and listening to the crickets and going to bed at ten oclock  your description is very animated said mr wentworth but i see nothing improper in what you describe  neither do i dear uncle it is extremely delightful i should nt like it if it were improper i assure you i dont like improper things though i dare say you think i do felix went on painting away  i have never accused you of that  pray dont said felix because you see at bottom i am a terrible philistine  a philistine repeated mr wentworth  i mean as one may say a plain godfearing man mr wentworth looked at him reservedly like a mystified sage and felix continued i trust i shall enjoy a venerable and venerated old age i mean to live long i can hardly call that a plan perhaps but it s a keen desirea rosy vision i shall be a lively perhaps even a frivolous old man  it is natural said his uncle sententiously that one should desire to prolong an agreeable life we have perhaps a selfish indisposition to bring our pleasure to a close but i presume he added that you expect to marry  that too dear uncle is a hope a desire a vision said felix it occurred to him for an instant that this was possibly a preface to the offer of the hand of one of mr wentworths admirable daughters but in the name of decent modesty and a proper sense of the hard realities of this world felix banished the thought his uncle was the incarnation of benevolence certainly but from that to acceptingmuch more postulatingthe idea of a union between a young lady with a dowry presumptively brilliant and a penniless artist with no prospect of fame there was a very long way felix had lately become conscious of a luxurious preference for the societyif possible unshared with othersof gertrude wentworth but he had relegated this young lady for the moment to the coldly brilliant category of unattainable possessions she was not the first woman for whom he had entertained an unpractical admiration he had been in love with duchesses and countesses and he had made once or twice a perilously near approach to cynicism in declaring that the disinterestedness of women had been overrated on the whole he had tempered audacity with modesty and it is but fair to him now to say explicitly that he would have been incapable of taking advantage of his present large allowance of familiarity to make love to the younger of his handsome cousins felix had grown up among traditions in the light of which such a proceeding looked like a grievous breach of hospitality i have said that he was always happy and it may be counted among the present sources of his happiness that he had as regards this matter of his relations with gertrude a deliciously good conscience his own deportment seemed to him suffused with the beauty of virtuea form of beauty that he admired with the same vivacity with which he admired all other forms  i think that if you marry said mr wentworth presently it will conduce to your happiness  sicurissimo felix exclaimed and then arresting his brush he looked at his uncle with a smile there is something i feel tempted to say to you may i risk it  mr wentworth drew himself up a little i am very safe i dont repeat things but he hoped felix would not risk too much  felix was laughing at his answer  it s odd to hear you telling me how to be happy i dont think you know yourself dear uncle now does that sound brutal  the old man was silent a moment and then with a dry dignity that suddenly touched his nephew we may sometimes point out a road we are unable to follow  ah dont tell me you have had any sorrows felix rejoined i did nt suppose it and i did nt mean to allude to them i simply meant that you all dont amuse yourselves  amuse ourselves we are not children  precisely not you have reached the proper age i was saying that the other day to gertrude felix added i hope it was not indiscreet  if it was said mr wentworth with a keener irony than felix would have thought him capable of it was but your way of amusing yourself i am afraid you have never had a trouble  oh yes i have felix declared with some spirit before i knew better but you dont catch me at it again  mr wentworth maintained for a while a silence more expressive than a deepdrawn sigh you have no children he said at last  dont tell me felix exclaimed that your charming young people are a source of grief to you  i dont speak of charlotte and then after a pause mr wentworth continued i dont speak of gertrude but i feel considerable anxiety about clifford i will tell you another time  the next time he gave felix a sitting his nephew reminded him that he had taken him into his confidence how is clifford today felix asked he has always seemed to me a young man of remarkable discretion indeed he is only too discreet he seems on his guard against meas if he thought me rather light company the other day he told his sistergertrude repeated it to methat i was always laughing at him if i laugh it is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him with confidence that is the only way i have  cliffords situation is no laughing matter said mr wentworth it is very peculiar as i suppose you have guessed  ah you mean his love affair with his cousin  mr wentworth stared blushing a little i mean his absence from college he has been suspended we have decided not to speak of it unless we are asked  suspended felix repeated  he has been requested by the harvard authorities to absent himself for six months meanwhile he is studying with mr brand we think mr brand will help him at least we hope so  what befell him at college felix asked he was too fond of pleasure mr brand certainly will not teach him any of those secrets  he was too fond of something of which he should not have been fond i suppose it is considered a pleasure  felix gave his light laugh my dear uncle is there any doubt about its being a pleasure cest de son age as they say in france  i should have said rather it was a vice of later lifeof disappointed old age  felix glanced at his uncle with his lifted eyebrows and then of what are you speaking he demanded smiling  of the situation in which clifford was found  ah he was foundhe was caught  necessarily he was caught he could nt walk he staggered  oh said felix he drinks i rather suspected that from something i observed the first day i came here i quite agree with you that it is a low taste it s not a vice for a gentleman he ought to give it up  we hope for a good deal from mr brands influence mr wentworth went on he has talked to him from the first and he never touches anything himself  i will talk to himi will talk to him felix declared gayly  what will you say to him asked his uncle with some apprehension  felix for some moments answered nothing do you mean to marry him to his cousin he asked at last  marry him echoed mr wentworth i should nt think his cousin would want to marry him  you have no understanding then with mrs acton  mr wentworth stared almost blankly i have never discussed such subjects with her  i should think it might be time said felix lizzie acton is admirably pretty and if clifford is dangerous  they are not engaged said mr wentworth i have no reason to suppose they are engaged  par exemple cried felix a clandestine engagement trust me clifford as i say is a charming boy he is incapable of that lizzie acton then would not be jealous of another woman  i certainly hope not said the old man with a vague sense of jealousy being an even lower vice than a love of liquor  the best thing for clifford then felix propounded is to become interested in some clever charming woman and he paused in his painting and with his elbows on his knees looked with bright communicativeness at his uncle you see i believe greatly in the influence of women living with women helps to make a man a gentleman it is very true clifford has his sisters who are so charming but there should be a different sentiment in play from the fraternal you know he has lizzie acton but she perhaps is rather immature  i suspect lizzie has talked to him reasoned with him said mr wentworth  on the impropriety of getting tipsyon the beauty of temperance that is dreary work for a pretty young girl no felix continued clifford ought to frequent some agreeable woman who without ever mentioning such unsavory subjects would give him a sense of its being very ridiculous to be fuddled if he could fall in love with her a little so much the better the thing would operate as a cure  well now what lady should you suggest asked mr wentworth  there is a clever woman under your hand my sister  your sisterunder my hand mr wentworth repeated  say a word to clifford tell him to be bold he is well disposed already he has invited her two or three times to drive but i dont think he comes to see her give him a hint to cometo come often he will sit there of an afternoon and they will talk it will do him good  mr wentworth meditated you think she will exercise a helpful influence  she will exercise a civilizingi may call it a soberinginfluence a charming clever witty woman always doesespecially if she is a little of a coquette my dear uncle the society of such women has been half my education if clifford is suspended as you say from college let eugenia be his preceptress  mr wentworth continued thoughtful you think eugenia is a coquette he asked  what pretty woman is not felix demanded in turn but this for mr wentworth could at the best have been no answer for he did not think his niece pretty with clifford the young man pursued eugenia will simply be enough of a coquette to be a little ironical that s what he needs so you recommend him to be nice with her you know the suggestion will come best from you  do i understand asked the old man that i am to suggest to my son to make aa profession ofof affection to madame munster  yes yesa profession cried felix sympathetically  but as i understand it madame munster is a married woman  ah said felix smiling of course she cant marry him but she will do what she can  mr wentworth sat for some time with his eyes on the floor at last he got up i dont think he said that i can undertake to recommend my son any such course and without meeting felixs surprised glance he broke off his sitting which was not resumed for a fortnight  felix was very fond of the little lake which occupied so many of mr wentworths numerous acres and of a remarkable pine grove which lay upon the further side of it planted upon a steep embankment and haunted by the summer breeze the murmur of the air in the far off treetops had a strange distinctness it was almost articulate one afternoon the young man came out of his paintingroom and passed the open door of eugenias little salon within in the cool dimness he saw his sister dressed in white buried in her armchair and holding to her face an immense bouquet opposite to her sat clifford wentworth twirling his hat he had evidently just presented the bouquet to the baroness whose fine eyes as she glanced at him over the big roses and geraniums wore a conversational smile felix standing on the threshold of the cottage hesitated for a moment as to whether he should retrace his steps and enter the parlor then he went his way and passed into mr wentworths garden that civilizing process to which he had suggested that clifford should be subjected appeared to have come on of itself felix was very sure at least that mr wentworth had not adopted his ingenious device for stimulating the young mans aesthetic consciousness doubtless he supposes he said to himself after the conversation that has been narrated that i desire out of fraternal benevolence to procure for eugenia the amusement of a flirtationor as he probably calls it an intriguewith the too susceptible clifford it must be admittedand i have noticed it beforethat nothing exceeds the license occasionally taken by the imagination of very rigid people felix on his own side had of course said nothing to clifford but he had observed to eugenia that mr wentworth was much mortified at his sons low tastes we ought to do something to help them after all their kindness to us he had added encourage clifford to come and see you and inspire him with a taste for conversation that will supplant the other which only comes from his puerility from his not taking his position in the worldthat of a rich young man of ancient stockseriously enough make him a little more serious even if he makes love to you it is no great matter  i am to offer myself as a superior form of intoxicationa substitute for a brandy bottle eh asked the baroness truly in this country one comes to strange uses  but she had not positively declined to undertake cliffords higher education and felix who had not thought of the matter again being haunted with visions of more personal profit now reflected that the work of redemption had fairly begun the idea in prospect had seemed of the happiest but in operation it made him a trifle uneasy what if eugeniawhat if eugeniahe asked himself softly the question dying away in his sense of eugenias undetermined capacity but before felix had time either to accept or to reject its admonition even in this vague form he saw robert acton turn out of mr wentworths inclosure by a distant gate and come toward the cottage in the orchard acton had evidently walked from his own house along a shady byway and was intending to pay a visit to madame munster felix watched him a moment then he turned away acton could be left to play the part of providence and interruptif interruption were neededcliffords entanglement with eugenia  felix passed through the garden toward the house and toward a postern gate which opened upon a path leading across the fields beside a little wood to the lake he stopped and looked up at the house his eyes rested more particularly upon a certain open window on the shady side presently gertrude appeared there looking out into the summer light he took off his hat to her and bade her goodday he remarked that he was going to row across the pond and begged that she would do him the honor to accompany him she looked at him a moment then without saying anything she turned away but she soon reappeared below in one of those quaint and charming leghorn hats tied with white satin bows that were worn at that period she also carried a green parasol she went with him to the edge of the lake where a couple of boats were always moored they got into one of them and felix with gentle strokes propelled it to the opposite shore the day was the perfection of summer weather the little lake was the color of sunshine the plash of the oars was the only sound and they found themselves listening to it they disembarked and by a winding path ascended the pinecrested mound which overlooked the water whose white expanse glittered between the trees the place was delightfully cool and had the added charm thatin the softly sounding pine boughsyou seemed to hear the coolness as well as feel it felix and gertrude sat down on the rustcolored carpet of pineneedles and talked of many things felix spoke at last in the course of talk of his going away it was the first time he had alluded to it  you are going away said gertrude looking at him  some daywhen the leaves begin to fall you know i cant stay forever  gertrude transferred her eyes to the outer prospect and then after a pause she said i shall never see you again  why not asked felix we shall probably both survive my departure  but gertrude only repeated i shall never see you again i shall never hear of you she went on i shall know nothing about you i knew nothing about you before and it will be the same again  i knew nothing about you then unfortunately said felix but now i shall write to you  dont write to me i shall not answer you gertrude declared  i should of course burn your letters said felix  gertrude looked at him again burn my letters you sometimes say strange things  they are not strange in themselves the young man answered they are only strange as said to you you will come to europe  with whom shall i come she asked this question simply she was very much in earnest felix was interested in her earnestness for some moments he hesitated you cant tell me that she pursued you cant say that i shall go with my father and my sister you dont believe that  i shall keep your letters said felix presently for all answer  i never write i dont know how to write gertrude for some time said nothing more and her companion as he looked at her wished it had not been disloyal to make love to the daughter of an old gentleman who had offered one hospitality the afternoon waned the shadows stretched themselves and the light grew deeper in the western sky two persons appeared on the opposite side of the lake coming from the house and crossing the meadow it is charlotte and mr brand said gertrude they are coming over here but charlotte and mr brand only came down to the edge of the water and stood there looking across they made no motion to enter the boat that felix had left at the mooringplace felix waved his hat to them it was too far to call they made no visible response and they presently turned away and walked along the shore  mr brand is not demonstrative said felix he is never demonstrative to me he sits silent with his chin in his hand looking at me sometimes he looks away your father tells me he is so eloquent and i should like to hear him talk he looks like such a noble young man but with me he will never talk and yet i am so fond of listening to brilliant imagery  he is very eloquent said gertrude but he has no brilliant imagery i have heard him talk a great deal i knew that when they saw us they would not come over here  ah he is making la cour as they say to your sister they desire to be alone  no said gertrude gravely they have no such reason as that for being alone  but why does nt he make la cour to charlotte felix inquired she is so pretty so gentle so good  gertrude glanced at him and then she looked at the distantlyseen couple they were discussing mr brand and charlotte were walking side by side they might have been a pair of lovers and yet they might not they think i should not be here said gertrude  with me i thought you did nt have those ideas  you dont understand there are a great many things you dont understand  i understand my stupidity but why then do not charlotte and mr brand who as an elder sister and a clergyman are free to walk about together come over and make me wiser by breaking up the unlawful interview into which i have lured you  that is the last thing they would do said gertrude  felix stared at her a moment with his lifted eyebrows je ny comprends rien he exclaimed then his eyes followed for a while the retreating figures of this critical pair you may say what you please he declared it is evident to me that your sister is not indifferent to her clever companion it is agreeable to her to be walking there with him i can see that from here and in the excitement of observation felix rose to his feet  gertrude rose also but she made no attempt to emulate her companions discovery she looked rather in another direction felixs words had struck her but a certain delicacy checked her she is certainly not indifferent to mr brand she has the highest opinion of him  one can see itone can see it said felix in a tone of amused contemplation with his head on one side gertrude turned her back to the opposite shore it was disagreeable to her to look but she hoped felix would say something more ah they have wandered away into the wood he added  gertrude turned round again she is not in love with him she said it seemed her duty to say that  then he is in love with her or if he is not he ought to be she is such a perfect little woman of her kind she reminds me of a pair of oldfashioned silver sugartongs you know i am very fond of sugar and she is very nice with mr brand i have noticed that very gentle and gracious  gertrude reflected a moment then she took a great resolution she wants him to marry me she said so of course she is nice  felixs eyebrows rose higher than ever to marry you ah ah this is interesting and you think one must be very nice with a man to induce him to do that  gertrude had turned a little pale but she went on mr brand wants it himself  felix folded his arms and stood looking at her i seei see he said quickly why did you never tell me this before  it is disagreeable to me to speak of it even now i wished simply to explain to you about charlotte  you dont wish to marry mr brand then  no said gertrude gravely  and does your father wish it  very much  and you dont like himyou have refused him  i dont wish to marry him  your father and sister think you ought to eh  it is a long story said gertrude they think there are good reasons i cant explain it they think i have obligations and that i have encouraged him  felix smiled at her as if she had been telling him an amusing story about some one else i cant tell you how this interests me he said now you dont recognize these reasonsthese obligations  i am not sure it is not easy and she picked up her parasol and turned away as if to descend the slope  tell me this felix went on going with her are you likely to give into let them persuade you  gertrude looked at him with the serious face that she had constantly worn in opposition to his almost eager smile i shall never marry mr brand she said  i see felix rejoined and they slowly descended the hill together saying nothing till they reached the margin of the pond it is your own affair he then resumed but do you know i am not altogether glad if it were settled that you were to marry mr brand i should take a certain comfort in the arrangement i should feel more free i have no right to make love to you myself eh and he paused lightly pressing his argument upon her  none whatever replied gertrude quicklytoo quickly  your father would never hear of it i have nt a penny mr brand of course has property of his own eh  i believe he has some property but that has nothing to do with it  with you of course not but with your father and sister it must have so as i say if this were settled i should feel more at liberty  more at liberty gertrude repeated please unfasten the boat  felix untwisted the rope and stood holding it i should be able to say things to you that i cant give myself the pleasure of saying now he went on i could tell you how much i admire you without seeming to pretend to that which i have no right to pretend to i should make violent love to you he added laughing if i thought you were so placed as not to be offended by it  you mean if i were engaged to another man that is strange reasoning gertrude exclaimed  in that case you would not take me seriously  i take every one seriously said gertrude and without his help she stepped lightly into the boat  felix took up the oars and sent it forward ah this is what you have been thinking about it seemed to me you had something on your mind i wish very much he added that you would tell me some of these socalled reasonsthese obligations  they are not real reasonsgood reasons said gertrude looking at the pink and yellow gleams in the water  i can understand that because a handsome girl has had a spark of coquetry that is no reason  if you mean me it s not that i have not done that  it is something that troubles you at any rate said felix  not so much as it used to gertrude rejoined  he looked at her smiling always that is not saying much eh but she only rested her eyes very gravely on the lighted water she seemed to him to be trying to hide the signs of the trouble of which she had just told him felix felt at all times much the same impulse to dissipate visible melancholy that a good housewife feels to brush away dust there was something he wished to brush away now suddenly he stopped rowing and poised his oars why should mr brand have addressed himself to you and not to your sister he asked i am sure she would listen to him  gertrude in her family was thought capable of a good deal of levity but her levity had never gone so far as this it moved her greatly however to hear felix say that he was sure of something so that raising her eyes toward him she tried intently for some moments to conjure up this wonderful image of a loveaffair between her own sister and her own suitor we know that gertrude had an imaginative mind so that it is not impossible that this effort should have been partially successful but she only murmured ah felix ah felix  why should nt they marry try and make them marry cried felix  try and make them  turn the tables on them then they will leave you alone i will help you as far as i can  gertrudes heart began to beat she was greatly excited she had never had anything so interesting proposed to her before felix had begun to row again and he now sent the boat home with long strokes i believe she does care for him said gertrude after they had disembarked  of course she does and we will marry them off it will make them happy it will make every one happy we shall have a wedding and i will write an epithalamium  it seems as if it would make me happy said gertrude  to get rid of mr brand eh to recover your liberty  gertrude walked on to see my sister married to so good a man  felix gave his light laugh you always put things on those grounds you will never say anything for yourself you are all so afraid here of being selfish i dont think you know how he went on let me show you it will make me happy for myself and for just the reverse of what i told you a while ago after that when i make love to you you will have to think i mean it  i shall never think you mean anything said gertrude you are too fantastic  ah cried felix that s a license to say everything gertrude i adore you       chapter viii  charlotte and mr brand had not returned when they reached the house but the baroness had come to tea and robert acton also who now regularly asked for a place at this generous repast or made his appearance later in the evening clifford wentworth with his juvenile growl remarked upon it  you are always coming to tea nowadays robert he said i should think you had drunk enough tea in china  since when is mr acton more frequent asked the baroness  since you came said clifford it seems as if you were a kind of attraction  i suppose i am a curiosity said the baroness give me time and i will make you a salon  it would fall to pieces after you go exclaimed acton  dont talk about her going in that familiar way clifford said it makes me feel gloomy  mr wentworth glanced at his son and taking note of these words wondered if felix had been teaching him according to the programme he had sketched out to make love to the wife of a german prince  charlotte came in late with mr brand but gertrude to whom at least felix had taught something looked in vain in her face for the traces of a guilty passion mr brand sat down by gertrude and she presently asked him why they had not crossed the pond to join felix and herself  it is cruel of you to ask me that he answered very softly he had a large morsel of cake before him but he fingered it without eating it i sometimes think you are growing cruel he added  gertrude said nothing she was afraid to speak there was a kind of rage in her heart she felt as if she could easily persuade herself that she was persecuted she said to herself that it was quite right that she should not allow him to make her believe she was wrong she thought of what felix had said to her she wished indeed mr brand would marry charlotte she looked away from him and spoke no more mr brand ended by eating his cake while felix sat opposite describing to mr wentworth the students duels at heidelberg after tea they all dispersed themselves as usual upon the piazza and in the garden and mr brand drew near to gertrude again  i did nt come to you this afternoon because you were not alone he began because you were with a newer friend  felix he is an old friend by this time  mr brand looked at the ground for some moments i thought i was prepared to hear you speak in that way he resumed but i find it very painful  i dont see what else i can say said gertrude  mr brand walked beside her for a while in silence gertrude wished he would go away he is certainly very accomplished but i think i ought to advise you  to advise me  i think i know your nature  i think you dont said gertrude with a soft laugh  you make yourself out worse than you areto please him mr brand said gently  worseto please him what do you mean asked gertrude stopping  mr brand stopped also and with the same soft straightforwardness he does nt care for the things you care forthe great questions of life  gertrude with her eyes on his shook her head i dont care for the great questions of life they are much beyond me  there was a time when you did nt say that said mr brand  oh rejoined gertrude i think you made me talk a great deal of nonsense and it depends she added upon what you call the great questions of life there are some things i care for  are they the things you talk about with your cousin  you should not say things to me against my cousin mr brand said gertrude that is dishonorable  he listened to this respectfully then he answered with a little vibration of the voice i should be very sorry to do anything dishonorable but i dont see why it is dishonorable to say that your cousin is frivolous  go and say it to himself  i think he would admit it said mr brand that is the tone he would take he would not be ashamed of it  then i am not ashamed of it gertrude declared that is probably what i like him for i am frivolous myself  you are trying as i said just now to lower yourself  i am trying for once to be natural cried gertrude passionately i have been pretending all my life i have been dishonest it is you that have made me so mr brand stood gazing at her and she went on why should nt i be frivolous if i want one has a right to be frivolous if it s ones nature no i dont care for the great questions i care for pleasurefor amusement perhaps i am fond of wicked things it is very possible  mr brand remained staring he was even a little pale as if he had been frightened i dont think you know what you are saying he exclaimed  perhaps not perhaps i am talking nonsense but it is only with you that i talk nonsense i never do so with my cousin  i will speak to you again when you are less excited said mr brand  i am always excited when you speak to me i must tell you thateven if it prevents you altogether in future your speaking to me irritates me with my cousin it is very different that seems quiet and natural  he looked at her and then he looked away with a kind of helpless distress at the dusky garden and the faint summer stars after which suddenly turning back gertrude gertrude he softly groaned am i really losing you  she was touchedshe was pained but it had already occurred to her that she might do something better than say so it would not have alleviated her companions distress to perceive just then whence she had sympathetically borrowed this ingenuity i am not sorry for you gertrude said for in paying so much attention to me you are following a shadowyou are wasting something precious there is something else you might have that you dont look atsomething better than i am that is a reality and then with intention she looked at him and tried to smile a little he thought this smile of hers very strange but she turned away and left him  she wandered about alone in the garden wondering what mr brand would make of her words which it had been a singular pleasure for her to utter shortly after passing in front of the house she saw at a distance two persons standing near the garden gate it was mr brand going away and bidding goodnight to charlotte who had walked down with him from the house gertrude saw that the parting was prolonged then she turned her back upon it she had not gone very far however when she heard her sister slowly following her she neither turned round nor waited for her she knew what charlotte was going to say charlotte who at last overtook her in fact presently began she had passed her arm into gertrudes  will you listen to me dear if i say something very particular  i know what you are going to say said gertrude mr brand feels very badly  oh gertrude how can you treat him so charlotte demanded and as her sister made no answer she added after all he has done for you  what has he done for me  i wonder you can ask gertrude he has helped you so you told me so yourself a great many times you told me that he helped you to struggle with youryour peculiarities you told me that he had taught you how to govern your temper  for a moment gertrude said nothing then was my temper very bad she asked  i am not accusing you gertrude said charlotte  what are you doing then her sister demanded with a short laugh  i am pleading for mr brandreminding you of all you owe him  i have given it all back said gertrude still with her little laugh he can take back the virtue he imparted i want to be wicked again  her sister made her stop in the path and fixed upon her in the darkness a sweet reproachful gaze if you talk this way i shall almost believe it think of all we owe mr brand think of how he has always expected something of you think how much he has been to us think of his beautiful influence upon clifford  he is very good said gertrude looking at her sister i know he is very good but he should nt speak against felix  felix is good charlotte answered softly but promptly felix is very wonderful only he is so different mr brand is much nearer to us i should never think of going to felix with a troublewith a question mr brand is much more to us gertrude  he is veryvery good gertrude repeated he is more to you yes much more charlotte she added suddenly you are in love with him  oh gertrude cried poor charlotte and her sister saw her blushing in the darkness  gertrude put her arm round her i wish he would marry you she went on  charlotte shook herself free you must not say such things she exclaimed beneath her breath  you like him more than you say and he likes you more than he knows  this is very cruel of you charlotte wentworth murmured  but if it was cruel gertrude continued pitiless not if it s true she answered i wish he would marry you  please dont say that  i mean to tell him so said gertrude  oh gertrude gertrude her sister almost moaned  yes if he speaks to me again about myself i will say why dont you marry charlotte she s a thousand times better than i  you are wicked you are changed cried her sister  if you dont like it you can prevent it said gertrude you can prevent it by keeping him from speaking to me and with this she walked away very conscious of what she had done measuring it and finding a certain joy and a quickened sense of freedom in it  mr wentworth was rather wide of the mark in suspecting that clifford had begun to pay unscrupulous compliments to his brilliant cousin for the young man had really more scruples than he received credit for in his family he had a certain transparent shamefacedness which was in itself a proof that he was not at his ease in dissipation his collegiate peccadilloes had aroused a domestic murmur as disagreeable to the young man as the creaking of his boots would have been to a housebreaker only as the housebreaker would have simplified matters by removing his chaussures it had seemed to clifford that the shortest cut to comfortable relations with peoplerelations which should make him cease to think that when they spoke to him they meant something improvingwas to renounce all ambition toward a nefarious development and in fact cliffords ambition took the most commendable form he thought of himself in the future as the wellknown and muchliked mr wentworth of boston who should in the natural course of prosperity have married his pretty cousin lizzie acton should live in a widefronted house in view of the common and should drive behind a light wagon over the damp autumn roads a pair of beautifully matched sorrel horses cliffords vision of the coming years was very simple its most definite features were this element of familiar matrimony and the duplication of his resources for trotting he had not yet asked his cousin to marry him but he meant to do so as soon as he had taken his degree lizzie was serenely conscious of his intention and she had made up her mind that he would improve her brother who was very fond of this light quick competent little lizzie saw on his side no reason to interpose it seemed to him a graceful social law that clifford and his sister should become engaged he himself was not engaged but every one else fortunately was not such a fool as he he was fond of clifford as well and had his own wayof which it must be confessed he was a little ashamedof looking at those aberrations which had led to the young mans compulsory retirement from the neighboring seat of learning acton had seen the world as he said to himself he had been to china and had knocked about among men he had learned the essential difference between a nice young fellow and a mean young fellow and was satisfied that there was no harm in clifford he believedalthough it must be added that he had not quite the courage to declare itin the doctrine of wild oats and thought it a useful preventive of superfluous fears if mr wentworth and charlotte and mr brand would only apply it in cliffords case they would be happier and acton thought it a pity they should not be happier they took the boys misdemeanors too much to heart they talked to him too solemnly they frightened and bewildered him of course there was the great standard of morality which forbade that a man should get tipsy play at billiards for money or cultivate his sensual consciousness but what fear was there that poor clifford was going to run a tilt at any great standard it had however never occurred to acton to dedicate the baroness munster to the redemption of a refractory collegian the instrument here would have seemed to him quite too complex for the operation felix on the other hand had spoken in obedience to the belief that the more charming a woman is the more numerous literally are her definite social uses  eugenia herself as we know had plenty of leisure to enumerate her uses as i have had the honor of intimating she had come four thousand miles to seek her fortune and it is not to be supposed that after this great effort she could neglect any apparent aid to advancement it is my misfortune that in attempting to describe in a short compass the deportment of this remarkable woman i am obliged to express things rather brutally i feel this to be the case for instance when i say that she had primarily detected such an aid to advancement in the person of robert acton but that she had afterwards remembered that a prudent archer has always a second bowstring eugenia was a woman of finelymingled motive and her intentions were never sensibly gross she had a sort of aesthetic ideal for clifford which seemed to her a disinterested reason for taking him in hand it was very well for a freshcolored young gentleman to be ingenuous but clifford really was crude with such a pretty face he ought to have prettier manners she would teach him that with a beautiful name the expectation of a large property and as they said in europe a social position an only son should know how to carry himself  once clifford had begun to come and see her by himself and for himself he came very often he hardly knew why he should come he saw her almost every evening at his fathers house he had nothing particular to say to her she was not a young girl and fellows of his age called only upon young girls he exaggerated her age she seemed to him an old woman it was happy that the baroness with all her intelligence was incapable of guessing this but gradually it struck clifford that visiting old women might be if not a natural at least as they say of some articles of diet an acquired taste the baroness was certainly a very amusing old woman she talked to him as no ladyand indeed no gentlemanhad ever talked to him before  you should go to europe and make the tour she said to him one afternoon of course on leaving college you will go  i dont want to go clifford declared i know some fellows who have been to europe they say you can have better fun here  that depends it depends upon your idea of fun your friends probably were not introduced  introduced clifford demanded  they had no opportunity of going into society they formed no relations this was one of a certain number of words that the baroness often pronounced in the french manner  they went to a ball in paris i know that said clifford  ah there are balls and balls especially in paris no you must go you know it is not a thing from which you can dispense yourself you need it  oh i m very well said clifford i m not sick  i dont mean for your health my poor child i mean for your manners  i have nt got any manners growled clifford  precisely you dont mind my assenting to that eh asked the baroness with a smile you must go to europe and get a few you can get them better there it is a pity you might not have come while i was living inin germany i would have introduced you i had a charming little circle you would perhaps have been rather young but the younger one begins i think the better now at any rate you have no time to lose and when i return you must immediately come to me  all this to cliffords apprehension was a great mixturehis beginning young eugenias return to europe his being introduced to her charming little circle what was he to begin and what was her little circle his ideas about her marriage had a good deal of vagueness but they were in so far definite as that he felt it to be a matter not to be freely mentioned he sat and looked all round the room he supposed she was alluding in some way to her marriage  oh i dont want to go to germany he said it seemed to him the most convenient thing to say  she looked at him a while smiling with her lips but not with her eyes  you have scruples she asked  scruples said clifford  you young people here are very singular one does nt know where to expect you when you are not extremely improper you are so terribly proper i dare say you think that owing to my irregular marriage i live with loose people you were never more mistaken i have been all the more particular  oh no said clifford honestly distressed i never thought such a thing as that  are you very sure i am convinced that your father does and your sisters they say to each other that here i am on my good behavior but that over theremarried by the left handi associate with light women  oh no cried clifford energetically they dont say such things as that to each other  if they think them they had better say them the baroness rejoined then they can be contradicted please contradict that whenever you hear it and dont be afraid of coming to see me on account of the company i keep i have the honor of knowing more distinguished men my poor child than you are likely to see in a lifetime i see very few women but those are women of rank so my dear young puritan you need nt be afraid i am not in the least one of those who think that the society of women who have lost their place in the vrai monde is necessary to form a young man i have never taken that tone i have kept my place myself and i think we are a much better school than the others trust me clifford and i will prove that to you the baroness continued while she made the agreeable reflection that she could not at least be accused of perverting her young kinsman so if you ever fall among thieves dont go about saying i sent you to them  clifford thought it so comical that he should knowin spite of her figurative languagewhat she meant and that she should mean what he knew that he could hardly help laughing a little although he tried hard oh no oh no he murmured  laugh out laugh out if i amuse you cried the baroness i am here for that and clifford thought her a very amusing person indeed but remember she said on this occasion that you are comingnext yearto pay me a visit over there  about a week afterwards she said to him pointblank are you seriously making love to your little cousin  seriously making lovethese words on madame munsters lips had to cliffords sense a portentous and embarrassing sound he hesitated about assenting lest he should commit himself to more than he understood well i should nt say it if i was he exclaimed  why would nt you say it the baroness demanded those things ought to be known  i dont care whether it is known or not clifford rejoined but i dont want people looking at me  a young man of your importance ought to learn to bear observationto carry himself as if he were quite indifferent to it i wont say exactly unconscious the baroness explained no he must seem to know he is observed and to think it natural he should be but he must appear perfectly used to it now you have nt that clifford you have nt that at all you must have that you know dont tell me you are not a young man of importance eugenia added dont say anything so flat as that  oh no you dont catch me saying that cried clifford  yes you must come to germany madame munster continued i will show you how people can be talked about and yet not seem to know it you will be talked about of course with me it will be said you are my lover i will show you how little one may mind thathow little i shall mind it  clifford sat staring blushing and laughing i shall mind it a good deal he declared  ah not too much you know that would be uncivil but i give you leave to mind it a little especially if you have a passion for miss acton voyons as regards that you either have or you have not it is very simple to say it  i dont see why you want to know said clifford  you ought to want me to know if one is arranging a marriage one tells ones friends  oh i m not arranging anything said clifford  you dont intend to marry your cousin  well i expect i shall do as i choose  the baroness leaned her head upon the back of her chair and closed her eyes as if she were tired then opening them again your cousin is very charming she said  she is the prettiest girl in this place clifford rejoined  in this place is saying little she would be charming anywhere i am afraid you are entangled  oh no i m not entangled  are you engaged at your age that is the same thing  clifford looked at the baroness with some audacity will you tell no one  if it s as sacred as thatno  well thenwe are not said clifford  that s the great secretthat you are not eh asked the baroness with a quick laugh i am very glad to hear it you are altogether too young a young man in your position must choose and compare he must see the world first depend upon it she added you should not settle that matter before you have come abroad and paid me that visit there are several things i should like to call your attention to first  well i am rather afraid of that visit said clifford it seems to me it will be rather like going to school again  the baroness looked at him a moment  my dear child she said there is no agreeable man who has not at some moment been to school to a clever womanprobably a little older than himself and you must be thankful when you get your instructions gratis with me you would get it gratis  the next day clifford told lizzie acton that the baroness thought her the most charming girl she had ever seen  lizzie shook her head no she does nt she said  do you think everything she says asked clifford is to be taken the opposite way  i think that is said lizzie  clifford was going to remark that in this case the baroness must desire greatly to bring about a marriage between mr clifford wentworth and miss elizabeth acton but he resolved on the whole to suppress this observation       chapter ix  it seemed to robert acton after eugenia had come to his house that something had passed between them which made them a good deal more intimate it was hard to say exactly what except her telling him that she had taken her resolution with regard to the prince adolf for madame munsters visit had made no difference in their relations he came to see her very often but he had come to see her very often before it was agreeable to him to find himself in her little drawingroom but this was not a new discovery there was a change however in this sense that if the baroness had been a great deal in actons thoughts before she was now never out of them from the first she had been personally fascinating but the fascination now had become intellectual as well he was constantly pondering her words and motions they were as interesting as the factors in an algebraic problem this is saying a good deal for acton was extremely fond of mathematics he asked himself whether it could be that he was in love with her and then hoped he was not hoped it not so much for his own sake as for that of the amatory passion itself if this was love love had been overrated love was a poetic impulse and his own state of feeling with regard to the baroness was largely characterized by that eminently prosaic sentimentcuriosity it was true as acton with his quietly cogitative habit observed to himself that curiosity pushed to a given point might become a romantic passion and he certainly thought enough about this charming woman to make him restless and even a little melancholy it puzzled and vexed him at times to feel that he was not more ardent he was not in the least bent upon remaining a bachelor in his younger years he had beenor he had tried to beof the opinion that it would be a good deal jollier not to marry and he had flattered himself that his single condition was something of a citadel it was a citadel at all events of which he had long since leveled the outworks he had removed the guns from the ramparts he had lowered the drawbridge across the moat the drawbridge had swayed lightly under madame munsters step why should he not cause it to be raised again so that she might be kept prisoner he had an idea that she would becomein time at least and on learning the conveniences of the place for making a lady comfortablea tolerably patient captive but the drawbridge was never raised and actons brilliant visitor was as free to depart as she had been to come it was part of his curiosity to know why the deuce so susceptible a man was not in love with so charming a woman if her various graces were as i have said the factors in an algebraic problem the answer to this question was the indispensable unknown quantity the pursuit of the unknown quantity was extremely absorbing for the present it taxed all actons faculties  toward the middle of august he was obliged to leave home for some days an old friend with whom he had been associated in china had begged him to come to newport where he lay extremely ill his friend got better and at the end of a week acton was released i use the word released advisedly for in spite of his attachment to his chinese comrade he had been but a halfhearted visitor he felt as if he had been called away from the theatre during the progress of a remarkably interesting drama the curtain was up all this time and he was losing the fourth act that fourth act which would have been so essential to a just appreciation of the fifth in other words he was thinking about the baroness who seen at this distance seemed a truly brilliant figure he saw at newport a great many pretty women who certainly were figures as brilliant as beautiful light dresses could make them but though they talked a great dealand the baronesss strong point was perhaps also her conversationmadame munster appeared to lose nothing by the comparison he wished she had come to newport too would it not be possible to make up as they said a party for visiting the famous wateringplace and invite eugenia to join it it was true that the complete satisfaction would be to spend a fortnight at newport with eugenia alone it would be a great pleasure to see her in society carry everything before her as he was sure she would do when acton caught himself thinking these thoughts he began to walk up and down with his hands in his pockets frowning a little and looking at the floor what did it provefor it certainly proved somethingthis lively disposition to be off somewhere with madame munster away from all the rest of them such a vision certainly seemed a refined implication of matrimony after the baroness should have formally got rid of her informal husband at any rate acton with his characteristic discretion forbore to give expression to whatever else it might imply and the narrator of these incidents is not obliged to be more definite  he returned home rapidly and arriving in the afternoon lost as little time as possible in joining the familiar circle at mr wentworths on reaching the house however he found the piazzas empty the doors and windows were open and their emptiness was made clear by the shafts of lamplight from the parlors entering the house he found mr wentworth sitting alone in one of these apartments engaged in the perusal of the north american review after they had exchanged greetings and his cousin had made discreet inquiry about his journey acton asked what had become of mr wentworths companions  they are scattered about amusing themselves as usual said the old man i saw charlotte a short time since seated with mr brand upon the piazza they were conversing with their customary animation i suppose they have joined her sister who for the hundredth time was doing the honors of the garden to her foreign cousin  i suppose you mean felix said acton and on mr wentworths assenting he said and the others  your sister has not come this evening you must have seen her at home said mr wentworth  yes i proposed to her to come she declined  lizzie i suppose was expecting a visitor said the old man with a kind of solemn slyness  if she was expecting clifford he had not turned up  mr wentworth at this intelligence closed the north american review and remarked that he had understood clifford to say that he was going to see his cousin privately he reflected that if lizzie acton had had no news of his son clifford must have gone to boston for the evening an unnatural course of a summer night especially when accompanied with disingenuous representations  you must remember that he has two cousins said acton laughing and then coming to the point if lizzie is not here he added neither apparently is the baroness  mr wentworth stared a moment and remembered that queer proposition of felixs for a moment he did not know whether it was not to be wished that clifford after all might have gone to boston the baroness has not honored us tonight he said she has not come over for three days  is she ill acton asked  no i have been to see her  what is the matter with her  well said mr wentworth i infer she has tired of us  acton pretended to sit down but he was restless he found it impossible to talk with mr wentworth at the end of ten minutes he took up his hat and said that he thought he would go off it was very late it was ten oclock  his quietfaced kinsman looked at him a moment are you going home he asked  acton hesitated and then answered that he had proposed to go over and take a look at the baroness  well you are honest at least said mr wentworth sadly  so are you if you come to that cried acton laughing why should nt i be honest  the old man opened the north american again and read a few lines if we have ever had any virtue among us we had better keep hold of it now he said he was not quoting  we have a baroness among us said acton that s what we must keep hold of he was too impatient to see madame munster again to wonder what mr wentworth was talking about nevertheless after he had passed out of the house and traversed the garden and the little piece of road that separated him from eugenias provisional residence he stopped a moment outside he stood in her little garden the long window of her parlor was open and he could see the white curtains with the lamplight shining through them swaying softly to and fro in the warm night wind there was a sort of excitement in the idea of seeing madame munster again he became aware that his heart was beating rather faster than usual it was this that made him stop with a halfamused surprise but in a moment he went along the piazza and approaching the open window tapped upon its lintel with his stick he could see the baroness within she was standing in the middle of the room she came to the window and pulled aside the curtain then she stood looking at him a moment she was not smiling she seemed serious  mais entrez donc she said at last acton passed in across the windowsill he wondered for an instant what was the matter with her but the next moment she had begun to smile and had put out her hand better late than never she said it is very kind of you to come at this hour  i have just returned from my journey said acton  ah very kind very kind she repeated looking about her where to sit  i went first to the other house acton continued i expected to find you there  she had sunk into her usual chair but she got up again and began to move about the room acton had laid down his hat and stick he was looking at her conscious that there was in fact a great charm in seeing her again i dont know whether i ought to tell you to sit down she said it is too late to begin a visit  it s too early to end one acton declared and we need nt mind the beginning  she looked at him again and after a moment dropped once more into her low chair while he took a place near her we are in the middle then she asked was that where we were when you went away no i have nt been to the other house  not yesterday nor the day before eh  i dont know how many days it is  you are tired of it said acton  she leaned back in her chair her arms were folded that is a terrible accusation but i have not the courage to defend myself  i am not attacking you said acton i expected something of this kind  it s a proof of extreme intelligence i hope you enjoyed your journey  not at all acton declared i would much rather have been here with you  now you are attacking me said the baroness you are contrasting my inconstancy with your own fidelity  i confess i never get tired of people i like  ah you are not a poor wicked foreign woman with irritable nerves and a sophisticated mind  something has happened to you since i went away said acton changing his place  your going awaythat is what has happened to me  do you mean to say that you have missed me he asked  if i had meant to say it it would not be worth your making a note of i am very dishonest and my compliments are worthless  acton was silent for some moments you have broken down he said at last  madame munster left her chair and began to move about  only for a moment i shall pull myself together again  you had better not take it too hard if you are bored you need nt be afraid to say soto me at least  you should nt say such things as that the baroness answered you should encourage me  i admire your patience that is encouraging  you should nt even say that when you talk of my patience you are disloyal to your own people patience implies suffering and what have i had to suffer  oh not hunger not unkindness certainly said acton laughing nevertheless we all admire your patience  you all detest me cried the baroness with a sudden vehemence turning her back toward him  you make it hard said acton getting up for a man to say something tender to you this evening there was something particularly striking and touching about her an unwonted softness and a look of suppressed emotion he felt himself suddenly appreciating the fact that she had behaved very well she had come to this quiet corner of the world under the weight of a cruel indignity and she had been so gracefully modestly thankful for the rest she found there she had joined that simple circle over the way she had mingled in its plain provincial talk she had shared its meagre and savorless pleasures she had set herself a task and she had rigidly performed it she had conformed to the angular conditions of new england life and she had had the tact and pluck to carry it off as if she liked them acton felt a more downright need than he had ever felt before to tell her that he admired her and that she struck him as a very superior woman all along hitherto he had been on his guard with her he had been cautious observant suspicious but now a certain light tumult in his blood seemed to tell him that a finer degree of confidence in this charming woman would be its own reward we dont detest you he went on i dont know what you mean at any rate i speak for myself i dont know anything about the others very likely you detest them for the dull life they make you lead really it would give me a sort of pleasure to hear you say so  eugenia had been looking at the door on the other side of the room now she slowly turned her eyes toward robert acton what can be the motive she asked of a man like youan honest man a galant hommein saying so base a thing as that  does it sound very base asked acton candidly i suppose it does and i thank you for telling me so of course i dont mean it literally  the baroness stood looking at him how do you mean it she asked  this question was difficult to answer and acton feeling the least bit foolish walked to the open window and looked out he stood there thinking a moment and then he turned back you know that document that you were to send to germany he said you called it your renunciation did you ever send it  madame munsters eyes expanded she looked very grave what a singular answer to my question  oh it is nt an answer said acton i have wished to ask you many times i thought it probable you would tell me yourself the question on my part seems abrupt now but it would be abrupt at any time  the baroness was silent a moment and then i think i have told you too much she said  this declaration appeared to acton to have a certain force he had indeed a sense of asking more of her than he offered her he returned to the window and watched for a moment a little star that twinkled through the lattice of the piazza there were at any rate offers enough he could make perhaps he had hitherto not been sufficiently explicit in doing so i wish you would ask something of me he presently said is there nothing i can do for you if you cant stand this dull life any more let me amuse you  the baroness had sunk once more into a chair and she had taken up a fan which she held with both hands to her mouth over the top of the fan her eyes were fixed on him you are very strange tonight she said with a little laugh  i will do anything in the world he rejoined standing in front of her should nt you like to travel about and see something of the country wont you go to niagara you ought to see niagara you know  with you do you mean  i should be delighted to take you  you alone  acton looked at her smiling and yet with a serious air well yes we might go alone he said  if you were not what you are she answered i should feel insulted  how do you meanwhat i am  if you were one of the gentlemen i have been used to all my life if you were not a queer bostonian  if the gentlemen you have been used to have taught you to expect insults said acton i am glad i am what i am you had much better come to niagara  if you wish to amuse me the baroness declared you need go to no further expense you amuse me very effectually  he sat down opposite to her she still held her fan up to her face with her eyes only showing above it there was a moments silence and then he said returning to his former question have you sent that document to germany  again there was a moments silence the expressive eyes of madame m auunster seemed however half to break it  i will tell youat niagara she said  she had hardly spoken when the door at the further end of the room openedthe door upon which some minutes previous eugenia had fixed her gaze clifford wentworth stood there blushing and looking rather awkward the baroness rose quickly and acton more slowly did the same clifford gave him no greeting he was looking at eugenia  ah you were here exclaimed acton  he was in felixs studio said madame munster he wanted to see his sketches  clifford looked at robert acton but said nothing he only fanned himself with his hat you chose a bad moment said acton you had nt much light  i had nt any said clifford laughing  your candle went out eugenia asked you should have come back here and lighted it again  clifford looked at her a moment so i havecome back but i have left the candle  eugenia turned away you are very stupid my poor boy you had better go home  well said clifford good night  have nt you a word to throw to a man when he has safely returned from a dangerous journey acton asked  how do you do said clifford i thoughti thought you wereand he paused looking at the baroness again  you thought i was at newport eh so i wasthis morning  good night clever child said madame munster over her shoulder  clifford stared at hernot at all like a clever child and then with one of his little facetious growls took his departure  what is the matter with him asked acton when he was gone he seemed rather in a muddle  eugenia who was near the window glanced out listening a moment the matterthe mattershe answered but you dont say such things here  if you mean that he had been drinking a little you can say that  he does nt drink any more i have cured him and in returnhe s in love with me  it was actons turn to stare he instantly thought of his sister but he said nothing about her he began to laugh i dont wonder at his passion but i wonder at his forsaking your society for that of your brothers paintbrushes  eugenia was silent a little he had not been in the studio i invented that at the moment  invented it for what purpose  he has an idea of being romantic he has adopted the habit of coming to see me at midnightpassing only through the orchard and through felixs paintingroom which has a door opening that way it seems to amuse him added eugenia with a little laugh  acton felt more surprise than he confessed to for this was a new view of clifford whose irregularities had hitherto been quite without the romantic element he tried to laugh again but he felt rather too serious and after a moments hesitation his seriousness explained itself i hope you dont encourage him he said he must not be inconstant to poor lizzie  to your sister  you know they are decidedly intimate said acton  ah cried eugenia smiling has shehas she  i dont know acton interrupted what she has but i always supposed that clifford had a desire to make himself agreeable to her  ah par exemple the baroness went on the little monster the next time he becomes sentimental i will him tell that he ought to be ashamed of himself  acton was silent a moment you had better say nothing about it  i had told him as much already on general grounds said the baroness but in this country you know the relations of young people are so extraordinary that one is quite at sea they are not engaged when you would quite say they ought to be take charlotte wentworth for instance and that young ecclesiastic if i were her father i should insist upon his marrying her but it appears to be thought there is no urgency on the other hand you suddenly learn that a boy of twenty and a little girl who is still with her governessyour sister has no governess well then who is never away from her mammaa young couple in short between whom you have noticed nothing beyond an exchange of the childish pleasantries characteristic of their age are on the point of setting up as man and wife the baroness spoke with a certain exaggerated volubility which was in contrast with the languid grace that had characterized her manner before clifford made his appearance it seemed to acton that there was a spark of irritation in her eyea note of irony as when she spoke of lizzie being never away from her mother in her voice if madame munster was irritated robert acton was vaguely mystified she began to move about the room again and he looked at her without saying anything presently she took out her watch and glancing at it declared that it was three oclock in the morning and that he must go  i have not been here an hour he said and they are still sitting up at the other house you can see the lights your brother has not come in  oh at the other house cried eugenia they are terrible people i dont know what they may do over there i am a quiet little humdrum woman i have rigid rules and i keep them one of them is not to have visitors in the small hoursespecially clever men like you so good night  decidedly the baroness was incisive and though acton bade her good night and departed he was still a good deal mystified  the next day clifford wentworth came to see lizzie and acton who was at home and saw him pass through the garden took note of the circumstance he had a natural desire to make it tally with madame m auunsters account of cliffords disaffection but his ingenuity finding itself unequal to the task resolved at last to ask help of the young mans candor he waited till he saw him going away and then he went out and overtook him in the grounds  i wish very much you would answer me a question acton said what were you doing last night at madame munsters  clifford began to laugh and to blush by no means like a young man with a romantic secret what did she tell you he asked  that is exactly what i dont want to say  well i want to tell you the same said clifford and unless i know it perhaps i cant  they had stopped in a garden path acton looked hard at his rosy young kinsman she said she could nt fancy what had got into you you appeared to have taken a violent dislike to her  clifford stared looking a little alarmed oh come he growled you dont mean that  and that whenfor common civilitys sakeyou came occasionally to the house you left her alone and spent your time in felixs studio under pretext of looking at his sketches  oh come growled clifford again  did you ever know me to tell an untruth  yes lots of them said clifford seeing an opening out of the discussion for his sarcastic powers well he presently added i thought you were my father  you knew some one was there  we heard you coming in  acton meditated you had been with the baroness then  i was in the parlor we heard your step outside i thought it was my father  and on that asked acton you ran away  she told me to goto go out by the studio  acton meditated more intensely if there had been a chair at hand he would have sat down why should she wish you not to meet your father  well said clifford father does nt like to see me there  acton looked askance at his companion and forbore to make any comment upon this assertion has he said so he asked to the baroness  well i hope not said clifford he has nt said soin so many wordsto me but i know it worries him and i want to stop worrying him the baroness knows it and she wants me to stop too  to stop coming to see her  i dont know about that but to stop worrying father eugenia knows everything clifford added with an air of knowingness of his own  ah said acton interrogatively eugenia knows everything  she knew it was not father coming in  then why did you go  clifford blushed and laughed afresh well i was afraid it was and besides she told me to go at any rate  did she think it was i acton asked  she did nt say so  again robert acton reflected but you did nt go he presently said you came back  i could nt get out of the studio clifford rejoined the door was locked and felix has nailed some planks across the lower half of the confounded windows to make the light come in from above so they were no use i waited there a good while and then suddenly i felt ashamed i did nt want to be hiding away from my own father i could nt stand it any longer i bolted out and when i found it was you i was a little flurried but eugenia carried it off did nt she clifford added in the tone of a young humorist whose perception had not been permanently clouded by the sense of his own discomfort  beautifully said acton especially he continued when one remembers that you were very imprudent and that she must have been a good deal annoyed  oh cried clifford with the indifference of a young man who feels that however he may have failed of felicity in behavior he is extremely just in his impressions eugenia does nt care for anything  acton hesitated a moment thank you for telling me this he said at last and then laying his hand on cliffords shoulder he added tell me one thing more are you by chance a little in love with the baroness  no sir said clifford almost shaking off his hand       chapter x  the first sunday that followed robert actons return from newport witnessed a change in the brilliant weather that had long prevailed the rain began to fall and the day was cold and dreary mr wentworth and his daughters put on overshoes and went to church and felix young without overshoes went also holding an umbrella over gertrude it is to be feared that in the whole observance this was the privilege he most highly valued the baroness remained at home she was in neither a cheerful nor a devotional mood she had however never been during her residence in the united states what is called a regular attendant at divine service and on this particular sunday morning of which i began with speaking she stood at the window of her little drawingroom watching the long arm of a rosetree that was attached to her piazza but a portion of which had disengaged itself sway to and fro shake and gesticulate against the dusky drizzle of the sky every now and then in a gust of wind the rosetree scattered a shower of waterdrops against the windowpane it appeared to have a kind of human movementa menacing warning intention the room was very cold madame munster put on a shawl and walked about then she determined to have some fire and summoning her ancient negress the contrast of whose polished ebony and whose crimson turban had been at first a source of satisfaction to her she made arrangements for the production of a crackling flame this old womans name was azarina the baroness had begun by thinking that there would be a savory wildness in her talk and for amusement she had encouraged her to chatter but azarina was dry and prim her conversation was anything but african she reminded eugenia of the tiresome old ladies she met in society she knew however how to make a fire so that after she had laid the logs eugenia who was terribly bored found a quarter of an hours entertainment in sitting and watching them blaze and sputter she had thought it very likely robert acton would come and see her she had not met him since that infelicitous evening but the morning waned without his coming several times she thought she heard his step on the piazza but it was only a windowshutter shaking in a raingust the baroness since the beginning of that episode in her career of which a slight sketch has been attempted in these pages had had many moments of irritation but today her irritation had a peculiar keenness it appeared to feed upon itself it urged her to do something but it suggested no particularly profitable line of action if she could have done something at the moment on the spot she would have stepped upon a european steamer and turned her back with a kind of rapture upon that profoundly mortifying failure her visit to her american relations it is not exactly apparent why she should have termed this enterprise a failure inasmuch as she had been treated with the highest distinction for which allowance had been made in american institutions her irritation came at bottom from the sense which always present had suddenly grown acute that the social soil on this big vague continent was somehow not adapted for growing those plants whose fragrance she especially inclined to inhale and by which she liked to see herself surroundeda species of vegetation for which she carried a collection of seedlings as we may say in her pocket she found her chief happiness in the sense of exerting a certain power and making a certain impression and now she felt the annoyance of a rather wearied swimmer who on nearing shore to land finds a smooth straight wall of rock when he had counted upon a clean firm beach her power in the american air seemed to have lost its prehensile attributes the smooth wall of rock was insurmountable surely je nen suis pas la she said to herself that i let it make me uncomfortable that a mr robert acton should nt honor me with a visit yet she was vexed that he had not come and she was vexed at her vexation  her brother at least came in stamping in the hall and shaking the wet from his coat in a moment he entered the room with a glow in his cheek and halfadozen raindrops glistening on his mustache ah you have a fire he said  les beaux jours sont passes replied the baroness  never never they have only begun felix declared planting himself before the hearth he turned his back to the fire placed his hands behind him extended his legs and looked away through the window with an expression of face which seemed to denote the perception of rosecolor even in the tints of a wet sunday  his sister from her chair looked up at him watching him and what she saw in his face was not grateful to her present mood she was puzzled by many things but her brothers disposition was a frequent source of wonder to her i say frequent and not constant for there were long periods during which she gave her attention to other problems sometimes she had said to herself that his happy temper his eternal gayety was an affectation a pose but she was vaguely conscious that during the present summer he had been a highly successful comedian they had never yet had an explanation she had not known the need of one felix was presumably following the bent of his disinterested genius and she felt that she had no advice to give him that he would understand with this there was always a certain element of comfort about felixthe assurance that he would not interfere he was very delicate this pureminded felix in effect he was her brother and madame munster felt that there was a great propriety every way in that it is true that felix was delicate he was not fond of explanations with his sister this was one of the very few things in the world about which he was uncomfortable but now he was not thinking of anything uncomfortable  dear brother said eugenia at last do stop making les yeux doux at the rain  with pleasure i will make them at you answered felix  how much longer asked eugenia in a moment do you propose to remain in this lovely spot  felix stared do you want to go awayalready  already is delicious i am not so happy as you  felix dropped into a chair looking at the fire the fact is i am happy he said in his light clear tone  and do you propose to spend your life in making love to gertrude wentworth  yes said felix smiling sidewise at his sister  the baroness returned his glance much more gravely and then do you like her she asked  dont you felix demanded  the baroness was silent a moment i will answer you in the words of the gentleman who was asked if he liked music je ne la crains pas  she admires you immensely said felix  i dont care for that other women should not admire one  they should dislike you  again madame munster hesitated they should hate me it s a measure of the time i have been losing here that they dont  no time is lost in which one has been happy said felix with a bright sententiousness which may well have been a little irritating  and in which rejoined his sister with a harsher laugh one has secured the affections of a young lady with a fortune  felix explained very candidly and seriously i have secured gertrudes affection but i am by no means sure that i have secured her fortune that may comeor it may not  ah well it may that s the great point  it depends upon her father he does nt smile upon our union you know he wants her to marry mr brand  i know nothing about it cried the baroness please to put on a log felix complied with her request and sat watching the quickening of the flame presently his sister added and you propose to elope with mademoiselle  by no means i dont wish to do anything that s disagreeable to mr wentworth he has been far too kind to us  but you must choose between pleasing yourself and pleasing him  i want to please every one exclaimed felix joyously i have a good conscience i made up my mind at the outset that it was not my place to make love to gertrude  so to simplify matters she made love to you  felix looked at his sister with sudden gravity you say you are not afraid of her he said but perhaps you ought to bea little she s a very clever person  i begin to see it cried the baroness her brother making no rejoinder leaned back in his chair and there was a long silence at last with an altered accent madame munster put another question you expect at any rate to marry  i shall be greatly disappointed if we dont  a disappointment or two will do you good the baroness declared and afterwards do you mean to turn american  it seems to me i am a very good american already but we shall go to europe gertrude wants extremely to see the world  ah like me when i came here said the baroness with a little laugh  no not like you felix rejoined looking at his sister with a certain gentle seriousness while he looked at her she rose from her chair and he also got up gertrude is not at all like you he went on but in her own way she is almost as clever he paused a moment his soul was full of an agreeable feeling and of a lively disposition to express it his sister to his spiritual vision was always like the lunar disk when only a part of it is lighted the shadow on this bright surface seemed to him to expand and to contract but whatever its proportions he always appreciated the moonlight he looked at the baroness and then he kissed her i am very much in love with gertrude he said eugenia turned away and walked about the room and felix continued she is very interesting and very different from what she seems she has never had a chance she is very brilliant we will go to europe and amuse ourselves  the baroness had gone to the window where she stood looking out the day was drearier than ever the rain was doggedly falling yes to amuse yourselves she said at last you had decidedly better go to europe then she turned round looking at her brother a chair stood near her she leaned her hands upon the back of it dont you think it is very good of me she asked to come all this way with you simply to see you properly marriedif properly it is  oh it will be properly cried felix with light eagerness  the baroness gave a little laugh you are thinking only of yourself and you dont answer my question while you are amusing yourselfwith the brilliant gertrudewhat shall i be doing  vous serez de la partie cried felix  thank you i should spoil it the baroness dropped her eyes for some moments do you propose however to leave me here she inquired  felix smiled at her my dearest sister where you are concerned i never propose i execute your commands  i believe said eugenia slowly that you are the most heartless person living dont you see that i am in trouble  i saw that you were not cheerful and i gave you some good news  well let me give you some news said the baroness you probably will not have discovered it for yourself robert acton wants to marry me  no i had not discovered that but i quite understand it why does it make you unhappy  because i cant decide  accept him accept him cried felix joyously he is the best fellow in the world  he is immensely in love with me said the baroness  and he has a large fortune permit me in turn to remind you of that  oh i am perfectly aware of it said eugenia that s a great item in his favor i am terribly candid and she left her place and came nearer her brother looking at him hard he was turning over several things she was wondering in what manner he really understood her  there were several ways of understanding her there was what she said and there was what she meant and there was something between the two that was neither it is probable that in the last analysis what she meant was that felix should spare her the necessity of stating the case more exactly and should hold himself commissioned to assist her by all honorable means to marry the best fellow in the world but in all this it was never discovered what felix understood  once you have your liberty what are your objections he asked  well i dont particularly like him  oh try a little  i am trying now said eugenia i should succeed better if he did nt live here i could never live here  make him go to europe felix suggested  ah there you speak of happiness based upon violent effort the baroness rejoined that is not what i am looking for he would never live in europe  he would live anywhere with you said felix gallantly  his sister looked at him still with a ray of penetration in her charming eyes then she turned away again you see at all events she presently went on that if it had been said of me that i had come over here to seek my fortune it would have to be added that i have found it  dont leave it lying urged felix with smiling solemnity  i am much obliged to you for your interest his sister declared after a moment but promise me one thing pas de zele if mr acton should ask you to plead his cause excuse yourself  i shall certainly have the excuse said felix that i have a cause of my own to plead  if he should talk of mefavorably eugenia continued warn him against dangerous illusions i detest importunities i want to decide at my leisure with my eyes open  i shall be discreet said felix except to you to you i will say accept him outright  she had advanced to the open doorway and she stood looking at him i will go and dress and think of it she said and he heard her moving slowly to her apartments  late in the afternoon the rain stopped and just afterwards there was a great flaming flickering trickling sunset felix sat in his paintingroom and did some work but at last as the light which had not been brilliant began to fade he laid down his brushes and came out to the little piazza of the cottage here he walked up and down for some time looking at the splendid blaze of the western sky and saying as he had often said before that this was certainly the country of sunsets there was something in these glorious deeps of fire that quickened his imagination he always found images and promises in the western sky he thought of a good many thingsof roaming about the world with gertrude wentworth he seemed to see their possible adventures in a glowing frieze between the cloudbars then of what eugenia had just been telling him he wished very much that madame m auunster would make a comfortable and honorable marriage presently as the sunset expanded and deepened the fancy took him of making a note of so magnificent a piece of coloring he returned to his studio and fetched out a small panel with his palette and brushes and placing the panel against a windowsill he began to daub with great gusto while he was so occupied he saw mr brand in the distance slowly come down from mr wentworths house nursing a large folded umbrella he walked with a joyless meditative tread and his eyes were bent upon the ground felix poised his brush for a moment watching him then by a sudden impulse as he drew nearer advanced to the gardengate and signaled to himthe palette and bunch of brushes contributing to this effect  mr brand stopped and started then he appeared to decide to accept felixs invitation he came out of mr wentworths gate and passed along the road after which he entered the little garden of the cottage felix had gone back to his sunset but he made his visitor welcome while he rapidly brushed it in  i wanted so much to speak to you that i thought i would call you he said in the friendliest tone all the more that you have been to see me so little you have come to see my sister i know that but you have nt come to see methe celebrated artist artists are very sensitive you know they notice those things and felix turned round smiling with a brush in his mouth  mr brand stood there with a certain blank candid majesty pulling together the large flaps of his umbrella why should i come to see you he asked i know nothing of art  it would sound very conceited i suppose said felix if i were to say that it would be a good little chance for you to learn something you would ask me why you should learn and i should have no answer to that i suppose a minister has no need for art eh  he has need for good temper sir said mr brand with decision  felix jumped up with his palette on his thumb and a movement of the liveliest deprecation that s because i keep you standing there while i splash my red paint i beg a thousand pardons you see what bad manners art gives a man and how right you are to let it alone i did nt mean you should stand either the piazza as you see is ornamented with rustic chairs though indeed i ought to warn you that they have nails in the wrong places i was just making a note of that sunset i never saw such a blaze of different reds it looks as if the celestial city were in flames eh if that were really the case i suppose it would be the business of you theologians to put out the fire fancy mean ungodly artistquietly sitting down to paint it  mr brand had always credited felix young with a certain impudence but it appeared to him that on this occasion his impudence was so great as to make a special explanationor even an apologynecessary and the impression it must be added was sufficiently natural felix had at all times a brilliant assurance of manner which was simply the vehicle of his good spirits and his good will but at present he had a special design and as he would have admitted that the design was audacious so he was conscious of having summoned all the arts of conversation to his aid but he was so far from desiring to offend his visitor that he was rapidly asking himself what personal compliment he could pay the young clergyman that would gratify him most if he could think of it he was prepared to pay it down have you been preaching one of your beautiful sermons today he suddenly asked laying down his palette this was not what felix had been trying to think of but it was a tolerable stopgap  mr brand frownedas much as a man can frown who has very fair soft eyebrows and beneath them very gentle tranquil eyes no i have not preached any sermon today did you bring me over here for the purpose of making that inquiry  felix saw that he was irritated and he regretted it immensely but he had no fear of not being in the end agreeable to mr brand he looked at him smiling and laying his hand on his arm no no not for thatnot for that i wanted to ask you something i wanted to tell you something i am sure it will interest you very much onlyas it is something rather privatewe had better come into my little studio i have a western window we can still see the sunset andiamo and he gave a little pat to his companions arm  he led the way in mr brand stiffly and softly followed the twilight had thickened in the little studio but the wall opposite the western window was covered with a deep pink flush there were a great many sketches and halffinished canvasses suspended in this rosy glow and the corners of the room were vague and dusky felix begged mr brand to sit down then glancing round him by jove how pretty it looks he cried but mr brand would not sit down he went and leaned against the window he wondered what felix wanted of him in the shadow on the darker parts of the wall he saw the gleam of three or four pictures that looked fantastic and surprising they seemed to represent naked figures felix stood there with his head a little bent and his eyes fixed upon his visitor smiling intensely pulling his mustache mr brand felt vaguely uneasy it is very delicatewhat i want to say felix began but i have been thinking of it for some time  please to say it as quickly as possible said mr brand  it s because you are a clergyman you know felix went on i dont think i should venture to say it to a common man  mr brand was silent a moment if it is a question of yielding to a weakness of resenting an injury i am afraid i am a very common man  my dearest friend cried felix this is not an injury it s a benefita great service you will like it extremely only it s so delicate and in the dim light he continued to smile intensely you know i take a great interest in my cousinsin charlotte and gertrude wentworth that s very evident from my having traveled some five thousand miles to see them mr brand said nothing and felix proceeded coming into their society as a perfect stranger i received of course a great many new impressions and my impressions had a great freshness a great keenness do you know what i mean  i am not sure that i do but i should like you to continue  i think my impressions have always a good deal of freshness said mr brands entertainer but on this occasion it was perhaps particularly natural thatcoming in as i say from outsidei should be struck with things that passed unnoticed among yourselves and then i had my sister to help me and she is simply the most observant woman in the world  i am not surprised said mr brand that in our little circle two intelligent persons should have found food for observation i am sure that of late i have found it myself  ah but i shall surprise you yet cried felix laughing both my sister and i took a great fancy to my cousin charlotte  your cousin charlotte repeated mr brand  we fell in love with her from the first  you fell in love with charlotte mr brand murmured  dame exclaimed felix she s a very charming person and eugenia was especially smitten mr brand stood staring and he pursued affection you know opens ones eyes and we noticed something charlotte is not happy charlotte is in love and felix drawing nearer laid his hand again upon his companions arm  there was something akin to an acknowledgment of fascination in the way mr brand looked at him but the young clergyman retained as yet quite enough selfpossession to be able to say with a good deal of solemnity she is not in love with you  felix gave a light laugh and rejoined with the alacrity of a maritime adventurer who feels a puff of wind in his sail ah no if she were in love with me i should know it i am not so blind as you  as i  my dear sir you are stone blind poor charlotte is dead in love with you  mr brand said nothing for a moment he breathed a little heavily is that what you wanted to say to me he asked  i have wanted to say it these three weeks because of late she has been worse i told you added felix it was very delicate  well sirmr brand began well sir  i was sure you did nt know it felix continued but dont you seeas soon as i mention ithow everything is explained mr brand answered nothing he looked for a chair and softly sat down felix could see that he was blushing he had looked straight at his host hitherto but now he looked away the foremost effect of what he had heard had been a sort of irritation of his modesty of course said felix i suggest nothing it would be very presumptuous in me to advise you but i think there is no doubt about the fact  mr brand looked hard at the floor for some moments he was oppressed with a mixture of sensations felix standing there was very sure that one of them was profound surprise the innocent young man had been completely unsuspicious of poor charlottes hidden flame this gave felix great hope he was sure that mr brand would be flattered felix thought him very transparent and indeed he was so he could neither simulate nor dissimulate i scarcely know what to make of this he said at last without looking up and felix was struck with the fact that he offered no protest or contradiction evidently felix had kindled a train of memoriesa retrospective illumination it was making to mr brands astonished eyes a very pretty blaze his second emotion had been a gratification of vanity  thank me for telling you felix rejoined it s a good thing to know  i am not sure of that said mr brand  ah dont let her languish felix murmured lightly and softly  you do advise me then and mr brand looked up  i congratulate you said felix smiling he had thought at first his visitor was simply appealing but he saw he was a little ironical  it is in your interest you have interfered with me the young clergyman went on  felix still stood and smiled the little room had grown darker and the crimson glow had faded but mr brand could see the brilliant expression of his face i wont pretend not to know what you mean said felix at last but i have not really interfered with you of what you had to losewith another personyou have lost nothing and think what you have gained  it seems to me i am the proper judge on each side mr brand declared he got up holding the brim of his hat against his mouth and staring at felix through the dusk  you have lost an illusion said felix  what do you call an illusion  the belief that you really knowthat you have ever really knowngertrude wentworth depend upon that pursued felix i dont know her yet but i have no illusions i dont pretend to  mr brand kept gazing over his hat she has always been a lucid limpid nature he said solemnly  she has always been a dormant nature she was waiting for a touchstone but now she is beginning to awaken  dont praise her to me said mr brand with a little quaver in his voice if you have the advantage of me that is not generous  my dear sir i am melting with generosity exclaimed felix and i am not praising my cousin i am simply attempting a scientific definition of her she doesnt care for abstractions now i think the contrary is what you have always fanciedis the basis on which you have been building she is extremely preoccupied with the concrete i care for the concrete too but gertrude is stronger than i she whirls me along  mr brand looked for a moment into the crown of his hat it s a most interesting nature  so it is said felix but it pullsit pullslike a runaway horse now i like the feeling of a runaway horse and if i am thrown out of the vehicle it is no great matter but if you should be thrown mr brandand felix paused a momentanother person also would suffer from the accident  what other person  charlotte wentworth  mr brand looked at felix for a moment sidewise mistrustfully then his eyes slowly wandered over the ceiling felix was sure he was secretly struck with the romance of the situation i think this is none of our business the young minister murmured  none of mine perhaps but surely yours  mr brand lingered still looking at the ceiling there was evidently something he wanted to say what do you mean by miss gertrude being strong he asked abruptly  well said felix meditatively i mean that she has had a great deal of selfpossession she was waitingfor years even when she seemed perhaps to be living in the present she knew how to wait she had a purpose that s what i mean by her being strong  but what do you mean by her purpose  wellthe purpose to see the world  mr brand eyed his strange informant askance again but he said nothing at last he turned away as if to take leave he seemed bewildered however for instead of going to the door he moved toward the opposite corner of the room felix stood and watched him for a momentalmost groping about in the dusk then he led him to the door with a tender almost fraternal movement is that all you have to say asked mr brand  yes it s allbut it will bear a good deal of thinking of  felix went with him to the gardengate and watched him slowly walk away into the thickening twilight with a relaxed rigidity that tried to rectify itself he is offended excited bewildered perplexedand enchanted felix said to himself that s a capital mixture       chapter xi  since that visit paid by the baroness munster to mrs acton of which some account was given at an earlier stage of this narrative the intercourse between these two ladies had been neither frequent nor intimate it was not that mrs acton had failed to appreciate madame m auunsters charms on the contrary her perception of the graces of manner and conversation of her brilliant visitor had been only too acute mrs acton was as they said in boston very intense and her impressions were apt to be too many for her the state of her health required the restriction of emotion and this is why receiving as she sat in her eternal armchair very few visitors even of the soberest local type she had been obliged to limit the number of her interviews with a lady whose costume and manner recalled to her imaginationmrs actons imagination was a marvelall that she had ever read of the most stirring historical periods but she had sent the baroness a great many quaintlyworded messages and a great many nosegays from her garden and baskets of beautiful fruit felix had eaten the fruit and the baroness had arranged the flowers and returned the baskets and the messages on the day that followed that rainy sunday of which mention has been made eugenia determined to go and pay the beneficent invalid a visite dadieux so it was that to herself she qualified her enterprise it may be noted that neither on the sunday evening nor on the monday morning had she received that expected visit from robert acton to his own consciousness evidently he was keeping away and as the baroness on her side was keeping away from her uncles whither for several days felix had been the unembarrassed bearer of apologies and regrets for absence chance had not taken the cards from the hands of design mr wentworth and his daughters had respected eugenias seclusion certain intervals of mysterious retirement appeared to them vaguely a natural part of the graceful rhythmic movement of so remarkable a life gertrude especially held these periods in honor she wondered what madame m auunster did at such times but she would not have permitted herself to inquire too curiously  the long rain had freshened the air and twelve hours brilliant sunshine had dried the roads so that the baroness in the late afternoon proposing to walk to mrs actons exposed herself to no great discomfort as with her charming undulating step she moved along the clean grassy margin of the road beneath the thicklyhanging boughs of the orchards through the quiet of the hour and place and the rich maturity of the summer she was even conscious of a sort of luxurious melancholy the baroness had the amiable weakness of attaching herself to placeseven when she had begun with a little aversion and now with the prospect of departure she felt tenderly toward this wellwooded corner of the western world where the sunsets were so beautiful and ones ambitions were so pure mrs acton was able to receive her but on entering this ladys large freshlyscented room the baroness saw that she was looking very ill she was wonderfully white and transparent and in her flowered armchair she made no attempt to move but she flushed a littlelike a young girl the baroness thoughtand she rested her clear smiling eyes upon those of her visitor her voice was low and monotonous like a voice that had never expressed any human passions  i have come to bid you goodby said eugenia i shall soon be going away  when are you going away  very soonany day  i am very sorry said mrs acton i hoped you would stayalways  always eugenia demanded  well i mean a long time said mrs acton in her sweet feeble tone they tell me you are so comfortablethat you have got such a beautiful little house  eugenia staredthat is she smiled she thought of her poor little chalet and she wondered whether her hostess were jesting yes my house is exquisite she said though not to be compared to yours  and my son is so fond of going to see you mrs acton added i am afraid my son will miss you  ah dear madame said eugenia with a little laugh i cant stay in america for your son  dont you like america  the baroness looked at the front of her dress if i liked itthat would not be staying for your son  mrs acton gazed at her with her grave tender eyes as if she had not quite understood the baroness at last found something irritating in the sweet soft stare of her hostess and if one were not bound to be merciful to great invalids she would almost have taken the liberty of pronouncing her mentally a fool i am afraid then i shall never see you again said mrs acton you know i am dying  ah dear madame murmured eugenia  i want to leave my children cheerful and happy my daughter will probably marry her cousin  two such interesting young people said the baroness vaguely she was not thinking of clifford wentworth  i feel so tranquil about my end mrs acton went on it is coming so easily so surely and she paused with her mild gaze always on eugenias  the baroness hated to be reminded of death but even in its imminence so far as mrs acton was concerned she preserved her good manners ah madame you are too charming an invalid she rejoined  but the delicacy of this rejoinder was apparently lost upon her hostess who went on in her low reasonable voice i want to leave my children bright and comfortable you seem to me all so happy herejust as you are so i wish you could stay it would be so pleasant for robert  eugenia wondered what she meant by its being pleasant for robert but she felt that she would never know what such a woman as that meant she got up she was afraid mrs acton would tell her again that she was dying goodby dear madame she said i must remember that your strength is precious  mrs acton took her hand and held it a moment well you have been happy here have nt you and you like us all dont you i wish you would stay she added in your beautiful little house  she had told eugenia that her waitingwoman would be in the hall to show her downstairs but the large landing outside her door was empty and eugenia stood there looking about she felt irritated the dying lady had not la main heureuse she passed slowly downstairs still looking about the broad staircase made a great bend and in the angle was a high window looking westward with a deep bench covered with a row of flowering plants in curious old pots of blue chinaware the yellow afternoon light came in through the flowers and flickered a little on the white wainscots eugenia paused a moment the house was perfectly still save for the ticking somewhere of a great clock the lower hall stretched away at the foot of the stairs half covered over with a large oriental rug eugenia lingered a little noticing a great many things comme cest bien she said to herself such a large solid irreproachable basis of existence the place seemed to her to indicate and then she reflected that mrs acton was soon to withdraw from it the reflection accompanied her the rest of the way downstairs where she paused again making more observations the hall was extremely broad and on either side of the front door was a wide deeplyset window which threw the shadows of everything back into the house there were highbacked chairs along the wall and big eastern vases upon tables and on either side a large cabinet with a glass front and little curiosities within dimly gleaming the doors were openinto the darkened parlor the library the diningroom all these rooms seemed empty eugenia passed along and stopped a moment on the threshold of each comme cest bien she murmured again she had thought of just such a house as this when she decided to come to america she opened the front door for herselfher light tread had summoned none of the servantsand on the threshold she gave a last look outside she was still in the humor for curious contemplation so instead of going directly down the little drive to the gate she wandered away towards the garden which lay to the right of the house she had not gone many yards over the grass before she paused quickly she perceived a gentleman stretched upon the level verdure beneath a tree he had not heard her coming and he lay motionless flat on his back with his hands clasped under his head staring up at the sky so that the baroness was able to reflect at her leisure upon the question of his identity it was that of a person who had lately been much in her thoughts but her first impulse nevertheless was to turn away the last thing she desired was to have the air of coming in quest of robert acton the gentleman on the grass however gave her no time to decide he could not long remain unconscious of so agreeable a presence he rolled back his eyes stared gave an exclamation and then jumped up he stood an instant looking at her  excuse my ridiculous position he said  i have just now no sense of the ridiculous but in case you have dont imagine i came to see you  take care rejoined acton how you put it into my head i was thinking of you  the occupation of extreme leisure said the baroness to think of a woman when you are in that position is no compliment  i did nt say i was thinking well acton affirmed smiling  she looked at him and then she turned away  though i did nt come to see you she said remember at least that i am within your gates  i am delightedi am honored wont you come into the house  i have just come out of it i have been calling upon your mother i have been bidding her farewell  farewell acton demanded  i am going away said the baroness and she turned away again as if to illustrate her meaning  when are you going asked acton standing a moment in his place but the baroness made no answer and he followed her  i came this way to look at your garden she said walking back to the gate over the grass but i must go  let me at least go with you he went with her and they said nothing till they reached the gate it was open and they looked down the road which was darkened over with long bosky shadows must you go straight home acton asked  but she made no answer she said after a moment why have you not been to see me he said nothing and then she went on why dont you answer me  i am trying to invent an answer acton confessed  have you none ready  none that i can tell you he said but let me walk with you now  you may do as you like  she moved slowly along the road and acton went with her presently he said if i had done as i liked i would have come to see you several times  is that invented asked eugenia  no that is natural i stayed away because  ah here comes the reason then  because i wanted to think about you  because you wanted to lie down said the baroness i have seen you lie downalmostin my drawingroom  acton stopped in the road with a movement which seemed to beg her to linger a little she paused and he looked at her awhile he thought her very charming you are jesting he said but if you are really going away it is very serious  if i stay and she gave a little laugh it is more serious still  when shall you go  as soon as possible  and why  why should i stay  because we all admire you so  that is not a reason i am admired also in europe and she began to walk homeward again  what could i say to keep you asked acton he wanted to keep her and it was a fact that he had been thinking of her for a week he was in love with her now he was conscious of that or he thought he was and the only question with him was whether he could trust her  what you can say to keep me she repeated as i want very much to go it is not in my interest to tell you besides i cant imagine  he went on with her in silence he was much more affected by what she had told him than appeared ever since that evening of his return from newport her image had had a terrible power to trouble him what clifford wentworth had told himthat had affected him too in an adverse sense but it had not liberated him from the discomfort of a charm of which his intelligence was impatient she is not honest she is not honest he kept murmuring to himself that is what he had been saying to the summer sky ten minutes before unfortunately he was unable to say it finally definitively and now that he was near her it seemed to matter wonderfully little she is a woman who will lie he had said to himself now as he went along he reminded himself of this observation but it failed to frighten him as it had done before he almost wished he could make her lie and then convict her of it so that he might see how he should like that he kept thinking of this as he walked by her side while she moved forward with her light graceful dignity he had sat with her before he had driven with her but he had never walked with her  by jove how comme il faut she is he said as he observed her sidewise when they reached the cottage in the orchard she passed into the gate without asking him to follow but she turned round as he stood there to bid him goodnight  i asked you a question the other night which you never answered he said have you sent off that documentliberating yourself  she hesitated for a single momentvery naturally then yes she said simply  he turned away he wondered whether that would do for his lie but he saw her again that evening for the baroness reappeared at her uncles he had little talk with her however two gentlemen had driven out from boston in a buggy to call upon mr wentworth and his daughters and madame munster was an object of absorbing interest to both of the visitors one of them indeed said nothing to her he only sat and watched with intense gravity and leaned forward solemnly presenting his ear a very large one as if he were deaf whenever she dropped an observation he had evidently been impressed with the idea of her misfortunes and reverses he never smiled his companion adopted a lighter easier style sat as near as possible to madame munster attempted to draw her out and proposed every few moments a new topic of conversation eugenia was less vividly responsive than usual and had less to say than from her brilliant reputation her interlocutor expected upon the relative merits of european and american institutions but she was inaccessible to robert acton who roamed about the piazza with his hands in his pockets listening for the grating sound of the buggy from boston as it should be brought round to the sidedoor but he listened in vain and at last he lost patience his sister came to him and begged him to take her home and he presently went off with her eugenia observed him leaving the house with lizzie in her present mood the fact seemed a contribution to her irritated conviction that he had several precious qualities even that malelevee little girl she reflected makes him do what she wishes  she had been sitting just within one of the long windows that opened upon the piazza but very soon after acton had gone away she got up abruptly just when the talkative gentleman from boston was asking her what she thought of the moral tone of that city on the piazza she encountered clifford wentworth coming round from the other side of the house she stopped him she told him she wished to speak to him  why did nt you go home with your cousin she asked  clifford stared why robert has taken her he said  exactly so but you dont usually leave that to him  oh said clifford i want to see those fellows start off they dont know how to drive  it is not then that you have quarreled with your cousin  clifford reflected a moment and then with a simplicity which had for the baroness a singularly baffling quality oh no we have made up he said  she looked at him for some moments but clifford had begun to be afraid of the baronesss looks and he endeavored now to shift himself out of their range why do you never come to see me any more she asked have i displeased you  displeased me well i guess not said clifford with a laugh  why have nt you come then  well because i am afraid of getting shut up in that back room  eugenia kept looking at him i should think you would like that  like it cried clifford  i should if i were a young man calling upon a charming woman  a charming woman is nt much use to me when i am shut up in that back room  i am afraid i am not of much use to you anywhere said madame m auunster and yet you know how i have offered to be  well observed clifford by way of response there comes the buggy  never mind the buggy do you know i am going away  do you mean now  i mean in a few days i leave this place  you are going back to europe  to europe where you are to come and see me  oh yes i ll come out there said clifford  but before that eugenia declared you must come and see me here  well i shall keep clear of that back room rejoined her simple young kinsman  the baroness was silent a moment yes you must come franklyboldly that will be very much better i see that now  i see it said clifford and then in an instant what s the matter with that buggy his practiced ear had apparently detected an unnatural creak in the wheels of the light vehicle which had been brought to the portico and he hurried away to investigate so grave an anomaly  the baroness walked homeward alone in the starlight asking herself a question was she to have gained nothingwas she to have gained nothing  gertrude wentworth had held a silent place in the little circle gathered about the two gentlemen from boston she was not interested in the visitors she was watching madame munster as she constantly watched her she knew that eugenia also was not interestedthat she was bored and gertrude was absorbed in study of the problem how in spite of her indifference and her absent attention she managed to have such a charming manner that was the manner gertrude would have liked to have she determined to cultivate it and she wished thatto give her the charmshe might in future very often be bored while she was engaged in these researches felix young was looking for charlotte to whom he had something to say for some time now he had had something to say to charlotte and this evening his sense of the propriety of holding some special conversation with her had reached the motivepointresolved itself into acute and delightful desire he wandered through the empty rooms on the large groundfloor of the house and found her at last in a small apartment denominated for reasons not immediately apparent mr wentworths office an extremely neat and welldusted room with an array of lawbooks in timedarkened sheepskin on one of the walls a large map of the united states on the other flanked on either side by an old steel engraving of one of raphaels madonnas and on the third several glass cases containing specimens of butterflies and beetles charlotte was sitting by a lamp embroidering a slipper felix did not ask for whom the slipper was destined he saw it was very large  he moved a chair toward her and sat down smiling as usual but at first not speaking she watched him with her needle poised and with a certain shy fluttered look which she always wore when he approached her there was something in felixs manner that quickened her modesty her selfconsciousness if absolute choice had been given her she would have preferred never to find herself alone with him and in fact though she thought him a most brilliant distinguished and wellmeaning person she had exercised a much larger amount of tremulous tact than he had ever suspected to circumvent the accident of teteatete poor charlotte could have given no account of the matter that would not have seemed unjust both to herself and to her foreign kinsman she could only have saidor rather she would never have said itthat she did not like so much gentlemans society at once she was not reassured accordingly when he began emphasizing his words with a kind of admiring radiance my dear cousin i am enchanted at finding you alone  i am very often alone charlotte observed then she quickly added i dont mean i am lonely  so clever a woman as you is never lonely said felix you have company in your beautiful work and he glanced at the big slipper  i like to work declared charlotte simply  so do i said her companion and i like to idle too but it is not to idle that i have come in search of you i want to tell you something very particular  well murmured charlotte of course if you must  my dear cousin said felix it s nothing that a young lady may not listen to at least i suppose it is nt but voyons you shall judge i am terribly in love  well felix began miss wentworth gravely but her very gravity appeared to check the development of her phrase  i am in love with your sister but in love charlottein love the young man pursued charlotte had laid her work in her lap her hands were tightly folded on top of it she was staring at the carpet in short i m in love dear lady said felix now i want you to help me  to help you asked charlotte with a tremor  i dont mean with gertrude she and i have a perfect understanding and oh how well she understands one i mean with your father and with the world in general including mr brand  poor mr brand said charlotte slowly but with a simplicity which made it evident to felix that the young minister had not repeated to miss wentworth the talk that had lately occurred between them  ah now dont say poor mr brand i dont pity mr brand at all but i pity your father a little and i dont want to displease him therefore you see i want you to plead for me you dont think me very shabby eh  shabby exclaimed charlotte softly for whom felix represented the most polished and iridescent qualities of mankind  i dont mean in my appearance rejoined felix laughing for charlotte was looking at his boots i mean in my conduct you dont think it s an abuse of hospitality  toto care for gertrude asked charlotte  to have really expressed ones self because i have expressed myself charlotte i must tell you the whole truthi have of course i want to marry herand here is the difficulty i held off as long as i could but she is such a terribly fascinating person she s a strange creature charlotte i dont believe you really know her charlotte took up her tapestry again and again she laid it down i know your father has had higher views felix continued and i think you have shared them you have wanted to marry her to mr brand  oh no said charlotte very earnestly mr brand has always admired her but we did not want anything of that kind  felix stared surely marriage was what you proposed  yes but we did nt wish to force her  a la bonne heure that s very unsafe you know with these arranged marriages there is often the deuce to pay  oh felix said charlotte we did nt want to arrange  i am delighted to hear that because in such caseseven when the woman is a thoroughly good creatureshe cant help looking for a compensation a charming fellow comes alongand voila charlotte sat mutely staring at the floor and felix presently added do go on with your slipper i like to see you work  charlotte took up her variegated canvas and began to draw vague blue stitches in a big round rose if gertrude is soso strange she said why do you want to marry her  ah that s it dear charlotte i like strange women i always have liked them ask eugenia and gertrude is wonderful she says the most beautiful things  charlotte looked at him almost for the first time as if her meaning required to be severely pointed you have a great influence over her  yesand no said felix i had at first i think but now it is six of one and halfadozen of the other it is reciprocal she affects me stronglyfor she is so strong i dont believe you know her it s a beautiful nature  oh yes felix i have always thought gertrudes nature beautiful  well if you think so now cried the young man wait and see she s a folded flower let me pluck her from the parent tree and you will see her expand i m sure you will enjoy it  i dont understand you murmured charlotte i cant felix  well you can understand thisthat i beg you to say a good word for me to your father he regards me i naturally believe as a very light fellow a bohemian an irregular character tell him i am not all this if i ever was i have forgotten it i am fond of pleasureyes but of innocent pleasure pain is all one but in pleasure you know there are tremendous distinctions say to him that gertrude is a folded flower and that i am a serious man  charlotte got up from her chair slowly rolling up her work we know you are very kind to every one felix she said but we are extremely sorry for mr brand  of course you areyou especially because added felix hastily you are a woman but i dont pity him it ought to be enough for any man that you take an interest in him  it is not enough for mr brand said charlotte simply and she stood there a moment as if waiting conscientiously for anything more that felix might have to say  mr brand is not so keen about his marriage as he was he presently said he is afraid of your sister he begins to think she is wicked  charlotte looked at him now with beautiful appealing eyeseyes into which he saw the tears rising oh felix felix she cried what have you done to her  i think she was asleep i have waked her up  but charlotte apparently was really crying she walked straight out of the room and felix standing there and meditating had the apparent brutality to take satisfaction in her tears  late that night gertrude silent and serious came to him in the garden it was a kind of appointment gertrude seemed to like appointments she plucked a handful of heliotrope and stuck it into the front of her dress but she said nothing they walked together along one of the paths and felix looked at the great square hospitable house massing itself vaguely in the starlight with all its windows darkened  i have a little of a bad conscience he said i ought nt to meet you this way till i have got your fathers consent  gertrude looked at him for some time i dont understand you  you very often say that he said considering how little we understand each other it is a wonder how well we get on  we have done nothing but meet since you came herebut meet alone the first time i ever saw you we were alone gertrude went on what is the difference now is it because it is at night  the difference gertrude said felix stopping in the path the difference is that i love you moremore than before and then they stood there talking in the warm stillness and in front of the closed dark house i have been talking to charlottebeen trying to bespeak her interest with your father she has a kind of sublime perversity was ever a woman so bent upon cutting off her own head  you are too careful said gertrude you are too diplomatic  well cried the young man i did nt come here to make any one unhappy  gertrude looked round her awhile in the odorous darkness i will do anything you please she said  for instance asked felix smiling  i will go away i will do anything you please  felix looked at her in solemn admiration yes we will go away he said but we will make peace first  gertrude looked about her again and then she broke out passionately why do they try to make one feel guilty why do they make it so difficult why cant they understand  i will make them understand said felix he drew her hand into his arm and they wandered about in the garden talking for an hour       chapter xii  felix allowed charlotte time to plead his cause and then on the third day he sought an interview with his uncle it was in the morning mr wentworth was in his office and on going in felix found that charlotte was at that moment in conference with her father she had in fact been constantly near him since her interview with felix she had made up her mind that it was her duty to repeat very literally her cousins passionate plea she had accordingly followed mr wentworth about like a shadow in order to find him at hand when she should have mustered sufficient composure to speak for poor charlotte in this matter naturally lacked composure especially when she meditated upon some of felixs intimations it was not cheerful work at the best to keep giving small hammertaps to the coffin in which one had laid away for burial the poor little unacknowledged offspring of ones own misbehaving heart and the occupation was not rendered more agreeable by the fact that the ghost of ones stifled dream had been summoned from the shades by the strange bold words of a talkative young foreigner what had felix meant by saying that mr brand was not so keen to herself her sisters justly depressed suitor had shown no sign of faltering charlotte trembled all over when she allowed herself to believe for an instant now and then that privately mr brand might have faltered and as it seemed to give more force to felixs words to repeat them to her father she was waiting until she should have taught herself to be very calm but she had now begun to tell mr wentworth that she was extremely anxious she was proceeding to develop this idea to enumerate the objects of her anxiety when felix came in  mr wentworth sat there with his legs crossed lifting his dry pure countenance from the boston advertiser felix entered smiling as if he had something particular to say and his uncle looked at him as if he both expected and deprecated this event felix vividly expressing himself had come to be a formidable figure to his uncle who had not yet arrived at definite views as to a proper tone for the first time in his life as i have said mr wentworth shirked a responsibility he earnestly desired that it might not be laid upon him to determine how his nephews lighter propositions should be treated he lived under an apprehension that felix might yet beguile him into assent to doubtful inductions and his conscience instructed him that the best form of vigilance was the avoidance of discussion he hoped that the pleasant episode of his nephews visit would pass away without a further lapse of consistency  felix looked at charlotte with an air of understanding and then at mr wentworth and then at charlotte again mr wentworth bent his refined eyebrows upon his nephew and stroked down the first page of the advertiser i ought to have brought a bouquet said felix laughing in france they always do  we are not in france observed mr wentworth gravely while charlotte earnestly gazed at him  no luckily we are not in france where i am afraid i should have a harder time of it my dear charlotte have you rendered me that delightful service and felix bent toward her as if some one had been presenting him  charlotte looked at him with almost frightened eyes and mr wentworth thought this might be the beginning of a discussion what is the bouquet for he inquired by way of turning it off  felix gazed at him smiling pour la demande and then drawing up a chair he seated himself hat in hand with a kind of conscious solemnity  presently he turned to charlotte again my good charlotte my admirable charlotte he murmured you have not played me falseyou have not sided against me  charlotte got up trembling extremely though imperceptibly you must speak to my father yourself she said i think you are clever enough  but felix rising too begged her to remain i can speak better to an audience he declared  i hope it is nothing disagreeable said mr wentworth  it s something delightful for me and felix laying down his hat clasped his hands a little between his knees my dear uncle he said i desire very earnestly to marry your daughter gertrude charlotte sank slowly into her chair again and mr wentworth sat staring with a light in his face that might have been flashed back from an iceberg he stared and stared he said nothing felix fell back with his hands still clasped ahyou dont like it i was afraid he blushed deeply and charlotte noticed itremarking to herself that it was the first time she had ever seen him blush she began to blush herself and to reflect that he might be much in love  this is very abrupt said mr wentworth at last  have you never suspected it dear uncle felix inquired well that proves how discreet i have been yes i thought you would nt like it  it is very serious felix said mr wentworth  you think it s an abuse of hospitality exclaimed felix smiling again  of hospitalityan abuse his uncle repeated very slowly  that is what felix said to me said charlotte conscientiously  of course you think so dont defend yourself felix pursued it is an abuse obviously the most i can claim is that it is perhaps a pardonable one i simply fell head over heels in love one can hardly help that though you are gertrudes progenitor i dont believe you know how attractive she is dear uncle she contains the elements of a singularlyi may say a strangelycharming woman  she has always been to me an object of extreme concern said mr wentworth we have always desired her happiness  well here it is felix declared i will make her happy she believes it too now had nt you noticed that  i had noticed that she was much changed mr wentworth declared in a tone whose unexpressive unimpassioned quality appeared to felix to reveal a profundity of opposition it may be that she is only becoming what you call a charming woman  gertrude at heart is so earnest so true said charlotte very softly fastening her eyes upon her father  i delight to hear you praise her cried felix  she has a very peculiar temperament said mr wentworth  eh even that is praise felix rejoined i know i am not the man you might have looked for i have no position and no fortune i can give gertrude no place in the world a place in the worldthat s what she ought to have that would bring her out  a place to do her duty remarked mr wentworth  ah how charmingly she does ither duty felix exclaimed with a radiant face what an exquisite conception she has of it but she comes honestly by that dear uncle mr wentworth and charlotte both looked at him as if they were watching a greyhound doubling of course with me she will hide her light under a bushel he continued i being the bushel now i know you like meyou have certainly proved it but you think i am frivolous and penniless and shabby grantedgranteda thousand times granted i have been a loose fisha fiddler a painter an actor but there is this to be said in the first place i fancy you exaggerate you lend me qualities i have nt had i have been a bohemianyes but in bohemia i always passed for a gentleman i wish you could see some of my old camaradesthey would tell you it was the liberty i liked but not the opportunities my sins were all peccadilloes i always respected my neighbors propertymy neighbors wife do you see dear uncle mr wentworth ought to have seen his cold blue eyes were intently fixed and then cest fini it s all over je me range i have settled down to a jogtrot i find i can earn my livinga very fair oneby going about the world and painting bad portraits it s not a glorious profession but it is a perfectly respectable one you wont deny that eh going about the world i say i must not deny that for that i am afraid i shall always doin quest of agreeable sitters when i say agreeable i mean susceptible of delicate flattery and prompt of payment gertrude declares she is willing to share my wanderings and help to pose my models she even thinks it will be charming and that brings me to my third point gertrude likes me encourage her a little and she will tell you so  felixs tongue obviously moved much faster than the imagination of his auditors his eloquence like the rocking of a boat in a deep smooth lake made long eddies of silence and he seemed to be pleading and chattering still with his brightly eager smile his uplifted eyebrows his expressive mouth after he had ceased speaking and while with his glance quickly turning from the father to the daughter he sat waiting for the effect of his appeal it is not your want of means said mr wentworth after a period of severe reticence  now it s delightful of you to say that only dont say it s my want of character because i have a characteri assure you i have a small one a little slip of a thing but still something tangible  ought you not to tell felix that it is mr brand father charlotte asked with infinite mildness  it is not only mr brand mr wentworth solemnly declared and he looked at his knee for a long time it is difficult to explain he said he wished evidently to be very just it rests on moral grounds as mr brand says it is the question whether it is the best thing for gertrude  what is betterwhat is better dear uncle felix rejoined urgently rising in his urgency and standing before mr wentworth his uncle had been looking at his knee but when felix moved he transferred his gaze to the handle of the door which faced him it is usually a fairly good thing for a girl to marry the man she loves cried felix  while he spoke mr wentworth saw the handle of the door begin to turn the door opened and remained slightly ajar until felix had delivered himself of the cheerful axiom just quoted then it opened altogether and gertrude stood there she looked excited there was a spark in her sweet dull eyes she came in slowly but with an air of resolution and closing the door softly looked round at the three persons present felix went to her with tender gallantry holding out his hand and charlotte made a place for her on the sofa but gertrude put her hands behind her and made no motion to sit down  we are talking of you said felix  i know it she answered that s why i came and she fastened her eyes on her father who returned her gaze very fixedly in his own cold blue eyes there was a kind of pleading reasoning light  it is better you should be present said mr wentworth we are discussing your future  why discuss it asked gertrude leave it to me  that is to me cried felix  i leave it in the last resort to a greater wisdom than ours said the old man  felix rubbed his forehead gently but en attendant the last resort your father lacks confidence he said to gertrude  have nt you confidence in felix gertrude was frowning there was something about her that her father and charlotte had never seen charlotte got up and came to her as if to put her arm round her but suddenly she seemed afraid to touch her  mr wentworth however was not afraid i have had more confidence in felix than in you he said  yes you have never had confidence in menever never i dont know why  oh sister sister murmured charlotte  you have always needed advice mr wentworth declared you have had a difficult temperament  why do you call it difficult it might have been easy if you had allowed it you would nt let me be natural i dont know what you wanted to make of me mr brand was the worst  charlotte at last took hold of her sister she laid her two hands upon gertrudes arm he cares so much for you she almost whispered  gertrude looked at her intently an instant then kissed her no he does not she said  i have never seen you so passionate observed mr wentworth with an air of indignation mitigated by high principles  i am sorry if i offend you said gertrude  you offend me but i dont think you are sorry  yes father she is sorry said charlotte  i would even go further dear uncle felix interposed i would question whether she really offends you how can she offend you  to this mr wentworth made no immediate answer then in a moment she has not profited as we hoped  profited ah voila felix exclaimed  gertrude was very pale she stood looking down i have told felix i would go away with him she presently said  ah you have said some admirable things cried the young man  go away sister asked charlotte  awayaway to some strange country  that is to frighten you said felix smiling at charlotte  towhat do you call it asked gertrude turning an instant to felix to bohemia  do you propose to dispense with preliminaries asked mr wentworth getting up  dear uncle vous plaisantez cried felix it seems to me that these are preliminaries  gertrude turned to her father i have profited she said you wanted to form my character well my character is formedfor my age i know what i want i have chosen i am determined to marry this gentleman  you had better consent sir said felix very gently  yes sir you had better consent added a very different voice  charlotte gave a little jump and the others turned to the direction from which it had come it was the voice of mr brand who had stepped through the long window which stood open to the piazza he stood patting his forehead with his pockethandkerchief he was very much flushed his face wore a singular expression  yes sir you had better consent mr brand repeated coming forward i know what miss gertrude means  my dear friend murmured felix laying his hand caressingly on the young ministers arm  mr brand looked at him then at mr wentworth lastly at gertrude he did not look at charlotte but charlottes earnest eyes were fastened to his own countenance they were asking an immense question of it the answer to this question could not come all at once but some of the elements of it were there it was one of the elements of it that mr brand was very red that he held his head very high that he had a bright excited eye and an air of embarrassed boldnessthe air of a man who has taken a resolve in the execution of which he apprehends the failure not of his moral but of his personal resources charlotte thought he looked very grand and it is incontestable that mr brand felt very grand this in fact was the grandest moment of his life and it was natural that such a moment should contain opportunities of awkwardness for a large stout modest young man  come in sir said mr wentworth with an angular wave of his hand it is very proper that you should be present  i know what you are talking about mr brand rejoined i heard what your nephew said  and he heard what you said exclaimed felix patting him again on the arm  i am not sure that i understood said mr wentworth who had angularity in his voice as well as in his gestures  gertrude had been looking hard at her former suitor she had been puzzled like her sister but her imagination moved more quickly than charlottes mr brand asked you to let felix take me away she said to her father  the young minister gave her a strange look it is not because i dont want to see you any more he declared in a tone intended as it were for publicity  i should nt think you would want to see me any more gertrude answered gently  mr wentworth stood staring is nt this rather a change sir he inquired  yes sir and mr brand looked anywhere only still not at charlotte yes sir he repeated and he held his handkerchief a few moments to his lips  where are our moral grounds demanded mr wentworth who had always thought mr brand would be just the thing for a younger daughter with a peculiar temperament  it is sometimes very moral to change you know suggested felix  charlotte had softly left her sisters side she had edged gently toward her father and now her hand found its way into his arm mr wentworth had folded up the advertiser into a surprisingly small compass and holding the roll with one hand he earnestly clasped it with the other mr brand was looking at him and yet though charlotte was so near his eyes failed to meet her own gertrude watched her sister  it is better not to speak of change said mr brand in one sense there is no change there was something i desiredsomething i asked of you i desire something stilli ask it of you and he paused a moment mr wentworth looked bewildered i should like in my ministerial capacity to unite this young couple  gertrude watching her sister saw charlotte flushing intensely and mr wentworth felt her pressing upon his arm heavenly powers murmured mr wentworth and it was the nearest approach to profanity he had ever made  that is very nice that is very handsome felix exclaimed  i dont understand said mr wentworth though it was plain that every one else did  that is very beautiful mr brand said gertrude emulating felix  i should like to marry you it will give me great pleasure  as gertrude says it s a beautiful idea said felix  felix was smiling but mr brand was not even trying to he himself treated his proposition very seriously i have thought of it and i should like to do it he affirmed  charlotte meanwhile was staring with expanded eyes her imagination as i have said was not so rapid as her sisters but now it had taken several little jumps father she murmured consent  mr brand heard her he looked away mr wentworth evidently had no imagination at all i have always thought he began slowly that gertrudes character required a special line of development  father repeated charlotte consent  then at last mr brand looked at her her father felt her leaning more heavily upon his folded arm than she had ever done before and this with a certain sweet faintness in her voice made him wonder what was the matter he looked down at her and saw the encounter of her gaze with the young theologians but even this told him nothing and he continued to be bewildered nevertheless i consent he said at last since mr brand recommends it  i should like to perform the ceremony very soon observed mr brand with a sort of solemn simplicity  come come that s charming cried felix profanely  mr wentworth sank into his chair doubtless when you understand it he said with a certain judicial asperity  gertrude went to her sister and led her away and felix having passed his arm into mr brands and stepped out of the long window with him the old man was left sitting there in unillumined perplexity  felix did no work that day in the afternoon with gertrude he got into one of the boats and floated about with idlydipping oars they talked a good deal of mr brandthough not exclusively  that was a fine stroke said felix it was really heroic  gertrude sat musing with her eyes upon the ripples that was what he wanted to be he wanted to do something fine  he wont be comfortable till he has married us said felix so much the better  he wanted to be magnanimous he wanted to have a fine moral pleasure i know him so well gertrude went on felix looked at her she spoke slowly gazing at the clear water he thought of it a great deal night and day he thought it would be beautiful at last he made up his mind that it was his duty his duty to do just thatnothing less than that he felt exalted he felt sublime that s how he likes to feel it is better for him than if i had listened to him  it s better for me smiled felix but do you know as regards the sacrifice that i dont believe he admired you when this decision was taken quite so much as he had done a fortnight before  he never admired me he admires charlotte he pitied me i know him so well  well then he did nt pity you so much  gertrude looked at felix a little smiling you should nt permit yourself she said to diminish the splendor of his action he admires charlotte she repeated  thats capital said felix laughingly and dipping his oars i cannot say exactly to which member of gertrudes phrase he alluded but he dipped his oars again and they kept floating about  neither felix nor his sister on that day was present at mr wentworths at the evening repast the two occupants of the chalet dined together and the young man informed his companion that his marriage was now an assured fact eugenia congratulated him and replied that if he were as reasonable a husband as he had been on the whole a brother his wife would have nothing to complain of  felix looked at her a moment smiling i hope he said not to be thrown back on my reason  it is very true eugenia rejoined that ones reason is dismally flat it s a bed with the mattress removed  but the brother and sister later in the evening crossed over to the larger house the baroness desiring to compliment her prospective sisterinlaw they found the usual circle upon the piazza with the exception of clifford wentworth and lizzie acton and as every one stood up as usual to welcome the baroness eugenia had an admiring audience for her compliment to gertrude  robert acton stood on the edge of the piazza leaning against one of the white columns so that he found himself next to eugenia while she acquitted herself of a neat little discourse of congratulation  i shall be so glad to know you better she said i have seen so much less of you than i should have liked naturally now i see the reason why you will love me a little wont you i think i may say i gain on being known and terminating these observations with the softest cadence of her voice the baroness imprinted a sort of grand official kiss upon gertrudes forehead  increased familiarity had not to gertrudes imagination diminished the mysterious impressiveness of eugenias personality and she felt flattered and transported by this little ceremony robert acton also seemed to admire it as he admired so many of the gracious manifestations of madame munsters wit  they had the privilege of making him restless and on this occasion he walked away suddenly with his hands in his pockets and then came back and leaned against his column eugenia was now complimenting her uncle upon his daughters engagement and mr wentworth was listening with his usual plain yet refined politeness it is to be supposed that by this time his perception of the mutual relations of the young people who surrounded him had become more acute but he still took the matter very seriously and he was not at all exhilarated  felix will make her a good husband said eugenia he will be a charming companion he has a great qualityindestructible gayety  you think that s a great quality asked the old man  eugenia meditated with her eyes upon his you think one gets tired of it eh  i dont know that i am prepared to say that said mr wentworth  well we will say then that it is tiresome for others but delightful for ones self a womans husband you know is supposed to be her second self so that for felix and gertrude gayety will be a common property  gertrude was always very gay said mr wentworth he was trying to follow this argument  robert acton took his hands out of his pockets and came a little nearer to the baroness you say you gain by being known he said one certainly gains by knowing you  what have you gained asked eugenia  an immense amount of wisdom  that s a questionable advantage for a man who was already so wise  acton shook his head no i was a great fool before i knew you  and being a fool you made my acquaintance you are very complimentary  let me keep it up said acton laughing i hope for our pleasure that your brothers marriage will detain you  why should i stop for my brothers marriage when i would not stop for my own asked the baroness  why should nt you stop in either case now that as you say you have dissolved that mechanical tie that bound you to europe  the baroness looked at him a moment as i say you look as if you doubted it  ah said acton returning her glance that is a remnant of my old folly we have other attractions he added we are to have another marriage  but she seemed not to hear him she was looking at him still my word was never doubted before she said  we are to have another marriage acton repeated smiling  then she appeared to understand another marriage and she looked at the others felix was chattering to gertrude charlotte at a distance was watching them and mr brand in quite another quarter was turning his back to them and with his hands under his coattails and his large head on one side was looking at the small tender crescent of a young moon it ought to be mr brand and charlotte said eugenia but it does nt look like it  there acton answered you must judge just now by contraries there is more than there looks to be i expect that combination one of these days but that is not what i meant  well said the baroness i never guess my own lovers so i cant guess other peoples  acton gave a loud laugh and he was about to add a rejoinder when mr wentworth approached his niece you will be interested to hear the old man said with a momentary aspiration toward jocosity of another matrimonial venture in our little circle  i was just telling the baroness acton observed  mr acton was apparently about to announce his own engagement said eugenia  mr wentworths jocosity increased it is not exactly that but it is in the family clifford hearing this morning that mr brand had expressed a desire to tie the nuptial knot for his sister took it into his head to arrange that while his hand was in our good friend should perform a like ceremony for himself and lizzie acton  the baroness threw back her head and smiled at her uncle then turning with an intenser radiance to robert acton i am certainly very stupid not to have thought of that she said acton looked down at his boots as if he thought he had perhaps reached the limits of legitimate experimentation and for a moment eugenia said nothing more it had been in fact a sharp knock and she needed to recover herself this was done however promptly enough where are the young people she asked  they are spending the evening with my mother  is not the thing very sudden  acton looked up extremely sudden there had been a tacit understanding but within a day or two clifford appears to have received some mysterious impulse to precipitate the affair  the impulse said the baroness was the charms of your very pretty sister  but my sisters charms were an old story he had always known her acton had begun to experiment again  here however it was evident the baroness would not help him ah one cant say clifford is very young but he is a nice boy  he s a likeable sort of boy and he will be a rich man this was actons last experiment madame munster turned away  she made but a short visit and felix took her home in her little drawingroom she went almost straight to the mirror over the chimneypiece and with a candle uplifted stood looking into it i shall not wait for your marriage she said to her brother tomorrow my maid shall pack up  my dear sister felix exclaimed we are to be married immediately mr brand is too uncomfortable  but eugenia turning and still holding her candle aloft only looked about the little sittingroom at her gimcracks and curtains and cushions my maid shall pack up she repeated bonte divine what rubbish i feel like a strolling actress these are my properties  is the play over eugenia asked felix  she gave him a sharp glance i have spoken my part  with great applause said her brother  oh applauseapplause she murmured and she gathered up two or three of her dispersed draperies she glanced at the beautiful brocade and then i dont see how i can have endured it she said  endure it a little longer come to my wedding  thank you that s your affair my affairs are elsewhere  where are you going  to germanyby the first ship  you have decided not to marry mr acton  i have refused him said eugenia  her brother looked at her in silence i am sorry he rejoined at last but i was very discreet as you asked me to be i said nothing  please continue then not to allude to the matter said eugenia  felix inclined himself gravely you shall be obeyed but your position in germany he pursued  please to make no observations upon it  i was only going to say that i supposed it was altered  you are mistaken  but i thought you had signed  i have not signed said the baroness  felix urged her no further and it was arranged that he should immediately assist her to embark  mr brand was indeed it appeared very impatient to consummate his sacrifice and deliver the nuptial benediction which would set it off so handsomely but eugenias impatience to withdraw from a country in which she had not found the fortune she had come to seek was even less to be mistaken it is true she had not made any very various exertion but she appeared to feel justified in generalizingin deciding that the conditions of action on this provincial continent were not favorable to really superior women the elder world was after all their natural field the unembarrassed directness with which she proceeded to apply these intelligent conclusions appeared to the little circle of spectators who have figured in our narrative but the supreme exhibition of a character to which the experience of life had imparted an inimitable pliancy it had a distinct effect upon robert acton who for the two days preceding her departure was a very restless and irritated mortal she passed her last evening at her uncles where she had never been more charming and in parting with clifford wentworths affianced bride she drew from her own finger a curious old ring and presented it to her with the prettiest speech and kiss gertrude who as an affianced bride was also indebted to her gracious bounty admired this little incident extremely and robert acton almost wondered whether it did not give him the right as lizzies brother and guardian to offer in return a handsome present to the baroness it would have made him extremely happy to be able to offer a handsome present to the baroness but he abstained from this expression of his sentiments and they were in consequence at the very last by so much the less comfortable it was almost at the very last that he saw herlate the night before she went to boston to embark  for myself i wish you might have stayed he said but not for your own sake  i dont make so many differences said the baroness i am simply sorry to be going  that s a much deeper difference than mine acton declared for you mean you are simply glad  felix parted with her on the deck of the ship we shall often meet over there he said  i dont know she answered europe seems to me much larger than america  mr brand of course in the days that immediately followed was not the only impatient spirit but it may be said that of all the young spirits interested in the event none rose more eagerly to the level of the occasion gertrude left her fathers house with felix young they were imperturbably happy and they went far away clifford and his young wife sought their felicity in a narrower circle and the latters influence upon her husband was such as to justify strikingly that theory of the elevating effect of easy intercourse with clever women which felix had propounded to mr wentworth gertrude was for a good while a distant figure but she came back when charlotte married mr brand she was present at the wedding feast where felixs gayety confessed to no change then she disappeared and the echo of a gayety of her own mingled with that of her husband often came back to the home of her earlier years mr wentworth at last found himself listening for it and robert acton after his mothers death married a particularly nice young girl  the end
